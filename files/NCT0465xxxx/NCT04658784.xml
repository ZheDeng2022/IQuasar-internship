    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to compare barbed suture versus non-barbed&#xD;
      suture at the time of posterior repair on postoperative pain scores as measured by a visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS) at 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants are randomized to use of barbed suture (2-0 V-Loc 90TM, Medtronic) or&#xD;
      non-barbed suture (2-0 Polydioxanone, PDS® EthiconTM) in a standardized technique for&#xD;
      posterior colporrhaphy at the time of posterior repair.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a growing concern for the aging female population, and&#xD;
      symptomatic women often require surgical intervention. Approximately 200,000 surgical&#xD;
      procedures for POP are performed annually in the United States. This number is anticipated to&#xD;
      increase with the growth in the aging population.1 Surgical prolapse repairs are often&#xD;
      categorized into either mesh augmented or native tissue repairs. During a native tissue&#xD;
      repair, the surgeon uses a woman's natural tissue to repair the prolapse without augmenting&#xD;
      the repair with synthetic mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women often have post-operative pain with native tissue posterior colporrhaphy. Native tissue&#xD;
      posterior repairs are performed to address symptomatic posterior compartment prolapse,&#xD;
      defects in the rectovaginal fibromuscularis, and/or a widened genital hiatus. This type of&#xD;
      repair may improve obstructed defecatory dysfunction and bulge symptoms, but can be&#xD;
      associated with postoperative pelvic pain and dyspareunia. Paraiso et al evaluated three&#xD;
      surgical techniques for posterior colporrhaphy (site-specific, midline plication, and porcine&#xD;
      graft) and found no difference in overall symptom improvement, quality of life, and&#xD;
      post-operative sexual function. Regardless of the technique used, a posterior colporrhaphy&#xD;
      can cause considerable postoperative pain and can contribute to de novo dyspareunia in 9-20%&#xD;
      of women. Most studies evaluating pain after posterior colporrhaphy tend to focus on various&#xD;
      methods of analgesia and surgical technique rather than the suture materials used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suture choice may contribute to postoperative pain at the time of posterior colporrhaphy.&#xD;
      There are few studies evaluating suture in the posterior compartment with no defined standard&#xD;
      suture material for posterior colporrhaphy. Available studies, when comparing subjective&#xD;
      bulge and quality of life outcomes, do not demonstrate superiority of one suture type over&#xD;
      the other. Delayed absorbable suture has the benefit of retaining tensile strength for&#xD;
      approximately 3 months. Delayed absorbable suture material itself, however, can remain in&#xD;
      place for up to 8 months. These properties may decrease postoperative pain by decreasing knot&#xD;
      burden. Barbed suture has been successfully applied to vaginal cuff closure, myomectomy,&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy mesh attachment, and closure of bowel and bladder injuries with demonstrated&#xD;
      reduced operative times. To date, no studies have evaluated the impact of barbed suture on&#xD;
      postoperative pain or surgical time after posterior colporrhaphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for this study is to compare delayed absorbable barbed suture versus&#xD;
      non-barbed delayed absorbable suture at the time of posterior repair on post-operative&#xD;
      posterior compartment pain scores, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), at 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include a comparison of VAS pain scores in the posterior compartment at&#xD;
      6-months, evaluation of operative time for posterior repair in minutes, evaluation of suture&#xD;
      burden and pelvic pain on examination of the posterior compartment, evaluation of pain versus&#xD;
      the length of a repair, evaluation of postoperative patient quality of life (QoL) using&#xD;
      series of standardized questionnaires, evaluation of suture cost, and a comparison of&#xD;
      anatomical and surgical failure in the posterior compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be approached for participation preoperatively. Baseline demographic data&#xD;
      will be abstracted from the medical record. A baseline Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification&#xD;
      (POP-Q) and pelvic myofascial exam will be performed. Baseline VAS and validated&#xD;
      questionnaires: Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 (PFDI-20) sub-scales Colorectal-Anal&#xD;
      Distress Inventory-8 (CRADI-8) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory-6 (POPDI-6) and&#xD;
      Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire- 12 (PISQ-12 )will be&#xD;
      completed. Participants will be randomized in the operating room after posterior vaginal&#xD;
      dissection to either barbed or non-barbed suture in a standardized technique. All concurrent&#xD;
      minimally invasive pelvic reconstructive surgical procedures are allowed. Randomization will&#xD;
      be stratified for minimally invasive (robotic or laparoscopic) versus vaginal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative care is standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be scheduled for a post-operative follow up visit at approximately 6 weeks.&#xD;
      At this visit they will have a structured postoperative interview and pelvic examination,&#xD;
      including POP-Q, standardized assessment of suture burden and myofascial trigger points. They&#xD;
      will also complete a VAS and validated questionnaires. Participants will be called at&#xD;
      approximately 6 months after their original surgery. They will have a structured interview&#xD;
      and complete VAS and complete validated questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse postoperative outcomes will be collected at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use a standard deviation estimate of 23.4mm to detect a difference on a&#xD;
      100mm VAS for pain. Accounting for a 15% drop-out rate, the investigators aim to enroll 64&#xD;
      participants with 32 in each group.&#xD;
