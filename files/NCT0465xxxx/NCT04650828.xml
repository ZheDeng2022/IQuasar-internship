  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that the HBeAg seroconversion rate of HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B&#xD;
      with tenofovir for one year's treatment was 17.8% and the negative conversion rate of their&#xD;
      HBeAg and HBV DNA were 20.0% and 97.6%. The HBeAg Seroconversion rate of these patients was&#xD;
      lower.Clinically, most patients need to take tenofovir for a long time, which may cause&#xD;
      serious complications such as renal function damage,with decreased therapy compliance and&#xD;
      Increased cost of treatment.In the course of tenofovir treatment, it is common that HBV-DNA&#xD;
      negative patients with HBeAg Being down poor or staying at a low positive level for a long&#xD;
      time keep taking the medicine. Therefore, it is Significant to Increase the HBeAg&#xD;
      seroconversion rate of tenofovir during the clinical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telbivudine has a strong antiviral effect.Studies have shown that the HBeAg seroconversion&#xD;
      rate of HBeAg positive CHB for one year was 25%, which was higher than other nucleosides, and&#xD;
      it could also improve the damaged renal function to a certain extent.The HBeAg seroconversion&#xD;
      rate of patients with poor response to tenofovir for 12 months could be still poor if for 24&#xD;
      months . Therefore, this study is to observe the efficacy of these patients combined with&#xD;
      telbivudine.&#xD;

      This is an open, multicenter, exploratory and real-world clinical study. It will be carried&#xD;
      out in patients with poor response (HBV DNA &gt; 2x103iu / ml) to tenofovir for 12 months. After&#xD;
      one -week screening period, patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to control and&#xD;
      experimental groups. The control group takes tenofovir for 12 months while the experimental&#xD;
      group takes tenofovir combined with telbivudinefor 12months .&#xD;
