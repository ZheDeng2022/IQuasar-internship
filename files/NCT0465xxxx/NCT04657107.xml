  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the past years, a large number of clinical trials have investigated the use of the&#xD;
      non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist racemic ketamine as an&#xD;
      adjunct to local anaesthetics, opioids, or other analgesic agents for the management and&#xD;
      prevention of postoperative pain. Actually racemic ketamine not only abolishes peripheral&#xD;
      afferent noxious stimulation, but can also prevent the central nociceptor sensitization.&#xD;
      S-ketamine, one of two enantiomers of racemic ketamine, has twice the analgesic potency of&#xD;
      the racemate. Moreover, S-ketamine shows smaller nervous system and less psychotropic effects&#xD;
      than racemic ketamine , which may make the drug more suitable for clinical use. Recently,&#xD;
      S-ketamine has been approved to treat refractory depression (TRD) and major depressive&#xD;
      disorder (MDD) by the FDA .S-ketamine may have greater clinical significance due to the high&#xD;
      rate of maternal depression. Therefore, we plan to explore whether clinical use of S-ketamine&#xD;
      can optimize anesthesia protocol and improve maternal prognosis.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraoperative anesthesia effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Anesthesia effect is graded I-IV. Level I means that it is very satisfactory, while Level IV means other anesthesia methods are needed to complete the operation. We expect to reach level I.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ramsay Sedation Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) was the first scale to be defined for sedated patients and was designed as a test of rousability. The RSS scores sedation at six different levels, according to how rousable the patient is.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clock-in-the-Box(CIB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 &amp; Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Clock-in-the-Box (CIB) is a rapidly administered cognitive screening measure which has been previously validated with cognitive screening and neuropsychological assessments. The CIB is scored on a 0-8 point scale and the total score includes two separate subscale scores. The higher scores reflect better performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PHQ-9</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 &amp; Day 3 &amp; Day 8 &amp; Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 is the major depressive disorder(MDD) module of the full PHQ. Used to provisionally diagnose depression and grade severity of symptoms in general medical and mental health settings. Scores each of the 9 DSM criteria of MDD as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day), providing a 0-27 severity score. Higher PHQ-9 scores are associated with decreased functional status and increased symptom-related difficulties, sick days, and healthcare utilization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale(EPDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3 &amp; Day 8 &amp; Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>EPDS is a valuable and efficient way of identifying patients at risk for &quot;perinatal&quot; depression. Mothers who score above 13 are likely to be suffering from a depressive illness of varying severity depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apgar score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The Apgar score is a test given to newborns soon after birth. This test checks a baby's heart rate, muscle tone, and other signs to see if extra medical care or emergency care is needed. The test is usually given twice: once at 1 minute after birth, and again at 5 minutes after birth.</description>

    <measure>blood gas</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>

    <description>Parturients were subsequently placed in a supine position with a left lateral tilt (15 ̊). Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia method (CSE) was performed at the L2-L3 or L3-L4 lumbar vertebral interspace, with 10～13mg 0.5% ropivacaine by a needle-through-needle technique. When adequate anesthesia to the T6 dermatome was achieved (Sensory and motor assessments were performed at 1 min intervals using pinprick testing and the modified Bromage score). Parturients received 10ml intravenous normal saline before surgery, If the anesthesia is inadequate, another 5ml 0.5% ropivacaine was given. Morphine hydrochloride 1 mg in saline 10 mL was injected by several times into the epidural space at the end of the operation. After the surgery, their PCA protocol consisted of 150 ug sufentanil and 24ml atropisetron diluted into 150 ml (2ml of basal infusion, a bolus of 0.5ml on demand, &quot;lock-out&quot; interval of 10 min, last for 48 h postoperatively);</description>
