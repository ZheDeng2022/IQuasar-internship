  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate pre-operative, post-operative and post-radiation&#xD;
      upper esophageal sphincter opening measures in oral cancer patients, compare measures to age-&#xD;
      and gender-matched healthy adults, and determine relationships with patient swallowing&#xD;
      outcomes and quality of life.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Upper Esophageal Maximum Admittance as measured by HRM among time points of oral cancer treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-surgery), approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)</time_frame>
    <description>This measure provides understanding of how well throat muscles pull the upper esophagus open to allow flow of liquid or food from the throat to the esophagus.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Upper Esophageal Integrated Relaxation Pressure (IRP) as measured by HRM</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-surgery), approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)</time_frame>
    <description>This measure indicates how well the muscles of the upper esophageal sphincter relax to allow liquid and food to pass through.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hypopharyngeal Pressure at Nadir Impedence (PNI) as measured by HRM</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-surgery), approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)</time_frame>
    <description>This measure indicates how well the upper esophagus stretches open to accept the liquid or food.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) Scores among time points of oral cancer treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-surgery), approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of swallowing-related quality of life. This patient-rated tool has a maximum score of 100 points total across 20 questions, where the highest score indicates better overall swallow-related quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) Grading Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-surgery), approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) grade of 0 to 4, where lower grade reflects better swallow function</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Statistical Correlation between MDADI and Maximum Admittance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-surgery), approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)</time_frame>

    <intervention_type>Diagnostic Test</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Videofluoroscopic imaging (VFSS) with high-resolution manometry (HRM)</intervention_name>
    <description>The Videofluoroscopic Imaging (VFSS) is done by inserting a small catheter into the nose and down the throat. The catheter is approximately .4 millimeters in diameter. A trained speech-language pathologist will insert the catheter after applying numbing medicine, or topical anesthetic, inside the nose.&#xD;
The high-resolution manometry (HRM) is a swallowing pressure test done at the same time as the VFSS. The HRM will measure how strong the throat muscle squeeze the liquids and foods that a person swallows.&#xD;
The VFSS and HRM will occur before surgery, about one month after surgery and three months after the completion of the radiation treatment.</description>
