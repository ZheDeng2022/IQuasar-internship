  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current healthcare response to frailty has been mainly reactive to acute health crises of&#xD;
      the elderly. With its insidious onset and progression, frailty is often not apparent unless&#xD;
      actively sought. Well-validated models of frailty already exist and, instead of trying to&#xD;
      create new frailty criteria or insisting on a universal approach to measuring frailty, it is&#xD;
      needed to move on to higher levels of care systems supporting their practical implementation,&#xD;
      mapping the chosen frailty instrument to its specific role. This pragmatic study will equip&#xD;
      older persons with awareness of their frailty status through community-based screening,&#xD;
      allowing for timely stage-specific care to avoid deleterious outcomes. While older persons&#xD;
      meeting frailty criteria will be referred for comprehensive geriatric assessment, pre-frail&#xD;
      older persons will be targeted for multi-factorial exercise and nutritional intervention in&#xD;
      the community to reverse the frailty trajectory. An over-arching aim will be to create a&#xD;
      sustainable triaging system and early intervention programme that can be administered by&#xD;
      trained members of the community. This will allow older persons to receive regular&#xD;
      re-assessments in the community such that any transitions to a higher state of frailty may be&#xD;
      captured and promptly addressed.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-controlled prospective cohort study, recruiting community-dwelling older&#xD;
      persons aged &gt;55 years, from various senior activity centres, day care and community centres&#xD;
      in the North-East region of Singapore. A mobile community-based platform for frailty and&#xD;
      physical fitness assessment will be anchored at the void decks of public housing blocks,&#xD;
      senior activity centres (SACs), senior care centres (SCCs) or community clubs for&#xD;
      accessibility. The platform will be maintained at each site for 2-3 consecutive weeks, and is&#xD;
      managed by members of the multidisciplinary team, with the same site being re-visited at&#xD;
      yearly intervals to allow follow-up. Each participant undergoes a multi-domain geriatric&#xD;
      screen and physical fitness assessment, and will be triaged by physical frailty status for&#xD;
      stage-specific care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and ethics approval has been&#xD;
      obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Singhealth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Multi-domain geriatric screen The multi-domain geriatric screen includes assessment&#xD;
      of (i) socio-demographic characteristics (including social support network, socio-economic&#xD;
      status, education and employment); (ii) mood as assessed using the 15-item Geriatric&#xD;
      Depression Scale; (iii) cognitive performance using the locally validated modified Chinese&#xD;
      version of Mini Mental State Examination (CMMSE); (iv) nutrition using the Mini Nutrition&#xD;
      Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) and Subjective Global Assessment (SGA); (iv) physical activity&#xD;
      level based on a structured questionnaire to assess the time spent on physical activities&#xD;
      over the last 7 days; (v) functional performance using Barthel's Index for activities of&#xD;
      daily living (ADLs) and Lawton and Brody's instrumental ADLs, as well as Life Space&#xD;
      Questionnaire (LSQ) for functional mobility; (vi) quality of life on EuroQol 5 dimensions&#xD;
      (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire and a visual analogue scale; (vii) sarcopenia using SARC-F&#xD;
      questionnaire enquiring ability to carry a heavy load, walking, rising from a chair, climbing&#xD;
      stairs and falls, has been validated as a suitable tool for community screening for&#xD;
      sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty Assessment Frailty screening will be based on the 5-item FRAIL scale, which assesses&#xD;
      for self-reported fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses and loss of weight, to&#xD;
      categorize participants as frail (score 3-5), pre-frail (1-2) or robust (0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical frailty will be objectively assessed using modified Fried's criteria, with frailty&#xD;
      defined by the presence of at least 3 and pre-frailty as 1-2 of 5 components - exhaustion,&#xD;
      slow gait speed, weak grip strength, low body mass index (BMI&lt;18.5kg/m2) and low physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grip strength will be measured using a JAMAR hand dynamometer, with 2 trials for each hand,&#xD;
      and the maximum value will be used for analysis. Gait speed will be based on time taken to&#xD;
      walk 10m at usual pace. Weakness (&lt;18kg for women and &lt;26 kg for men) and slowness (&lt;0.8m/s)&#xD;
      will be defined using reference values from the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Fitness Tests The physical fitness test battery was modified from the Senior Fitness&#xD;
      Test. Participants who report feeling unwell on pre-assessment screening will be exempt from&#xD;
      fitness tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower body strength and power will be measured using the chair stand test, in which the&#xD;
      participant will be instructed to rise as fast as possible from seated to a full standing&#xD;
      position, while keeping the arms folded across the chest. Time taken to complete 5 chair&#xD;
      stands as well as the number of full chair stands performed in 30 seconds will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to grip strength, upper limb dexterity will be assessed using the box-and-block&#xD;
      test, in which participants pick up blocks and place them in the box on the other side across&#xD;
      a barrier as quickly as possible. The number of blocks transferred in 1 minute will be&#xD;
      recorded. 2 trials will be performed, one for each arm, and the better performance will be&#xD;
      used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-task gait performance will be assessed by asking the participant to walk 10-metres while&#xD;
      performing serial 2-step forward calculation and animal naming without specific instruction&#xD;
      on task prioritization. Gait speed and number of correct calculations on the dual-task&#xD;
      protocol will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper and lower body flexibility will be assessed using the back-scratch and chair&#xD;
      sit-and-reach tests respectively, with 2 trials for each test, and the better performance&#xD;
      will be used for analysis. The back-scratch test is performed with the participant placing&#xD;
      one hand behind the shoulder and the other hand up the middle of the back, fingers extended.&#xD;
      The distance (cm) the middle fingers are short of touching (-) or overlapping (+) will be&#xD;
      recorded. In the chair sit-and-reach test, participant sits on the edge of a chair with one&#xD;
      leg extended in front while reaching forward with the hands toward the toes. The distance&#xD;
      (cm) from the extended third finger to tip of toe (+ for beyond, and - for behind the toe)&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic balance (agility) will be assessed on the Timed Up-and-Go Test, which requires the&#xD;
      participant to stand from a seated position, walk as quickly as possible around a cone 3m&#xD;
      ahead of the chair, and return to a fully seated position. The balance subtests of the Short&#xD;
      Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was also adopted, including side-by-side, semi-tandem and&#xD;
      tandem standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory endurance will be evaluated using the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), along a&#xD;
      walkway of at least 20m and with constant encouragement throughout the test. The total&#xD;
      distance walked in 6 minutes will be recorded, and rest is permitted anytime during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be scored on the SPPB for a composite measure of physical performance,&#xD;
      applying established cut-offs on the individual tests of gait speed, balance and chair stand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Composition Participants will under Bioimpedance Analysis (BIA) (MC-780M, TANITA, Tokyo,&#xD;
      Japan) for measurement of muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention for pre-frail older adults Pre-frail will be operationalized as the presence of&#xD;
      1-2 positive responses on FRAIL, or FRAIL score of 0 but with objective weak grip strength&#xD;
      and/or slow gait speed. The latter takes into consideration the potential for under-reporting&#xD;
      of symptoms on the FRAIL questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants meeting operational criteria for pre-frailty will be enrolled in a group-based&#xD;
      physical exercise and nutritional intervention programme, delivered over 4 months. The&#xD;
      intervention will commence 3 months from the baseline screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group-based, as opposed to traditional individual physiotherapy sessions, has been shown to&#xD;
      boost older persons' motivation for participation and potentially addresses the social&#xD;
      contribution to frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo weekly 1-hr exercise sessions designed to challenge all major&#xD;
      muscle groups with specific emphasis on strength training, in addition to gait, balance and&#xD;
      endurance exercises, to target the major frailty elements of weakness and gait deficit, with&#xD;
      demonstrated effectiveness for falls prevention in older adults. Upper limb strengthening&#xD;
      exercises will be conducted through the use of therabands or free weights (e.g. bottled&#xD;
      water) for resistance. The exercises will be made progressively more difficult over time&#xD;
      (e.g. increasing the number of repetitions) according to group's progress, yet also catering&#xD;
      for individual variability, under supervision of the physiotherapist. Endurance exercise will&#xD;
      consist of outdoor walking. Targeting to each older adult's individual intensity level with&#xD;
      progression as they improve ensures that the exercises remain physically challenging to&#xD;
      provide sufficient stimulus. An individually prescribed structured home exercise programme&#xD;
      with pictorials and explanations at the end of each session will be provided so that&#xD;
      participants can continue with the exercises between sessions to achieve an optimal frequency&#xD;
      of exercising at least three times a week, with a checklist to record adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional intervention (6 group-based session) will be delivered with the aim of&#xD;
      facilitating healthy eating habits to achieve adequate protein, energy, Vitamin D and fluid&#xD;
      intake through regular foods and beverages without the need for nutritional supplements.&#xD;
      Educating older adults to evaluate and adapt their nutritional intake, taking into&#xD;
      consideration their dietary habits, can be expected to improve sustainability of effect and&#xD;
      adherence. A group grocery-shopping trip will be conducted to provide guidance on choosing&#xD;
      quality food within budget.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be followed up at 6-, 12- and 24-month. Participants enrolled in the&#xD;
      intervention programme will have their physical performance measures at 3-month (immediate&#xD;
      pre-intervention). Subsequent follow-up visits will be at the end of the 4-month&#xD;
      intervention, 6- and 12-month post-intervention.&#xD;
