  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use lay language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines regarding physical activity in patients with inherited arrhythmia and&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy are mostly dedicated to adult patients, with a special focus on sports&#xD;
      competition. Their application to the pediatric population has been scarcely evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity is well known for its health benefits but may be dangerous in this&#xD;
      population, which leads to confusion within the medical community and among patients. Actual&#xD;
      physical activity of children with such inherited cardiac disorders is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to assess the level of physical activity in children with inherited&#xD;
      arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy, and the adherence to the current European guidelines on the&#xD;
      subject. Secondary objectives aimed to assess through a qualitative analysis the impact of&#xD;
      the disease on physical activity and daily life in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of physical activity and adherence to current guidelines will be determined from&#xD;
      interviews between the patient and the principal investigator. Each patient will be&#xD;
      questioned in order to explore the experiences, motivations and feelings of participants&#xD;
      regarding physical activity. The standardized questionnaire was created by the principal&#xD;
      investigator and members of the clinical research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that many children practice physical activity outside the current&#xD;
      guidelines and hope to identify the main determinants of physical activity in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

        This study will take place in two paediatric tertiaty hospitals : the paediatric and&#xD;
        congenital cardiology department of Montpellier university hospital and the paediatric&#xD;
        cardiology and rehabilitation unit of St-Pierre institute in Palavas-Les-Flots, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children aged from 6 to 18 years old with genetic and/or clinical diagnosis of inherited&#xD;
        cardiomyopathies (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy and arrythmogenic&#xD;
        right ventricular cardiomyopathy) or inherited primary arrhythmia syndrome (long QT&#xD;
        syndrome, brugada syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) are&#xD;
        eligible to participate in this study. Each subject accepting to participate during the&#xD;
        annual follow up consultation will be enrolled&#xD;
