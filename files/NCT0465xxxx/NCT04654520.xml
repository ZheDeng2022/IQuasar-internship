  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized study is to investigate local tumor control, survival outcomes,and&#xD;
      complications on patients of stage Ⅳ non small-cell lung cancer ,whom based on medication&#xD;
      with concurrent primary radiotherapy omitting clinical tumor volume.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer Statistics,（2020）states that low lung cancer survival rates reflect the large&#xD;
      proportion of patients (57%) diagnosed with metastatic disease, for which the 5-year relative&#xD;
      survival rate is 5%.With the development of three-dimensional radiotherapy technology, the&#xD;
      wide application of comprehensive treatment concept, and the understanding of the&#xD;
      relationship between different metastatic state and survival of stage IV NSCLC, prospective&#xD;
      and retrospective studies have confirmed that systemic therapy combined with primary tumor&#xD;
      three-dimensional radiation Treatment is more conducive to improving symptoms and prolonging&#xD;
      survival than medication alone. Some retrospective analysises of stage III NSCLC, omitting&#xD;
      clinical target volume of primary tumor with intensity modulated radiotherapy showed no&#xD;
      reduction in local control rate and survival time.Omitted CTV in Ⅳ NSCLC patients with&#xD;
      primary tumor radiotherapy can make smaller target area, which could push up most of the&#xD;
      local stage of late Ⅳ NSCLC patients with primary tumor radiation dose. Prospective studies&#xD;
      are needed to further clarify whether omission of target areas may affect local control time,&#xD;
      survival time, and radioactive toxicity.&#xD;
