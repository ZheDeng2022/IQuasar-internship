      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most frequently occurring serious bacterial infection in&#xD;
      young children and accounts 5 to 14% of emergency department visits Formation of renal&#xD;
      scarring in children has been associated with serious complications as hypertension,&#xD;
      preeclampsia, and end stage renal failure in young age . So, this study aims to determine&#xD;
      whether dexamethasone reduces the renal scarring in children will be treated with antibiotics&#xD;
      for acute pyelonephritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct a multi center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind&#xD;
      clinical trial, that will evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg every 12 hours&#xD;
      per day orally for 3 days) in preventing renal scarring in young febrile children (2 months&#xD;
      to 14 years) with a first-diagnosed UTI. 120 Participants will be enrolled over a 3-year&#xD;
      period from 6 sites.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most frequently occurring serious bacterial infection in&#xD;
      young children and accounts for 5 to 14% of emergency department visits. UTIs can be divided&#xD;
      into asymptomatic bacteriuria, cystitis, and acute pyelonephritis (APN ). The APN is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of renal damage, acquired through renal scarring. Which is&#xD;
      a consequence of the inflammatory and immune response that aim to eradicate the bacteria&#xD;
      involved in the UTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenchymal infection can be solved, but there are a number of poorly understood factors that&#xD;
      may perpetuate inflammation, and this would promote the formation of scarring. One of the&#xD;
      most relevant factors involved in formation of renal scarring is the production of&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators (complement proteins, bactericidal peptides, cytokines , chemokines,&#xD;
      ). hence, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs may prevent the release of these mediators and&#xD;
      the formation of permanent renal scarring. Renal scarring in childhood has been associated&#xD;
      with serious complications as hypertension, preeclampsia, and ESRD in young age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment of children with UTI has focused on the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux&#xD;
      (VUR) and on the early treatment of UTI with antibiotics. Although the presence of VUR&#xD;
      increases the likelihood of bacteria gaining access to the kidney, correction of VUR is not&#xD;
      sufficient to prevent scarring. Renal scarring frequently occurs in children who do not have&#xD;
      VUR, and early diagnosis and treatment of children with VUR is not associated with a&#xD;
      reduction in the incidence of end-stage renal disease. Similarly, early antibiotic therapy is&#xD;
      necessary, but it is not sufficient to prevent renal scarring in most children with UTI.&#xD;
      Because signs of UTI in children are relatively non-specific, the diagnosis is often delayed.&#xD;
      data from many studies have shown that once the infection has localized to the renal&#xD;
      parenchyma, treatment with antibiotics alone does not prevent scarring. hence ,It is clear&#xD;
      that the current management is not always effective in preventing renal scarring. The&#xD;
      proposed study aims to determine whether dexamethasone therapy - which focuses on modulation&#xD;
      of the host inflammatory response - is effective in reducing renal scarring.&#xD;

    <description>Division of Children With Renal Scarring at the Outcome of (DMSA) Renal Scan [ Time Frame: The outcome DMSA scan will be 6 months from enrollment.] Renal scarring is defined as decreased uptake of tracer with or without loss of contours.&#xD;
Three radiologists independently will review all renal DMSA scans for scarring .&#xD;
Diagnosis of presence or absence of renal scarring for a kidney , should be endorsed by the majority of readers (2/3).&#xD;
The child will be determined to have renal scarring if either kidney or both kidneys have scarring by the majority of readers.</description>
