  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past years, the adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) has been&#xD;
      increasing obviously in China. It may be caused by the reason of increased body weight,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, gastroesophageal reflux disease and premalignant. In western countries,&#xD;
      the 5-year rate of advanced AEG was less than 30%, it was the same in China. There was&#xD;
      significant difference in epidemiology, pathogenic mechanism, biological characteristics and&#xD;
      prognosis between AEG and antrum tumors, so AEG was regarded as a kind of independent&#xD;
      disease. Up till now, the scope of lymph node dissected, the selection of operation approach,&#xD;
      the resection range and the digestive tract reconstruction for the treatment of AEG were in&#xD;
      dispute, especially in the reconstruction of digestive tract after operation. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of the proximal gastrectomy combined&#xD;
      with Giraffe anastomosis for early adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction.&#xD;

      In the past years, the adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) has been&#xD;
      increasing obviously in China. It may be caused by the reason of increased body weight,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, gastroesophageal reflux disease and premalignant. In western countries,&#xD;
      the 5-year rate of advanced AEG was less than 30%, it was the same in China. There was&#xD;
      significant difference in epidemiology, pathogenic mechanism, biological characteristics and&#xD;
      prognosis between AEG and antrum tumors, so AEG was regarded as a kind of independent&#xD;
      disease. Up till now, the scope of lymph node dissected, the selection of operation approach,&#xD;
      the resection range and the digestive tract reconstruction for the treatment of AEG were in&#xD;
      dispute, especially in the reconstruction of digestive tract after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digestive tract reconstruction methods for AEG II were determined by the surgical&#xD;
      approach. The controversy exists regarding whether reconstruction method with low esophageal&#xD;
      reflux should be used to treat AEG patients. The gastric tube reconstruction, the&#xD;
      antrum-preserving double-tract reconstruction and the Roux-en-Y reconstruction were the&#xD;
      common methods. Some studies showed that the 24-h pH profile in the patients with gastric&#xD;
      tube reconstruction was similar to the healthy person, but it may be related to the&#xD;
      increasing incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease in the healthy person and the&#xD;
      anti-reflux medication used in the patients. Although the antrum-preserving double-tract&#xD;
      reconstruction have a good function of anti-reflux, the complicated operation and too many&#xD;
      anastomotic stomas increased the rate of postoperative happened. The common physiological&#xD;
      mechanism of anti-reflux was caused by the lower esophageal sphincter, esophagogastric&#xD;
      junction, His angle and so on. Therefore, in our center, we use a new reconstruction which&#xD;
      combine the advantages of gastric tube reconstruction with rebuilding the His angle and&#xD;
      fundus of gastric. We call it Gastric tube interposition esophagogastrostomy with&#xD;
      reconstruction of His angle and fundus (Giraffe anastomosis).&#xD;
