  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Netherlands, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is increasing. In&#xD;
      addition, EAC has a dismal prognosis. Therefore, screening for Barrett's Esophagus (BE) has&#xD;
      stimulated interest. Although BE is a known precursor of EAC, a minority of patients with EAC&#xD;
      are known with a previous diagnosis of BE. A non-invasive screening tool, such as breath&#xD;
      testing, could select patients at risk for BE, after which unsedated transnasal endoscopy&#xD;
      (uTNE) can confirm or exclude the diagnosis. The objective is to determine the accuracy and&#xD;
      acceptability of a non-invasive screening strategy i.e. breath testing followed by uTNE for&#xD;
      BE and EAC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The ongoing increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in the Netherlands during&#xD;
      the last few decades and the still dismal prognosis has stimulated interest in screening for&#xD;
      Barrett's esophagus (BE). Although BE is a known precursor of EAC, a minority of patients&#xD;
      with EAC (&lt;10%) are known with a previous diagnosis of BE, and hence, most cases of BE are&#xD;
      undiagnosed. Screening programs to detect BE followed by endoscopic surveillance and&#xD;
      treatment of dysplasia or early neoplasia seem able to reduce the incidence of EAC and&#xD;
      improve survival. A non-invasive screening tool, such as breath testing, could select&#xD;
      patients at risk for BE, after which unsedated transnasal endoscopy (uTNE) can confirm or&#xD;
      exclude the diagnosis. uTNE offers the possibility of a more acceptable and accurate&#xD;
      endoscopic assessment of the esophagus with almost neglectable risks and lower costs compared&#xD;
      to conventional endoscopy. The objective is to determine the accuracy and acceptability of a&#xD;
      non-invasive screening strategy i.e. breath testing followed by uTNE for BE and EAC.&#xD;
