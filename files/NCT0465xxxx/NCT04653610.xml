  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the role of extracellular vesicles in HIV-infection, by&#xD;
      determining the expression profile and content of EVs before and after treatment initiation&#xD;
      in HIV-infected patients, through extensive blood and tissue sampling (leukapheresis, stool&#xD;
      sampling and colon biopsies). A one-time sampling (blood, stool, colon biopsies) will also be&#xD;
      performed in HIV-seronegative healthy volunteers to confirm that results found in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients are related to the disease.&#xD;

        Our aim is to enroll a minimum of 32 and a maximum of 50 untreated HIV-infected patients.&#xD;
        We aim to include a minimum of 16 patients with a CD4 T cell count lower than 350 cells/µl&#xD;
        and a minimum of 16 patients with a CD4 T cell count higher than 350 cells/µl. Furthermore&#xD;
        we aim to include 16 HIV-seronegative healthy donors to confirm that the results found in&#xD;
        HIV-patients are related to the disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
        A.1. Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented untreated HIV-1 infection defined as followed: HIV-1-specific&#xD;
             antibody+(western blot); p31+ (ELISA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4 T cell count will be determined standard of care (SOC). A minimum of 16 patients&#xD;
             will be included with a CD4 T cell count lower than 350 cells/µl and a minimum of 16&#xD;
             patients with a CD4 T cell count higher than 350 cells/µl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 65 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to attend the complete schedule of assessments and patient visits as described&#xD;
             in the schedule below&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness to have blood, stool and colon samples collected and stored&#xD;
             for 20 years after finalizing the study, and used for various research purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
        A.2. Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent HIV-infection, early diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous or current history of opportunistic infection (AIDS defining events as&#xD;
             defined in category C of the CDC clinical classification), consisting of chronic HIV-1&#xD;
             infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active HBV infection (Hepatitis B surface antigen positive or HBV viral&#xD;
             load positive in the past and no evidence of subsequent seroconversion (=HBV antigen&#xD;
             or viral load negative and positive HBV surface antibody))&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active HCV infection: HCV antibody positive result within 60 days prior to&#xD;
             study entry with positive HCV viral load or, if the HCV antibody result is negative, a&#xD;
             positive HCV RNA result within 60 days prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;

             will in the opinion of the investigator interfere with the trial conduct or safety of&#xD;
             the participant. An initial psychiatric assessment will be made by the treating&#xD;
             physician. Since making a correct psychological assessment at the time of diagnosis&#xD;
             can be difficult, a visit with a psychologist is planned for patients included in the&#xD;
             study, for a second evaluation. This will be planned within the first month after&#xD;
             diagnosis. In consultation with the psychologist, further sampling will be planned or&#xD;
             the patient will be excluded from further sampling.&#xD;

             treatment and/or hospitalization within 60 days prior to entry&#xD;
