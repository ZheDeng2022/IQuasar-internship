  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, investigator initiated clinical trial using a FDA approved, marketed&#xD;
      brace called DJO X4. This phase 4, prospective, randomized clinical trial is being conducted&#xD;
      to evaluate the use of the X4 knee brace with the Motion Intelligence platform in patients&#xD;
      having unilateral TKA. The study is designed to determine if using a &quot;virtual rehabilitation&quot;&#xD;
      device leads to enhanced recovery following TKA by improving patient objective and subjective&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the use of the X4 knee brace&#xD;
      with the Motion Intelligence platform in patients having unilateral TKA. This brace is a FDA&#xD;
      approved, marketed product being used as per the manufacturer's (DJO) marketed indications.&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine if using a &quot;virtual rehabilitation&quot; device leads to&#xD;
      enhanced recovery following total knee arthroplasty by improving patient objective and&#xD;
      subjective outcome measures. These outcomes will be collected using a validated tool called&#xD;
      the Knee Society Score (KSS). The KSS is a standard of care tool collected for all TKA&#xD;
      patients pre-operatively and postoperatively at the 8 week visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one to 4 cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1- Study group-Home discharge. Patients randomized to this group will be provided with&#xD;
      the X4 brace and trained on the use of Motion Intelligence platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2- Control group-Home discharge. Patients randomized to this group will serve as the&#xD;
      control group. There will be no changes to the standard of care recovery for a TKA patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3- Study group-Inpatient rehabilitation. Patients randomized to this group will be&#xD;
      provided with the X4 brace and trained on the use of Motion Intelligence platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 4- Control group-Inpatient rehabilitation. Patients randomized to this group will&#xD;
      serve as the control group. There will be no changes to the standard of care recovery for a&#xD;
      TKA patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DJO X4 brace will be provided to the patient at no cost. Study visits, hospitalization,&#xD;
      inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation costs are standard of care and will be the&#xD;
      responsibility of the patient. There will be no payment for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study patients will complete a daily &quot;Daily Patient Log&quot; starting the day after discharge&#xD;
      from the hospital until postoperative day (POD) 56. This log will document the patient's&#xD;
      location:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rehabilitation center or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Home physical therapy or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical therapy center&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital (re-admission)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Return to work (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses is that the X4 brace with the Motion Intelligence platform will provide&#xD;
      an enhanced, cost-effective postoperative recovery following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Discharge to a sub-acute rehabilitation after arthroplasty surgery is discouraged after due to&#xD;
    the pandemic. The protocol is being revised to remove this arm of the study.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>DJO X4 brace with Motion Intelligence Platform</intervention_name>
    <description>The X4 Knee brace with the Motion Intelligence platform uses both a bio-measurement equipment with an interactive application thereby providing the patient with immediate feedback on their exercise regime. The X4 Knee brace is a postoperative brace worn by a patient to monitor compliance to prescribed protocol based on the movement and function of the knee joint. The device also connects wirelessly to a companion mobile application, Motion Intelligence, and streams both real-time and collected data for review and record collection. Prescribed exercises are uploaded into the patient application, with a number of the exercises actively tracked by the Mi360 sensor housed in the X4 brace. Compliance can be tracked by the physician in real-time between postoperative visits and any medical staff on a separate dashboard.</description>
