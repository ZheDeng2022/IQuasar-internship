  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV trial studies the side effects and how well perampanel works in reducing&#xD;
      seizure frequency in patients with high-grade glioma and focal epilepsy. Perampanel is a drug&#xD;
      used to treat seizures. Giving perampanel together with other anti-seizure drugs may work&#xD;
      better in reducing seizure frequency in patients with high-grade glioma and focal epilepsy&#xD;
      compared to alternate anti-seizure drugs alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Demonstrate the efficacy and safety of perampanel (PER) on seizure frequency in adult&#xD;
      patients with biopsy-proven high-grade glioma and focal epilepsy compared with alternate&#xD;
      anti-seizure drugs (ASDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the change in neurocognitive function and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      progression over the course of PER treatment with a daily dose of 4 mg (up to -8mg) in&#xD;
      patients with biopsy-proven high-grade glioma and focal epilepsy compared with alternate&#xD;
      ASDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify a biomarker-specific response to seizure-reduction in patients treated with&#xD;
      PER in patients with a biopsy-proven high-grade glioma (i.e., IDH-mutant versus [vs]&#xD;
      wildtype).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A: Patients receive perampanel orally (PO) once daily (QD) 40 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B: Patients receive ASD per standard of care for 40 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.&#xD;
