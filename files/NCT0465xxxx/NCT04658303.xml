  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma in-transit metastases (ITMs) continue to represent a therapeutic dilemma, in that no&#xD;
      standard method of treatment has been uniformly adopted. The complexity and heterogeneity of&#xD;
      patient and disease characteristics, including the location and number of ITMs presents a&#xD;
      barrier to a one size fits all treatment approach. Treatment of patients with limited&#xD;
      regional disease remains challenging. Patients are typically treated with a combination of&#xD;
      surgery, regional therapy, systemic therapy. Data on the management of ITMs is limited, even&#xD;
      with the availability of immunotherapy (IMT). This study will use the unique etiology of ITMs&#xD;
      to facilitate the understanding of how individual lesions metabolically and immunologically&#xD;
      evolve as they move away from the primary tumor site. It is hypothesize that as ITMs move&#xD;
      away from the primary melanoma site each will harbor progressively hypermetabolic tumor cells&#xD;
      and a harsher microenvironment.&#xD;

      This study will use a novel platform to profile patient biopsies, including microscopic&#xD;
      analysis, flow cytometry for phenotyping, metabolic, and functional analyses, and metabolic&#xD;
      profiling by Seahorse analysis to understand the unique etiology of ITMs to understand how&#xD;
      individual melanoma lesions metabolically and immunologically evolve as they move away from&#xD;
      the primary tumor site. A large amount of translational data is able to be derived from from&#xD;
      an individual tissue biopsies. This study will utilize this platform to extensively evaluate&#xD;
      2-5 (melanoma) in-transit metastases (ITMs) per patient. It is hypothesized that as ITMs move&#xD;
      away from the primary melanoma site each will harbor progressively hypermetabolic tumor cells&#xD;
      and a harsher microenvironment. Each ITM station will be deeply profiled using metabolic&#xD;
      assays, flow cytometry, and highly multiplexed immunofluorescent microscopy including, to&#xD;
      interrogate the metabolic profiles of tumor and immune system in individual melanoma ITMs,&#xD;
      and, to Determine tumor:immune interaction in the context of hypoxia using high-dimensional&#xD;
      imaging. Using high throughput sequencing technologies, it will determined how tumor and&#xD;
      immune cells interact and evolve during the course of transit in ITMs (as these cells become&#xD;
      more metabolically and immunologically suppressive as they migrate further from the primary&#xD;
      site). The clonal evolution analysis of tumor cells through and pimonidazole-enabled single&#xD;
      cell RNA-sequencing will be used to identify transcriptomic changes in tumor, immune, and&#xD;
      stromal cells correlated with hypoxia exposure.&#xD;

    <description>5' scRNAseq will be used for identification of TCR sequences to identify individual T cell clones.

    <description>Analysis of hypoxia exposure for each cell using unique pimonidazole CITE-seq strategy also allows for the a. As hypoxia promotes the terminal differentiation of T cells, it is expected that distant ITMs will harbor more hypoxic cells and that terminally differentiated T cells will experience higher levels of hypoxia.</description>

    <description>Pimonidazole is not used with therapeutic intent, and has a non-hazardous designation. It has been widely used for in-vivo evaluation of intratumor hypoxia, and patients will take PO pimonidazole before the scheduled biopsy. Patients receive an oral dose of pimonidazole, a safe chemical tracer up to 24 hours prior to biopsy. Pimonidazole allows for true hypoxia staining; pimonidazole binds hypoxic proteins covalently, creating an antigen that facilitates the imaging, flow cytometry, and scRNA-seq experiments proposed. Pimonidazole has been previously used in patients and is safe and well tolerated, without anticipated adverse events.</description>
