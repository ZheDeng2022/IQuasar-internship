  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, patients receive insulin doses if they consume specific amounts&#xD;
      of carbohydrates. Currently, insulin is not being administered for consumption of protein&#xD;
      although studies in adults show that consuming about 75 grams of protein causes elevation in&#xD;
      post prandial glucose levels and might need insulin coverage. We are proposing that this&#xD;
      amount is different for kids and it might vary based on weight, age, pubertal stage, HbA1C or&#xD;
      other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This has not been studied in children before, and it will provide information about the&#xD;
      amount of protein in the diet that can cause elevation in post prandial glucose.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In target glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) continues to be a challenge&#xD;
      despite advances in methods of insulin delivery and medical knowledge in this area. One of&#xD;
      the major aspects is controlling postprandial glycemia (PPG). The relationship between&#xD;
      dietary intake of carbohydrates and PPG is well established, and the use of insulin coverage&#xD;
      for carbohydrate intake is standard of care. Insulin dose for carbohydrate coverage increases&#xD;
      with body weight and progression through puberty. Multiple researchers have attempted to&#xD;
      study the effect of dietary intake of protein and fat on PPG as well, but this relationship&#xD;
      is not well established in the pediatric age group and there are not clear guidelines for&#xD;
      patients on when and how to give insulin for protein intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meals with high protein content have been shown to cause higher glucose excursions in&#xD;
      patients with T1D, and lower glycemic response in healthy individuals which suggests that&#xD;
      physiologic response to protein intake involves higher insulin secretion. This has also been&#xD;
      demonstrated by Sun et al, where they showed an increase in insulinemic index in healthy&#xD;
      individuals when consuming chicken with rice compared to rice alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of dietary protein in individuals with T1D has been studied in mixed meals several&#xD;
      times. Smart et al demonstrated that the greatest glucose excursions after high protein low&#xD;
      fat meal occurred most significantly form min 150 to 300 after the meal, when insulin is&#xD;
      given to cover carbohydrates only. In 2013, Borie-Swinburne et al measured interstitial&#xD;
      glucose levels by CGM in 28 c-peptide negative T1D patients, on two consecutive nights, with&#xD;
      and without addition of 21.5 grams of protein to dinner (40 g vs 61.5 g). They concluded that&#xD;
      no additional insulin is needed to cover for the added protein. Neu et al studied 15&#xD;
      adolescents with T1D on two consecutive nights. They used CGM monitoring for 12 hours, and&#xD;
      they compared the area under the curve (AUC) between regular meals and fat/ protein rich&#xD;
      meal. They found a significant difference and they recommended additional insulin for fat&#xD;
      /protein rich meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigating the effect of protein-only intake is also an area of research focus. Paterson&#xD;
      et al studied 27 patients with TID , aged 7-40 yrs, where they were given 6 test meals of&#xD;
      varying amounts (0g, 12.5g, 25g, 50g, 75g and 100g) of pure protein without giving insulin.&#xD;
      Postprandial glycemia was found to be significantly higher only for 75 and 100 grams of&#xD;
      protein compared to the lower quantities. Glucose levels were slower to rise when compared to&#xD;
      consumption of 20 grams of carbohydrates. Paterson et al also conducted another study with&#xD;
      slightly different design: 27 participants with T1D [aged 10-40 years, HbA1c ≤ 64 mmol/mol&#xD;
      (8%), BMI ≤ 91st percentile] received a 30-g carbohydrate (negligible fat) test drink with a&#xD;
      variable amount of protein daily over 5 days in randomized order. Protein (whey isolate 0&#xD;
      g/kg carbohydrate, 0 g/kg lipid) was added in amounts of 0 (control), 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 g.&#xD;
      A standardized dose of insulin was given for the carbohydrate. PPG was assessed by 5 hours of&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring. Increasing protein quantity in a low-fat meal containing&#xD;
      consistent amounts of carbohydrate decreases glucose excursions in the early (0-60-min)&#xD;
      postprandial period and then increases in the later postprandial period in a dose-dependent&#xD;
      manner. In summary, Paterson et al concluded that there was a threshold for dietary protein&#xD;
      intake (75 grams), and only protein intake above this threshold regardless of body weight&#xD;
      would result in post prandial hyperglycemia. However, these studies included a wide range of&#xD;
      ages and did not adjust for body weight in their analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Innovation The purpose of this study is to explore the role of weight in the relationship&#xD;
      between protein intake and post prandial glucose (PPG) levels. The study design (36 children&#xD;
      each receiving 6 increasing nominal doses of protein) allows for the relationship to be&#xD;
      studied both across patients of varying weights within each nominal dose, and across patients&#xD;
      (whose weights remain the same) across the increasing doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To describe the relationship of weight (in kg), and mg of protein per kg body weight,&#xD;
      to PPG, graphically and statistically, at each nominal dose. The heaviest children will&#xD;
      receive the lowest mg/kg amount of protein at each nominal dose, so these relationships with&#xD;
      PPG will be inverse. Additionally, children with different weights and receiving different&#xD;
      nominal doses, may be receiving the same mg/kg protein. Observing all nominal doses together&#xD;
      will allow us to determine whether the relationship, if any, is linear, demonstrates a&#xD;
      threshold, or exhibits a doseresponse curve, as examples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To describe graphically and statistically the relationship of dose of protein to PPG&#xD;
      by patient across increasing doses. Since the weight remains constant (or approximately&#xD;
      constant) within a patient, adjustment by weight would yield the same results. The&#xD;
      expectation is that these results will confirm those from Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To construct a multivariate mixed model where any observed relationships can be&#xD;
      controlled for other demographic and clinical characteristics possibly associated with blood&#xD;
      glucose levels. The type of model will depend on the results of Aims 1 and 2.&#xD;
