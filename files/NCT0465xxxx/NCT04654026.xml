  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are the main causes of death among&#xD;
      people. Antiplatelet threrapy is very important for patients to prevent ischemic&#xD;
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.Ischemic cardiovascular patients of cerebral&#xD;
      amyloid angiopathy (CAA) patients is as high as 20%, aspirin and clopidogrel is applied to&#xD;
      prevent or treat the patient with CAA is controversial, there is no valid evidence of CAA&#xD;
      crowd is safe to use of antiplatelet drugs, but progress in clinical treatment is usually&#xD;
      based on patient condition for antiplatelet agents to prevent the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
      events, such as blood clots.Therefore, this study is intended to be a single-center,&#xD;
      prospective study of patients with ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases&#xD;
      taking aspirin and clopidogrel, to determine whether the patients are combined with CAA , and&#xD;
      to conduct a follow-up study for 12 months after team inclusion:1) The prevalence rate and&#xD;
      gene spectrum of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases among CAA patients&#xD;
      enrolled in our hospital were analyzed;2) To explore the correlation between aspirin and&#xD;
      clopidogrel drug genes and blood drug concentrations and diseases in patients with ischemic&#xD;
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases complicated with CAA;3) To evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of aspirin and clopidogrel in patients with ischemic cardiovascular and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular diseases who combined with CAA.&#xD;

      This project intends to observation of bleeding the application of antiplatelet in patients&#xD;
      with CAA, so as to provide effective clinical evidence for the further application of&#xD;
      clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with CAA in the future, and to provide reference basis&#xD;
      for the accurate formulation of clinical treatment plans and the balance of health risks&#xD;
      brought by adverse bleeding reactions.&#xD;
