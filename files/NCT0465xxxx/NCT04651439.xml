  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) including Stevens Johnson (SJS) and Lyell syndromes&#xD;
      represent the most severe drug eruptions. It is an allergic disorder caused by cytotoxic T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, specific of drugs, responsible for the destruction of keratinocytes by&#xD;
      apoptosis. Regulatory T cell (CD25 high CD4+), normally responsible for controlling the&#xD;
      activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, have altered function. Despite the progress made in&#xD;
      the pathophysiological understanding of TEN, there is currently no effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main symptom is bullous and skin peeling &gt; 10% giving the appearance of great burns. The&#xD;
      death rate is estimated between 30 and 40% due to visceral inflammatory injuries and&#xD;
      bacterial superinfection. The risk of mortality is estimated during the initial treatment by&#xD;
      calculating the SCORTEN (mortality&gt;10% if SCORTEN&gt;2, mortality&gt;90% if SCORTEN&gt;5). The&#xD;
      morbidity is also very important (92% at 1 year), especially ophthalmologic with high risk of&#xD;
      blindness...&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic potential of G-CSF (Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor) in TEN is&#xD;
      supported by several observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The G-CSF promotes skin healing. This has been shown in human burns, with a significant&#xD;
      reduction in healing time under G-CSF. The mechanisms associate the growth factor effect on&#xD;
      keratinocytes, macrophages stimulation and metalloprotease activity allowing tissue&#xD;
      remodeling limiting sequels onset. Otherwise, healing altered in deficient G-CSF mice is&#xD;
      corrected by the growth factor injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The G-CSF is an immunomodulator whose activities appear to justify use in TEN :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polarization of immune response to Th2 non-cytotoxic (anti Th1),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preferential differentiation of naive LT (T lymphocytes) in regulator LT (CD25 high&#xD;
           CD4+) and mobilization of regulator LT of the spinal cord to altered tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The G-CSF was used in a few cases of TEN with great efficacy. No data is available concerning&#xD;
      sequels of SJS/TEN in treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial program, by providing proof of the efficacy of filgrastim in SJS/TEN,&#xD;
      should allow progress in care of this serious toxics diseases. In the future, it could thus&#xD;
      reduce the significant morbidity of these syndromes with a high rate of sequelae.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life evolution assessed with Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) or Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI).&#xD;
DLQI is calculated by adding the score of each question, resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.&#xD;
CDLQI is used in the same way. It is documented in 5 minutes. Each question is illustrated by a cartoon based on the theme of the question, making it more fun for younger children. The scoring for each question is &quot;Very much&quot;[Score = 3], &quot;Quite a lot&quot;[2], &quot;Only a little&quot;[1], &quot;Not at all&quot;[0], &quot;Blank&quot;[0], and Q7 - &quot;prevented school&quot;[3]. The 10 individual question scores are summed to provide a total CDLQI score. The maximum possible score is 30, indicating maximum impact on QoL.&#xD;

    <measure>Risk of developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 0, day 7 and day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Determination of the proportion of patients with high risk of developing PTSD measured with Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) or Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES).&#xD;
IES-R is a 22-item self-administered questionnaire that measures symptoms of intrusion, avoidance and over-arousal experienced during the past 7 days. Patients rate each item on a 0-5 point Likert scale. The total score, between 0 and 88, is obtained by adding all the ratings for each item: low risk (score less than 12), moderate (score between 12 and 34 inclusive) or at high risk (score strictly greater than 34) of developing PTSD.&#xD;
CRIES-13 is a revised scale to measure the impact of events on children from 8 years old. Items are rated on a 4-point scale, with scores of 0, 1, 3 and 5 points. The maximum score is 65. The score is obtained by adding the responses to each item. A score of 30 or more would be effective in screening for PTSD.&#xD;
A comparison between the 2 arms will be done.</description>
