  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major public health problem, with 44,872 new cases per year in&#xD;
      France (3rd most common cancer), and 17,684 deaths (2nd cause of death from cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer screening is used to detect early-stage cancers and precancerous lesions&#xD;
      (adenomas). Detecting the disease at an early stage enables curative treatment, which is less&#xD;
      aggressive and less costly than treatment at an advanced stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal occult blood screening has proven its effectiveness in the general population, with a&#xD;
      14% to 16% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality, and even a drop in incidence with 2nd&#xD;
      generation immunological tests (FIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, organised colorectal cancer screening in the general population has been in place&#xD;
      since 2009 and since 2015 has been based on the use of a quantitative immunological test&#xD;
      (OC-Sensor®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test is offered every 2 years to men and women aged between 50 and 74 with an average&#xD;
      risk of developing CRC, i.e. nearly 19.7 million people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disadvantages of the current screening test are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insufficient sensitivity, although the FIT is more sensitive than the old guaiac test,&#xD;
           its sensitivity is not perfect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insufficient specificity: many colonoscopies are performed for nothing. This&#xD;
           unjustifiably exposes many patients to endoscopic complications and incurs an&#xD;
           unnecessary cost to society.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participation rate in screening is too low. Colorectal cancer screening&#xD;
           participation was 32.1% in 2017/2018, below the European minimum efficiency target of&#xD;
           45% and far below the 71% observed in our Dutch neighbours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several non-invasive alternatives for colorectal cancer screening are being explored and&#xD;
      proposed. Among these techniques, serum protein assay has shown its interest in terms of&#xD;
      screening for adenomas and colorectal cancers. The assay of 7 serum proteins (which will be&#xD;
      the subject of a patent application in 2020), by ELISA test, is the subject of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results need to be confirmed in a prospective study, with comparison to the gold&#xD;
      standard: total colonoscopy. If these results are confirmed, this would make it possible to&#xD;
      develop a new non-invasive method of colorectal cancer screening, which would have several&#xD;
      advantages over the current test: better sensitivity than the FIT (estimated at about 38% for&#xD;
      the detection of advanced adenomas and 88% for colorectal cancers) which would limit the&#xD;
      number of false negatives and decrease the number of colorectal cancers discovered at a late&#xD;
      stage, a better specificity which would limit the number of false positives and decrease the&#xD;
      number of unnecessary colonoscopies, a better participation in the screening test, and a&#xD;
      reasonable cost with a technique that can be routinely performed in many centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this prospective clinical study, a pre-clinical calibration phase of the test&#xD;
      (combined dosage of the 7 candidate proteins) is necessary, which is the subject of the&#xD;
      present project.&#xD;
