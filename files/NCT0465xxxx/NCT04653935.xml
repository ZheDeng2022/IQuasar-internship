    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to pilot and assess the feasibility of a fully remote effectiveness&#xD;
      evaluation of a smartphone self-management app for those living with Sjogren's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fully-remote evaluation will involve minimal contact with researchers. Potential&#xD;
      participants will be recruited internationally online through social media and mailing lists&#xD;
      for Sjogren's syndrome support groups. Adverts will direct people to download the&#xD;
      self-management app on app stores (Apple App Store and Google Play). The app has been&#xD;
      designed to automate all study procedures, by guiding users through the following processes:&#xD;
      screening, informed consent, randomisation, and the collection of outcome data through in-app&#xD;
      surveys sent at 0, 5, and 10 weeks. Users will be randomised to receive the full intervention&#xD;
      or a control:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention group: full version of the app containing multiple behavioural components:&#xD;
           Symptom and Lifestyle Information, Energy Management, Goal Setting, Managing Difficult&#xD;
           Times, Assertiveness and Communication Skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Group: minimal version of the app containing only the Symptom and Lifestyle&#xD;
           Information component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To pilot and assess the feasibility of the planned methodology, and inform the design of a&#xD;
      future definitive randomised control trial of the app, the primary objectives of this study&#xD;
      are to: characterise users (i.e. international recruitment and consent rates), and test&#xD;
      screening, randomisation and data collection procedures (i.e. outcome measure completion&#xD;
      rates and score variability). The secondary objectives are to explore app engagement patterns&#xD;
      (using log data) and the acceptability of the study procedures and the app (using remote&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Interviews will take place after users have had the app installed on their device for 10 weeks after date of consent</time_frame>
    <description>All users will be invited to participate in a remote qualitative interview (up to 60 minutes). We do not expect that all participants will take part, and aim to recruit n=20 (10 in experimental group, 10 in control group). Interested users will be contacted via email to consent and arrange a suitable interview time. Semi-structured interviews will explore acceptability of the app and study procedures (i.e. affective attitude, burden, perceived effectiveness of the app, ethicality, app coherence, and opportunity costs) and usability of the app (informed by items on the System Usability Scale.</description>
