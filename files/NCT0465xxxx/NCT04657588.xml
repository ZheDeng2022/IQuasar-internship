  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness and improvement in quality of&#xD;
      life of using a novel anal insert (myMiracle)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study including the potential pros and cons, patients will be&#xD;
      given a minimum of 7 days to think about whether they would like to participate in the study.&#xD;
      If they would like to participate, and informed consent form will need to be signed, after&#xD;
      which the patients will undergo a screening to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria. A 2&#xD;
      week run-in period will take place to let patients get used to filling in an electronic daily&#xD;
      diary. Prior to this period, patients will be asked to fill out several questionnaires. After&#xD;
      this period, randomisation into either (1) the anal insert group or (2) the care as usual&#xD;
      group. Group 1 will then have an 'accommodation' week in which they can try out two different&#xD;
      sizes of the anal insert to see which size they would prefer for the treatment period. The&#xD;
      treatment period will consist of 8 weeks In which the (1) anal insert group is expected to&#xD;
      use the anal inserts and the (2) care as usual group is asked to continue with their&#xD;
      treatment as usual. During the treatment period, patients will fill out an electronic daily&#xD;
      diary as well as weekly questionnaires.At the end of the 8 week treatment period, patients&#xD;
      will fill out additional questionnaires. The follow-up consists of 4 weeks, after which&#xD;
      patients will be asked again to fill out several questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>Measured using the St. Marks/vaizey incontinence score. This scale ranges from 0 (complete continence = best score) to 24 (complete incontinence= worst score). We are particularly interested in whether a clinically meaningful decrease of â‰¥3 points will occur in the intervention group compared to the control group.</description>

    <description>Measured through the Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. This questionnaire contains 7 questions which can each be given a score of 0 to 3. A total score of 0= no anxiety (the best), a total score of 21= severe anxiety (the worst)</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through the 5 level EQ-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). This questionnaire contains 5 domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) which can all individually be scored on a scale of 0 (best) to 5(worst). Additionally participants are asked to score their health for that day from a score of 0 (worst health you can imagine) to a score of 100 (best health you can imagine).</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (QoL) (disease specific QoL)</measure>

    <description>Measured through the Faecal incontinence Quality of life scale (FIQL). This questionnaire contains 24 items which can be scored from 1( worst) to 4,5 or 6 (best) depending on the item. Patients can score a minimum of 29 points (worst QoL) to a maximum of 119 points (best QoL).</description>

    <intervention_name>myMiracle anal insert</intervention_name>
    <description>The myMiracle device is a single-use, pre-lubricated, liquid-filled rectal insert with a plastic applicator. The insert is filled with liquid mineral oil. The primary advantage of this new instrument is the fact that the liquid-filled insert will move and adapt as the fluid is transferred throughout the device making it easy to insert/remove and comfortable to wear. The design is intended to adjust to the contours of the individual anatomy to prevent leakage.</description>
