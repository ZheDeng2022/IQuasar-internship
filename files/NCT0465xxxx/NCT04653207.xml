  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the glycaemic and insulinaemic response and sensory profile of the&#xD;
      drinks with various ratios sucrose:isomaltulose. The information will be useful for&#xD;
      manufacturers of beverages to produce blood glucose friendlier drinks. The information will&#xD;
      also be useful for dieticians and clinicians in recommending foods and drinks for people with&#xD;
      diabetes. The information will also be useful to the public for making better food choices.&#xD;
      The data will also provide insights on how the different ratios of sweeteners may affect&#xD;
      glycaemic and insulinaemic indices (GI and II).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the optimal mixture of sucrose with isomaltulose that&#xD;
      will produce optimal reduction in glycaemia and an acceptable sensory profile. These will be&#xD;
      assessed among three different ethnicities.The study will recruit a maximum of 60 healthy&#xD;
      young (21-60 years old) males from three ethnicities (Malay, Indian, and Chinese). Each&#xD;
      participant will take part in 9 separate test sessions on nonconsecutive days, and consume 3&#xD;
      reference control drinks and 6 different test drinks. On each of the test days, participants&#xD;
      will consume either the reference drink (50g of anhydrous glucose dissolved in 300 ml of&#xD;
      water) or one of the test drinks which consists of 50g of sucrose and/or isomaltulose&#xD;
      dissolved in 300 ml of water in the following ratios: 0:100, 100:0, 50:50, 80:20, 70:30,&#xD;
      60:40 sucrose:isomaltulose. Study population: The study will recruit a maximum of 65 healthy&#xD;
      young (21-60 years old) males. At least 10 participants will be selected from the three&#xD;
      ethnicities (Malay, Indian, and Chinese). Males will be selected in order to avoid effects of&#xD;
      the menstrual cycle. Participants will be recruited from the general public in Singapore and&#xD;
      will be between 21 and 60 years, with a body mass index between 22 and 27 kg/m2.Design: The&#xD;
      experimental protocol adopted is a pre-validated method used repeatedly for measuring the GI&#xD;
      of foods. The testing follows a randomised, single-blinded, between-subjects, crossover&#xD;
      design with participants returning on 9 non-consecutive days. Reference food testing&#xD;
      (standard glucose solution) will precede test food testing. On each test day, participant&#xD;
      will consume either the reference drink or one of the test drinks. The test sessions will be&#xD;
      made up of 3 identical reference drinks and 6 test drinks. The number sessions each&#xD;
      participant will complete will be determined by the researcher and communicated to the&#xD;
      participant. For the 9 test sessions, participants arrive at the laboratory between 8:30-9 am&#xD;
      following a 10 hour overnight fast. They are instructed not to partake in intense level&#xD;
      sports and avoid alcohol consumption on the evening prior to a test session. Following a 10&#xD;
      minute rest two blood samples are obtained five minutes apart for determining baseline blood&#xD;
      glucose levels. They are then given either the standard or test drink to consume. They are&#xD;
      instructed to consume the food at a comfortable pace within 12 minutes. After consumption of&#xD;
      the test drink, subjects will complete a liking questionnaire. Further blood samples are&#xD;
      obtained at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes for blood glucose measurements and&#xD;
      insulin (at every half hour intervals).Reference/Test foods: The reference drink will be&#xD;
      anhydrous glucose (50 g) (standard) dissolved in 300 ml of water) and will be consumed on 3&#xD;
      occasions. The test drinks will consist of 50g of sucrose and/or isomaltulose dissolved in&#xD;
      300 ml of water in the following ratios: 0:100, 100:0, 50:50, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40&#xD;
      sucrose:isomaltulose. A total of 6 test drinks will be tested. The participant will be&#xD;
      requested to finish both reference and test drink within 12min.Blood collection: Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to attend the testing sessions after an overnight fast of ten to twelve hours.&#xD;
      Two fasting blood samples will be collected by finger prick for glucose measurement and not&#xD;
      more than 0.5ml finger prick blood sample will also be collected to measure baseline insulin.&#xD;
      A drop of blood will be collected into a HemoCue® cuvette (Helsingborg, Sweden) for blood&#xD;
      glucose analysis. In addition, not more than 0.5ml of finger prick blood will be collected&#xD;
      for the analyses of plasma insulin concentrations. Participants will then consume the test&#xD;
      meal within 12 minutes. Following this, approximately 5µl of blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180min for glucose measurements and not more than 0.5ml&#xD;
      of blood samples will be collected at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180min for insulin&#xD;
      measurements.'Liking' questionnaire: On the testing session days, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to rate their 'liking' for the test meal. Participants will be rate their 'overall liking'&#xD;
      for the test meal on a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale anchored with 'dislike extremely' (0 mm),&#xD;
      'neither like nor dislike' (50 mm) and 'like extremely' (100 mm) immediately after they&#xD;
      consume the test meal.Screening: Potential participants will first attend a screening session&#xD;
      for consenting and eligibility procedures. Participants will arrive in the morning following&#xD;
      an overnight fast. During the screening, a questionnaire will have to be completed and&#xD;
      anthropometry and blood pressure will be assessed. Screening questionnaire: The screening&#xD;
      questionnaire will include contact information, demographic, general health details, and&#xD;
      physical activity level. This information will be used to determine whether the participant&#xD;
      is eligible for the study, as well as to check for any possible confounders that may&#xD;
      influence the study outcomes. Anthropometric measurements: Body weight and body composition&#xD;
      will be measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Height will be measured using a&#xD;
      stadiometer in order to calculate participants' BMI. Waist circumference will be measured at&#xD;
      the minimum circumference between the iliac crest and the rib cage. Hip circumference will be&#xD;
      measured at the maximum protuberance of the buttocks. Blood pressure will also be measured.&#xD;
      Blood pressure: Blood pressure will be measured using an Omron blood pressure monitor (Model&#xD;
      HEM-907) at baseline. Participants will be seated for five minutes before blood pressure is&#xD;
      measured. Measurements will be taken in duplicate and the averaged results will be recorded.&#xD;
