  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) is recommended for symptomatic patients within 24 h of&#xD;
      carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. However, previous major studies found significantly better&#xD;
      outcomes with HBO2 in patients treated within 6 h. Currently, there is no consensus on a CO&#xD;
      poisoning-to-HBO2 interval that would not be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators aimed to evaluate the difference in therapeutic effect depending&#xD;
      on the poisoning-to-HBO2 interval after CO exposure in patients with acute CO poisoning who&#xD;
      received HBO2 within 24 h. The investigators compared the neurocognitive outcomes of patients&#xD;
      according to HBO2 time intervals based on the outcomes of patients treated within 6 h&#xD;
      (control group) with propensity score matching using the CO poisoning registry of our&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, 50,000 patients with carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning are admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital emergency departments annually, resulting in 1,500 deaths. CO poisoning can have&#xD;
      serious neurologic sequelae. Immediate treatment, within 24 h after poisoning, is a&#xD;
      reasonable recommendation for patients with CO poisoning. Most physicians do not treat with&#xD;
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) 24 h after CO poisoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weaver et al. conducted a double-blind randomized control trial (RCT) satisfying all&#xD;
      Consolidated Standards for the Reporting of Trials guidelines, which showed that HBO2&#xD;
      significantly reduced the rate of cognitive sequelae than normobaric oxygen therapy (NBO2) 6&#xD;
      weeks and 12 months post-treatment in patients with acute symptomatic CO poisoning. Although&#xD;
      the aforementioned study used a maximum poisoning-to-HBO2 interval of 24 h in the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, more than 60% of enrolled patients were treated with HBO2 in less than 6 h after CO&#xD;
      poisoning and the mean poisoning-to-HBO2 time was 5.8 h. In addition, in a subgroup with&#xD;
      poisoning-to-HBO2 interval &gt; 6 h, the mean interval was 8.6 h. Therefore, their study results&#xD;
      were actually powered to determine the benefit of HBO2 within 6 h post-CO poisoning; hence,&#xD;
      it is unknown whether HBO2 reduces the neurocognitive sequelae occurrence rate if performed&#xD;
      beyond 6-12 h from CO poisoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no consensus on a CO poisoning-to-HBO2 interval that would not be&#xD;
      beneficial. Therefore, the investigators aimed to evaluate the difference in therapeutic&#xD;
      effect depending on the poisoning-to-HBO2 interval after CO exposure in patients with acute&#xD;
      CO poisoning who received HBO2 within 24 h. The investigators compared the neurocognitive&#xD;
      outcomes of patients according to HBO2 time intervals based on the outcomes of patients&#xD;
      treated within 6 h (control group) with propensity score matching to make tight adjustments&#xD;
      to significant differences in patient baseline characteristics using the CO poisoning&#xD;
      registry of our hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators classified the patients included in the study into two groups: an early&#xD;
      group (≤ 6 h, control group) and a late group (6-24 h, case group), based on the time from&#xD;
      patient rescue from CO source to the start of the first HBO2 session. In addition, patients&#xD;
      who received HBO2 at 6-24 h were divided into case 1 group (&gt; 6 h and ≤ 12 h) and case 2&#xD;
      group (≥ 12 h and ≤ 24 h), and outcomes were compared with those of patients who received&#xD;
      HBO2 within 6 h from CO exposure. Moreover, the investigators classified poisoning severity&#xD;
      based on the necessity for intubation; mildly and severely poisoned patients were defined as&#xD;
      those not requiring and requiring intubation, respectively&#xD;

During the first HBO2, initial compression was performed to 2.8 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for 45 min, followed by 2.0 ATA for 60 min. If an additional HBO2 was possible within 24 h, then 2.0 ATA was administered for 90 min. Moreover, if necessary, patients were treated with HBO2, even after 24 h, until all symptoms resolved.</description>
