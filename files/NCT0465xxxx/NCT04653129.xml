  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of autologous fat graft in enhancing&#xD;
      peripheral nerve regeneration. The investigators hypothesize that fat grafting will allow for&#xD;
      faster and greater recovery of motor and sensory function following surgical repair of&#xD;
      injured peripheral nerves.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic injuries to peripheral nerves are a frequent finding after hand trauma. High&#xD;
      morbidity after nerve injuries mainly affects the younger and working population, with&#xD;
      consequent decrease in life quality and productivity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even in direct nerve repair and microsurgical nerve coaptation, regeneration is often&#xD;
      suboptimal with incomplete target reinnervation. Suboptimal outcome is attributed to axonal&#xD;
      degeneration, fibrotic scar formation, and neuromas at the site of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of adipose tissue has become very popular in tissue engineering and reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery in recent years. It is proposed as a &quot;regenerative tool&quot; for various tissues,&#xD;
      including peripheral nerves, because it offers an effective and minimally invasive procedure&#xD;
      for obtaining stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unprocessed fat grafting can provide a simple approach to improve peripheral nerve&#xD;
      regeneration by means of neoangiogenesis &amp; inflammatory response modulation. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      serves as a good protective barrier in peripheral nerve surgery, reducing fibrosis and&#xD;
      adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study advocated by Tuncel et al, concluded that combined use of autologous fat graft&#xD;
      with surgical repair methods induced significantly better regeneration in rats [3]. In&#xD;
      another study by Kilic et al, using adipose tissue flap in a crush injury model in rats was&#xD;
      found to be superior to other groups in myelin thickness, nerve fiber density, axon count,&#xD;
      and functional recovery at 4 weeks. They concluded that fat tissue seems to promote nerve&#xD;
      regeneration because of its stem cell content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no prior studies have examined the use of fat graft in peripheral nerve&#xD;
      repair in humans. So, the investigators proposed this clinical study to evaluate the outcomes&#xD;
      of primary nerve repair combined with autologous fat graft in peripheral nerve injuries.&#xD;

    <description>The fat grafts will be harvested from the abdomen or lateral thighs in a closed sterile system, then prepared according to Coleman guidelines. The blood and oil layers are then separated from the adipose tissue.&#xD;
The lipoaspirate will be injected based on a technique described by Vaienti et al, by 17-gaug cannula which will be inserted through the skin around the main incision at the nerve repair site, and the fat graft will be injected after closure of the skin.</description>
