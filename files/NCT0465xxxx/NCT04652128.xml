  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to reduce the incidence of fractures due to osteopenia, osteoporosis, and bone&#xD;
      mineral density in first stroke patients, the purpose of this study was to determine whether&#xD;
      it is meaningful to administer zoledronic acid prophylactically, and to define the&#xD;
      characteristics of the patient group that can benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects suitable for the selection criteria are divided into an experimental group&#xD;
      (zoledronic acid group) and a control group (physiological saline group) in random permuted&#xD;
      blocks. Random assignment means that a coin is thrown and assigned to the experimental group&#xD;
      or the control group with the probability of a head or tail, and is assigned using a random&#xD;
      number table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison-control group was designed to analyze and compare whether there is a&#xD;
      significant effect of preventing the decrease in bone density in the group administered&#xD;
      zoledronic acid through the double-blind experimental group and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason why physiological saline was selected as a reference drug was to double-blind with&#xD;
      zoledronic acid, because it does not affect the subject's bone density and has a very low&#xD;
      possibility of side effects, and its transparent properties are similar to that of zoledronic&#xD;
      acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects undergo a bone density (BMD-Spine and femur, Whole Body Composition Assessment) test&#xD;
      using DEXA (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) through outpatient or hospitalization at the&#xD;
      Department of Rehabilitation within one month after the onset of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the subject will receive a single infusion of zoledronic acid 5mg/100mL or&#xD;
      physiological saline 100mL intravenously at the outpatient or inpatient ward depending on the&#xD;
      group. Subsequently, the subject will receive a single infusion of zoledronic acid 5mg/100mL&#xD;
      or physiological saline 100mL intravenously at the outpatient or inpatient ward depending on&#xD;
      the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject or guardian fills in the questionnaire form at the time of the first injection,&#xD;
      6 months and 12 months after the injection, and immediately sees the fractures, side effects,&#xD;
      and changes in drugs taken from the last survey to the present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first injection, 6 months and 12 months after the injection, the above examination&#xD;
      (bone density) is performed through an outpatient department of rehabilitation medicine, and&#xD;
      by type known to be related to zoledronic acid administration such as fractures during the&#xD;
      period (primary fragile fracture, non-spine fragile fracture, Symptom fracture, spine&#xD;
      fracture, etc.)&#xD;
