        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects are clinically indicated for de novo catheter ablation of typical atrial&#xD;
             flutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least one (1) documented episode of typical atrial flutter within 180 days (6&#xD;
             months) prior to enrollment, documented by 12-lead ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age 18 years or older at time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects are willing and able to provide written informed consent to participate in&#xD;
             the study and agree to comply with all follow-up visits and evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. In the opinion of the Investigator, any contraindication to the planned atrial&#xD;
             ablation, including contraindications to anticoagulation therapy and any other&#xD;
             significant uncontrolled or unstable medical condition (e.g. sepsis, acute metabolic&#xD;
             illness, chronic kidney disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to entrain CTI dependent AFL by standard pacing at procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any prior right atrial cavotricuspid isthmus ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any cardiac ablation for non-atrial flutter arrhythmias within 90 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any patient scheduled or anticipating an AF ablation within the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use of amiodarone within 120 days prior to procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Cardiac surgery within 60 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) within 60 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Current unstable angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Documented atrial or ventricular tumors, clots, thrombus, within 30-days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any history of a known hematologic disorder (bleeding/clotting).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Implantation of permanent leads of an implantable device in or through the right&#xD;
             atrium within 90-days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure within 6-months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects with an ejection fraction less than 30% within 90 days of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) within 30-days of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             tricuspid valve regurgitation, tricuspid valve stenosis, or tricuspid valve&#xD;
             replacement; Ebstein's anomaly, or other congenital heart disease) that would preclude&#xD;
             catheter introduction and placement, as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Any cerebral ischemic/infarct event (excluding transient ischemic attacks) within 180&#xD;
             days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;42 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Severe uncontrolled systemic hypertension (systolic pressure &gt; 240 mm Hg) within the&#xD;
             last 30-days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant within the course of their&#xD;
             participation in the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Current enrollment in any other study protocol where testing or results from the study&#xD;
             may interfere with the procedure or outcome measurements for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Any other condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, makes the patient a&#xD;
             poor candidate for this procedure, the study or compliance with the protocol (includes&#xD;
             vulnerable patient population, mental illness, addictive disease, terminal illness&#xD;
             with a life expectancy of less than two years, extensive travel away from the research&#xD;
             center).&#xD;
