  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spina bifida, or myelomeningocele (MMC), is a disorder where the lower part of the spinal&#xD;
      cord of the fetus is exposed, meaning there is no bone or skin covering it. This is dangerous&#xD;
      because the spinal cord contains cells which control one's ability to move their legs and&#xD;
      walk, and also to be able to urinate and have bowel movements normally. One of the current&#xD;
      treatments for fetal MMC is to perform a surgery on the fetus before it is born which has&#xD;
      many names including in utero surgery, prenatal surgery, or fetal surgery. This is a surgery&#xD;
      that occurs inside the uterus (the womb) where the surgeon closes the opening in your fetus'&#xD;
      back to cover the exposed spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have found that adding stem cells to the repair is effective in improving the&#xD;
      ability of animals with MMC to walk, and that the stem cells are safe in animal studies.&#xD;
      These stem cells are thought to protect the cells in the spinal cord that control movement&#xD;
      and developmental outcomes. This study is being performed to look at the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of stem cells on the fetus's exposed spinal cord during prenatal surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, treatment of MMC was limited to post-natal surgery to close the dura and skin&#xD;
      over the spinal cord to prevent meningitis, which had no effect on motor function. The&#xD;
      potential benefit of earlier intervention was realized when prenatal ultrasound of patients&#xD;
      with MMC early in gestation revealed near-normal leg movements despite displaying paralysis&#xD;
      at birth. This finding gave credence to the two-hit hypothesis that paralysis was progressive&#xD;
      during prenatal life and suggested that fetal intervention could prevent the secondary damage&#xD;
      to the spinal cord. Fetal repair of MMC did confer improvement in motor function of children&#xD;
      treated in the Management of Myelomeningocele (MOMS) randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      promising results of the MOMS trial demonstrated the potential for improvement of paralysis&#xD;
      for these patients, but distal motor function still remained severely impaired in the&#xD;
      majority of patients with MMC with standard in utero repair alone. While this demonstrated&#xD;
      that the ideal time to intervene to prevent paralysis is in utero with the goal of preventing&#xD;
      the accrual of ongoing damage to the spinal cord, there is still room for improvement. The&#xD;
      remarkable regenerative capacity of the fetal environment combined with regenerative capacity&#xD;
      of placental mesenchymal stem cells offers potential for augmentation of the fetal repair of&#xD;
      MMC with a novel therapy to further reduce and repair the sustained spinal cord damage.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Treatment arm subjects receiving PMSC-ECM (Placental Mesenchymal Stem Cells seeded on a commercially available dural graft extracellular matrix). Additionally, we will follow a contemporaneous cohort of patients undergoing routine fetal or postnatal MMC repair without PMSC-ECM (non-PMSC untreated contemporaneous cohort). 35 participants will be enrolled under the treatment arm and 20 participants will be enrolled under the untreated contemporaneous cohort.&#xD;
The addition of a non-PMSC treated cohort, the untreated contemporaneous cohort, has been added at the request of the FDA to provide contemporaneous patients for validation of the continued relevance of use of the outcomes of the MOMS trial as the comparison arm for the Phase 2a portion of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Will be assessed by evaluating the presence or absence of cerebrospinal fluid leak, infection at the MMC repair site, failure of the MMC repair site to heal, and any unexpected growths or tumor formation.

    <time_frame>30 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This is primarily evaluated by improvement in motor function 2 or more levels greater than expected by anatomic level of the defect and by patients' ability to walk independently. Bowel function will be assessed by caregiver questionnaires on bowel habits, and by anorectal manometry. Urologic function will be assessed by caregiver questionnaires regarding urologic function, by renal and bladder ultrasounds to evaluate for hydronephrosis and bladder abnormalities, and by video urodynamics.</description>

    <description>As in the current standard fetal surgery, under sonographic guidance, initial uterine entry will be accomplished by uterine stapling device or similar. The fetus will be given an intramuscular injection of pain medications and paralytic. The myelomeningocele will be closed in a standardized manner under magnification. As in the standard fetal operation, the spinal cord will be dissected from surrounding tissue and allowed to drop into the spinal canal. The PMSC-ECM product will then be tailored to the size of the spinal cord and applied topically, cell side down. The PMSC-ECM product will be sutured in place to the dura. Finally, the fetal skin will be closed in the standard fashion. The amniotic fluid volume will be replaced and antibiotics will be added. The uterus will be closed. The abdominal fascial layer and skin will be closed in routine fashion.</description>
