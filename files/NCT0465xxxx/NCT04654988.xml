    <textblock>
      The objective of this multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of 12 - month treatment with prednisone and&#xD;
      azathioprine comparing to placebo on top of guideline-recommended medical therapy in patients&#xD;
      with biopsy-proven virus negative myocarditis or inflammatory cardiomyopathy and reduced&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 45%). The study will also assess persistence of the treatment&#xD;
      effects after 12 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Myocarditis/ inflammatory cardiomyopathy, which often leads to HF, is still an under-studied&#xD;
      disease with various clinical manifestations. The active myocarditis is found post-mortem&#xD;
      even in 42% of sudden deaths of young people and in 9-16% of adults and 46% of children with&#xD;
      idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Moreover, an increase in morbidity and mortality from&#xD;
      myocarditis was recorded in the years 1990-2015. Myocarditis significantly increases the risk&#xD;
      of HF, serious arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities, sudden death, anxiety, depression&#xD;
      and it reduces quality of life. Myocarditis affects mainly young people (18-40 years old, and&#xD;
      children) who lead active family life and work. Therefore, the disease causes deterioration&#xD;
      of entire family life, it reduces individual productivity, creates high and long-term&#xD;
      treatment costs. There is an urgent need to improve myocarditis therapy. Current guidelines&#xD;
      recommendations in myocarditis consists of standard treatment of already developed HF and&#xD;
      long-term avoidance of physical activity. Due to the lack of good quality scientific data,&#xD;
      there is no clear recommendation for the targeted treatment - thus patients' prognosis may be&#xD;
      poor. The pathogenesis of myocarditis and limited reports suggest the reasonable chance of&#xD;
      significant improvement of patients' survival due to immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Aim of the IMPROVE-MC study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 12-month&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment with prednisone and azathioprine compared with placebo on the&#xD;
      guideline-recommended medical therapy in patients with biopsy-proven virus-negative&#xD;
      myocarditis or inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Secondary aim is to create ready-to-use&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic scheme in polish and international healthcare systems, which can&#xD;
      lead to myocarditis guidelines change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and methods: In this multicenter (7 recruitment centers), prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial we are going to include 100 patients aged 18-75 years&#xD;
      old, with biopsy-proven virus-negative myocarditis in stable or worsening course of the&#xD;
      disease despite standard medical treatment, with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)&#xD;
      ≤45% and/or significant cardiac arrhythmias refractory to antiarrhythmic treatment. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria consist of ie.: another specific etiology of HF different from myocarditis; already&#xD;
      implanted ventricular assist device; a heart transplant recipient; contraindications to&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment; suspected sarcoidosis or giant cell myocarditis. Intervention:&#xD;
      azathioprine for 12 months and prednisone for the first 6 months versus placebo for 12 months&#xD;
      Study course: after randomization patients will undergo one-year double-blind treatment and&#xD;
      then one-year follow-up to assess the long-term effects of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of the treatment will be assessed during study visits:&#xD;
      investigational products/ placebo will be provided and additional tests will be performed -&#xD;
      48-hour Holter monitoring, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
      laboratory tests and follow-up endomyocardial biopsy after one-year of treatment. In order to&#xD;
      broaden knowledge about myocarditis pathogenesis additional genetic, immunology and proteomic&#xD;
      tests will be performed. All echo, MRI, Holter and biopsy tests will be evaluated centrally.&#xD;
      Study endpoints: primary endpoint is change from baseline in mean LVEF at 12-months.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints (assessed after 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months since the treatment start)&#xD;
      consist of: the percentage of patients with ≥10% increase of LVEF; occurrence of&#xD;
      hospitalization; death; heart transplantation; cardiac device implantation; ablation of heart&#xD;
      rhythm disorders; change of arrhythmia burden; HF symptoms assessed in New York Heart&#xD;
      Association (NYHA) class; distance in 6-minute walk test; quality of life; echocardiographic&#xD;
      parameters; cardiac MRI; histopathological exam; biomarkers of fibrosis and myocardial&#xD;
      necrosis; concentration of anti-heart auto-antibodies. Summary: Myocarditis can result in&#xD;
      numerous complications, but there is paucity of data regarding optimal therapy, short- and&#xD;
      long-term effects of possibly effective immunosuppressive therapy. The IMPROVE-MC study will&#xD;
      provide high-quality scientific data about efficacy and safety of immunosuppressive therapy,&#xD;
      non-invasive (MRI, biomarkers) and invasive diagnostics tests (endomyocardial biopsy), and&#xD;
      prognosis of myocarditis patients. This nationwide project will help in creation&#xD;

             contraindication to CMR; or any other clinical history or study that determines that,&#xD;
