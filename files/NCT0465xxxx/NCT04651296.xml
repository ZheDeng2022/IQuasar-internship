  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain (CP) is a major health problem for military Veterans, and CP is often associated&#xD;
      with comorbid mental health problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and&#xD;
      depression. CP with psychological comorbidity is associated with increased healthcare costs,&#xD;
      medication use, risk of suicide and rates of disability and reduced quality of life. Current&#xD;
      empirically supported treatments do not always lead to substantial improvements (up to 50% of&#xD;
      patients drop out or are do not respond to treatment). This project was designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of a novel intervention for addressing these challenges. Compassion meditation&#xD;
      (CM), a meditative practice that focuses on the wish to remove suffering, is a contemplative&#xD;
      practice that has promise for the amelioration of physical and mental health problems as well&#xD;
      as promoting positive affect and improving quality of life. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of Cognitively-Based Compassion Training for Chronic Pain with Psychological&#xD;
      Comorbidity (CBCT-CP+) compared to Health Education while Living with Pain (H.E.L.P.) control&#xD;
      condition, in a sample of among Veterans with CP conditions and psychological comorbidity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain (CP), defined as persistent (&gt;6 months), non-malignant, musculoskeletal or&#xD;
      generalized pain, is a prevalent and costly public health problem. CP is highly prevalent&#xD;
      among Veterans; 30-40% of Veterans have moderate to severe CP. CP has a significant negative&#xD;
      impact on mental health and quality of life. CP is associated with declines in physical and&#xD;
      social functioning, decreased activity levels, anxiety, negative mood, and depression.&#xD;
      Approximately 1.6 million Veterans Health Administration (VHA) enrolled Veterans have CP and&#xD;
      psychological distress associated with mental health comorbidities, including posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD; ~50%), depression (~25%), and anxiety disorder(s) (~25%). Despite this&#xD;
      urgent clinical need and extraordinary economic and societal costs, there are currently no&#xD;
      evidence-based psychosocial interventions that simultaneously target comorbid mental health&#xD;
      symptoms and CP interference in Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Veterans Health Administration and National Center for Complementary and Integrative&#xD;
      Health have similarly prioritized the use of complementary and integrative health approaches&#xD;
      for the treatment of complex physical and mental health conditions. Currently, forty percent&#xD;
      of Veterans with CP report using these approaches, and 70% of non-users would use these&#xD;
      approaches if they were offered at the VA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compassion meditation (CM), a meditative practice that focuses on the wish to remove&#xD;
      suffering, is a contemplative practice that has promise for the amelioration of physical and&#xD;
      mental health problems as well as promoting positive affect and improving quality of life. CM&#xD;
      has been shown to decrease anxiety and depressive symptoms in clinical populations, and is&#xD;
      associated with reductions in pain severity, pain disability, pain catastrophizing,&#xD;
      psychological distress, pain-related anxiety and depression, and pain-related anger in&#xD;
      civilians with CP. CBCT (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training), a manualized CM protocol, is&#xD;
      associated with reduced stress-related immune responses, improved negative affect, and&#xD;
      reduced suicidality and depression in civilians. CBCT has also been shown to increase social&#xD;
      connectedness and positive affect, and reduce depressive and PTSD symptoms in Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this randomized controlled trial (RCT), the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      Cognitively-Based Compassion Training for Chronic Pain with Psychological Comorbidity&#xD;
      (CBCT-CP+). The trial will compare CBCT-CP+ to Health Education while Living with Pain&#xD;
      (H.E.L.P.) control condition, in a sample of 126 Veterans with CP conditions and&#xD;
      psychological comorbidities. The rationale for the proposed study of compassion meditation&#xD;
      for CP with psychological comorbidity is motivated by (1) a pressing clinical need, (2) a&#xD;
      clear theoretical model, and (3) initial evidence of its safety, feasibility and potential&#xD;
      positive clinical effect for improving psychiatric conditions among Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from this study could inform clinical practice and policy by investigating whether a&#xD;
      compassion-based intervention targeting both CP and psychological comorbidities will improve&#xD;
      treatment outcomes for Veterans. Further, results of the trial will lay the groundwork for&#xD;
      multi-site studies that would attempt to determine efficacy of CBCT-CP+ across VA clinics and&#xD;
      formally investigate putative mechanisms of treatment effects. This work could ultimately&#xD;
      lead to better care for Veterans, greater patient and therapist satisfaction, and lower&#xD;
      healthcare and societal costs.&#xD;

    <description>Self-report questionnaire; pain interference subscale includes 7 items measuring the degree to which pain interferes with various aspects of life, including mobility, social activities, and mood. Subscale scores range from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicative of greater pain disability.</description>

    <description>The CGI consists of two clinician-rated one-item measures assessing 1) the severity of psychopathology from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients), CGI-S, and 2) the improvement in functioning since baseline assessment from 1 (very much improved since the initiation of treatment) to 7 (very much worse since the initiation of treatment), CGI-I. The CGI is a well-established measure of psychological symptom severity and is applicable across psychological conditions.</description>
