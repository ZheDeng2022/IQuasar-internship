  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moderate to deep levels of sedation and analgesia are required for ERCP. Propofol-based&#xD;
      sedation is simple, easy to use, and effective, but is not without cardiovascular and&#xD;
      respiratory adverse effects. The combination of remimazolam and alfentanil has shown&#xD;
      promising results for sedation in other similar scenarios. The aim of this study was to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy and safety of a standard propofol-alfentanil regimen with a&#xD;
      remimazolam-alfentanil combination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      What is already known about this topic is that propofol-based sedation techniques are&#xD;
      effective for ERCP procedures but are not without cardiovascular and respiratory adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Title:A randomized, controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety profile of a&#xD;
           remimazolam-alfentanil combination with a propofol-alfentanil combination for ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research center: Single center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Design of the study: Randomized, double-blind, controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The population of the study: Age is between 18 and 85 years; ASA I and II levels;&#xD;
           Patients undergone elective ERCP surgery, non-intubation patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sample size: Based on Akhondzadeh R et al. research, propofol based sedation resulted in&#xD;
           43% patients present oxygen desaturation, and assuming a 15% reduction in hypoxic events&#xD;
           in remimazolam group. From this, we have estimated that oxygen desaturation rate will be&#xD;
           43% in the propofol group and 28 % in the remimazolam group. We have estimated that,&#xD;
           with a sample size of 207 patients, the study will have 80% power to detect a&#xD;
           significant difference using the log-rank test. We have estimated that the rate of&#xD;
           dropout or withdrawal will be approximately 20%, and thus we plan to enroll 259 patients&#xD;
           each group&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Interventions: Group remimazolam-alfentanil combination received 10 µg/kg alfentanil and&#xD;
           0.3mg/kg remimazolam over 30 seconds, followed by an infusion of remimazolam at 0.2 to 1&#xD;
           mg/kg/hr and alfentanil at 0 to 1ug/kg/min. In case of the sudden patient movement, and&#xD;
           difficulty in maneuvering the endoscope, remimazolam 0.1mg/kg was used in the form of&#xD;
           bolus, as rescue drugs, and alfentanil 5ug/kg when additional analgesia is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group propofol-alfentanil combination received 10 µg/kg alfentanil and 1.5 to 2 mg/kg&#xD;
           propofol over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of propofol at 2 to 6mg/kg/hr and&#xD;
           alfentanil at 0 to 1ug/kg/min. In case of the sudden patient movement, and difficulty in&#xD;
           maneuvering the endoscope,propofol 0.5mg/kg was used in the form of bolus, as rescue&#xD;
           drugs, and alfentanil 5ug/kg when additional analgesia is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Outcome： Primary outcome： The occurrence of hypoxia, defined by any event of SpO2&#xD;
           (oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry) &lt; 90% of any duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcome： Number of events of hypoxia, defined as desaturation &lt; 90%. The mean&#xD;
           number of events during the procedure will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lowest recorded SpO2 during the procedure. Requirement of minor airway manoeuvres: jaw&#xD;
           lift/jaw thrust, nasopharyngeal airway insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Requirement of major airway manoeuvres: bag mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Total alfentanyl dose. The mean values (the doses in micrograms) during the procedure&#xD;
           will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Requirement of antispasmodic agent. Proportion of patients requiring this medication&#xD;
           will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endoscope re-insertion rate. Rescued sedation: drugs dose. Total duration of procedure.&#xD;
           Duration under sedation/anaesthesia. Successful completion of the procedure: Yes/No.&#xD;
           Proportion of patients fulfilling this criterion will be compared between the two&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sensation of abdominal bloating: Y/N. Proportion of patients experiencing this adverse&#xD;
           event will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients' satisfaction score on leaving recovery: 5 points numerical rating scale: Very&#xD;
           satisfied (5), somewhat satisfied (4), neither satisfied nor dissatisfied (3), somewhat&#xD;
           dissatisfied (2), very dissatisfied (1). Proportion of patients at a particular&#xD;
           threshold will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The endoscopist assessed the ease of performing at the end of the procedure as&#xD;
           I-satisfactory, II-difficult or III-impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           QOR-15. Recovery time :The time to recovery based on Modified Aldrete score was noted&#xD;
           every 5 minutes, starting from the time of endoscope removal . A score of 9 was&#xD;
           considered as recovery and the patient was discharged to the ward.The estimated duration&#xD;
           of the study:2-3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the procure is expected more than 1 hour, the arterial blood gas (ABG) will be&#xD;
           detected before and after the ERCP, and the serum Aβ1-40 will be also determined by the&#xD;
           commercial kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Incidence of hypertention, hypotension，tachycardia , bradycardia，nausea，vomiting, POD,&#xD;
           Sensation of abdominal bloating, increased UAMY, The dosage of urapidil, ephedrine,&#xD;
           atropine and esmolol during the observation period&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Safety consideration: ECG, HR, MAP, respiratory rate was monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Statistical analysis Mean and standard deviation values will be estimated for continuous&#xD;
           outcomes while frequency and percentage will be computed for binary outcomes. 95%&#xD;
           confidence intervals around the point estimate will be calculated where appropriate for&#xD;
           the primary and secondary outcomes. Descriptive statistics will be used to present the&#xD;
           results. P &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant. Analyses will be intention-to-treat&#xD;
           from randomisation. All randomised cases will be included in the analyses, regardless of&#xD;
           missing data. As the data capture is only limited to a few hours after the intervention&#xD;
           and the investigators are directly involved in the conduct of the study, we anticipate&#xD;
           very few missing data. A subgroup analyses will be attempted (if feasible) for the high&#xD;
           BMI and OSA groups combined.&#xD;
