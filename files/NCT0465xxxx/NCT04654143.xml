    <textblock>
      This is a phase I single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to&#xD;
      investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and food effect of BVL-GSK098&#xD;
      administered as single and multiple oral doses to healthy volunteers&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, first-in-human (FIH), double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      single and multiple ascending oral dose study in healthy volunteers.The study will be divided&#xD;
      into two parts that will be conducted sequentially. Part A is a SAD study to determine the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and PK of single oral doses of BVL-GSK098 in healthy volunteers. In&#xD;
      addition, the last cohort of Part A will investigate the effect of food on the PK of&#xD;
      BVL-GSK098. Part B is a MAD study to determine the safety, tolerability and PK of BVL-GSK098&#xD;
      following multiple daily oral doses in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
