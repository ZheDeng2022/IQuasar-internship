  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to reveal the effectiveness and safety of integrative Korean&#xD;
      medicine for Failed Back Surgery Syndrome(FBSS) by observing inpatients treated with&#xD;
      integrative Korean medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a retrospective observational study. The subjects for study are patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with FBSS and who have been admitted to four Jaseng Hospital of Korean medicine&#xD;
      (Gangnam, Bucheon, Daejeon, and Haeundae) for 2015.01.01-2019.12.31.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records of selected patients will be analyzed, and telephone surveys will be&#xD;
      conducted for each patient. The survey questions are Numeric ratinc scale (NRS), Oswestry&#xD;
      Disability Index(ODI), quality of life, and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), etc.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric rating scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Finish survey by November 2020</time_frame>
    <description>NRS uses an 11-point scale to evaluate current neck pain and radiating pain where no pain is indicated by '0', and the worst pain imaginable by '10'. NRS was assessed at admission, 2 weeks after admission, discharge, and long term follow up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index(ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Finish survey by November 2020</time_frame>
    <description>ODI is a 10-item questionnaire developed to evaluate the degree of disability for lower back pain. Each item is divided into 6 levels, and 0 to 5 points are awarded. The higher the score, the greater the degree of disability. We will conduct an validated Korean NDI questionnaire</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The five level version of EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Finish survey by November 2020</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is most widely used as a method of indirectly calculating the quality of life from various aspects. The EQ-5D-5L consists of 5 questions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, anxiety/depression) that ask about the current state of health, and answers each question with 5 likert. (1=I have no problems about, 2=I have slight problems about, 3=I have moderate problems about, 4=I have severe problems about, 5=I am unable to about) In this study, the validated Korean version questionnaire will be used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Finish survey by November 2020</time_frame>
    <description>PGIC is an indicator that evaluates the improvement of patients in 7 steps, and the subject responds with improvement of functional limitation after treatment with 7 likert. (1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, 7=very much worse).</description>
