      - Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the &quot;STOP&quot; (Sevrage Tabagique à l'aide&#xD;
      d'Outils dédiés selon la Préférence: Smoking Cessation using preference-based tools)&#xD;
      intervention, a preference-based smoking cessation intervention for smokers with low&#xD;
      socio-economic position (SEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      STOP is a randomised, multi-centre, single blinded, intent-to-treat trial. Participating&#xD;
      centres include primary care practices (community, municipal or general health clinics),&#xD;
      hospital-based facilities, and healthcare institutions specialised in addiction treatment.&#xD;
      Smokers with low SEP will be randomised into either the intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons randomised to the control group will be accompanied by their health professional&#xD;
      according to standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the intervention group will receive the same smoking cessation&#xD;
      advice, drug (varenicline, champix,..) prescription and support as participants in the&#xD;
      control group, but they will also have a choice of being given free Nicotine Replacement&#xD;
      Therapy (NRT) (transdermal patch, gum, spray, inhaler, sublingual tablets/lozenges) and/or an&#xD;
      electronic cigarette + e-liquid on the spot to aid their quit attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up appointments will take place at around 7 to 14 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
      after inclusion, according to the participant and health professional availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure of this study will be the 7-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence&#xD;
      at 6 months after inclusion (yes/no), defined as self-reported abstinence for at least 7&#xD;
      days, This self-reported abstinence will be validated by measured exhaled carbon monoxide,&#xD;
      unless this measurement is unavailable due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, multi-centre, single blinded, intent-to-treat pragmatic trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited by physicians in the different study centres starting March&#xD;
      2021. Physicians are therefore asked to present the study to their patients who might be&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the study. Posters and flyers inviting smokers who wish to quit to&#xD;
      talk to their physician about smoking cessation are also supplied to participating centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians can also carry out a pre-inclusion questionnaire over the phone or during a remote&#xD;
      consultation, prior to a face to face appointment. However study presentation, recruitment,&#xD;
      and baseline measures are will only be done with patients physically present at the study&#xD;
      centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some centres (depending on declared need), a research assistant (RA) might help physicians&#xD;
      in describing the project to each potential participant. After a presentation of the study&#xD;
      objective, a written informed consent (supplementary material) will be asked from eligible&#xD;
      patients before proceeding with randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment period in each centre will last for up to one year, while each participant will&#xD;
      be followed for 6 months. However, not all centers will begin recruiting at the same time,&#xD;
      and data collection is therefore expected to last until the end of year 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Intervention standardisation: training of medical doctors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating teams (investigators) will receive individual training sessions, during&#xD;
      which we will present to them the study protocol, the randomisation procedure and the data&#xD;
      entry (eCRF) software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol as well as a brief reminder of recommendations concerning the use of NRT&#xD;
      and e-cigarettes will be presented to all participating team members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A printed study booklet summarising the study protocol will be given out to investigators as&#xD;
      well as a digital version on a provided tablet, as well as a video format of the training&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, the fidelity of the intervention will also be assured by the structured eCRF&#xD;
      throughout the study. The eCRF will automatically determine if participants are eligible, and&#xD;
      will guide investigators during the intervention process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Randomisation and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each medical doctor (investigator) will be provided with a tablet with access to a web-based&#xD;
      randomisation module and an Electronic Case Report Form interface (eCRF). The Randomisation&#xD;
      will be investigator-stratified. This software is supplied by a company specialised in&#xD;
      clinical research and will be in accordance with the latest European and French regulations&#xD;
      regarding the protection of personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a verification of inclusion criteria, and informed consent, the module will randomise&#xD;
      the participant either to the intervention or to the control group (1:1), and will&#xD;
      simultaneously notify the coordinator of the study by e-mail. In order to minimise selection&#xD;
      bias, no substitution or change of group will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be blinded to their randomisation group: participants will not know that&#xD;
      those randomised in the intervention group will receive free e-cigarettes and/or NRT.&#xD;
      However, all participants - as part of the informed consent statement and the study&#xD;
      presentation - will be informed that investigators are studying how to help smokers with&#xD;
      their quit attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians - who will carry out the intervention and most of the follow up assessments - will&#xD;
      not be blinded to treatment randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The control group (standard care):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the control group will be given standard care in assisting their&#xD;
      smoking cessation attempt, but without free access to NRT or e-cigarettes. Standard care&#xD;
      depends on each health professional habitual practice, it includes motivational interviewing,&#xD;
      advice to quit and prescription of NRTs. Health professionals will also be in position to&#xD;
      prescribe other treatments (for example: Varenicline which is covered at 65% by the French&#xD;
      health universal insurance and might be completely covered by an additional complementary&#xD;
      health insurance - or Bupropion which has to be paid completely). An investigator could also&#xD;
      give advice on e-cigarette use if he or she finds it suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the follow-up, participants randomised to the control group will be offered an&#xD;
      e-cigarette + e-liquid and/or NRT in sufficient quantity for one month, if needed and&#xD;
      desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the face to face baseline appointment, participants randomised to the intervention&#xD;
      group will receive the same routine care smoking cessation advice, drug prescription and&#xD;
      support as participants in the control group. Further, participants will also have a choice&#xD;
      of being given free NRT (transdermal patch, gum, spray, inhaler, and sublingual&#xD;
      tablets/lozenges) and/or e-cigarettes on the spot to aid with their quit attempt.&#xD;
      E-cigarettes would be provided with e-liquids with different nicotine levels (3, 6, 12 and 16&#xD;
      mg/ml), and different flavours (tobacco, mint, and fruit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The provided e-cigarette is the &quot;Zlide Tube&quot; (Shenzhen Innokin Technology Co., Shenzhen,&#xD;
      China) an easy to use e-cigarette with a 3000mAh rechargeable battery, a 4 mL tank with&#xD;
      sliding top refill system, provided with several spare coils, and a wall charger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief and clear description of each smoking cessation aid will be given to each&#xD;
      participant, and depending on his/her choice. At each appointment (baseline and subsequent&#xD;
      follow-up) depending on his/her choice, he/she will be provided with a sufficient quantity to&#xD;
      last until the following appointment. The intervention process will be guided by the eCRF&#xD;
      which will remind investigators to list all available products, and ask them to fill the type&#xD;
      and quantity of the delivered tools for participants in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short didactic videos explaining how to use different NRTs and e-cigarettes will be available&#xD;
      for participants in the intervention group (a mobile-friendly link to the video will be&#xD;
      given), as well as for physicians accompanying participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow-up, participants in the intervention group can also be given other smoking&#xD;
      cessation tools than the one(s) previously delivered, according to their preference and after&#xD;
      seeing their physician (they can be given NRTs at the second appointment if they initially&#xD;
      chose e-cigarette only and vice versa, or the type of given NRTs can be changed or they can&#xD;
      receive NRT in addition to an e-cigarette). Follow-up measures after the first (baseline)&#xD;
      appointment might take place remotely, if the participants do not require any delivery of&#xD;
      smoking cessation tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant in both groups will be given a diary or a &quot;calendar postcard&quot; on which&#xD;
      he/she will document daily use of any smoking cessation aids, and the number of cigarettes&#xD;
      smoked every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These postcards will be pre-paid and pre-addressed to return to the study investigators who&#xD;
      would automatically fill in the corresponding data in the centralised data system.&#xD;
