      The present study is a retrospective cohort study. Patients older than 18 years of age and&#xD;
      underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgical treatment during the period from 2014 to&#xD;
      2019 and paired severely overweight controls who had no longer gone through bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. Patients having BMI (Body Mass Index) much lower than 35 (calculated as the weight&#xD;
      (kilograms) / length2 (meters)), a base line diagnosis taken into consideration a medical&#xD;
      exclusion for surgical treatment died in one year of surgical operation and missed statistics&#xD;
      at scientific information had been excluded from the study. The primary final results of the&#xD;
      study was the weight-change percentage at follow-up in comparison with baseline one and the&#xD;
      clinical events after surgery.&#xD;

      This is a retrospective cohort study. The sample size of our study includes one hundred case&#xD;
      older than 18 years of age and underwent RYGB surgical treatment during the period from 2014&#xD;
      to 2019 and paired severely overweight controls who had no longer gone through bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. Patients having BMI (Body Mass Index) much lower than 35 (calculated as the weight&#xD;
      (kilograms) / length2 (meters)), a base line diagnosis taken into consideration a medical&#xD;
      exclusion for surgical treatment, died in one year of surgical operation and missed&#xD;
      statistics at scientific information had been excluded from the study. Data was collected&#xD;
      taking in to account each patient history (age, sex, length, weight, BMI, occupation, marital&#xD;
      status, and comorbidities) and weight record in every visit from measurements statistics.&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary final results of the study was the weight-change percentage at&#xD;
      follow-up in comparison with baseline one. The secondary effects including the clinical&#xD;
      events after surgery, micronutrient levels, incidence of diabetes, hypertension, and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia.&#xD;
