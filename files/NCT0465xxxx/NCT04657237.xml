  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is first-line treatment for solid tumors. However, surgical trauma-induced&#xD;
      physiologic stress has been demonstrated to facilitate metastasis and recurrence in different&#xD;
      types of cancer. It has been reported that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could be activated by&#xD;
      surgical stress. Hence, we instigate the effect of anesthetic technique on expression of PD1&#xD;
      and PD1 ligand.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cellular immune response plays a central part in postoperative clearance of tumor cells.&#xD;
      T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells are two predominant cytotoxic effector cells that&#xD;
      are the major components of antitumor immunity. In mouse models, proliferation of T&#xD;
      lymphocytes in response to surgical trauma is defective . Programmed death-1 (PD-1) belongs&#xD;
      to the CD28 receptor superfamily. It is an inhibitory receptor, and its expression is&#xD;
      upregulated on activated leukocytes, resulting in an inhibited immune response. PD-1&#xD;
      interacts with two ligands: programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1, also referred to as B7-H1) and&#xD;
      programmed death ligand-2 (PD-L2, also known as B7-DC). PD-L2 is expressed mainly on&#xD;
      activated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, whereas PD-L1 is distributed widely. In&#xD;
      addition to immune cells, some subsets of tumor cells also express PD-L1 to escape from&#xD;
      immunosurveillance. It has been reported that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could be activated by&#xD;
      surgical stress. Hence, we instigate the effect of anesthetic technique on expression of PD1&#xD;
      and PD1 ligand.&#xD;

    <description>TPVB will be given using high frequency linear U/S transducer, place the U/S ultrasound probe was placed parallel to the vertebral spine at T4, and, T6 level and shifted 2-3 cm laterally to obtain the appropriate visualization. Following the identification of pleura, transverse process and paravertebral space, the needle was inserted in caudocranial direction using in-plane approach. Confirm negative vessel or pleural breach via aspiration then proceed with local anaesthetic 0.25% bupivacaine (20 ml) delivery slowly divided equally at T4and T6; the pleura will be seen to be pushed downward</description>
