      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic, safety, immunogenicity and&#xD;
      efficacy of CMAB819 and Nivolumab in subjects with recurrent or metastatic head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma., after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients were randomized to receive CMAB819 or Nivolumab 480 mg by intravenous infusion every&#xD;
      4 weeks until documented disease progression, discontinuation, withdrawal of consent, or up&#xD;
      to 4 doses in subjects without disease progression, whichever occurs earlier. After&#xD;
      completing 4 doses of therapy, administer of CMAB819 480 mg intravenous (IV) solution for&#xD;
      injection every 4 weeks until documented disease progression, discontinuation, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent or the study ends. Randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
      (ECOG) performance status ECOG (0 versus 1), sex (male versus female), weight （≤60 kg versus&#xD;
      &gt;60kg）and clinical trial institution (up to 20 centers) .&#xD;
