      The study is an open-label uncontrolled single-center study for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      Performance characteristics (efficacy and safety) of the dermal filler &quot;MMI-22-04-2019&quot; on&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MMI-22-04-2019 is a dermal filler recommended for application in the intimate area. It is a&#xD;
      sterile, injectable, colorless transparent gel, non-pyrogenic, reabsorbable medical device.&#xD;
      Its main functional ingredient is cross-linked hyaluronic acid of non-animal origin, produced&#xD;
      through bacterial fermentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MMI-22-04-2019 is contained in pre-filled, graduated, disposable sterile syringe with&#xD;
      Luer Lock adapter with 1 ml of net content. The sterilization of the product is achieved by&#xD;
      moist heat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MMI-22-04-2019 has been classified as a Class III medical device under Annex IX of&#xD;
      Directive MDD 93/42 EEC since it is a long-term, invasive and absorbable medical device.&#xD;
