  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective(s) of the study is to evaluate the impact of exposure to SC&#xD;
      Peginterferon beta-1a or IM Interferon beta-1a before and during pregnancy on pregnancy&#xD;
      outcome in female participants who had registered in the German Patient Support Program (PSP)&#xD;
      and of whom a pregnancy report and pregnancy outcome report is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are applicable for a subpopulation of the&#xD;
      above-mentioned population, i.e. for participants of whom data on a standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire collected during a telephone interview is available.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study with focus on existing pregnancy reporting forms&#xD;
      (retrospective part) and a patient's questionnaire which is completed at a single point of&#xD;
      time (prospective part). Main data source for the retrospective data (from 2014 until&#xD;
      December 2019) will be captured from multiple sclerosis service-center (MSSC) database, i.e.&#xD;
      the entered pregnancy report (to be completed as soon as pregnancy becomes known) and&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes report (to be completed after completion of pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective data (December 2020 to 31 March 2021) will be captured as standardized ePDF&#xD;
      questionnaire completed during telephone interview. If the pregnancy report or the pregnancy&#xD;
      outcome report is incomplete, i.e. the data above was not collected, the open questions will&#xD;
      be addressed during a telephone interview performed by the MSSC and the new information will&#xD;
      be entered into the MSCC database. The patient questionnaire will be completed at a single&#xD;
      point of time during the telephone interview performed by the MSSC.&#xD;
