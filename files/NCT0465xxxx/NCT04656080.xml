      1. Cell-free DNA does not vary significantly as a function of the activity of&#xD;
           immunologically quiescent cardiac transplant recipients, despite the metabolic demands&#xD;
           of the transplanted organ. (The implication of the null result would be that no&#xD;
           restrictions to patient activity, nor modification of cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
           prescription, would be necessary to maintain proper test characteristics of AlloSure&#xD;
           testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In immunologically active cardiac transplant allografts, exercise prior to assay of&#xD;
           donor-derived cell-free DNA can be used to increase the sensitivity of the AlloSure&#xD;
           test. (The implication of this would be that the optimal time-frame for drawing an&#xD;
           Allosure may actually be post-exercise, and that window will be characterized).&#xD;

      The specific research questioned aimed to be addressed with this proposed study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Are dd-cfDNA levels in heart transplant recipients independent of recent cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise? More specifically, does the metabolic demand of maximal cardiopulmonary exercise in&#xD;
      recent heart transplant recipients trigger a release of dd-cfDNA (if so, then what is the&#xD;
      time course for resolution back to baseline?) ii. If dd-cfDNA does not release to any&#xD;
      significant degree with cardiac allografts with short donor-ischemic time, does this test&#xD;
      characteristic continue to hold for cardiac allografts transplanted after longer donor&#xD;
      ischemic times? iii. In cardiac transplant recipients with medically stabilized, treated&#xD;
      antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and persistent dd-cfDNA elevation, does a discrete episode&#xD;
      of maximal cardiometabolic activity trigger any additional elevation of dd-cfDNA, and again,&#xD;
      with what time course?&#xD;

        The subjects to be enrolled in this study will be male and/or female hemodynamically stable&#xD;
        outpatients who have undergone orthotopic heart transplant within three months from&#xD;
        enrollment date for the recent transplant cohort, and within 10 years of transplant for the&#xD;
        antibody-mediated rejection cohort. All subjects will be 18 to 80 years of age. All&#xD;
        subjects must be able to read and understand an informed consent to be enrolled in the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the stabilized antibody-mediated rejection cohort, only patients with invasive coronary&#xD;
        angiography indicating no more than ISHLT grade 1 coronary allograft vasculopathy within 6&#xD;
        months prior to testing will be included.&#xD;
