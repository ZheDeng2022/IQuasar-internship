  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are the most common intracranial tumors in children, accounting for&#xD;
      about 40% of intracranial tumors in children. The biological characteristics and clinical&#xD;
      prognosis of LGGs vary greatly, and they can present different biological characteristics&#xD;
      such as restricted growth, invasive growth, and malignant transformation during their&#xD;
      development. The prognosis of LGGs is related to the degree of tumor resection, histological&#xD;
      type, and whether it has spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For LGGs, surgical resection is the main treatment method. However, many tumors located in&#xD;
      the visual pathway, brainstem, hypothalamus and other midline parts, it is impossible to&#xD;
      completely remove. Radiotherapy can effectively control tumor progression to a certain&#xD;
      extent, but radiotherapy can cause obvious and serious delayed damage, such as cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, endocrine disorders, cerebrovascular events, and second tumors. Chemotherapy can&#xD;
      effectively treat LGGs in children, and can postpone or avoid radiotherapy. It is the&#xD;
      preferred treatment for children with LGGs after surgery. Carboplatin combined with&#xD;
      vincristine, the CV regimen, is currently the main chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of&#xD;
      children with LGGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-angiogenesis is a new type of treatment. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Among children with relapsed,&#xD;
      refractory or progressing LGGs, the effective rate of Bev combined with irinotecan was 44%,&#xD;
      and the 6-month and 2-year progression-free survival rates were 85% and 48%, respectively.&#xD;
      However, almost all of them were treated with Bev progressed again. Tumor growth is more&#xD;
      aggressive after Bev treatment fails. Recombinant human endostatin (rh-ES) is an endogenous&#xD;
      broad-spectrum angiogenesis inhibitor that has been shown to significantly improve&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy when combining with conventional chemotherapy agents in non-small-cell&#xD;
      lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma.Previous retrospective studies of the research team&#xD;
      found that rh-ES combined with CV can treat LGGs in children effectively, shorten the onset&#xD;
      time, help quickly alleviate the symptoms of brainstem damage, and improve the quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to use prospective clinical studies to further confirm the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of the anti-angiogenic drug rh-ES combined with traditional CV regimens in the&#xD;
      treatment of children with LGGs.&#xD;
