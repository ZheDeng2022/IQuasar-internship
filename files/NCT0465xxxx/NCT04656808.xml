  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the intervention study will be 120 caregivers with guilt feelings linked with&#xD;
      care and high levels of emotional distress (anxiety and/or depression), randomly allocated to&#xD;
      the intervention conditions: intervention group and cognitive-behavioral comparison group.&#xD;
      The intervention will be provided in a group setting and will consist in 8 sessions plus 3&#xD;
      booster sessions. The effect of the intervention on guilt feelings, depressive and anxious&#xD;
      symptomatology, and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk will be assessed after the intervention&#xD;
      and at follow-ups at 6 months.&#xD;

      1. Contact with collaborator centers. Centers with previous collaboration with the research&#xD;
           team will provide contact data of potential participants. In addition, information of&#xD;
           the project will be made available through posters, news, and internet (e.g., social&#xD;
           networks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previous to the assessment each participant will be randomly allocated to the&#xD;
           intervention conditions (guilt focused intervention (GFI) and cognitive behavioral&#xD;
           therapy (CBT)) following the CONSORT recommendations. Randomization will be made through&#xD;
           random numbers using computerized procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Once contacted, caregivers will be requested to sign an informed consent and, if the&#xD;
           inclusion criteria are met, the interview will take place. Interviews will be conducted&#xD;
           by trained psychologists blinded to the project aims and hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The interviews will consist in questions and questionnaires specifically selected for&#xD;
           the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The intervention conditions have been developed following previous studies by the team&#xD;
           or recognized researchers, or following previous research studies in the topic of&#xD;
           caregiving stress or related topics (e.g. psychotherapeutic strategies for reducing&#xD;
           distress).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The interventions will take place in group format (maximum 8 participants per group).&#xD;
           Each intervention will consist in 8 weekly sessions plus 3 booster sessions in a 5 month&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Participants will be assessed again after the intervention (2 months) and at the&#xD;
           follow-up (6 months).&#xD;

    <description>Following literature on factors associated with guilt experiences in caregivers (Gonyea et al., 2008; Gallego-Alberto et al., 2019; Losada et al., 2014; Prunty &amp; Foli, 2019; Romero-Moreno et al., 2014; Spillers et al., 2008) and previous intervention studies testing an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy intervention for dementia family caregivers (Losada et al., 2015; Márquez-González et al., 2020), a guilt focused intervention was specifically designed for caregivers who experienced high levels of guilt and emotional distress. The program is based on CBT (Márquez-González et al., 2007) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) approaches (Losada et al., 2005; Márquez-González et al., 2010), combined with techniques of Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT; Gilbert, 2009), which were adapted to work with guilt experienced by family dementia caregivers.</description>

    <description>Following the cognitive behavioral model adapted to caregiving (Losada et al., 2006) and considering other previous CBT intervention studies with dementia caregivers (Gallagher-Thompson et al., 2003), a CBT intervention developed and tested for dementia family caregivers (Márquez-González et al., 2007) was used for this study. Specifically, this intervention consists of different components that are described in more detail in Losada et al. (2011) and Márquez-González et al. (2007): a) a cognitive restructuring module aimed at modifying caregivers' dysfunctional thoughts about caregiving into other, more appropriate thoughts which promote the use of more adaptive coping strategies for caregivers; b) increasing pleasant activities or behavioral activation; c) asking for help skills; and d) relaxation techniques for reducing physiological activation.</description>
