  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental illness is very common in todays' society, and it is the most common cause for sick&#xD;
      leave in Sweden. Affective diseases, such as different states of anxiety and depression, are&#xD;
      the two most common conditions of mental illness that has been reported by different&#xD;
      workplaces in Sweden. Pharmacological treatment of anxiety using benzodiazepines, tends to be&#xD;
      long, and it may lead to substance dependence, as well as severe side effects such as&#xD;
      increased anxiety levels, cognitive impact and psychomotor effects. The Swedish Council on&#xD;
      Health Technology Assessment (SBU) have identified that there are scientific knowledge gaps&#xD;
      that needs to be filled regarding the mental illness care, such as anxiety. There is a need&#xD;
      for evaluations of non-pharmacological, complementary treatments as well as research with a&#xD;
      high methodological quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture is a nonpharmacological treatment method based on complementary medicine, for&#xD;
      which interest has increased over the last years. It has, to some extent, been introduced in&#xD;
      the ordinary health care system. Auricular acupuncture (AA) is a branch of acupuncture where&#xD;
      needles are inserted in different areas in the outer ears AA has been used to treat anxiety&#xD;
      as well as vid depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) among veterans. A&#xD;
      standardised insertion pattern, defined as the National Acupuncture Detoxification&#xD;
      Association (NADA) protocol, is normally practised, and it has also been used to treat&#xD;
      insomnia. Evaluations has shown that AA according to the NADA-protocol has a calming effect&#xD;
      and seem to alleviate symptoms of anxiety, depression and to some extent, also sleeping&#xD;
      difficulties. The aim of this study is to study and evaluate effects of AA as an add-on&#xD;
      treatment to treatment as usual (TaU) within affective outpatient care for patients suffering&#xD;
      from symptoms of anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, non-inferiority randomised controlled study (RCT) with a number of (N=72)&#xD;
      participants will be conducted to answer the study aims. A qualitative interview study will&#xD;
      also be conducted to find out how the patients experience AA as an adjunctive therapy.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to study and evaluate effects of AA as an add-on treatment to&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TaU) within affective outpatient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety/depression: is the treatment symptom relieving?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does it change the participants' intake addictive drugs (i.e. benzodiazepines)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep: Is there some improvement in any sleep disorders that are linked to the basic&#xD;
           problem?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do the treatment effects persist 6 months after the treatment has ended?&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, non-inferiority randomised controlled study (RCT) with a number of (N=72)&#xD;
      participants will be conducted to answer the study aims. A qualitative interview study will&#xD;
      also be conducted to find out how the patients experience AA as an adjunctive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomised in two groups. The participants in group 1 will receive&#xD;
      AA as an adjunctive therapy to TaU (i.e. individual counseling therapy, psycho therapy,&#xD;
      pharmacological therapy) during 8 weeks. The add-on treatment will be administered at the&#xD;
      treatment sessions with their caregiver (i.e. registered nurse, psychologist, curator), and&#xD;
      at each session the participants receive 5 sterile stainless needles in each outer ear. The&#xD;
      needling is standardised according to the NADA-protocol (10). The needles will remain in the&#xD;
      outer ears for approximately 45 minutes, and will be removed by the care giver. Group 2, the&#xD;
      control group, will receive TaU and will, just like group 1, have a follow-up after 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial 12-15 participants from the AA group will be recruited to participate in an&#xD;
      interview study. Semistructured interviews will be conducted after the 8 weeks intervention&#xD;
      has finished. The questions are aimed to find out how the participants experienced the AA as&#xD;
      an add-on treatment, and if AA was helpful to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.&#xD;
