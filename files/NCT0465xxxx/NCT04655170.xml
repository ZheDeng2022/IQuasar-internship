  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of a combination&#xD;
      of nebulized Formoterol and Revefenacin among patients hospitalized for AECOPD compared with&#xD;
      standard-of-care therapy with nebulized Albuterol and Ipratropium.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, parallel group, randomized clinical trial in 60 patients hospitalized with the&#xD;
      primary diagnosis of AECOPD or acute respiratory failure with a secondary diagnosis of COPD&#xD;
      (ICD-10 codes J44.1 and J96 - J96.2 with J44.9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administer standard bronchodilator protocol with nebulized Albuterol and Ipratropium every 6&#xD;
      hours (n=30)&#xD;
&#xD;
      versus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nebulized Revefenacin 175 μg once per day and Formoterol 20 μg twice per day (n=30) for up to&#xD;
      7 days of treatment. Study medication will be administered by standard jet nebulizers in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect the Borg dyspnea scale twice a day during hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the total doses of bronchodilators per day received by each patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the number of rescue doses needed per day of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the lowest level of FiO2 employed on days 1, 3 and 7 of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record all adverse events and concurrent medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will collect:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Exam (Day 1, 3, 7, or ET) Serum Chemistry (Day 1, 3, 7, or ET) Hematology (Day 1, 3,&#xD;
      7, or ET) Chest X-Ray (Day 1).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participating patients with AECOPD will be randomized 1:1 to either a standard bronchodilator protocol with nebulized Albuterol and Ipratropium every 6 hours or nebulized Revefenacin 175 μg once per day and Formoterol 20 μg twice per day. Each patient will have a single randomization number indicating the allocated treatment. The treatment assignments will be generated with the use of a pseudo-random-number generator with stratification for age groups (&lt;50, 50-69, &gt;70) that will be used to ensure balance of these factors in the numbers of subjects assigned to each of the two treatments. The allocation to&#xD;
treatment arms will be according to a predetermined computer-generated randomization schedule that will not be disclosed to the clinical investigators.</intervention_model_description>
