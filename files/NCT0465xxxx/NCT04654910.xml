      The primary aim for this study is to determine if patient satisfaction and experience is&#xD;
      improved with the active discussion/inclusion of PROMIS scores during new foot and ankle&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>mean pain interference domain measured by PROMIS</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, before intervention</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS® (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) is a set of person-centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health in adults and children. It can be used with the general population and with individuals living with chronic conditions. Scores are typically between 20-80, but may be 0-100. Any result with higher a higher number is indicating higher pain interference effect.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>mean Patient Activation Measure (PAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary outcome measure is the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). The PAM is a 13-item scale with a 5-point Likert response scale for all questions. Raw scores are scaled to a range of 0-100 with 100 being the highest activation in self- management.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>percent of participant who respond favorably on the Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CG CAHPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess scores on the Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CG CAHPS) survey. This is a standardized tool to measure patients' perception of care provided by physicians in an office setting. Specifically, for our analysis will we focus specifically on the individual question to assess communication. We will compare the percentage of participants in the intervention versus control group who respond favorably to this question using a chi-square test of association.</description>
