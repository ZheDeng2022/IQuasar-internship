  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary choices, and in particular, excess calorie intake leading to obesity, are strong, but&#xD;
      reversible risk factors for cancer. For example, foods high in added sugars are low-nutrient,&#xD;
      high calorie foods that increase the risk of cancer by promoting weight gain. As such, the&#xD;
      reduction of sweets is consistent with American Institute for Cancer Research and the&#xD;
      American Cancer Society dietary recommendations. Behavioral interventions to alter diet have&#xD;
      limited long-term efficacy, most likely because eating decisions are governed by automatic&#xD;
      neurocognitive processes that are not addressed in conventional interventions. In particular,&#xD;
      the ability to refrain from consuming unhealthy, but widely available, palatable foods, is&#xD;
      increasingly understood to depend on inhibitory control, i.e., the ability to cut off action&#xD;
      tendencies that are put in motion by innate drives towards rewarding behaviors. Recent work&#xD;
      by our team and others have demonstrated that computer-based inhibitory control trainings&#xD;
      result in short-term, specific changes in behavior, such as reducing intake of salty snack&#xD;
      food, chocolate, and alcoholic beverages. An automatized, home computer-based inhibitory&#xD;
      control training offers the potential of an inexpensive and highly disseminable method of&#xD;
      lowering cancer risk across wide swaths of the population. As such, we aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, mechanism of action, effectiveness and persistence of a home&#xD;
      computer-based inhibitory control training. In particular, we hypothesize that a&#xD;
      high-repetition training in inhibitory control will result in increased adherence to a&#xD;
      low-sugar diet, and that effects will be mediated through improved inhibitory control. We&#xD;
      further hypothesize that gamefying the training will improve efficacy because it will boost&#xD;
      compliance with the daily trainings. We also hypothesize that the training will be most&#xD;
      effective for those starting of with impaired inhibitory control, as well as those with&#xD;
      strongest desire for palatable foods and those with strongest explicit health goals. Lastly,&#xD;
      we aim to examine the impact of inhibitory control training on secondary outcomes, including&#xD;
      on overall caloric intake, and on short-term weight loss. To achieve these aims, the proposed&#xD;
      study will recruit 100 overweight and obese individuals who currently eat high-sugar diets,&#xD;
      and who wish to improve their diets. Participants will be assigned a reduced-sugar diet for 8&#xD;
      weeks. After a baseline period, participants will be randomized, via a 2 x 2 factorial&#xD;
      design, to receive 6 weeks of either inhibitory control training or a sham training, and&#xD;
      either a gamified or non-gameified training. The 6-week intervention will consist of 15&#xD;
      minutes per day of home computer- based inhibitory control training, and will be followed by&#xD;
      a 1-week booster and then 1-week follow-up period. Dietary adherence will be measured via a&#xD;
      food frequency questionnaire and via automated 24-hour food recall. Neurocognitive variables&#xD;
      will be assessed pre and post-training in order to test trainings' mechanism of action, and&#xD;
      moderation will be assessed through baseline trait measures of explicit health goals,&#xD;
      implicit attitudes towards appetitive stimuli, body mass index, and responsivity to food&#xD;
      cues.&#xD;
