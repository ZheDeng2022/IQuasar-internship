      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria is a disease that affects many people in Burkina Faso. It is caused by germs that are&#xD;
      spread by mosquito bites. A vaccine that blocks the spread of malaria is important to get rid&#xD;
      of the disease. To see if a vaccine works, researchers need to find out how many malaria&#xD;
      infections are happening in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how often people of all ages who live in Sabou, Burkina Faso, get malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 6 months to 65 years who reside in Sabou in a household with adults and&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with questions about their health. They will have a physical&#xD;
      exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked about any malaria symptoms they are having. They will be asked&#xD;
      about the use of bed nets. Their vital signs, like blood pressure and temperature, will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will have blood taken from their arm with a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have a fever will have a malaria test. Those who test positive for malaria&#xD;
      will be referred to the local health facility for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have monthly study visits. Blood will be taken from a finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be invited to take part in 2 mosquito feeding experiments. Mosquitos that do&#xD;
      not carry malaria will bite their arm. And a small amount of blood will be fed to mosquitos&#xD;
      in a laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' homes will be examined for mosquitoes. Researchers will remove all mosquitoes&#xD;
      they collect. Participants' homes will be sprayed with a chemical to kill mosquitoes and&#xD;
      other insects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 12 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A vaccine that interrupts malaria transmission is critical to eradicate the disease, but&#xD;
      improved assays are needed to measure the efficacy of vaccines. Transmission-blocking&#xD;
      vaccines (TBVs) work by inducing antibodies in vaccines that inhibit parasite development in&#xD;
      the mosquito interrupting transmission. Efficacy of vaccines may be estimated by in vitro&#xD;
      membrane feeding assays using immune sera and laboratory mosquitoes, but qualified assays&#xD;
      that measure transmission in the field are needed to assess transmission-blocking&#xD;
      interventions in natura. Clinical trials of TBV have started elsewhere on the continent in&#xD;
      Mali, and we expect to expand TBV studies here in Burkina Faso in the future. This protocol&#xD;
      will use a longitudinal cohort to gather information on the rates of blood smear positive&#xD;
      individuals by month, season and year at Sabou Health district area, Burkina Faso.&#xD;
      Individuals in the villages will be approached first for participation, including permission&#xD;
      to contact their household and neighbors of their compound for participation. Households will&#xD;
      be identified using census data and individuals will be consented for participation. Malaria&#xD;
      smears will be obtained at monthly visits, in conjunction with mosquito collections in/around&#xD;
      village residences. Parasite rates in locally caught mosquitoes will be assessed&#xD;
      longitudinally for differences by season and year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 600 volunteers from Sabou area will be enrolled. Participants aged 0.5-65 years&#xD;
      will have monthly blood sampling and mosquito collection at their household. Participants&#xD;
      will be followed for up to 1 year, to collect data that will guide the design of future&#xD;
      community-based trials of TBV.&#xD;
