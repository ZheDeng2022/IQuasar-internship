  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in Austria with 2.868 men and 2.009 women&#xD;
      diagnosed in 2016. Reflecting the high mortality of this disease, 2.415 men and 1.534 women&#xD;
      died from lung cancer. Therefore, lung cancer is the most common reason for cancer associated&#xD;
      death in men and second most common reason in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This malignant disease can be divided into two main groups: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC is a paradigm for personalized medicine, with an&#xD;
      increasing number of targetable gene alterations. Despite this growing diversity of molecular&#xD;
      subtypes, in most patients no targetable mutation can be detected. For these patients&#xD;
      check-point inhibitors with or without chemotherapy is the mainstay of the initial tumor&#xD;
      therapy. Until recently, little progress has been made in the treatment of SCLC in last&#xD;
      decades. Recently, an overall survival benefit by the addition of an immune-checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor to first-line chemotherapy for advanced SCLC has been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the progress in the treatment of NSCLC, the performance of predictive biomarkers is&#xD;
      weak. Therefore, the development of more precise prediction models is of great importance for&#xD;
      the progress of personalized treatment strategies.&#xD;

      This registry is designed as multicenter observational cohort of patients with lung cancer.&#xD;
      Patient medical, testing and treatment information will be obtained through extraction of&#xD;
      data from existing patient medical charts. Longitudinal follow-up data, including survival&#xD;
      and tumor progression, will also be extracted from patient medical charts. This patient&#xD;
      follow-up data will be obtained until patient death or loss to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For documentation in the registry, no further diagnostic or therapeutic measures are required&#xD;
      than those already necessary in general. Participation in the registry must not interfere&#xD;
      with treatment routines. Only routine data, which has already been recorded in the patient's&#xD;
      medical chart, is transferred to the electronic Case Report Forms. To maintain patient&#xD;
      confidentiality, each patient will be assigned a unique patient identifying number upon&#xD;
      enrollment; this number will accompany the patient's medical and other registry information&#xD;
      throughout the lifetime of the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A written consent must be obtained prior to the input of data. No informed consent is&#xD;
      required from deceased patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from all sites willing to participate.&#xD;

        The registry will be made available for all disciplines and physicians caring for cancer&#xD;
        patients with locally advanced or metastatic lung cancer in Austria. In a first step&#xD;
        patients with diagnosis after 01.01.2019 will be included. In a second step the registry&#xD;
        will be expanded to include patients with diagnosis before 01.01.2019.&#xD;
