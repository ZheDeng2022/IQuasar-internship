  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillar tissue is a significant organ for the performing of immune systems in children. The&#xD;
      Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), is an organelle needed for the care of a stable function of the&#xD;
      cells. The purpose of the study was to explore the correlation among ER stress and tonsillar&#xD;
      tissue disorders and to explain the structure of diseases related to the immune system.&#xD;

      A prospective study was conducted on 46 children aged who underwent tonsillectomy for chronic&#xD;
      tonsillitis or tonsil hypertrophy. Tonsil tissues were evaluated in terms of ER stress&#xD;
      markers and apoptosis markers by Real-time PCR and Western blot methods.&#xD;

    <description>Our primary outcome was to evaluate providing that Endoplasmic Reticulum stress and apoptosis reaction performing in chronic tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertropy, which is related with the immune system of children. GRP78, CHOP, ATF6, ATF4 proteins will be investigated in tonsillar tissues to evaluate ER stress index, and bax, bcl2 proteins will be investigated to evaluate apoptosis.</description>
