  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present clinical evaluation was planned for comparing the post-operative pain incidence&#xD;
      in maxillary premolar teeth with acute irreversible pulpitis treated by recently introduced&#xD;
      heat treated TruNatomy TM and other widely studied heat-treated files Hyflex EDM, Protaper&#xD;
      Gold and one heat-treated reciprocating EdgeFile in single-visit root canal treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Essential component of successful root canal treatment is removal of pulp tissue remnants,&#xD;
      microorganisms, and microbial toxins from root canal system. Machine assisted root canal&#xD;
      preparation allows for faster and easier instrumentation. Flexible nickel-titanium (NiTi)&#xD;
      root canal files have become indispensible with technological advancements in metallurgy and&#xD;
      incorporation of several design features manufacturers have attempted to improve the&#xD;
      efficiency of these instruments. 1 Thermomechanically treated NiTi has a modified phase&#xD;
      composition compared to conventional NiTi files. These files contain varying amounts of&#xD;
      R-phase and martensite in their alloy composition in clinical conditions. Increased&#xD;
      proportion of martensite phase allows for more flexible files with enhanced cyclic fatigue&#xD;
      resistance. Simultaneously endodontic motor have undergone significant enhancements regarding&#xD;
      torque control and kinematics that are adjustable in several directions. 1 Yared (2008)&#xD;
      introduced the concept of single file reciprocation which was based on balanced-force&#xD;
      technique. Reciprocation motion have been shown to increase the cyclic fatigue resistance of&#xD;
      NiTi instruments, also these motions have been associated with increased debris extrusion and&#xD;
      post treatment discomfort. Recently TruNatomy TM files has been introduced with manufacturers&#xD;
      claims of 0.8mm slim wire NiTi design with superior flexibility, off-centered cross-section,&#xD;
      special heat-treated NiTi wire and regressive taper allowing for preservation of dentin and&#xD;
      tooth integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operative pain following root canal treatment is influenced by number of factors; root&#xD;
      canal file system and rotary kinetics on incidence and intensity of post-operative pain has&#xD;
      been conflicting with certain evidence favoring full rotary motion whilst others recommend&#xD;
      reciprocating motion. Sun et al. (2018) in their systematic review concluded that different&#xD;
      type of full rotary root canal NiTi file system did not have significant influence on&#xD;
      post-root canal treatment pain and reciprocation motion was associated with increased post&#xD;
      treatment discomfort. These scientific studies involved comparing both conventional NiTi and&#xD;
      heat-treated files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this scenario the present clinical evaluation was planned for comparing the post-operative&#xD;
      pain incidence in maxillary premolar teeth with acute irreversible pulpitis treated by&#xD;
      recently introduced heat treated TruNatomy TM and other widely studied heat-treated files&#xD;
      Hyflex EDM, Protaper Gold and one heat-treated reciprocating EdgeFile in single-visit root&#xD;
      canal treatment.&#xD;
