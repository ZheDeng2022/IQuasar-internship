  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last years, the imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity has come&#xD;
      to the fore as a possible molecular disease mechanism of schizophrenia . Pharmacological&#xD;
      studies have suggested different fMRI and EEG markers of that molecular dysfunction (resting&#xD;
      state connectivity changes, auditory mismatch and steady state deficits). However, previous&#xD;
      research is inconclusive regarding their genetic basis, their reliability, inter-individual&#xD;
      relationship as well as disease specificity. Therefore, in this study we aim at estimating&#xD;
      the effect sizes, test-retest-reliability and clinical correlates of the respective markers&#xD;
      in a comparative fashion in patients with schizophrenia, their relatives and healthy control&#xD;
      subject. To assess their molecular validity, we will assess their relationship with&#xD;
      glutamatergic and GABAergic genotypes and cellular disease models. The proof of such a&#xD;
      relation would give the opportunity of detecting a glutamatergic and GABAergic imbalance&#xD;
      throughout non-invasive imaging. Furthermore, it would help deepening our understanding of&#xD;
      the molecular pathophysiology of mental disorders which will be essential for the development&#xD;
      of more effective drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participant collective will include 3 groups of 200 persons, consisting of patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, their healthy relatives and healthy controls that are not related to the&#xD;
      patients. The patients must be diagnosed of schizophrenia according to DSM-5 to be included&#xD;
      in the study and will be excluded when there is a further psychiatric comorbidity that&#xD;
      dominates in the clinical appearance. All participants have to be aged from 18 to 80 years,&#xD;
      be mentally and contractually capable to give their consent to study participation and may&#xD;
      not be pregnant or have a structural neurological disease. The healthy participants must not&#xD;
      suffer from a psychiatric disorder themselves and, additionally, the control subjects must&#xD;
      not have psychiatric disorders in the family history of their first-degree relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant will undergo the same examinations, tests and measurements. All subjects&#xD;
      will be taken a blood sample of 30 milliliters of blood that will be tested for antibodies&#xD;
      against the NMDA receptor, neuronal growth factors, components of the glutamatergic and&#xD;
      GABAergic metabolism and markers for the integrity of the blood brain barrier. In addition to&#xD;
      that, a genetic analysis to identify risk alleles for schizophrenia and important&#xD;
      glutamatergic and GABAergic genes will be performed. A medical history of every subject will&#xD;
      be taken, including medication, somatic and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, a row of&#xD;
      psychiatric ratings scales as well as neuropsychological and neurological tests will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini-RDoC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Form Health 36 (SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Berner Psychopathologie-Skala&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calgary Depression Rating Scale for Schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS-k)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Global Impression (CGI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (EPS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heidelberg Neurological Soft Signs Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  d2 test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every study participant must undergo an EEG measurement while different, neutral visual&#xD;
      (fixation cross or movies without sound) and auditive stimuli (tones or clic trains) will be&#xD;
      presented to them. They will be instructed to ignore the auditive stimuli. Resting state,&#xD;
      auditory steady state response (ASSR) and two different auditory mismatch paradigms will be&#xD;
      used. Without contradiction for the conduction of an MRI measurement, a combined EEG/ MRI&#xD;
      measurement and a pure MRI measurement (without EEG) using the same paradigms are intended.&#xD;
      It will also include structural (T1, T2 and diffusion tensor imaging) MRI and MR spectroscopy&#xD;
      of glutamate and GABA. All the previously mentioned examinations are planned to take place on&#xD;
      the same day with an approximate expenditure of time of five hours. If necessary, the&#xD;
      examinations may also take place on different days, providing that there will be a maximum of&#xD;
      three weeks between the first and the last measurement. Except from the blood withdrawal, we&#xD;
      intend repeating all the measurements for a second time. This repetition must take place at&#xD;
      least one day and not later than three years after the first measurement. It will not be&#xD;
      necessary to repeat the clinical and neuropsychological tests if the first testing does not&#xD;
      date back more than 6 weeks. In a second part of the study, we want to generate induced&#xD;
      pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) from 15 participants of every study group. For this&#xD;
      purpose, a further blood sample of 20 milliliters of blood must be taken. The participants of&#xD;
      the second part of the study will be selected based on special genetic, EEG or fMRI&#xD;
      characteristics revealed in the first part of the study if they agree to be contacted again.&#xD;
