  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determinate if therapeutic exercise with blood flow restriction&#xD;
      (BFR) during neoadjuvant chemotherapy potentialy neurotoxic could prevent the onset of&#xD;
      chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) comparing to usual care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CIPN is a side effect of cancer therapies that nowadays has no solution, so our intention is&#xD;
      to carry out a preventive therapy against the onset of CIPN. The nature of the studies that&#xD;
      try to prevent is very diverse, but one of the wide tools is therapeutic exercise. In this&#xD;
      case we intend to combine therapeutic exercise with BFR to obtain a pre-conditioning effect&#xD;
      that protects intraepidermal fibers from exposure to the chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported CIPN symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks (after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms across to sensory, motor and automic domains will be measured using the questionnarie the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-CIPN twenty-item scale. The total questionnaire has a score from 0 to 100, in which a higher score indicates increased symptom burden.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breast cancer quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 weeks (after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire. The total questionnaire has a score from 0 to 100, in which a higher score indicates increased quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CIPN severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks (after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by clinical version of The Total Neuropathy Score. Each item is scored from 0 to 4, with the total score ranging from 0 to 24 points; a higher score indicates greater neuropathy severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks (after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index that is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances. The global score, with a range of 0-21 points, &quot;0&quot; indicating no difficulty and &quot;21&quot; indicating severe difficulties.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks (after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Scale for Mood Assessment. The scale tries to assess four moods; anxiety, angerhostility, sadness-depression, and happiness. Itd subscale is scory from 0 to 10, a higher score in the EVEA subscales would indicate that the respondent has a higher level of sad-depressed, anxious, angryhostile, and happy mood, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain in hands and feet</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks (after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by visual analogue scale. From 0 to 10, a higher score is a worse subjective pain in hands and feet.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Touch Detection Thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks (after intervention)</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General physical functioning and mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks (after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by the 6 minutes walking test. A greater distance (meters) covered over 6 min indicates greater mobility and general functioning.</description>
