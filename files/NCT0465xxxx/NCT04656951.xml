      Daratumumab for first line treatment of transplant-ineligible myeloma patients followed by&#xD;
      daratumumab re-treatment at first relapse (GMMG-DADA)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of daratumumab added to a&#xD;
      standard induction regimen of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (VCD). A&#xD;
      secondary aim is to assess the efficacy of maintenance therapy until progression using&#xD;
      daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Thirdly the efficacy of a&#xD;
      daratumumab-containing regimen at first relapse shall be tested following a&#xD;
      daratumumab-containing first line regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VCD has been established as a standard of care for first line therapy of transplant-eligible&#xD;
      patients in Germany. The favorable toxicity profile makes this regimen also suitable for&#xD;
      transplant-ineligible patients. Daratumumab has shown to be safe and efficacious in a variety&#xD;
      of combinations such as with VMP, Vd or Rd. Using a reduced dose of cyclophosphamide the&#xD;
      study shall investigate safety and efficacy of Dara-VCD in the transplant-ineligible patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy has become standard of care in transplant-eligible and non-eligible&#xD;
      patients. However, there is uncertainty whether a single agent maintenance is sufficient or&#xD;
      whether a combination therapy is necessary. In this study the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      maintenance with daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone will be assessd&#xD;
      with a focus on MRD negativity as a novel endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multitude of treatment options at first relapse has generated the need to find an optimal&#xD;
      sequence of therapy regimens in first and second line. In particular it is unclear whether&#xD;
      the efficacy of daratumumab at relapse is affected by its prior use as part of the first line&#xD;
      treatment. Patients in this study will relapse on or after a daratumumab-containing&#xD;
      maintenance and shall receive DRd at first relapse. In the POLLUX study patients received DRd&#xD;
      but had no prior exposure to daratumumab. Therefore, patients included into the POLLUX study&#xD;
      can serve as an indirect control cohort for the present study. If in the present study the&#xD;
      PFS after DRd is similar to the PFS of the comparable cohort from the POLLUX study, the&#xD;
      assumption is supported that prior exposure to daratumumab does not impair the activity of a&#xD;
      subsequent daratumumab-containing regimen at relapse. In addition, the overall efficacy of&#xD;
      the whole protocol treatment will be assessed by analyzing PFS2 after relapse from study&#xD;
      inclusion (PFS2).&#xD;
