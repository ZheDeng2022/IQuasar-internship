    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-interventional, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study in participants&#xD;
      who have been treated with ABO-101 in a prior trial. Eligible participants will undergo&#xD;
      clinical evaluations at prespecified intervals for 3 years from the last visit in the prior&#xD;
      clinical trial (up to 5 years post-treatment).&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, noninterventional, long-term follow-up study of patients with&#xD;
      (Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB) MPS IIIB who have completed a prior clinical trial involving the&#xD;
      administration of ABO-101. This study is designed to provide LTFU in accordance with the FDA&#xD;
      and European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines for patients treated with gene therapy&#xD;
      products. The duration of the current study is 3 years for a total of up to 5 years&#xD;
      post-treatment for these participants who rollover from a prior clinical trial of ABO-101.&#xD;
      Participants will have a maximum of 5 annual scheduled visits with assessments as specified&#xD;
      in the schedule of assessments.&#xD;
