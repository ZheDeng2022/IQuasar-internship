      Background: Insomnia is a common mental problem, where people experienced difficulty falling&#xD;
      asleep, problem maintaining asleep and early morning awakening. It is highly prevalent&#xD;
      world-wide and in Hong Kong, causing significant suffering and distress. While evidence based&#xD;
      intervention exists, e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), there will not enough&#xD;
      therapists to meet treatment demand. A more efficient delivery of treatment, e.g. internet&#xD;
      based therapy is called for that can delivery treatment more cost efficiently by requiring&#xD;
      lesser therapist time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study aims at evaluating the effectiveness of CBTi (Gp) on treating Chinese&#xD;
      insomniac adults in Hong Kong. There has been criticism that most clinical trials have been&#xD;
      conducted with Caucasians in Western countries and little has been done with ethnic&#xD;
      minorities, including Asians in these countries, not to mention Asians in Asian countries,&#xD;
      e.g., Chinese in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A two-arm parallel-group randomised controlled trial, comparing the treatment and&#xD;
      waitlist group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A CBTi protocol would be developed. Approximately 60 Chinese adults with insomnia&#xD;
      will be recruited in Hong Kong and randomised into one of the two groups (treatment vs.&#xD;
      waitlist). The treatment last for 6 weeks, plus a 3-month follow-up period. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure will be Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is characterized by difficulty in initiating sleep, difficulty in maintaining sleep,&#xD;
      early morning awakening and non-restorative sleep, which should be relatively frequent (&gt;/= 3&#xD;
      times/ week), persistent (&gt;/= 2-4 weeks) and severe enough to affect daytime functioning. It&#xD;
      is among the most common mental disorders. Epidemiological surveys in Western countries found&#xD;
      a high prevalence of insomnia syndrome (9.2-13%) and insomnia symptoms (11.4% to 38%). In&#xD;
      Hong Kong, a prevalence of 11.9% was reported for community adults. Given such high&#xD;
      prevalence, insomnia is evidently one major health concern across diverse communities,&#xD;
      including Hong Kong. Furthermore, the disorder runs a chronic and debilitating course if&#xD;
      untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interrelationships between insomnia and mental health are now well established in the&#xD;
      epidemiological literature, with insomnia shown to be frequently comorbid with mental health&#xD;
      concerns, such as depression or anxiety and risk of suicide. Insomnia symptoms have&#xD;
      repeatedly been shown to increase the risk of subsequent depression. Also, it is shown that&#xD;
      augmenting an antidepressant medication with a brief, symptom focused, cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia is promising for individuals with depression and comorbid insomnia in&#xD;
      terms of alleviating both depression and insomnia. It is clear that insomnia is not only a&#xD;
      disorder of high personal suffering, but is also associated with high and recurring societal&#xD;
      costs. These facts strongly argue for the need of effective treatments to relieve personal&#xD;
      suffering, caring burdens, and societal economic costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fortunately, there are effective treatments available for insomnia, particularly&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). In a number of meta-analysis of insomnia treatments, CBT&#xD;
      is effective and consistently performs better than placebo and other control conditions in&#xD;
      improving nighttime insomnia symptoms, including sleep latency, total sleep time, wake after&#xD;
      sleep onset, and insomnia symptoms. CBT for insomnia (CBTi) packages include stimulus&#xD;
      control, relaxation, sleep restriction and their combination meet APA criteria for&#xD;
      empirically validated treatment for insomnia based on the strength of results from a number&#xD;
      of empirical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, while effective psychological treatments exist, there is only limited manpower&#xD;
      to provide the intervention. Western studies showed that 15-25% of children and adults were&#xD;
      suffering from mental health disorders, but only 20-30% of them had access to treatment.&#xD;
      Locally in Hong Kong, we are facing an almost identical situation. About 15% of children and&#xD;
      adults suffered from mental health disorders, but again only 15-30% of them had access to&#xD;
      mental health services. Obviously, a shortage of mental health professionals such as&#xD;
      psychiatrists or clinical psychologists is a worldwide phenomenon. In Hong Kong, our&#xD;
      situation regarding the availability of clinical psychologists (CPs) in providing&#xD;
      psychological treatment is even worse. We have a ratio of approximately 1 CP to 18,000 in the&#xD;
      Hong Kong population, far below the ratio of 1 in 3,500 in the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most governments, including those of richer countries like USA, will admit that they will&#xD;
      never have the resources to increase the number of mental health professionals like&#xD;
      psychiatrists and CPs to meet the societal demand. Instead, a more viable solution is to look&#xD;
      for greater cost-efficiency in delivering services. Recent meta-analyses find the&#xD;
      effectiveness of group psychological treatment (mostly CBT) for insomnia as largely&#xD;
      comparable to that of traditional one on one therapy. Group therapy is thus advocated as a&#xD;
      less-intensive, cost-effective way to offer evidence-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on Morin, we developed a treatment protocol for CBTi, incorporating both education and&#xD;
      individualized feedback. The protocol implements all of the key procedures in one-on-one CBTi&#xD;
      such as sleep restriction, stimulus control, managing dysfunctional beliefs about sleep,&#xD;
      behavioural experiments, increasing energizing behaviours, all of which target the&#xD;
      maintaining factors of insomnia. Patients would be assigned a therapist to follow up on them&#xD;
      via either brief (5-10 minutes) telephone calls. Compared to traditional face to face CBTi,&#xD;
      the protocol requires 32% of the therapist's time of the latter, i.e., a 68% drop in the&#xD;
      therapist's time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of study in the effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia&#xD;
      in Hong Kong Chinese, let alone CBTi in group. This proposal aims at developing a CBTi&#xD;
      protocol for treatment of insomnia in Hong Kong to increase the access of evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment to local Chinese insomnia adults. This involves protocol development, test-run and&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a waitlist control group and a short-term follow-up&#xD;
      of three months.&#xD;
