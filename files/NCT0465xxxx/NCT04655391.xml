      This phase Ib trial evaluates the best dose and effect of glasdegib in combination with&#xD;
      venetoclax and decitabine, or gilteritinib, bosutinib, ivosidenib, or enasidenib in treating&#xD;
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back (relapsed) after stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. Chemotherapy drugs, such as venetoclax and decitabine, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Glasdegib, bosutinib, ivosidenib, and&#xD;
      enasidenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Glasdegib inhibits the Sonic the Hedgehog gene. Venetoclax inhibits BCL-2 gene.&#xD;
      Bosutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits BCR-ABL gene fusion. Ivosidenib&#xD;
      inhibits isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 gene or IDH-1. Enasidenib inhibits isocitrate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase-2 gene or IDH-2. This study involves an individualized approach that may allow&#xD;
      doctors and researchers to more accurately predict which treatment plan works best for&#xD;
      patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      1 hour on days 1-5, and venetoclax PO QD on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up&#xD;
      to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;

      days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHAPTER 3: Patients receive glasdegib PO QD and bosutinib monohydrate (bosutinib) PO QD on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHAPTER 4: Patients receive glasdegib PO QD and ivosidenib PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHAPTER 5: Patients receive glasdegib PO QD and enasidenib mesylate (enasidenib) PO QD on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

    <description>Measured by limiting dilution and engraftment into non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency gamma severely immunocompromised mice. Graphical statistics will be used. To assess the association between the LSC reduction and the response to the treatment, the median change from baseline to post-treatment (2 cycles) in engraftment levels of secondary mice recipients (n=12 mice/patient, 6 females and 6 males) will be compared by two-sample t test between response and non-response patient groups as LSC donors, across all treatment arms. The effect of treatment on the target genes will be assessed for each arm by linear mixed models (pre- versus multiple post-treatment time points) as well.</description>
