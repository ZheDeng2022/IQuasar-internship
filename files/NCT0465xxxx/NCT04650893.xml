      This study is to assess the efficacy of intraoperative intravenous nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug (ketorolac) versus intravenous (dexamethosone) administration on&#xD;
      dysphagia and dysphonia after ACDF.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of two intraoperative, intravenous&#xD;
      medications on dysphagia and dysophonia following anterior cervical discectomy and&#xD;
      fusion(ACDF). The medications include Ketorolac, an anti-inflammatory versus dexamethasone, a&#xD;
      corticosteroid. Eligibility criteria includes adults aged 19 years of age or older who are&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo a ACDF for radiculopathy or myelopathy by Drs. Cornett and Vincent at&#xD;
      Nebraska Medicine. Subjects will be recruited for a prospective, randomzed, single-blinded&#xD;
      clinical drug study and randomized into three cohorts: (1) control (no steroid or&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), (2) IV NSAID(1-time dose of 30mg of IV Ketorolac at&#xD;
      time of closure), and (3) IV steroid (1-time dose of 10mg of IV dexamethasone at the time of&#xD;
      closure. The primary outcome measures are patient questionnaires which include the EAT-10 and&#xD;
      Bazaz classification for dysphagia and VHI-10 for dysphonia. In addition, the Neck Disability&#xD;
      Index (NDI) and Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) will also be collected. Research follow-up&#xD;
      will be subject completed questionnaires to be collected pre-operatively and then post&#xD;
      operation at day 1, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Post operative&#xD;
      questionnaires may be collected at time of patient follow-up in clinic, by phone or mail.&#xD;
