    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patient's own Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGMs)&#xD;
      worn in the non-ICU hospital setting have adequate accuracy for blood glucose monitoring when&#xD;
      compared to point-of-care (POC) capillary glucose measurement, and to determine if alerts&#xD;
      given by CGMs worn in the non-ICU hospital would prevent episodes of hyperglycemia and&#xD;
      hypoglycemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients admitted to the hospital in inpatient or observation status and having a&#xD;
      Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGMs) attached will be screened and identified by providers and&#xD;
      nurses. An order will be placed by providers to continue patient's home CGM use in the&#xD;
      hospital. &quot;CGM patient agreement&quot; describing the hospital policy for use of CGMs will be&#xD;
      provided to the patient for signature. Patients will be encouraged to continue to wear their&#xD;
      CGMs in the hospital unless their presence interferes with patients' medical care. CGM&#xD;
      presence will be recorded by nursing in patient chart under LDA (lines, drains, airway)&#xD;
      section. Patients will be approached by the research staff and will be offered enrollment in&#xD;
      the study. A research consent will be reviewed with patients and will be provided for&#xD;
      signature. Patients will be asked to continue to use their home CGMs in the hospital. If CGM&#xD;
      sensor will reach the end of life, patients have the option to place a new sensor and to&#xD;
      follow manufacturer recommendations for calibration and setting. Patients are responsible to&#xD;
      provide their own sensors, transmitters and readers during the hospitalization period. If it&#xD;
      is determined that the current sensor will interfere with hospital medical and surgical care&#xD;
      (MRI testing, procedure at the site), patients will be asked to remove the CGM sensor and&#xD;
      transmitter. Patients will have the option to replace the sensor after the procedure if they&#xD;
      so desire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to monitor their glucose level via CGM. For flash sensors, patients&#xD;
      will be asked to scan their sensor at least every 8 and as needed. CGMs that require&#xD;
      calibration will be calibrated by the patients using hospital glucometer readings. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients alerted by their CGM about low glucose levels or fast downward or upward trending&#xD;
      will have to notify their nursing staff. A POC blood glucose check will be done by nursing&#xD;
      staff to confirm the alert or the trend. Treatment decisions will be made based on POC&#xD;
      readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During hospitalization patients will continue to have their blood glucose checked with POC&#xD;
      glucometers per hospital policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of diabetes and the associated complications, dosing of insulin, change from PO to&#xD;
      insulin treatment and back to PO medications during hospitalization or at discharge will be&#xD;
      done by the admitting team with help from the inpatient Endocrinology Consultation Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decisions about insulin dosing or other diabetes treatments will be made based on hospital&#xD;
      glucometer readings, and not based on CGM readings alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to give the research team &quot;provider access&quot; to their cloud CGM&#xD;
      software, or to allow the team to download their CGM data prior to discharge if their reading&#xD;
      devices do not automatically synchronize with the cloud software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGM data will be compared with POC glucometer readings obtained in the hospital at&#xD;
      approximately the same time. Different patient variables (demographics, comorbidities, labs&#xD;
      and vitals, administered medications) will be collected from electronic health record and&#xD;
      will be evaluated to determine if they interfere with CGM readings. The accuracy of CGM for&#xD;
      glucose measurement in the hospital will be calculated.&#xD;
