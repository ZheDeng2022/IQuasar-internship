      With 0.9% sodium chloride injection as a placebo control, to evaluate the effectiveness and&#xD;

      Clinically common non-systemic anesthesia mainly includes surface anesthesia, local immersion&#xD;
      anesthesia, nerve block, regional blocking, intravertebral anesthesia. Patients under&#xD;
      non-general anesthesia surgery, is still in a more sober state, easily due to external&#xD;
      factors and increase the psychological and mental burden, even if the ideal anaesthetic&#xD;
      effect can be achieved, but for autonomic nerve activities can not be completely and&#xD;
      effectively eliminated. Hydrochloric acid right-metomidine is an alpha2-adrenaline receptor&#xD;
      agonisant developed by Orion Pharma (Finland) and Abott (Usa) in collaboration. Unlike other&#xD;
      sedative hypnotic sedatives, hydrochloric acid right metamine produces a sedative hypnotic&#xD;
      effect by acting on the blue spot nuclear alpha2 receptor and the inflammatory endogenous&#xD;
      sleep-stimulating pathway, allowing the patient to maintain a natural sleep state of non-fast&#xD;
      eye III, which is characterized by the patient being stimulated or speech-altered, and does&#xD;
      not produce respiratory inhibition during sedative hypnosis. In addition to the sedative&#xD;
      effect, the right metomisurein also has anti-anxiety, reduce stress response, stable&#xD;
      hemodynamics, analgesic, inhibitsalival secretion, anti-cold and diuretic function, and other&#xD;
      sedative analgesic drugs when used with good synergy, can significantly reduce the use of&#xD;
      other sedative analgesic drugs.&#xD;

    <description>At least 15 minutes before anesthesia, the study drug was given sedation according to the dosing schedule. At the end of the loading dose of the study drug, an alertness/sedation score (OAA/S) was performed, and then it entered the maintenance dosing phase, which was performed every 5 minutes until the end of the operation OAA/S score. OAA/S≤4 means that the required level of sedation has been reached, and anesthesia can be performed after starting the study drug for ≥15 minutes and reaching the required level of sedation. During the administration of the study drug, OAA/S ≤4 should always be maintained.</description>
