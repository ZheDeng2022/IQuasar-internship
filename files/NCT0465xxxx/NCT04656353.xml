  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an online psychosocial self-help&#xD;
      program for Chinese immigrant women with breast cancer, by comparing Chinese immigrant women&#xD;
      who receive the online psychosocial program and those who do not receive the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to understand if this online psychosocial program is effective in&#xD;
      helping Chinese immigrant women to feel more supported, understand that the distress is&#xD;
      normal, engage in self-care activities, become aware of the community resources, feel more&#xD;
      confident about returning to a normal life, and feel less distress overall as they return to&#xD;
      life after treatment. This information will help us to better understand these Chinese&#xD;
      immigrant women's needs and concerns and plan future growth of the program to meet their&#xD;
      personal, cultural, and language needs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted over a two-year period at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre&#xD;
      (PM), University Health Network and Markham Stouffville Hospital (MSH) with PM as&#xD;
      lead/coordinating site. The mixed-methods study design will include a longitudinal survey and&#xD;
      a focus group component. Quantitative assessments will be conducted at three time periods:&#xD;
      pre-intervention (T0), within 2 weeks post-intervention (T1), and three months&#xD;
      post-intervention (T2). Two small focus groups will be conducted to deepen the understanding&#xD;
      of the participants', who received the online psychosocial program, experience of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online psychosocial self-help program (www.asianbrcarecovery.ca) website is hosted with&#xD;
      University Health Network Digital, build on the SharePoint 2013 Platform. The website is an&#xD;
      anonymous website with open access to the general public, including Control Group&#xD;
      participants. They may come across the online psychosocial program if they search the&#xD;
      internet for information. A question was included in the Control Group 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaire to track if the participants found and used the website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment. Recruitment will be conducted by a research assistant (RA) who is fluent in&#xD;
      English and Chinese either in-person or by telephone. The oncologist will approach each&#xD;
      patient coming to the hospital for treatment or from virtual visits using hospital approved&#xD;
      Ontario Telemedicine Network and introduce the study. If the participant is interested to&#xD;
      hear more about the study, the oncologist will ask for the participant's consent to release&#xD;
      her contact information to the RA. The RA will contact the participant and explain the nature&#xD;
      and demands of the study, go through the informed consent form with her, and answer any&#xD;
      questions. If the participant agrees to participate, written informed consent, Participant&#xD;
      Demographics questionnaire, and baseline distress survey (T0) will be mailed to the&#xD;
      participant with a return self-addressed stamped envelope prior to randomization. The two&#xD;
      community partners (South Riverdale Community Health Center and Senior Persons Living&#xD;
      Connected) will also help with identifying participants. The group leaders at the monthly&#xD;
      Chinese cancer psychoeducational groups will introduce the study and if the participant is&#xD;
      interested, they will ask for the participant's consent to have her contact information&#xD;
      provided to the RA. The recruitment process will remain the same. The participant will be&#xD;
      asked to complete these documents in two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the online psychosocial intervention&#xD;
      (INT) or the standard care control group (CTL) by using a list of randomly generated numbers&#xD;
      (www. Random.org): when a participant is enrolled, she will be assigned the next consecutive&#xD;
      number in the list. Participants receiving an odd number will be assigned to the CTL&#xD;
      condition, and those receiving an even number will be assigned to the INT condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Arm. Following the receipt of completed baseline (T0) questionnaires, the&#xD;
      participants randomized to the INT group will be provided with the website link to the online&#xD;
      psychosocial program and a questionnaire and a distress survey. They will be asked to use the&#xD;
      website within two weeks and then complete the questionnaire and distress survey after using&#xD;
      it (T1) and mail them back in a self-addressed stamped envelope. The RA will call&#xD;
      participants with a reminder if completed questionnaires have not been received by the third&#xD;
      week. The questionnaire and survey will be administered at the 3-month follow-up period (T2)&#xD;
      either at a participant's clinic visit or by mail, and the participant will be given two&#xD;
      weeks to complete and return it in a self-addressed stamped envelope. A reminder call will be&#xD;
      made after the two-week period. The questionnaires will take about 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INT participants will also be asked in the 3-month follow-up questionnaire if they are&#xD;
      interested in attending a focus group to elaborate on their experience with the psychosocial&#xD;
      self-help program. For those who have expressed an interest will be contacted. The focus&#xD;
      groups will last about 1-1.5 hours and consist of 3-4 participants; the small group size will&#xD;
      afford more focused solicitation of the primary outcomes. Focus groups will be audio-taped&#xD;
      and conducted in either English or Chinese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group. Participants randomized to the CTL group will receive standard care. At the&#xD;
      two weeks following randomization (T1) and the 3-month follow-up periods (T2), the RA will&#xD;
      mail the questionnaire and distress survey for completion. Participants will be given two&#xD;
      weeks to complete the questionnaire and distress survey. A self-addressed stamped envelope&#xD;
      will be provided to mail them back. A reminder call will be made after the two-week period.&#xD;
      The questionnaire and distress survey will be administered at the 3-month follow-up period&#xD;
      (T2) either at the participant's clinic visit or by mail. The questionnaires will take about&#xD;
      10 minutes to complete. Once the 3-month follow-up package is received, each participant will&#xD;
      be provided with the website link to view the self-help program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection. Quantitative data will be collected with a pre/post measure of emotional&#xD;
      distress (anxiety and depression), questionnaires, and website analytics (e.g., number of&#xD;
      visits to the website per individual). All measures used in the study will be available in&#xD;
      both English and Chinese (traditional and simplified versions), and participants will be&#xD;
      asked about their language preference. Qualitative data will be collected from two small&#xD;
      focus groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures. Socio-demographic and medical information will be collected with a self-report&#xD;
      information form (Patient Demographics questionnaire) created by the research team. Any study&#xD;
      materials that are in English (i.e., consent forms, socio-demographic information form, and&#xD;
      questionnaires) will be professionally translated to Chinese (simplified and traditional), to&#xD;
      accommodate the diversity in the Chinese population. The translated documents will be&#xD;
      reviewed by the Chinese members of the team and recommendations made until acceptable&#xD;
      Chinese-translated versions are agreed upon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis. Data will be analyzed using SPSS version 25. Participant&#xD;
      characteristics and baseline outcome measures will be summarized using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics. The equivalence of groups at baseline on basic demographic and medical variables&#xD;
      will be assessed using independent t-tests and chi-square tests, and variables demonstrating&#xD;
      any significant group differences (p&lt;.05) will be included as covariates in the primary&#xD;
      analyses. A data dictionary will be created containing detailed descriptions of each variable&#xD;
      and coding information. Data checks will be verified by the study investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of the online self-help program, the main and interaction effects of&#xD;
      treatment group (INT and CTL) and time (T0, T1, and T2) on each of the primary outcomes will&#xD;
      be examined using separate mixed ANCOVA models, controlling for any empirically identified&#xD;
      covariates. Hedges' g and associated confidence intervals will be calculated to estimate&#xD;
      effect sizes both over time (within groups) and between groups. Alpha will be set at 0.05,&#xD;
      and probability values will be two-tailed. Missing data will be evaluated on a case-by-case&#xD;
      basis such that drop-outs will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Data Analysis. Focus group interviews will be transcribed verbatim. Content&#xD;
      analysis will be used to analyze focus group transcripts and identify categories and themes.&#xD;
      Constant comparison will be undertaken by staying close to the data, identifying negative&#xD;
      cases, and comparing themes and patterns. NVivo 10 will be used for data management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small honorarium will be provided to each participant at every single time period they&#xD;
      complete the measures to compensate for the time taken to participate. Similarly, a small&#xD;
      honorarium will be provided to the participants attending the focus groups to compensate them&#xD;
      for their time and transportation expenses.&#xD;
