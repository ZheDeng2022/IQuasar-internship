  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will involve performing a series of medical imaging procedures of the&#xD;
      abdomen using both ultrasound and MRI modalities in subjects at risk for or already diagnosed&#xD;
      with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The primary objective of this clinical study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the clinical feasibility of an investigational ultrasound technique for&#xD;
      quantifying liver fat by comparing specific ultrasound-derived biomarkers with the liver fat&#xD;
      percentage obtained from MRI Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF) measurements. All&#xD;
      subjects enrolled in this study will undergo two investigational abdominal ultrasound&#xD;
      examinations using the Philips EPIQ Ultrasound System and one MRI PDFF examination according&#xD;
      to the clinical standard of care.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of hepatotoxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of chronic liver disease (e.g., viral, cholestatic, or autoimmune).&#xD;
