      The pre- and post-operative functional assessment of patients' knees is of great interest for&#xD;
      the practitioner, whether it is in his or her daily practice to determine the appropriate&#xD;
      management of the patient, or to conduct clinical studies. The scores used are established in&#xD;
      several languages to provide a uniformly accepted unit of measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large number of functional knee scores already exist. These include scores for&#xD;
      Lysholm-Tegner, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Knee injury and&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), but these can be difficult to apply in practice. daily&#xD;
      due to their length, which may be too time-consuming for the clinician when consultations for&#xD;
      example.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder surgeons are familiar with the Simple Shoulder Value (SSV) score, which simply&#xD;
      consists of asking the patient how much they value their shoulder on the day of the exam,&#xD;
      compared to a normal shoulder in percentage terms. It has been shown to produce results that&#xD;
      are close to Constant score or Rowe and American Shoulder Score and Elbow score Surgeons&#xD;
      Score after shoulder surgery. It is, since its description, very much used in daily practice&#xD;
      by shoulder surgeons because of its speed and simplicity of execution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No such assessment exists to our knowledge for the knee. The validation of a score of this&#xD;
      type for the knee joint would allow the use of a new practical tool for a better patient&#xD;
      management while saving the practitioner and the patient money. time in consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to propose a functional knee score similar to the ISS for the&#xD;
      shoulder that would allow a self-assessment of the condition of a knee, compared to a normal&#xD;
      knee in percentage terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the SKV (Simple Knee Value) is a valid score giving results of&#xD;
      equivalent to the various scores already used in the functional assessment of the knee in the&#xD;
      different pathological situations in adult and paediatric populations&#xD;
