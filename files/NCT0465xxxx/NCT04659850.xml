  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of processed foods particularly those high in protein and based on whey protein are&#xD;
      high in advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs are the result of a chemical reaction&#xD;
      between mainly sugar and protein when they are heated together (known as the Maillard&#xD;
      reaction). Whey protein is routinely derived via high temperature processing methods which&#xD;
      produce AGEs. AGEs are absorbed during digestion and high circulating concentrations of AGEs&#xD;
      are associated with adverse health effects such as dementia and the metabolic syndrome. In&#xD;
      this study we aim to firstly ascertain the habitual level of AGE intake in the diet via a&#xD;
      dietary questionnaire and equate this to both metabolic health and cognition at baseline.&#xD;
      Volunteers will then be given a milkshake with either a high or low AGE content on either a&#xD;
      high or low fat background. AGEs are usually ingested as part of a processed food diet which&#xD;
      can be high in fat and it is necessary to separate the effects of these two food types. We&#xD;
      will test these effects in a young and older group of volunteers with low and higher levels&#xD;
      of circulating AGEs respectively. Circulating levels of hormones, glucose and lipids in the&#xD;
      blood will be measured as indicators of metabolic health. Cognitive tests will be carried out&#xD;
      to assess the impact of AGEs on episodic memory.&#xD;

      This study will be a short-term, randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial. Volunteers will&#xD;
      be younger (18-30 years) and older (55-75 years) men and women, normal and overweight (BMI&gt;19&#xD;
      to 29.9). N=24 in each age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical screening for all study volunteers and neuropsychological screening will be carried&#xD;
      out prior to study start. A small, pin prick, fasted blood sample will be taken to measure&#xD;
      glucose and HbA1C levels to rule out type 2 diabetics. Anthropometric and body composition&#xD;
      measurements will also be taken. Body weight and height will be measured using a scale and a&#xD;
      stadiometer to the nearest 0.5 kg and 0.5 cm, respectively. Waist and hip circumferences will&#xD;
      be measured and the waist-to-hip ratio calculated. Standard procedures will be followed for&#xD;
      the anthropometric measurements and the average of three measurements taken.&#xD;
      Neuropsychological screening may be repeated on another day if volunteers are borderline on&#xD;
      their first visit as scores may vary by a couple of points depending on external events i.e.&#xD;
      vounteers are having a bad day. Experienced staff will carry out abdominal fat measurements&#xD;
      by manual determination of the area between the upper surface of the second lumbar vertebra,&#xD;
      the lower surface of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and the lateral margins of the outer rib&#xD;
      cage. If the Viscan is available we will use that to measure abdominal fat. Venous blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected as appropriate for the hormones and metabolites to be tested and&#xD;
      stored at -70 Â°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day prior to the challenge volunteers will visit the Human Nutrition Unit (HNU, RINH).&#xD;
      They will be given a low AGE breakfast and be supplied with a low AGE lunch and dinner for&#xD;
      that day and instructed not to consume anything else. After an overnight fast volunteers will&#xD;
      receive a one-off dose of either high AGE (11.4 mgs) or low AGE (2.4 mgs) whey protein&#xD;
      delivered in a either a low or high fat milkshake (400ml) blended with flavours and a&#xD;
      consistent quantity of sugar. All ingredients will be commercially available and of food&#xD;
      grade. Apart from differences in fat and AGE the content of shakes will be closely balanced&#xD;
      for sugar and other components. All participants will be asked to answer two questionnaires&#xD;
      one to determine their habitual intake of dietary AGEs and one to determine their level of&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different milkshakes will be tested with a minimum 7 day wash out period between tests.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be randomised to each test group. After a 12 h overnight fast and a&#xD;
      standardised intake the day prior to the tests, and no strenuous physical activity for 2 days&#xD;
      previously, subjects will attend the HNU. Volunteers will be requested to provide a small&#xD;
      urine sample for AGE analysis. An intravenous catheter will then be placed in an antecubital&#xD;
      vein and flushed with saline between aspirations to keep the catheter clear. After a short&#xD;
      resting period, a blood sample will be taken prior to the first memory test then a single&#xD;
      milkshake will be consumed under supervision. Blood samples will be taken immediately before&#xD;
      the milkshake ingestion (0 min) and after 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 and 240 min. Further&#xD;
      computer based memory tests will be carried out at 30, 90 and 240 minutes. A urine sample&#xD;
      will be requested at the end of the study before participants are offered lunch. Memory tests&#xD;
      have been designed by Dr Ros Langston (University of Dundee) and Dr Kevin Allan, School of&#xD;
      Psychology and will be carried out on lap tops specifically designated for this study. Blood&#xD;
      and urine will be analysed for AGEs. Blood will also be analysed for glucose lipids and&#xD;
      hormones. Dr Janice Drew will also analyse blood samples for gene expression of the&#xD;
      SIRT-1/NAD+ complex indicative of the response of individuals to dietary challenge.&#xD;
