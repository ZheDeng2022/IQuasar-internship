  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pyelonephritis is important to recognize and treat quickly. Today the diagnosis is&#xD;
      primarily clinical and often challenging. Sometimes acute pyelonephritis is complicated by&#xD;
      obstruction leading to hydronephrosis. The aim of this study is to investigate whether&#xD;
      ultrasound scanning conducted by a radiologist can diagnose acute pyelonephritis. Also, the&#xD;
      investigators will investigate whether health care professionals with basic ultrasound skills&#xD;
      can diagnose hydronephrosis by point-of-care ultrasound scanning in patients suspected of&#xD;
      acute pyelonephritis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is an acute infection in the upper urinary tract, which quite&#xD;
      frequently is seen in emergency departments (ED). Most often, an infection of the bladder&#xD;
      ascends to the kidneys causing APN. In rarer cases, APN occurs because of a hematogenous&#xD;
      spread of bacteria. It is important to identify and treat APN quickly to prevent progression&#xD;
      to sepsis, renal failure and ultimately death. Today, primarily APN diagnosis consists of a&#xD;
      clinical identification. This is often supported by unspecific blood and urine tests such as&#xD;
      C reactive protein (CRP) and leucocytes and urine dipstick. A positive urine culture verifies&#xD;
      the APN diagnosis. This diagnostic process is challenging as frequently symptoms are weak and&#xD;
      atypical and there is a waiting period for unspecific diagnostic methods and culture results.&#xD;
      Complicating an APN diagnosis is asymptomatic bacteriuria, a confusing condition, common in&#xD;
      the elderly. Therefore, the empirical treatment initiated often treats a potentially wide&#xD;
      range of infections including APN. Currently, the Danish ED do not use diagnostic imaging to&#xD;
      confirm APN. Ultrasound scanning (US) by a radiologist rules out other complicating factors&#xD;
      such as obstruction or renal abscess. Further imaging is reserved for complicated cases with&#xD;
      no response to the initial treatment. Both Computed Tomography (CT) scanning and Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) can visualize inflammation in the kidneys. Generally, CT is&#xD;
      considered the optimal imaging modality in complicated APN cases. The radiation dose-related&#xD;
      to a CT must be considered if this imaging technique is to be used as a primary diagnostic&#xD;
      tool. MRI appears to be equally or more satisfactory in identifying the inflammatory changes&#xD;
      related to APN. However, this investigative tool is more expensive and time-consuming, and&#xD;
      often not readily available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound (US) has a lot of advantages in an acute medical setting. It can be utilised at&#xD;
      the bedside and is a gentle technique. Conventional grayscale US is not ideal when trying to&#xD;
      identify APN. However, more specialized US techniques increase the diagnostic value of US.&#xD;
      These techniques include the Doppler US and the contrast-enhanced US (CEUS). Studies suggest&#xD;
      that CEUS can identify APN equally to contrast-enhanced CT. Therefore, US has the potential&#xD;
      to become relevant in the investigation of patients with a suspected kidney infection in the&#xD;
      ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate whether additional diagnostic imaging, in particular US, of&#xD;
      patients admitted to the ED with suspected APN will assist in a more reliable diagnosis.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it will investigate if point-of-care US of the kidneys by an investigator with&#xD;
      basic US skill can assist a more rapid recognition of hydronephrosis in APN patients with&#xD;
      complicating obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will invite patients admitted with suspected APN to participate in this&#xD;
      study, which will include three additional scans. The first is a point of care US of the&#xD;
      kidneys by a study assistant to assess the presence or absence of hydronephrosis. The second&#xD;
      is a US by a specialist from the Radiology Department using both Doppler US and CEUS. The&#xD;
      third scan is a reference standard MRI of the kidneys at the Radiology Department. This will&#xD;
      be performed at a similar time (or as close as possible) to the radiologist US. The MRI will&#xD;
      be conducted on a 1,5 T MRI scanner and include the following sequences: planning, Dixon, T1&#xD;
      mapping, T2, T2 mapping, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (100, 400, 800), MRI angio (3D&#xD;
      VIBE), and Phase Contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These additional imaging findings will be evaluated in relation to the clinical findings.&#xD;

        Participants will be included among patients admitted at the ED of three Danish hospitals&#xD;
        in the Region of Southern Denmark: the ED in Kolding, Lillebælt Hospital, the ED in&#xD;
        Aabenraa, Hospital Sønderjylland, and the ED in Odense, Odense University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A Danish ED corresponds to an acute medical ward. Either a general practitioner or a&#xD;
        prehospital emergency medical service refers patients visiting a Danish ED, or patients get&#xD;
        admitted because they called the emergency centre telephone number (1-1-2).&#xD;
