  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the need and potential benefits of the wide field of view&#xD;
      during general and gynecology laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tremendous popularity of the laparoscopic surgeries is balanced with its tradeoffs - the&#xD;
      needs for an excellent intracavitary visualization along with a surgeon skill set capable of&#xD;
      performing these, often more technically challenging procedures. Image quality has improved,&#xD;
      but there are still various restrictions to images captured by the lens at the tip of a long&#xD;
      tubular laparoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      270Surgical developed a 270 degree angle scope to overcome these unmet needs and improve the&#xD;
      image quantity and extent during laparoscopy. The study will evaluate standard laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery using the 270Surgical system; &quot;The SurroundScope&quot;.&#xD;
