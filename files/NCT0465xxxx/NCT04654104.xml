      The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms underlying the complex interaction&#xD;
      between Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Therefore, in order to&#xD;
      identify a possible role of immune checkpoints not only in the susceptibility to COPD&#xD;
      development but also in its evolution towards lung cancer, will be evaluate the correlation&#xD;
      between PD-L1 expression and cigarette smoke exposure in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are many epidemiological studies highlighting the interconnections between&#xD;
      COPD and lung cancer and the influence of cigarette smoke, the molecular bases of this&#xD;
      association are less well defined. Initially they were thought to be driven just by innate&#xD;
      inflammation, however, recent studies have also demonstrated the influence of the adaptive&#xD;
      immune system. Despite this, the role of immune checkpoints in chronic lung inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases such as COPD is less well understood. COPD is currently the 4th leading cause of&#xD;
      death worldwide but is assessed to be the 3rd by the end of 2020 resulting in an economic and&#xD;
      social burden that is in continuous progression.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from from the outpatient clinics of the Pulmonary and Critical&#xD;
      Care Medicine department of &quot;Mauro Scarlato&quot; Hospital in Scafati, Italy in collaboration with&#xD;
      the Operational Unit of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacovigilance of Catanzaro University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      171 patients will be divided according to the results of the anatomopathological examinations&#xD;
      into four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy never smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smokers with normal lung&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COPD (COPD group was divided in two subgroups: GOLD 1-2 group and GOLD 3-4 group).&#xD;

        The levels of PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 will be evaluated by immunofluorescence and by RT-PCR&#xD;
        on biopsy samples, which will be taken according to normal clinical practice. The&#xD;
        checkpoint levels will be assessed before and after exposure after a medium of smoke also&#xD;
        in the macrophages extracted from the BAL, which will be collected according to normal&#xD;
        clinical practice, by RT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The aforementioned experiments will be carried out at the Pharmacology Section of the&#xD;
        Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, their cost&#xD;
        will not be borne by the NHS but will be fully borne by the aforementioned University.&#xD;
