  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the SIRTCI study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy (XELOX: Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin), anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      (Bevacizumab), SIRT (TheraSphere®) and ICI (Atezolizumab) in patients with CRC with&#xD;
      predominant liver metastases. SIRTCI is a single-arm, prospective, multi-centre phase II&#xD;
      study. The main inclusion criteria are patients with MSS mRCC with predominantly non-operable&#xD;
      liver metastases and measurable disease. Patients with extra-hepatic metastases can be&#xD;
      included since the objective of the study is to induce local and abscopal effects of&#xD;
      radiotherapy combined with ICI by stimulating the anti-tumour immune response to destroy both&#xD;
      hepatic and extra-hepatic metastases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 50% of patients with CRC will develop a metastatic disease. Majority of patients have&#xD;
      unresectable disease and unresectable liver-dominant disease represents 25% of all mCRC.&#xD;
      Morbidity and mortality in patients with mCRC are mainly due to unresectable liver&#xD;
      metastases. In this setting, chemotherapy (doublet or triplet) plus biological agent remains&#xD;
      the standard of care since no prospective randomized trial demonstrates the efficacy of local&#xD;
      treatments (chemoembolization or hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy). Actually median PFS&#xD;
      in patients with unresectable liver-dominant mCRC is range between 9 to 12 months and more&#xD;
      effective treatments must be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICI are to date ineffective in pMMR mCRC due to low level of tumor mutational load.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, radiation induces an immunogenic cell death able to convert a &quot;nonimmunogenic&quot;&#xD;
      neoplasm into an &quot;immunogenic&quot; neoplasm. In patients with liver-dominant mCRC SIRT has not&#xD;
      shown survival improvement but only delayed disease progression in the liver. ICI improve&#xD;
      efficacy of radiation both in irradiated lesions and non-irradiated lesions (abscopal&#xD;
      effect). One explanation of the absence of PFS improvement with SIRT in first-line setting&#xD;
      could be the progression of the extra-hepatic disease. Indeed, the rationale of SIRTCI 01 is&#xD;
      to combine SIRT and ICI to induce an immune response and an abscopal effect against mCRC in&#xD;
      order to improve control of hepatic disease (increase local SIRT efficacy with ICI) and&#xD;
      extra-hepatic disease (increase abscopal effects of SIRT with ICI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is therefore to demonstrate the synergistic anti-tumor efficacy of SIRT&#xD;
      and ICI in patients with unresectable liver-dominant mCRC. Primary endpoint is PFS at 9&#xD;
      months. Main secondary endpoints are safety, response rate and OS. In addition, exploratory&#xD;
      biomarker analyses will be performed in order to identify predictive factors of SIRT plus ICI&#xD;
      efficacy. No safety issue was observed with XELOX/bevacizumab/atezolizumab and&#xD;
      SIRT/FOLFOX/bevacizumab then the combination evaluated in SIRTCI 01 should be safe. Moreover&#xD;
      oxaliplatin dose is decreased before SIRT treatment and bevacizumab is added only after SIRT&#xD;
      treatment. All well-known predictive biomarkers of chemotherapy (mutational status,&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA) and ICI (tumor mutational load, immune response) efficacy will be&#xD;
      analyzed. Additionally, pharmacokinetic analyses of Atezolizumab and centralized imaging&#xD;
      review will be performed to evaluate morphologic and metabolic predictive markers (CT-scan,&#xD;
      MRI, FDG PET/CT and Y90 PET/CT) of SIRT plus ICI efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first one to use SIRT in order to induce immunogenic cell death and&#xD;
      sensitivity to ICI. Combination of SIRT and ICI could increase immune abscopal anti-tumor&#xD;
      effects of radiation. Indeed, once activated in one place (liver), the immune system can&#xD;
      attack tumor lesions anywhere else in the body (lung, peritoneum…) through this abscopal&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIRTCI 01 will provide informations on efficacy and safety of SIRT, ICI and chemotherapy&#xD;
      combination in patients with unresectable liver-dominant mCRC. SIRT plus chemotherapy as well&#xD;
      as chemotherapy plus ICI are well tolerated. TheraSphere® will be administered 3 or 4 days&#xD;
      after cycle 2 or 3 of chemotherapy with adaptation of chemotherapy doses. Moreover, an&#xD;
      interim analysis is planned to access efficacy of the strategy (first step after 22 evaluable&#xD;
      patients included). At the time of the interim analysis, a complete review of the toxicities&#xD;
      will be done to check the safety of the strategy and an independent data monitoring committee&#xD;
      will monitor in real time all severe adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFS at 9 months has been chosen as primary endpoint because it is a surrogate marker of OS.&#xD;
      Actually median PFS in first-line setting with a doublet plus a biological agent is range&#xD;
      from 8 to 11 months in unresectable mCRC and 9 to 12 months in unresectable liver-dominant&#xD;
      mCRC, corresponding to a PFS of 50%-60% at 9 months. PFS is more reliable than response rate&#xD;
      at 2-3 months given that the treatments used can induce tumor necrosis (SIRT) and/or initial&#xD;
      pseudo-progression (ICI). In addition, most of patients will have a disease control/response&#xD;
      at 2-3 months with this combination.As in all innovative phase II trials, this study should&#xD;
      well include selected patients . A randomized phase II study with a large population does not&#xD;
      seem appropriate in view of the limited literature on the safety and efficacy of this&#xD;
      combination. The alternative clinical hypothesis to obtain 70% of patients alive and without&#xD;
      progression at 9 months is ambitious and currently not achieved with current chemotherapies&#xD;
      plus a biological agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients with liver-dominant disease. Nevertheless, since the aim of&#xD;
      the trial is to induce immune abscopal anti-tumor effects of radiation, patients with hepatic&#xD;
      and extra-hepatic lesions will be included; extrahepatic lesions will be permitted if they&#xD;
      are not symptomatic and if there is no organ dysfunction (up to 10 lesions). As ICI are very&#xD;
      effective in dMMR mCRC (marketing authorization ongoing) it has been decided to exclude&#xD;
      patients with dMMR mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PFS obtain in SIRTCI 01 will provided a rationale for a randomized phase III study&#xD;
      comparing chemotherapy alone (doublet or triplet ± biological agent) versus chemotherapy,&#xD;
      SIRT and ICI combination in mCRC patients with unresectable liver-dominant disease.&#xD;
