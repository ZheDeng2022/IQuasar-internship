  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parent-mediated interventions are considered best practice for treating children with autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorder, but these interventions are underutilized in community settings.&#xD;
      Implementation strategies like consultation can improve the implementation of these&#xD;
      interventions, but little is known about the active ingredients of consultation. This study&#xD;
      uses an experimental design (ABCD single-case design with multiple baselines) to identify the&#xD;
      active ingredients of a consultation model designed to support the implementation of a&#xD;
      parent-mediated intervention for autism spectrum disorder in a low-resourced community mental&#xD;
      health system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) to treat autism spectrum disorder (ASD),&#xD;
      yet the gap from when EBPs are developed to when they reach community settings is 17 years.&#xD;
      EBPs are consistently underused in community settings despite their well-studied&#xD;
      effectiveness. One such EBP for treating ASD in young children is parent-mediated&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consultation is one method of supporting implementation that involves providing clinicians&#xD;
      with support and feedback from intervention experts. For this study, consultation on an&#xD;
      evidence-based parent-mediated intervention, Project ImPACT, will be the focus. Understanding&#xD;
      the active ingredients that go into consultation is important to understand how consultation&#xD;
      works so that it can be tailored to best meet the needs of community settings. This&#xD;
      single-case experimental design (SCED) will manipulate three potential ingredients of&#xD;
      consultation: feedback on taped sessions, case support, and skill rehearsal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups of 3-5 providers per agency will be given 2 weeks to complete a 6-hour self-directed&#xD;
      online tutorial on Project ImPACT utilized regularly by Project ImPACT consultants. Next,&#xD;
      each agency will be randomly assigned to baselines lasting 3-6 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of&#xD;
      each consultation component (total of 12 weeks). All agencies will receive consultation. The&#xD;
      order of the consultation components will be randomized using a random number generator such&#xD;
      that each agency has an equal chance of receiving one of the predetermined permutations of&#xD;
      phases (e.g., equally as likely to be randomized to ABCD order as ADBC order). Across each&#xD;
      phase, providers will record one session per week with their enrolled family and submit it&#xD;
      via a HIPAA-compliant Drop-box link. Providers will complete weekly online questionnaires on&#xD;
      implementation outcomes, with time reserved during consultation sessions to complete them.&#xD;
      After consultation, providers will submit a final recorded session and questionnaire 8-weeks&#xD;
      post-consultation. Caregivers will complete a measure of social communication for their child&#xD;
      via online questionnaire at baseline, twice during consultation, and after 8 weeks&#xD;
      post-consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feedback phase will involve the consultant and peers responding to the 5-minute clips of&#xD;
      recorded telehealth sessions with praise and constructive feedback. The case support phase&#xD;
      will be a time for the consultant and peers to assist in any challenges faced; for example,&#xD;
      this could include issues with telehealth, caregiver coaching, or family/child needs. The&#xD;
      skill rehearsal phase will allow for consultees to practice their clinical skills via role&#xD;
      play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have 4 aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Identify the potential active ingredients of the consultation model by&#xD;
      evaluating its effects on providers' treatment adherence and parent-mediated intervention&#xD;
      competence. The investigators predict that the feedback component will improve adherence and&#xD;
      competence over and above improvements from the case support and skill rehearsal components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Examine the relative feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of each&#xD;
      consultation component using a SCED component analysis. Feasibility is the extent to which a&#xD;
      practice can be successfully carried out within a setting. Acceptability is the extent to&#xD;
      which a practice is agreeable and satisfactory. Appropriateness is the perceived fit or&#xD;
      relevance of a practice to address a problem. The investigators predict that providers will&#xD;
      perceive the case support component to be the most feasible, acceptable, and appropriate of&#xD;
      all components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Examine the effects of the consultation model on case penetration and the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the EBP (Project ImPACT). The&#xD;
      investigators predict case penetration (i.e., total number of Project ImPACT cases on a&#xD;
      provider's caseload divided by the total number of eligible clients) and EBP feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and appropriateness to increase over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 4: Demonstrate associated social communication outcomes for Medicaid-enrolled&#xD;
      children with ASD from baseline to post-consultation. Given that consultation leads to&#xD;
      improved adherence and child outcomes and Project ImPACT results in improved child social&#xD;
      communication outcomes, the investigators predict that our consultation model will be&#xD;
      associated with improvements in child social communication skills.&#xD;

    <description>Parent-mediated intervention competence will be assessed via the Triadic Intervention and Evaluation Rating Scale which utilizes a 5-point scale to assess for competency in delivering collaborative coaching techniques used in parent-mediated interventions. The scale used is: Never (1), Rarely (2), Sometimes (3), Often (4), and Almost Always (5). The minimum value on the scale is 25 and the maximum value is 125.

    <description>Case penetration will be measured weekly using the Penetrability Formula and will be expressed using provider report of the total number of Project ImPACT cases on their caseload divided by the total number of eligible clients with ASD on their Medicaid Autism Benefit caseload. This is expressed as a percentage. Higher percentage values indicate higher case penetration.</description>

    <time_frame>23-26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Providers will give ratings on the Feasibility of Intervention Measure, Acceptability of Intervention Measure, and Intervention Appropriate Measure to characterize provider perceptions of the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of each consultation phase. Feasibility is defined as the stakeholder's perception of the extent to which a practice can be successfully carried out within a setting. Acceptability is a stakeholder's perception that a practice is agreeable and satisfactory. Appropriateness is the stakeholder's perception of the fit or relevance of a practice to address a problem. The scale used is: Completely disagree (1), Disagree (2), Neither disagree or agree (3), Agree (4), and Completely agree (5). The minimum value on each measure is 4 and the maximum value is 20. Higher scores indicate higher feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of each phase.</description>

    <time_frame>23-26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Autism Impact Measure (AIM) will be used to measure child social communication at baseline, in week 6 and week 12 of the consultation phase, and 8 weeks into post-consultation. The AIM contains five empirically derived subdomain scores: Repetitive Behavior, Atypical Behavior, Communication, Social Reciprocity, and Peer Interaction. Forty-one items are rated based on a 5-point scale ranging from Never (1) to Always (5) for frequency and impact. The minimum value for each scale (frequency and impact) is 41 and the maximum value is 205. Higher values indicate higher frequency of concerns and higher impact of concerns on child functioning.</description>
