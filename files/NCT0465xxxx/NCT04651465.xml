    <textblock>
      The current Randomised Controlled Trial study delivers and evaluate an evidence-based&#xD;
      prevention program from Australia (Tuning in to Kids: TIK) to parent of preschool children.&#xD;
      Reports from parents and preschool teachers are used to determine whether the program leads&#xD;
      to universal benefits of improved wellbeing and reduced mental health difficulties for&#xD;
      children and parents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study recruits approximately 250 parents of preschool children through local&#xD;
      kindergartens to evaluate the N-TIK program as a universal and selective prevention program.&#xD;
      The study will use a cluster randomized controlled design and comparing an intervention with&#xD;
      a wait-list control sample. Baseline measurement (Time 1) are gathered from parents, children&#xD;
      and teachers and include measurement of parenting, parent functioning, child emotion&#xD;
      competence, child behavior and child kindergarten adjustment. Following baseline assessment&#xD;
      families is allocated into Intervention or Wait-list conditions. Intervention parents attend&#xD;
      a 6-session group parenting program where they learn to emotion coach their children and&#xD;
      regulate their own emotions. These groups are facilitated by selected research team&#xD;
      facilitators. Post-program, Intervention parents complete program evaluation measures (Time&#xD;
      2) to provide program feedback. At 12-month follow-up (Time 3) baseline assessments are&#xD;
      repeated for Intervention and Wait-list participants with preschool teachers reporting on&#xD;
      children's adjustment. Wait-list parents are then offered the N-TIK program delivered by&#xD;
      community practitioners who have been trained by the project team in the intervention and&#xD;
      have previously co-facilitated groups alongside the research group facilitators. This ensures&#xD;
      the program can be used beyond just the research study building sustainability of the&#xD;
      preventive intervention in the municipalities&#xD;
