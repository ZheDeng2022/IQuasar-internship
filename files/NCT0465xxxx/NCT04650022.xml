      Preprocedural predictors of outcome in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion (ABAO)&#xD;
      who underwent endovascular treatment (EVT) remain controversial. The Investigators aimed to&#xD;
      analyse, in patients with ABAO treated by EVT, if pre-EVT DWI total posterior-circulation&#xD;
      infarct volume (TPIV) was a predictor of 90-days outcomes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute basilar artery occlusion (ABAO) is a rare and devastating type of stroke. Endovascular&#xD;
      treatment (EVT) is routinely performed in real-world practice, encouraged by the recent&#xD;
      result of the basilar artery international cooperation study (BASICS), a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABAO may result in infarcts in the brainstem, cerebellar lobes, thalamus and subthalamic&#xD;
      area, or occipitotemporal lobes. Previously, studies using the DWI Posterior-circulation&#xD;
      Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (Pc-ASPECT) Score or brainstem score, for predicting outcome&#xD;
      in patients with ABAO, showed that the initial infarct extend can affect outcome. Some of&#xD;
      these studies included patients tretaed by EVT. But, results showed conflicting findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, evidence regarding the association between pre-ETVT DWI lesion volume and outcomes&#xD;
      is relatively weak and has not yet be determined. Predictors of the outcomes of EVT for&#xD;
      anterior circulation include infarcts volume. More recently, authors reported a predictive&#xD;
      model of good outcome combining initial DWI infarct volume of less than 10 ml,&#xD;
      onset-to-puncture time less than 8 hours and embolic origin in 71 Korean patients undergoing&#xD;
      EVT for vertebrobasilar occlusion. Nevertheless, up now, there is not sufficient evidence to&#xD;
      reach a consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using data of our prospective registry, the investigators analyzed consecutive MRI selected,&#xD;
      endovascularly treated ABAO patients within the first 24h after symptom-onset. Using the&#xD;
      initial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), baseline total posterior-Circulation infarct volume&#xD;
      (TPCIV) was calculated in mL, on an apparent diffusion-coefficient map reconstruction (Olea&#xD;
      sphere software).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TPCIV was analyzed in univariate and multivariable models as a predictor of 90-day functional&#xD;
      independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-2) and mortality. According to received operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) analysis, the optimal cut-off was determined by maximizing the Youden&#xD;
      index, to evaluate the prognostic value of TPCIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators aimed to investigate the relationship between baseline DWI total TPCIV and&#xD;
      the 90-days functional outcome and mortality, in a large cohort of ABAO selected by MRI prior&#xD;
      to EVT.&#xD;
