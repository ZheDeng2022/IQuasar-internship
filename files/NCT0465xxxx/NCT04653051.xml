  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-center, retrospective, non-randomized, non-controlled and consecutive&#xD;
      series post-market study. The purpose of this study is to confirm safety, performance and&#xD;
      clinical benefits of the DVR Plates. The primary objective is the assessment of performance&#xD;
      by analyzing fracture healing. The secondary objective is the assessment of safety by&#xD;
      recording and analyzing the incidence and frequency of complications and adverse events.&#xD;

      The DVR plating system in this study includes the DVR Crosslock Distal Radial Plate, the DVR&#xD;
      Volar Rim Plate and the DVR Wrist Plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One site will be involved in this study. The aim is to include a total of 112 consecutive&#xD;
      series patients treated between 2014 and 2018. All potential study subjects will be required&#xD;
      to participate in the Informed Consent Process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data from the preop, intraop, immediate post-op and last consultation visit will be&#xD;
      available in medical notes and collected retrospectively. During a follow up phone call the&#xD;
      patient will be asked to complete a patient questionnaire and a question on his/her wrist&#xD;
      function. In addition, any complications since the last consultation visit at the clinic,&#xD;
      information about and treatment of the complications will also be collected over the phone.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must have been implanted with one of the DVR Plates according to the&#xD;
             approved indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Off-label use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cases where there is an active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conditions which tend to retard healing such as, blood supply limitations, previous&#xD;
             infections, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insufficient quantity or quality of bone to permit stabilization of the fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conditions that restrict the patient's ability or willingness to follow postoperative&#xD;
             instructions during the healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Foreign body sensitivity - where material sensitivity is suspected, appropriate tests&#xD;
             should be conducted and sensitivity ruled out prior to implantations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cases where the implant(s) would cross open epiphyseal plates in skeletally immature&#xD;
             patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cases with malignant primary or metastatic tumors which preclude adequate bone support&#xD;
             or screw fixations, unless supplemental fixation or stabilization methods are&#xD;
             utilized.&#xD;
