    <textblock>
      Involuntary mental health care is permitted because it is believed to make people with severe&#xD;
      mental disorders (SMD) better and prevent them from getting worse or even dying In this study&#xD;
      we will investigate whether low levels of coercion in an area is connected with poorer&#xD;
      outcomes in Norway. It can be assumed that too little involuntary care might lead to the&#xD;
      opposite outcomes to those intended by the Norwegian Mental Health Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same law applies all over Norway, but the rate of involuntary care varies: there is up to&#xD;
      five-fold difference between the catchment areas of the 69 Community Mental Health Centers.&#xD;
      The investigators will estimate rates of involuntary care and adjust for age, sex, urbanity&#xD;
      and area deprivation. The data source is the Norwegian Patients Registry, and all patients in&#xD;
      treatment for a severe mental disorder in 2015 and their use of mental health care until 2018&#xD;
      will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model 1 follows all patients who were treated for a severe mental disorder in 2015. The model&#xD;
      will test whether the rates of involuntary care in the area they live can predict the length&#xD;
      of time to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model 2 follows patients with treatment for severe mental disorders that had no episode of&#xD;
      voluntary care in 2015. The model will test whether the rate of involuntary care in their&#xD;
      area predicts their use of mental health inpatient care in 2016 and 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model 3 tests how long time patients with severe mental disorders that received only&#xD;
      voluntary care in 2015 remain without a period of involuntary care in 2016-17, as a function&#xD;
      of the rate of involuntary care in their area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model 4 estimates changing the total number of patients with severe mental disorders in the&#xD;
      catchment area in 2016-17 as a function of time and the rate of involuntary in 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model 5 tests whether suicide rates for a catchment area varies as a function of its rate of&#xD;
      involuntary care. Because suicides are rare, we will observe the variables over longer time&#xD;
      periods, using involuntary care rates from 2015 to 2018 and suicide rates for 2015-2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was evaluated by the Research Ethics Committee (ref 2018/795), who approved use of&#xD;
      registry data, and by the Privacy Ombudsman at Akershus University Hospital (ref 2018-090).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Involuntary mental health care is permitted because it is believed to make people with severe&#xD;
      mental disorders (SMD) better and prevent them from getting worse or even dying. This study&#xD;
      concerns whether low levels of coercion in an area is connected with poorer outcomes in&#xD;
      Norway. Too little involuntary care could be expected to lead to the opposite outcomes to&#xD;
      those intended by the Norwegian Mental Health Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same law applies all over Norway, but the rate of involuntary care varies: there is an up&#xD;
      to five-fold difference between the catchment areas of the 69 Community Mental Health Centers&#xD;
      (CMHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use national register data to test whether areas with low rates of&#xD;
      involuntary care shows signs of failing to achieve the patient benefits of involuntary care&#xD;
      as intended by the Norwegian Mental Health Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on involuntary care will be retieved from the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) and&#xD;
      combined with data on the general population and demographics from Statistics Norway, to&#xD;
      study the hypothesized negative consequences of low rates of involuntary care. All of&#xD;
      Norway's 21 Health Trusts and their 69 Community Mental Health Centers that provide&#xD;
      specialist services are required to submit to NPR on an annual basis complete data of all&#xD;
      service use from their hospitals' electronic patient administrative and clinical systems. The&#xD;
      NPR conducts extensive data-quality checks, and publishes completeness data for all&#xD;
      variables. The registry implemented a unique patient identifier in 2008, so that a patient's&#xD;
      care can be followed across time. From the NPR database, information on all specialist mental&#xD;
      health treatment activity for patients with set criteria (in our case diagnosis F20-31 and&#xD;
      legal status) during a given time period (here 2015-18) can be extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both involuntary admissions and outpatient compulsion in the form of community treatment&#xD;
      orders (CTO) are envisaged to contribute to the aims of the Mental Health Act, such as&#xD;
      protection against harm, improvement, restoration of health, and recovery or cure for the&#xD;
      patient. The variable of interest is low use of the combination of these two forms of&#xD;
      involuntary care. To our knowledge, there is no established way to calculate a combined&#xD;
      measure of inpatient and outpatient involuntary care, and it is not generally established how&#xD;
      one form of involuntary care is associated with the other. In Norway, 31% of involuntary&#xD;
      admissions continued as a CTO in 2018, and although permitted, CTOs are almost never&#xD;
      initiated when the patient lives at home. When a patient is under involuntary admissions or a&#xD;
      CTO, the care system has substantial influence and control over their treatment, and&#xD;
      medication is a particular focus. Regardless of the form of involuntary care, control over&#xD;
      treatment can be continued according to necessity criteria in the law in order to prevent&#xD;
      deterioration. For these reasons, the rate of persons affected by involuntary admission&#xD;
      and/or CTO per 100 000 capita will be used as an indicator of use of involuntary care in the&#xD;
      catchment area and hence, the main covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age span will be patients from 18 to 65, so that the increasing frequency of involuntary&#xD;
      care due to lack of capacity due to dementia towards the end of life will not impact the&#xD;
      results. The investigators will control for age and sex by indirect standardization, based on&#xD;
      Statistics Norway's tables for population in municipalities and city districts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test whether the living condition index and/or urbanity of the&#xD;
      municipality (perhaps merged to fewer categories than five) predict rates of involuntary&#xD;
      care. A classification of all municipalities into five degrees of urbanity from a previous&#xD;
      study will be used. Statistics Norway published an index of living conditions in Norwegian&#xD;
      municipalities and City districts in 2000 and 2008, which has not been continued after 2008.&#xD;
      This index combines the level or frequency of a variety of social benefit payments,&#xD;
      unemployment, education level and lethality, and should be sufficiently up to date. If&#xD;
      urbanity or living condition predicts rates of involuntary care, it will be controlled for by&#xD;
      estimating a suitable linear regression model. A hierarchical model adjusting for nesting of&#xD;
      municipalities within CMHCs and CMHCs within health trusts will be considered, but this&#xD;
      adjustment may be reduced based on intraclass correlations. Then the ratio between expected&#xD;
      and observed use of involuntary care will be the main covariate, and will reflect the rate of&#xD;
      involuntary care per capita, controlled for age, sex and urbanity and deprivation in each&#xD;
      catchment area. Each patient in the dataset will be assigned the value of this covariate&#xD;
      corresponding to their area of residence in 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of models is assess associations between the main covariate measured in the&#xD;
      index year and survival or change in outcome variables in the following 2 years for the&#xD;
      patients included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model 1. Are there more deaths among SMD patients from areas with low levels of involuntary&#xD;
      care?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main covariate is rate of involuntary care in 69 areas in 2015, controlled for age, sex,&#xD;
      urbanity and deprivation. The unit of analysis is the individual patient with a care episode&#xD;
      and a registered SMD diagnosis in 2015. Outcome variable is time to death from the quarter in&#xD;
      2015 with a registered event with a SMD-diagnosis, observed through 2018. The unit of&#xD;
      analysis is the individual SMD patient. The statistical method is survival analysis with&#xD;
      adjustment for age and sex and adjustment for random effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model 2. Is there increased use of inpatient care for voluntary SMD-patients from areas with&#xD;
      low levels of involuntary care?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main covariate is rate of involuntary mental health care in 69 areas in 2015, controlled&#xD;
      for age, sex, urbanity and deprivation. The unit of analyses is the individual SMD-patient&#xD;
      with 'voluntary care only' in 2015. The outcome variable is change in mental health inpatient&#xD;
      days in the next two years for the included patients. The statistical method is a linear&#xD;
      mixed model with random effects for CMHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model 3. Is there decreased time to next episode of involuntary care for voluntary&#xD;
      SMD-patients from in areas with low levels of involuntary care? The main covariate is rate of&#xD;
      involuntary mental health care in the 69 areas in 2015, controlled for age, sex, urbanity and&#xD;
      deprivation. The unit of analyses is the individual SMD-patient with 'voluntary care only' in&#xD;
      2015. Outcome variable are time to a treatment episode with involuntary care observed through&#xD;
      2016 and 2017. The statistical method is survival analysis with death as competing risk with&#xD;
      random effects for catchment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model 4 and 5 are ecological models of the catchment areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model 4. Are low levels of involuntary care in a catchment area followed by more SMD patients&#xD;
      in the area? The main covariate is rate of involuntary mental health care in the 69 areas in&#xD;
      2015, controlled for age, sex, urbanity and deprivation. The outcome variable is the annual&#xD;
      number of patients with SMD in 2016 and 2017. The unit of analysis is the catchment area&#xD;
      (N=69). The statistical method is linear regression model with time, main covariate and&#xD;
      interaction between the two as independent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model 5. Is low level of involuntary care in an area related to more suicides?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main covariate is rate of involuntary care in 2015-2018 in the 69 areas, controlled for&#xD;
      age, sex, urbanity and deprivation. The outcome variable is the standardized rate of suicides&#xD;
      in the area's population regardless of patient status, from 2015 through 2019. The unit of&#xD;
      analysis is the 69 catchment areas. Due to low incidence of the outcome, merging of some&#xD;
      areas will be considered. The statistical method is correlation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination: Study results will be published study international peer-reviewed scientific&#xD;
      journals. The number of papers necessary to disseminate results depends of the complexity of&#xD;
      results and their interpretation.&#xD;
