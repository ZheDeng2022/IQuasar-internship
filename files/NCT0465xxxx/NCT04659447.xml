    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a common knee injury, which seriously affects the&#xD;
      living ability and sport level of the injured. ACL reconstruction is the main method to treat&#xD;
      ACL injury. Due to the reconstructive ligament needs a tendon bone healing and ligament&#xD;
      maturation, therefore, in the ACL anatomical study, reconstruction surgery and reconstruction&#xD;
      materials under the condition of constant progress, how to improve the ACL reconstruction of&#xD;
      tendon bone healing and shorten the time of the ligament mature, improve the clinical effect&#xD;
      of ACL reconstruction, has become the focus in the ACL reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is full of growth factors and bioactive factors, which&#xD;
      has the function of promoting tissue healing, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. At the&#xD;
      same time of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, using autologous PRP in the bone&#xD;
      channel might promote tendon bone healing and ligament maturing after ACL reconstruction,&#xD;
      promote the recovery of proprioception, prevent bone channel expanding, shorten the&#xD;
      postoperative recovery time, speed up the patients recovery exercise ability, improve the&#xD;
      clinical effect of ACL reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with ACL injuries were randomly divided into two groups: one group&#xD;
      underwent ACL anatomical reconstruction, and the other group underwent ACL anatomical&#xD;
      reconstruction with PRP. Various clinical scores, KT-2000, Biodex and imaging tests were used&#xD;
      to evaluate the differences in the clinical effects of the two surgical methods in terms of&#xD;
      postoperative pain, joint swelling, knee function, joint stability, muscle strength recovery,&#xD;
      bone channel expanding, ligament vasinization, and ligament maturation.&#xD;
