  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the utility of composite wrapping&#xD;
      comprising human amniotic membrane and allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      (HAM-AdMSC) for augmentation of nerve transfer procedure in upper TBPI patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nerve transfer procedure is recognized as the current gold standard for treating traumatic&#xD;
      brachial plexus injury (TBPI). However, despite the current major progress in diagnosis and&#xD;
      microsurgical repair, the prognosis in TBPI remains unfavorable due to limited donor nerve&#xD;
      and compromised regenerative capability of the nervous system arising from prolonged&#xD;
      denervation. Therefore, there is a major need to devise new treatment strategies; and one&#xD;
      possible approach is to develop cellular therapies to bioengineer new nerve tissue and/or&#xD;
      modulate the endogenous regenerative mechanisms within the injured nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous studies have shown that the peripheral nerve tissue engineering approach using&#xD;
      human amniotic membrane seeded with allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs to augment axonal&#xD;
      regeneration in nerve transfer of TBPI patient revealed promising functional recovery of the&#xD;
      shoulder range of motion (ROM). The investigators plan a non-randomized clinical trial in a&#xD;
      single center to investigate the use of a hybrid (composite) between human amniotic membrane&#xD;
      (HAM) and allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC) as wrapping in the nerve&#xD;
      transfer procedure of upper TBPI patients, with a focus on the augmentation of axonal&#xD;
      regeneration&#xD;

    <description>Measured by Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. The MRC scale consists of 6 values of motor power evaluation, ranging from 0 to 5 (0=No contraction, 1=Flicker or trace contraction, 2=Active movement but eliminated with gravity, 3=Active movement against gravity, 4=Active movement against gravity and resistance, 5=Normal power). The tests are performed by two blinded assessor. A higher score indicates better functional motor power outcome.</description>

    <measure>Initial elbow flexion MRC grade 1 (in months)</measure>
    <time_frame>throughout the study duration (12 months), recorded as the first time reported by the patients</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the length of time (in months) for the patients to show initial contraction (achieve MRC grade 1) of elbow flexion. Previous study by Estrella (2011) showed that the average time for brachial plexus injury patients to achieve an elbow flexion grade M3 after nerve transfer procedure was 7.6 months (range, 5-12 months). As the elbow flexion is the most important movement to restore in treating BPI, the investigators aim to compare the length of time (in months) for the patients to achieve initial contraction (MRC grade 1). The sooner the patients achieve initial elbow flexion MRC grade 1, the better the outcome is.</description>

The lower scores mean a better pain outcome.</description>

    <description>DASH score is a self-assessment of symptoms and function of the entire upper extremity comprising 30 items.

The scores are then used to calculate a scale score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability). Greater DASH scores reflect greater disability (worse outcome).</description>
