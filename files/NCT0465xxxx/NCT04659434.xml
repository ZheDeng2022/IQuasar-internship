    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of Sintilimab to current 2nd line salvage therapy of&#xD;
      Rituximab, Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) for patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). All patients will receive four cycles of sintilimab&#xD;
      plus R-GemOx. Afterwards, 1) patients who achieve CR assessed by PET-CT and are eligible for&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) will undergo ASCT. After transplantation,&#xD;
      patients will receive sintilimab monotherapy up to 8 cycles or until disease recurrence and&#xD;
      progression, death, intolerance and toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or other&#xD;
      reasons specified in the protocol. 2) Patients who achieve CR assessed by PET-CT and are not&#xD;
      eligible for ASCT will directly receive sintilimab monotherapy as maintenance treatment for a&#xD;
      maximum of 8 cycles as described above. 3) Patients achieved PR, SD or PD assessed by PET/CT&#xD;
      will withdraw from this study and receive proper treatment based on investigator's decision.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rituximab is a chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody that binds to CD20, on pre-B and&#xD;
      mature B lymphocytes and eliminates these cells potentially via a number of different&#xD;
      mechanisms. The R-GemOx regimen has been adopted by numerous medical institutions&#xD;
      internationally as therapy for older patients or comorbid patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory DLBCL and as a back-bone for the investigation of novel therapies in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy. The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte co-receptor PD-1 has been extensively studied&#xD;
      and is recognized to provide critical inhibitory signals that down-regulate T-cell function&#xD;
      and provides a mechanism for immune evasion for tumors. PD-L1, the ligand of PD-1 is&#xD;
      expressed on DLBCL tumor cells, along with infiltrating non-malignant cells, primarily&#xD;
      macrophages, with PD-1 expressed on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Sintilimab targets&#xD;
      programmed PD-1 on tumor cells and prevents interaction with either PD-1 receptor or B7.1&#xD;
      (CD80), both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells. Interference of&#xD;
      the PD-L1:PD-1 and PDL1:B7.1 interactions may enhance the magnitude and quality of the&#xD;
      tumor-specific T-cell response through increased T-cell priming, expansion, and/or effector&#xD;
      function. This study of sintilimab in combination with rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      aims to address the unmet clinical need of patients with relapsed and refractory DLBCL. It is&#xD;
      based upon a sound mechanistic approach, investigating the activity of novel agents and will&#xD;
      aim to compressively explore biomarkers of response. The primary objective will be the&#xD;
      complete response rate (CRR) of this salvage therapy. A maintenance phase of sintilimab will&#xD;
      be added as this may induce an on-going T-cell response to neo-antigens released as a result&#xD;
      of previous treatment.&#xD;
