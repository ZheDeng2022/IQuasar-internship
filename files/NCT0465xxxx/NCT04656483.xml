      Infants with Neurodevelopmental Disabilities (ND) show emotional, cognitive and&#xD;
      socio-interactive dysregulation dramatically impacting on caregiving behavior. Early&#xD;
      family-centered rehabilitation interventions are effective in promoting better infant&#xD;
      outcomes and in optimizing healthcare systems economic return in the long-term. The Video&#xD;
      Feedback intervention (VFI) is effective in promoting sensitive parenting and supporting&#xD;
      infants' development. In the light of limited resources of the healthcare systems,&#xD;
      technological advance in telemedicine may facilitate the delivery of VFI to a greater number&#xD;
      of families of infants with ND. Consistently, the Supporting Parenting at Home: Empowering&#xD;
      Rehabilitation through Engagement (SPHERE) project is a randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Infants with Neurodevelopmental Disabilities (ND) show emotional, cognitive and&#xD;
      socio-interactive dysregulation dramatically impacting on caregiving behavior. Parents may&#xD;
      report critical emotional burden with heightened risk for chronic levels of distress,&#xD;
      depression and anxiety. This constitutes a crucial point considering that parenting&#xD;
      represents the first preventive factors for infants' development also in the presence of ND&#xD;
      conditions. Thus, it is not surprising that early rehabilitation interventions that focus on&#xD;
      the parent-infant dyad have been found to be the most effective in recent meta-analytic study&#xD;
      and to be the most rewarding for healthcare systems in terms of economic return in the&#xD;
      long-term. Specifically, the VFI constitutes an early family-centered intervention that&#xD;
      proved to be effective in promoting sensitive parenting and supporting infants' behavioral&#xD;
      and socio-emotional development. The use of VFI intervention has been also documented to be&#xD;
      beneficial in dyads of children with neurodevelopmental disability reducing child's&#xD;
      disruptive and emotionally negative behaviors; promoting maternal sensitivity, increasing&#xD;
      self- efficacy and reducing parenting stress. It should be highlighted that delivering VFI in&#xD;
      hospital or home-based context should be highly demanding for the healthcare systems due to&#xD;
      high cost and disparities in access to the service for families in remote areas. As such,&#xD;
      delivering VFI through telemedicine approaches (e.g., videoconferencing) appears to hold&#xD;
      promises of promoting a reduction in inequality of care, greater access to early&#xD;
      family-centered support and a more effective and efficient promotion of health outcomes for&#xD;
      infants with ND. We still do not know how a VFI support for parents of infants with ND may&#xD;
      end up in being effective and efficient in terms of promoting infants' development and&#xD;
      parental health. Consistently, the Supporting Parenting at Home: Empowering Rehabilitation&#xD;
      through Engagement (SPHERE) project is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming at&#xD;
      assessing effectiveness of an early family centered VFI parenting support delivered through&#xD;
      videoconferencing on dyads with infants with ND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPHERE RCT will include two arms (see arm description) and three assessment phases: T0,&#xD;
      baseline; T1, immediate post-intervention; T2, follow-up (6 months after the intervention).&#xD;
      For both arms, standardized assessment sessions will include video-recording of mother-infant&#xD;
      interaction and maternal self-report scales (depression [Beck Depression Inventory, BDI; Beck&#xD;
      et al., 1961]; anxiety [State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI-Y, Spielberg, 1983] parenting&#xD;
      stress, [Parenting Stress Index, PSI; Abidin, 1983] and infants' temperament [Infant Behavior&#xD;
      Questionnaire Revised, IBQ-R, Gartstein et al., 2003]).&#xD;

    <description>Mother-child dyads will take part into a 6 video-conference sessions of Video Feedback (vVF). The vVF will be standardized according to previously published RCTs. Specifically, the 6 vVFI sessions will be organized in two subsequent phases: 4 sessions based on sharing the focus on different relational themes, and 2 sessions of interactive integration. In more specific terms, during the first set of 4 sessions the psychologist will review with mothers' segments of the videotapes obtained during the baseline assessment and will focus on four different relational themes: responsiveness, physical stimulation, teaching, and parenting experience. During the interactive integration session, the insights developed from the first 4 videoconferences will be applied to the real-time interaction between the parent and his/her infant under the guidance of the psychologist.</description>
