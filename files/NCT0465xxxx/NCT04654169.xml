  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive capsulitis is a disease that negatively affects a person's quality of life by&#xD;
      causing severe pain and limitation in the movements of the shoulder joint in all directions.&#xD;
      Conservative approaches including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral corticosteroid&#xD;
      usage and physiotherapy program are the first choice for the treatment. However, painful&#xD;
      exercises usually prevent patients from fully participating in the physiotherapy program. For&#xD;
      this reason, interventional procedures such as intra-articular corticosteroid injection (IAI)&#xD;
      and suprascapular nerve block (SSNB) are preferred to be applied before the physiotherapy&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to reveal both short and long-term effects of SSNB and IAI&#xD;
      combination on pain, shoulder range of motion (ROM), disability, and quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with adhesive capsulitis. It is hypothesized that the addition of SSNB to IAI&#xD;
      results in greater improvements in pain, passive and active shoulder ROMs, disability, and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive capsulitis (AK), also known as frozen shoulder, is a disease that negatively affects&#xD;
      a person's quality of life by causing severe pain and limitation in the movements of the&#xD;
      shoulder joint in all directions. Although the underlying etiology is not clear, it may&#xD;
      develop as a result of primary (idiopathic) or secondary causes such as diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      malignancy, thyroid dysfunction, hypoadrenalism, Parkinson's disease, stroke, cardiac and&#xD;
      pulmonary diseases, or local shoulder problems such as trauma, tendinitis, rupture. Prolonged&#xD;
      immobilization after injuries is another important risk factor for adhesive capsulitis. It is&#xD;
      more common in women between the ages of 40-60. Conservative approaches including&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral corticosteroid usage and physiotherapy program&#xD;
      are the first choice for the treatment. The physiotherapy program consisting range of motion&#xD;
      (ROM), stretching and strengthening exercises are often painful and prevent the patient's&#xD;
      full participation. For this reason, interventional procedures such as intra-articular&#xD;
      corticosteroid injection (IAI) and suprascapular nerve block (SSNB) are preferred to be&#xD;
      applied before the physiotherapy program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to reveal both short and long-term effects of SSNB and IAI&#xD;
      combination on pain, shoulder ROM, disability, and quality of life in patients with adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis. It is hypothesized that the addition of SSNB to IAI results in greater&#xD;
      improvements in pain, passive and active shoulder ROMs, disability, and quality of life. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure of the study is determined to be the Shoulder Pain and Disability&#xD;
      Index (SPADI), while the secondary outcome measures to be the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS),&#xD;
      active and passive ROMs, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36).&#xD;
