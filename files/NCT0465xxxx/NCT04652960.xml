      This phase I trial identifies the best dose, possible benefits, and/or side effects of&#xD;
      duvelisib in combination with nivolumab in treating patients with stage IIB-IVB mycosis&#xD;
      fungoides and Sezary syndrome. Duvelisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving duvelisib in combination with nivolumab may&#xD;
      work better than giving each of these drugs individually, or treating with the usual approach&#xD;
      in patients with mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the&#xD;
      combination of duvelisib with nivolumab in patients with advanced mycosis fungoides/Sezary&#xD;
      syndrome (MF/SS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. Ia. To determine the overall response rate at&#xD;
      four months to the combination of nivolumab and duvelisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. To determine the time to maximum response, best overall response rate, complete remission&#xD;
      rate, and duration of response among responding patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether intra-patient changes in serum cytokines (soluble CD40L, TNF-beta,&#xD;
      IL-17alpha, IL-15, CXCL13, IL-12p40) predict response to duvelisib in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore whether the combination of duvelisib and nivolumab changes the T-cell&#xD;
      repertoire including T-cell receptor sequencing pre- and post- treatment with duvelisib and&#xD;
      nivolumab in effort to better understand skin flare and other immunogenic reactions to this&#xD;
      combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of duvelisib in combination with fixed dose&#xD;
      nivolumab followed by a dose-expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive duvelisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and&#xD;
      nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;

             who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not&#xD;
             require contraception. WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and&#xD;
             who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy)&#xD;
             or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of&#xD;
             amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological&#xD;
             causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle&#xD;

               -  Adjuvant or maintenance therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence of another&#xD;
                  malignancy (excluding cutaneous T-cell lymphoma) is permissible after discussion&#xD;
                  with the Washington University principal investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with previous malignancies are eligible if disease-free for &gt; 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of solid organ transplantation or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled infection requiring systemic antimicrobials: Patients on antibacterial,&#xD;
             antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis will not be excluded if all other exclusion /&#xD;
             inclusion criteria are met&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) unrelated to underlying lymphoma&#xD;
             (positive serology for anti-EBV virus capsid antibody [VCA] immunoglobulin M (IgM)&#xD;
             antibody and negative for anti-EBV Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen [EBNA] IgG antibody,&#xD;
             or clinical manifestations and positive EBV polymerase chain reaction [PCR] consistent&#xD;
             with active EBV infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active cytomegalovirus (CMV) (positive serology for anti-CMV IgM&#xD;
             antibody and negative for anti-CMV IgG antibody or positive CMV PCR with clinical&#xD;
             manifestations consistent with active CMV infection) and requiring therapy will be&#xD;
             excluded from participation in the study. Carriers will be monitored per institutional&#xD;
             guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have known active hepatitis B (e.g. hepatitis B&#xD;
             virus [HBV] surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g. hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is detected)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with chronic HBV or HCV are defined as patients with positive hepatitis&#xD;
                  B serology: Patients with a negative HBsAg and a positive hepatitis B core&#xD;
                  antibody (HBcAb) require an undetectable/negative hepatitis B deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
                  acid (DNA) test (e.g. polymerase chain reaction [PCR] test) to be enrolled, and&#xD;
                  will require prophylactic antiviral treatment initiated prior to the first dose&#xD;
                  of study drug, and continued until approximately 6 to 12 months after completion&#xD;
                  of study drug(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1), with the exception of alopecia and&#xD;
             neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to duvelisib or nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible to start study therapy. Patients who are on strong&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may start study therapy if discontinued 5 half lives&#xD;
             before start of study therapy. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.&#xD;
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled&#xD;
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need&#xD;
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
             herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis,&#xD;
             congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade &gt;= 3, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, and cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline QT interval corrected with Fridericia's method (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Criteria does not apply to subjects with a right or left bundle branch&#xD;
                  block&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             nivolumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal&#xD;
             abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are&#xD;
             known risk factors for bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need&#xD;
             for additional treatment before coming on study&#xD;
