  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study will include 3 parts. Aim of Part 1 of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE) for M4344 (is an Ataxia Telangiectasia&#xD;
      Mutated and Rad3-related [ATR] inhibitors) in combination with niraparib in participants with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. Aim of Parts 2 and 3 of the study is to provide clinical&#xD;
      proof-of-concept for the preclinically predicted synergistic efficacy of ATR and&#xD;
      poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) in defined populations of participants&#xD;
      with advanced breast cancer (aBC) with DDR mutations with an unmet medical need.&#xD;
