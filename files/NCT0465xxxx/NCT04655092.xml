      The subjects who have completed the 52-week treatment duration in Study A19-201 will be&#xD;
      treated with P1101, starting at the dose at Week 50. The dose during this study may be&#xD;
      increased or decreased up to 500 μg depending on the condition. This study will be continued&#xD;
      as a post-marketing clinical study after acquisition of the marketing approval of P1101.&#xD;
