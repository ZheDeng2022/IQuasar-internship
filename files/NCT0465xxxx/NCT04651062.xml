  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Endocuff study aims to show an increase of the number of detected adenomas in screening&#xD;
      colonoscopies when a endocuff vision (Arc Medical Design Ldt Leeds England) is used.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endocuff is a relatively new device which is intended to be attached to the end of the&#xD;
      colonoscope. Several minor studies have shown that the use of Endocuff probably increases the&#xD;
      number of detected polyps in colonoscopy. Endocuff is made of soft plastic and has been&#xD;
      designed to give an optimal view of the entire colon. It gently averts and flattens folds in&#xD;
      order to see small polyps &quot;hiding&quot; in the space behind colonic folds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate into the effect of the Endocuff in screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy compared with screening colonoscopy performed without Endocuff. The device has&#xD;
      been used during several years yet an effect on the number of polyps detected during&#xD;
      screenings colonoscopy has not been shown. This studies main hypothesis is that the use of&#xD;
      Endocuff in screenings colonoscopy will increase the adenoma detection rate in these&#xD;
      patients, with a potential to reduce interval cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled trial with 900 patients.&#xD;
