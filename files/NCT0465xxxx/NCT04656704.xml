  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective is to measure the degree to which oral microstomia caused by&#xD;
      sclerosing skin disease improves after treating patients with local hyaluronidase injections.&#xD;
      Investigator will determine improvements in oral aperture by measuring the centimeters of the&#xD;
      height of oral opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are: Investigator will aim to assess changes in quality of life and&#xD;
      functionality, by serial calculations of the Mouth Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis (MHISS). In&#xD;
      addition, investigator would like to investigate how many treatments are required prior to&#xD;
      treatment efficacy plateauing. Since there is minimal data on the use of hyaluronidase for&#xD;
      oral microstomia, it is not yet clear how many treatments are ideally required for maximal&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be brought in monthly for photographs, examination, assessment, and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that hyaluronidase injections will significantly improve patients' ability&#xD;
      to open their mouths and oral functionality. It remains unclear how many treatments will be&#xD;
      required for maximal effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigator will recruit 8 patients with oral microstomia caused by a sclerotic skin&#xD;
      disorder. Patients must be 18 years of age or older with an established diagnosis of a&#xD;
      sclerotic skin disorder by a dermatologist. Sclerotic skin disorders may include scleroderma,&#xD;
      CREST, scleromyxedema, and morphea involving the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial screening visit, demographic information will be obtained, inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be reviewed, and informed consent will be obtained for those deemed&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment. Patients who qualify for the study, and who have never been exposed&#xD;
      to hyaluronidase before, will have 0.1 cc hyaluronidase injected to assess whether they have&#xD;
      an allergic reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualifying patients will undergo monthly intradermal injections of 200 units of hyaluronidase&#xD;
      into the cutaneous lips by the study staff into through 6 treatments. Subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated for improvement in primary and secondary endpoints using clinical examination,&#xD;
      photographs, and questionnaires during initial and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is a pilot study, there are only 2 case reports published wherein hyaluronidase&#xD;
      was used for similar indications. One study injected approximately between 120 and 150 units&#xD;
      for morphea-induced microstomia; this study listed locations of injection sites (ie, right&#xD;
      jaw line, left jawline, and chin). Another used between 20 and 200 units of hyaluronidase for&#xD;
      scleroderma-induced microstomia; investigators injected in 2 rows of the cutaneous lips and&#xD;
      approximated number of injections in a schematic. Investigator elected to inject the higher&#xD;
      end of dosage used, 200 units (1 full vial of hyaluronidase), as this was effectively used in&#xD;
      a publication. Additionally, there has not been any dose-related side effect concerns with&#xD;
      hyaluronidase to our knowledge. It is common practice to use multiple vials to treat&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid complications, which is safely done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for improvement in primary and secondary endpoints using clinical&#xD;
      examination, photographs, and questionnaires during initial and follow-up visits.&#xD;
