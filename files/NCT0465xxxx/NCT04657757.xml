      The aim of this study is to investigate bacterial attachment and bactericidal effects of&#xD;
      different materials used for the transmucosal part of implants. Using a brace, the intraoral&#xD;
      biofilm formation in healthy subjects will be measured after 28 hours (24 hours intraorally,&#xD;
      4 hours rest). For this purpose 2 sterile platelets of each of the 8 differently processed&#xD;
      materials (16 platelets in total) are inserted into the braces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main target parameter is the quantification of the biofilm by crystal violet staining.&#xD;
      For this purpose the samples are analyzed by spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 595 nm&#xD;
      (OD595).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary target parameter possible bactericidal effects of the materials, which are&#xD;
      analyzed by Colony forming units (CFU) determination, are used.&#xD;

    <description>intraoral apparatus in which two platelets of each of the 8 materials (Esteticor Lumina PF; Esteticor Lumina PF - after Lactic acid storage; Pagalinor 2; Esteticor Economic; Pekkton ivory - untreated; Pekkton ivory - rough; Oralloy; Machined Titan Zirconia (TiZr) alloy) are to be examined. Examination is a crystal violet OD595 staining (10 minutes). The color absorbed by the bacteria is then dissolved with a 30% acetic acid and measured spectrophotometrically at 595 nm. The plaque formed on the material surface is removed immediately after removal from the oral cavity and analyzed by determination of Colony Forming Unit (CFU) number.</description>

    <description>Eight platelets with different material composition and surface properties are fastened in a holder (carrier rondell) with 15 mm diameter and inserted into the braces. Braces are to be worn for 28 hours in the oral cavity except for meals and oral hygiene procedures. Platelets then are removed and analyzed. After a first course the braces are to be cleaned in chlorhexidine solution in an ultrasonic bath; followed by a second identical course (Braces to be worn for 28 hours in the oral cavity except for meals and oral hygiene procedures).</description>
