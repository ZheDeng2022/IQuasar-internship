    <textblock>
      Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination is recommended at birth to protect against&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) in countries with high TB burden. BCG is supplied in multidose vials with&#xD;
      limited durability after reconstitution. In Guinea-Bissau, this has led to a practice of only&#xD;
      opening a BCG vial at specific days, and only if sufficient children are present. Therefore,&#xD;
      BCG vaccination is frequently delayed. Accumulating evidence indicates that BCG has&#xD;
      beneficial effects on survival beyond the specific protection against tuberculosis, so called&#xD;
      non-specific effects (NSEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that increasing the availability of BCG and vaccinating&#xD;
      children at the first health-facility contact can reduce early infant non-accidental&#xD;
      mortality by 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a cluster-randomised crossover trial, 23 health facilities (HFs) in three rural regions in&#xD;
      Guinea-Bissau will be randomised to either continue with current practice (typically BCG&#xD;
      vaccination once a week if a sufficient number of children are present for vaccination); or&#xD;
      to offer additional BCG vaccines to make BCG available every day and open a vial of BCG if&#xD;
      there is just one eligible child present. All children born in the three regions and&#xD;
      registered during the study period, will be eligible for inclusion into the trial 1 day after&#xD;
      birth. If consent is given by the mother, the child will be followed until day 42 after&#xD;
      birth, when other vaccines are scheduled to be given. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      non-accidental mortality, secondary outcomes are non-accidental hospital admissions,&#xD;
      non-accidental neonatal mortality and cost-effectiveness of making BCG available at the first&#xD;
      health-facility contact.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination at&#xD;
      birth to protect against TB in countries with high TB burden. Though the BCG vaccine is&#xD;
      scheduled at birth, the vaccine is often given with delay, also among children born in Health&#xD;
      Facilities (HFs), where it should be possible to obtain the vaccine. In 2010 in rural&#xD;
      Guinea-Bissau, only 38% of children received BCG within the first month of life. BCG is&#xD;
      supplied in 20-dose vials and unused doses must be discarded 6 hours after reconstitution.&#xD;
      This has led to a local practice of not opening a BCG vial unless sufficient eligible&#xD;
      children are present for vaccination. Moreover, the HFs seek to assemble larger groups of&#xD;
      children eligible for BCG at specific days. Our observations from the field indicate that&#xD;
      even on these days, vials may not be opened if the number of children is too low. Similar&#xD;
      practises have been demonstrated in other low-income countries, but this practice is not in&#xD;
      line with WHO recommendations, which emphasise that multi-dose vials should be opened and&#xD;
      used to vaccinate one child despite any wastage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, an estimated 73% of all neonatal deaths occurred within the first week of life.&#xD;
      Several studies have suggested that BCG vaccination is associated with survival benefits&#xD;
      early in life: In three randomised trials from Guinea-Bissau, BCG-at-birth was associated&#xD;
      with a 38% lower neonatal mortality and marked reductions already 3 days after vaccination. A&#xD;
      WHO-commissioned review and meta-analysis conducted in 2014 including five clinical trials&#xD;
      indicated that BCG-vaccinated children had a relative risk of mortality at 0.70 (95%&#xD;
      confidence interval 0.49-1.01) compared with BCG-unvaccinated children. Two randomised trials&#xD;
      from India, both published after the review was conducted, found no effect of BCG at birth on&#xD;
      neonatal mortality. In both India and Guinea-Bissau, all trials were conducted among low&#xD;
      birth weight (LBW) children and primary outcome was neonatal mortality. In Guinea-Bissau,&#xD;
      BCG-Denmark was used in all trials, whereas BCG-Russia was used in the trials from India.&#xD;
      Strain of BCG has been suggested as a possible reason for the discrepancy between the trials&#xD;
      in India, and the trials in Guinea-Bissau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, early BCG vaccination may be important, not only for protection against&#xD;
      tuberculosis, but also for the impact on survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing the availability of BCG and vaccinating children at the first health-facility&#xD;
      contact can reduce early infant mortality due to other causes than accidents by 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a cluster randomized trial of increased BCG availability at the 23 HFs in&#xD;
      three rural regions (Oio, Biombo and Farim) in Guinea-Bissau. In half of the HFs, BCG will be&#xD;
      provided as per current practice (typically once a week if a sufficient number of children&#xD;
      are present for vaccination); in the remaining HFs, additional BCG vaccines will be supplied&#xD;
      to make BCG available every day and opening a vial of BCG if there is just one eligible child&#xD;
      present. In collaboration with the national vaccination programme, the investigators will&#xD;
      ensure that the same strain of WHO-prequalified BCG vaccines will be used at the same time in&#xD;
      both the control and intervention arm of the study. The allocation of centres will be crossed&#xD;
      over after 12 months and inclusion of participants will carry on for another 12 months.&#xD;
      Pregnancies, births and deaths will be monitored through two different levels of&#xD;
      surveillance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 1 - Bandim Health Project's (BHPs) rural Health and Demographic Surveillance System&#xD;
      (HDSS). The BHP teams survey women of fertile age and children below the age of 5 years in&#xD;
      randomly selected village clusters in all health regions across the country, which involves&#xD;
      40 village clusters distributed across the three regions included in this study. Through this&#xD;
      system, it is possible to monitor pregnancies, births, vaccinations and child health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 2 - Reinforced community health worker monitoring. In all villages in Guinea-Bissau,&#xD;
      community health workers (CHWs) monitor births and deaths through a national monitoring&#xD;
      system. The CHWs report aggregated data on pregnancies, number of births and neonatal deaths&#xD;
      (in two categories: 0-7 days, 8-28 days) in their capture area to the local health centre at&#xD;
      monthly meetings. This data collection will be reinforced by supervision and further data&#xD;
      collection from BHP supervisors covering each health centre area. The CHWs will receive a&#xD;
      visit every 1-2 months from a supervisor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children registered during pregnancy in Oio, Biombo or Farim enter the trial cohort 1 day&#xD;
      after birth. A pregnancy can be registered in more than one village, but the child will only&#xD;
      enter the trial if the mother gave birth in the village or the nearby health facility, and&#xD;
      then was discharged to the village where the pregnancy was registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all registered deaths, a specially trained field worker will visit the household of the&#xD;
      deceased child to conduct a verbal autopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to study start, all 23 HFs in the three regions will be visited by a team from BHP.&#xD;
      During these visits, refresher training on vaccination technique and assessment of lymph&#xD;
      glands will be conducted. The training will include general information on the BCG vaccine,&#xD;
      information on reconstitution and durability of the vaccines, how to check that the vials&#xD;
      have not been damaged by heat and information on adverse events. During the trial, the HFs&#xD;
      will be visited regularly by a nurse from BHP, who will observe and supervise the vaccination&#xD;
      sessions for vaccination technique, attention to registration of adverse event, used strain&#xD;
      of vaccinations, registration of cold chain and state of vaccine stock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be non-accidental mortality rate between 1 day after birth and 42&#xD;
      days after birth, where other vaccines are scheduled to be given. 22,800 infants are expected&#xD;
      to be included in the study during the two-year study period. With a baseline mortality of&#xD;
      2.5% (varying between 1.5 and 3.5% by HF) this sample size should result in 88% power to&#xD;
      demonstrate an effect if the true mortality reduction is assumed to be 25% (power simulations&#xD;
      based on a logistic regression with Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE)-based correction&#xD;
      for village cluster). Secondary outcomes are non-accidental hospital admissions,&#xD;
      non-accidental neonatal mortality and cost-effectiveness of making BCG available at the first&#xD;
      health-facility contact. The effect of making BCG available at the first HF contact will be&#xD;
      analysed in logistic regression models with GEE-based correction for village cluster.&#xD;
