      To characterize both functionally and morphologically initial Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)&#xD;
      stages and their progression over a period of 10 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent complication of diabetes mellitus and the&#xD;
      leading cause of legal blindness in active populations of industrialized countries.&#xD;
      Progression of DR has been up to now classified according to the ETDRS classification, based&#xD;
      on a multicentric study that evaluated the effect of laser photocoagulation on advanced&#xD;
      stages of DR. Although appropriate for late stages of DR, it does not grade progression well&#xD;
      in the initial stages of the disease. Initial stages of DR require urgent characterization&#xD;
      and their evolution should be well defined because some of the lesions are still reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early stages of DR are characterized by 4 main alterations: microaneurysms (MA) and&#xD;
      retinal hemorrhages, represented by red dots in the fundus, blood-retinal barrier breakdown,&#xD;
      capillary closure and damage of neuronal and glial cells of the retina. Thus, there are both&#xD;
      microvascular changes, with endothelial cell and pericyte damage with thickening of basement&#xD;
      membrane, and neuronal changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies, progression of DR does not occur at the same rate in all patients.&#xD;
      Some never develop vision loss, whereas others rapidly progress to macular edema or&#xD;
      neovascularization leading to vision loss. The understanding of the mechanisms that balance&#xD;
      in different direction is of outmost importance. The duration of diabetes mellitus and the&#xD;
      metabolic control are major risk factors for DR progression, but they are insufficient to&#xD;
      explain the great variability observed in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data indicate that MA turnover may be an appropriate indicator of DR progression. Our&#xD;
      research group has identified different DR progression phenotypes. Phenotype A is&#xD;
      characterized by a low MA turnover, phenotype B characterized by increased thickness and&#xD;
      phenotype C with predominant ischemia, with a high MA turnover. These phenotypes were defined&#xD;
      based on MA turnover (RetmarkerDR) and on central retinal thickness (RT) measured by Optical&#xD;
      Coherence Tomography (OCT) and the model was able to correctly identify eyes at risk of&#xD;
      progression. 61,8-76,7% of eyes with an increase RT in the central subfield, inner and/or&#xD;
      outer ring allowed a MA formation rate ≥ 2 and/or a MA turnover ≥ 6. More recently, some&#xD;
      genetic variants have been linked to the different phenotypes and may explain specific&#xD;
      progression patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is emerging evidence to suggest that retinal neurodegeneration is an early event in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of DR and that it could participate in the development of microvascular&#xD;
      abnormalities. The understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration&#xD;
      and the identification of the mediators between neurodegeneration and microangiopathy is&#xD;
      essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators aim to understand the extent of these cell abnormalities in the initial&#xD;
      stages of DR and to characterize their progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of retinal thickness using OCT offers non-invasive evaluation of retinal edema and&#xD;
      can suggest an appropriate treatment target. The Investigators will use recent and innovative&#xD;
      approaches as Spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) with retinal layers segmentation to study&#xD;
      neurodegenerative changes occurring in DR. OCT-Angiography and OCT-Leakage layer by layer&#xD;
      analysis will be used for microvasculature and blood retinal barrier assessment.&#xD;
