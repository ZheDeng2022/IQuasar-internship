  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to develop, and pilot test a decision-making tool that is&#xD;
      tailored for women with physical disabilities to support those women in making a decision&#xD;
      about whether or not a pregnancy is right given the participant's situation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Decisional Conflict Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional conflict is characterized by uncertainty about a decision. The Decisional Conflict Scale consists of 16 items with 5 response options. Total scores range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the readiness to make a choice in Stage of Decision-Making Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Decision or choice predisposition about pregnancy. The scale ranges from &quot;haven't begun to think about choices&quot; to &quot;have already made a decision and unlikely to change my mind&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of decision making tool as assessed by participant rating of the presentation of information</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of decision making tool is measured by 11 items that measure the presentation of information rated on Likert scales ranging from 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent) with higher scores reflecting better information presentation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of decision making tool as assessed by participant rating by the usefulness in supporting decision making</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability is measured by 9 items. The items measure the usefulness of worksheets in the decision making tool and are on Likert scales ranging from 1 (not at all useful) to 5 (very useful). Higher scores indicate an increase in usefulness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demand of decision making tool as assessed by duration of intervention use</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Demand will be assessed using data from a log book kept by participants. The book contains the dates the book was used and which chapters were reviewed. The number of days will be summed for each section with a higher number of days indicating greater demand.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demand of decision making tool as measured by question on likeliness of using the tool after the study is over</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is measured with a single item rated on Likert scales of 1 (definitely not likely) to 5 (very likely). Higher scores indicate a higher likelihood of using the tool after the study is over.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Implementation of decision making tool as measured by question of ease of use of tool</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Implementation is measured with a single item rated on Likert scales ranging from 1 (very hard) to 5 (very easy).</description>

    <intervention_name>Decision-making tool</intervention_name>
    <description>Women will be directed to a secure website to download a copy of the decision making tool and worksheets (they can download as many copies as they wish to). The women will use the tool and worksheets at their own pace for the pilot study period.&#xD;
The decision making tool is a 23-page tool and set of 9 downloadable worksheets. The tool covers topics relevant to women with disabilities in considering or planning a pregnancy: 1) Overview of Pregnancy: 2) Knowing what is important; 3) Partners, family and important relationships; 4) Physical function and independence; 5) Health and wellbeing; 6) Caring for an infant; 7) Financial resources &amp; insurance; 8) How to find reliable information and resources; 9) Connecting with other women with physical disabilities; 10) Dealing with reactions of others, stigma and bias, pressure; and 11) Reaching a decision.</description>
