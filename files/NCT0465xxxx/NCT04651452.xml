  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aromatase inhibitors are a powerful medication for reducing the risk of recurrence and&#xD;
      increasing survival in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. However, these medications can&#xD;
      lead to intolerable side effects, poor medication adherence, and increased stress levels.&#xD;
      This project's broad objective is to assess whether an intervention can improve medication&#xD;
      adherence and reduce physical symptoms and stress in breast cancer patients prescribed&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors. Participants will be randomly assigned to a values affirmation or&#xD;
      reflective journaling condition. Interventions will be writing-based, one essay per month for&#xD;
      six months. Physical symptoms and perceived stress will be assessed at baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention (one month after the intervention), and follow-up (six months from the&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment and seven months after the end of the intervention).&#xD;
      Furthermore, an electronic pill bottle will continuously assess daily compliance so that&#xD;
      medication adherence rates during the intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up can be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sample of 250 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the value&#xD;
      affirmation (N=125) or reflective journaling (N=125) condition. Participants will complete&#xD;
      baseline measures of physical symptoms, perceived stress, and other covariates. They will&#xD;
      also be given an electronic pill bottle that will record whether they have daily opened and&#xD;
      closed the bottle, signifying adherence to their prescribed medication regime. This pill&#xD;
      bottle will sync to an online dashboard. Participants in both conditions will complete a&#xD;
      brief essay online (or via paper and pencil for those who prefer or do not have internet&#xD;
      access) every month for six months. Value affirmation condition essays will include prompts&#xD;
      about important, core personal values. Reflective journaling essays will have prompts that do&#xD;
      not include any core personal value content but ask participants, in part, to write about&#xD;
      typical daily routines. Following the conclusion of the intervention, participants will&#xD;
      report on their levels of perceived stress and physical symptoms. Six months following the&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment, participants will again report their perceived stress levels&#xD;
      and physical symptoms. A sample size of 250 has been selected for feasibility and because&#xD;
      this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect differences for all three outcomes of&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substudy will be conducted on 120 of these participants who will complete their 3rd essay&#xD;
      prompt in an fMRI scanner. In the scan session, participants will also complete a stress&#xD;
      reactivity task. The substudy will allow examination of the neural mechanism of value&#xD;
      affirmation and reflective journaling to determine whether these neural mechanisms lead to&#xD;
      enhanced medication adherence rates and reductions in stress and physical symptoms.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The participant and their care provider, who prescribes their aromatase inhibitor, will remain masked to which writing condition (self-affirmation or reflective journaling) the participant is randomized into. The outcomes assessor will remain masked to which condition the participants will complete. However, the experimenter will help set up the participant's online content and, therefore, will not be masked to the writing condition.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in Physical Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 1-month post-intervention and 7 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Symptom Checklist is a 43 item self-report of physical symptoms specific to breast cancer treatment. Participants rate how bothered they were by each symptom in the last 4 weeks on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely). Item 43 is an open response question that asks participants to indicate and rate any additional symptoms they may be experiencing. Component symptom scale scores (e.g. musculoskeletal pain, cognitive problems, weight problems) will be determined by calculating the average score of the items that make up each scale. The symptom scale scores will range from 0 to 4. A total score for all the items will be calculated by adding the scores across all symptoms. Thus, the total scores will range from 0 to 172, with higher scores reflecting greater symptom severity.</description>

    <ipd_description>The research team will share data associated with self-reports (e.g. demographics, stress levels) and adherence by depositing the data at the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), which is an NIH-funded repository. All data and documentation will be de-identified and will be consistent with applicable laws and regulations. Submitted data will confirm with relevant data and terminology standards.&#xD;
This data will be shared with investigators working under an institution with a Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) and could be used for secondary study purposes. The study team agrees that the names and Institutions of persons either given or denied access to the data, and the bases for such decisions, will be summarized in the annual progress report.&#xD;
We agree to deposit and maintain the phenotypic data and secondary analysis of data (if any) at ICPSR. The repository has data access policies and procedures consistent with NIH data sharing policies.</ipd_description>
