  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis Obliterative Syndrome (BOS) is the primary noninfectious pulmonary complication&#xD;
      after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and usually carries a poor prognosis. It&#xD;
      occurs in about 10% of children underwent HSCT. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)&#xD;
      published guidelines and criteria for the diagnosis of BOS. BOS defined by spirometric&#xD;
      criteria according to modified NIH consensus guidelines: FEV1 &lt; 75% predicted and a greater&#xD;
      than 10% decline from pretransplant baseline, and FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7 (FCV: Forced Vital Capacity).&#xD;
      Nevertheless Cheng and al. indicate that the magnitude of FEV1 decline before diagnosis&#xD;
      exceeded the diagnostic requirement of a greater than 10% decline compared with baseline FEV.&#xD;
      Moreover, the decline in FEV1 prior to BOS diagnosis appeared to occur within 6 months for&#xD;
      those patients. Recent studies suggest that any intervention should be targeted during the&#xD;
      FEV1 decline, and before the diagnosis of BOS. For this, inhalated treatment are used:&#xD;
      Bergeron et al. reported improvements in symptoms as well in FEV1 one month followed&#xD;
      treatment including formoterol and budesonide in a prospective trial including adults (12%&#xD;
      increase of FEV1 for 62% adults). Williams and al. in another prospective adult's cohort,&#xD;
      showed that the association between fluticasone, montelukast and azythromycin was associated&#xD;
      with stable lung function, reduced systemic corticosteroids, and improved quality of life at&#xD;
      3 months for adults with BOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our national French prospective cohort which include 300 children with HSCT from 2014 to&#xD;
      2017 (RESPPEDHEM Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique 2012), 35% of children presented&#xD;
      a decline of FEV1≥ 10% without BOS criteria (FEV1 &lt; 75% and FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7). Among them, some&#xD;
      received combination of corticoids and long acting beta agonists for 6 months. Children with&#xD;
      this type of inhalated treatment improved their FEV1 to 88.1% predicted while children&#xD;
      without any treatment have a FEV1 at 80.7% predicted. Our hypothesis is that association of&#xD;
      Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol can be used as a treatment of the decline of FEV1 for&#xD;
      children and so prevent BOS.&#xD;

      It's a prospective randomized double blind, multicentre, parallel-group in a 1:1 ratio,&#xD;
      controlled and superiority trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the effect of a Fluticasone Propionate associated with&#xD;
      Salmeterol using inhalation chamber compared to placebo on respiratory function at 6 months&#xD;
      in children over six years of age who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation with a decline of FEV1 ≥ 10% from pre transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary criterion will be the difference in the FEV1% predicted value from inclusion to 6&#xD;
      months following the initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of a Fluticasone Propionate associated with Salmeterol using inhalation&#xD;
      chamber compared to placebo in children over six years old underwent allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation with a decline of FEV1 ≥ 10% from pre transplantation baseline to 6&#xD;
      months following the initiation of treatment, and 6 months after the end of treatment, on&#xD;
      pulmonary function, respiratory symptoms, Bronchiolitis Obliterative Syndrome (BOS) rate,&#xD;
      oral steroid exposure and occurrence of infections;&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess potential confounding factors associated to the 6-months inhaled treatment efficacy&#xD;
      from baseline to 12 months, especially:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - GVHD (Graft Versus Host Disease) occurrence, severity and treatment (steroid dose exposure,&#xD;
      calcineurins inhibitors dose, second line of GVHD treatment); To assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the treatment at baseline, M1, M3 and M6 following the initiation of&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      All endpoints were collected at baseline, randomization, 1, 3, 6 months during the treatment&#xD;
      period, and then 3, 6 months after the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Endpoints relative to respiratory symptoms :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  dyspnea will be evaluate at the NYHA (New York Heart Association) scoring;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  step test (patient climb up and down step during three minutes at the frequency of&#xD;
                30/mn) : Respiratory rate, dyspnea Heart rate, SaO2 (oxygen saturation) during the&#xD;
                exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endpoints relative to pulmonary function :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FEV1 (Forced expiratory volume) VC (Vital Capacity) , TLC (Total Lung capacity) ,&#xD;
                RV (Residual volume), FRC (Functional Residual Capacity), sRaw (specific airway&#xD;
                resistance) DLCO (diffusing capacity of the lungs) using a similar method of&#xD;
                measurement for static lung volumes (plethysmography)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of patients presented with BOS defined as the absence of infection, and FEV1&#xD;
                &lt; 75% predicted, and the FEV1/ FVC &lt; 0.7, and the RV &gt;120% or air trapping or&#xD;
                bronchiectasis or small airways thickening on computed tomography&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endpoints relative to GVHD :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute and Chronic GVHD manifestations defined on NIH consensus with scoring;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  First line of treatment: cumulative dose of corticosteroid systemic exposure and&#xD;
                cumulative dose of calcineurins inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Second line of GVHD treatment exposure will be assessed using the other type of&#xD;
                treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Endpoints relative to respiratory infections :&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Number of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Endpoints relative to safety and tolerance:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adverse events during the study period such as treatment tolerance, thrush, death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study patients over six years of age who underwent allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a decline of FEV1 ≥10% from pre transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of this range of age is motivated by the fact that PFTs (Pulmonary Function Test)&#xD;
      requires a degree of cooperation that is age dependent, only children who are 6 years of age&#xD;
      or older are able to realize reproducible PFTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children between 6 to 11 years (&lt; 12 years): 50 μg inhaled fluticasone propionate and 25&#xD;
      μg salmeterol (SERETIDE® 50/25) :two puffs twice a day from randomisation during 6 months&#xD;
      using inhalation chamber&#xD;
&#xD;
      - For children between 12 to 17 years (&gt; or = 12 years) : 125 μg inhaled fluticasone&#xD;
      propionate and 25 μg salmeterol (SERETIDE® 125/25): two puffs twice a day from randomisation&#xD;
      during 6 months using inhalation chamber For children between 6 to 11 years (&lt; 12 years):&#xD;
      placebo of SERETIDE® 50/25 :two puffs twice a day from randomisation during 6 months using&#xD;
      inhalation chamber For children between 12 to 17 years (&gt; or = 12 years) : placebo of&#xD;
      SERETIDE® 125/25: two puffs twice a day from randomisation during 6 months using inhalation&#xD;
      chamber&#xD;
