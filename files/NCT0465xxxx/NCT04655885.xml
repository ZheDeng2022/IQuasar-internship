  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major hepatectomies are high-risk surgeries offered more and more frequently for the curative&#xD;
      treatment of primary or secondary liver cancer, and for complex cases, representing a real&#xD;
      challenge for medical teams. The 1st peroperative phase of &quot;hepatic resection&quot; requires a&#xD;
      minimum supply of filling fluids to limit perioperative bleeding (Low Central Venous&#xD;
      Pressure). However this strategy exposes the risk of organ hypoperfusion due to low cardiac&#xD;
      flow, secondary to hypovolaemia, which may lead to ischemic situations favoring the onset of&#xD;
      postoperative complications. On the other hand, the hemodynamic management of the 2nd&#xD;
      peroperative phase &quot;post hepatic resection&quot; is marked by the need to correct this&#xD;
      hypoperfusion by optimizing cardiac output by suitable vascular filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major challenge is thus to restore cardiac output by refilling without excess, by&#xD;
      correcting the hypovolemia that arose during the &quot;post resection of the hepatic parenchyma&quot;&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that an individualized protocol for optimizing intraoperative cardiac flow&#xD;
      by guided vascular filling during the &quot;post hepatic resection&quot; phase is accompanied by a&#xD;
      reduction in postoperative complications in patients operated on for major hepatic surgery.&#xD;
