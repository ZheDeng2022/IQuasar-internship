      What is Impact of Amount Versus Surface Area of Liposuction on Haematological Parameters,&#xD;
      Coagulopathy Profile and Electrolyte Balance? Liposuction involves the creation of extensive&#xD;
      subsurface trauma, comparable in many respects to the massive injury of an internal burn.&#xD;
      Liposuction commences with cannula aspiration of several liters of fluid-engorged adipose&#xD;
      tissue, during which small feeder vessels are inevitably torn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating on multiple areas increases the area of injury regardless of whether just small&#xD;
      amounts of fat are removed. Because many of the complications associated with large volume&#xD;
      liposuction are related to fluid shifts and fluid balance, classifying the procedure based on&#xD;
      the total volume removed from the patient, including fat, wetting solution, and blood, makes&#xD;
      more sense to evaluate the damage made by the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and aesthetic issues define large-volume liposuction as having a 5,000-ml aspirate,&#xD;
      mega-volume liposuction as having an 8,000-ml aspirate, and giganto-volume liposuction as&#xD;
      having an aspirate of 12,000 ml or more.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Liposuction is fat- removing aesthetic surgery procedure that aims to body contouring.&#xD;
      Liposuction is the most frequently performed aesthetic surgery procedure in Western&#xD;
      Countries. This technique has had rapid development since the 1970s, when it was experimented&#xD;
      for the first time by A. and G. Fischer. It is currently widely used in clinical practice for&#xD;
      many different situations in aesthetic, reconstructive and functional fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1970s, fat removal was carried out with a blunt curette. This technique was modified in&#xD;
      1977 by a French surgeon, Yves Gerard Illouz, who added hyaluronidase and saline to emulsify&#xD;
      the fatty tissue, and hence facilitate aspiration with the use of liposuction cannula. This&#xD;
      was termed the 'wet technique' and was introduced to reduce blood loss during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current options for wetting solutions are dry, wet, superwet, and tumescent. The dry&#xD;
      technique employs no wetting solution and has few indications in liposuction. The wet&#xD;
      technique involves instillation of 200 to 300 mL of solution per area to be treated,&#xD;
      regardless of the amount aspirated. The superwet technique employs an infiltration of 1 mL&#xD;
      per estimated mL of expected aspirate, and this is the technique practiced at our&#xD;
      institution. Tumescent infiltration, popularized by Klein, involves infiltration of wetting&#xD;
      solution that creates significant tissue turgor and results in infiltration of 3 to 4 mL of&#xD;
      wetting solution per mL aspirated. Regardless of technique, the infiltrate should be allowed&#xD;
      to take effect for seven minutes prior to suctioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies consider the most important parameter, to determine the safety of liposuction,&#xD;
      is the amount (volume) of aspirated fluid. A review of the scientific literature shows that&#xD;
      there are no scientific data available to support a specific volume maximum at which point&#xD;
      liposuction is no longer safe, although the risk of complications is unavoidably higher as&#xD;
      the volume of aspirate and the number of anatomic sites treated increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and aesthetic issues define large-volume liposuction as having a 5,000-ml aspirate,&#xD;
      mega-volume liposuction as having an 8,000-ml aspirate, and giganto-volume liposuction as&#xD;
      having an aspirate of 12,000 ml or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In large volume liposuction, there is potential for large fluid shifts secondary to the&#xD;
      volume of tissue removed, with a risk of developing pulmonary edema, high-volume liposuction&#xD;
      is significantly more prone to complications than the original form of liposuction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a long history of debate over the safe volume of fat tissue that can be removed by&#xD;
      liposuction. Current ASPS guidelines define 5,000 milliliters (five liters) as &quot;large-volume&#xD;
      liposuction&quot; potentially associated with a higher risk of complications. But the guidelines&#xD;
      acknowledge there is no scientific data to support an absolute cutoff point. Patients with&#xD;
      complications had larger liposuction volumes-average 3.4 liters-and higher BMIs. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing &quot;large-volume&quot; liposuction of more than five liters had a higher overall&#xD;
      complication rate: 3.7 versus 1.1 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, liposuction involves the creation of extensive subsurface trauma,&#xD;
      comparable in many respects to the massive injury of an internal burn. Liposuction commences&#xD;
      with cannula aspiration of several liters of fluid-engorged adipose tissue, during which&#xD;
      small feeder vessels are inevitably torn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only few studies have mentioned the effect of surface area on liposuction and none of those&#xD;
      studies have been published at certified impacted magazine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study considers the amount of liposuction is a constant factor (Large volume&#xD;
      liposuction) and the surface area is the variant to detect the changes in hemogram,&#xD;
      coagulation profile and electrolyte imbalance that may lead to possible complication.&#xD;
