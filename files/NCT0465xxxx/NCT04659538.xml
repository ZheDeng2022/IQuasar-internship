  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a First in Human study with the Filerlex CAPTIS device designed to demonstrate the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of the device in subjects undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve&#xD;
      Replacement (TAVR)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi center, single arm, FIH safety and feasibility study enrolling&#xD;
      up to 20 patients. Patients undergoing clinically indicated TAVR who comply with the study&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled to have embolic protection with the CAPTIS®&#xD;
      Device during the TAVR procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening activities will include initial screening by the site, analysis of patient CT scan&#xD;
      by the sponsor and core-lab, and review of the clinical and imaging data by an eligibility&#xD;
      committee to confirm that all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Final eligibility for&#xD;
      study enrollment is then determined by the investigator in the cardiac catheterization&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will undergo safety assessment during the procedure, post-procedure, and at&#xD;
      30 days post-procedure; Feasibility evaluation will be assessed during procedure.&#xD;
