  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine treatment safety and efficacy of MR-HIFU ablation of painful Osteoid Osteoma&#xD;
      (OO) in children and young adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoid Osteoma (OO) is a benign, but painful, bone tumor commonly occurring in children and&#xD;
      young adults. Definitive treatment options are CT-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and&#xD;
      less commonly, open surgical resection. RFA is less invasive than surgery, but it still&#xD;
      requires drilling from the skin through muscle and bone. It also exposes the patient and&#xD;
      operator to ionizing radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) provides precise and&#xD;
      controlled delivery of focused ultrasound energy inside a lesion using an external&#xD;
      applicator, without any incisions or drilling. MR-HIFU has been successfully used to treat&#xD;
      painful bone metastases in adult clinical trials. Several recent reports, including two&#xD;
      publications from our group, show that MR-HIFU is a feasible and safe treatment for OO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR-HIFU ablation of OO may provide a better alternative to surgical resection or RFA as it is&#xD;
      completely non-invasive and does not require ionizing radiation. These two qualities of&#xD;
      MR-HIFU are especially beneficial in growing children and young adults. Furthermore, MR-HIFU&#xD;
      OO ablation is quick, with expected total procedure time of less than two hours. Such short&#xD;
      treatments offer additional safety benefits from reduced anesthesia / sedation requirement&#xD;
      compared to surgery and RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's group has performed the first pilot clinical trial in the U.S. to evaluate&#xD;
      MR-HIFU treatment for painful osteoid osteoma (PI: K.V. Sharma, NCT02349971). This trial&#xD;
      shows that MR-HIFU ablation is feasible, well tolerated, and can be safely performed in a&#xD;
      pediatric cohort. Based on these results, the investigators propose a pivotal clinical trial&#xD;
      designed to evaluate treatment efficacy as the next logical step required for clinical&#xD;
      translation. The investigators hypothesize that noninvasive and radiation-free MR-HIFU&#xD;
      ablation for osteoid osteoma will be a clinically effective treatment, with success rate&#xD;
      comparable to that currently reported for RFA.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will undergo MR-HIFU ablation procedure of OO under general anesthesia. Patients will be monitored for disease status and adverse events for 12 months following procedure. Patients with incomplete or partial response at 28 days after MR-HIFU will be permitted a second MR-HIFU procedure.&#xD;
If there is still incomplete pain relief without medication use by 28 days following the second MR-HIFU treatment, patients will be offered standard of care treatment with RFA and followed for one year.</description>

    <description>MR-HIFU is an innovative technology that allows for non-invasive thermal ablation of tissues and tumors by integrating an external high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer with a conventional MRI scanner.&#xD;
The focused ultrasound transducer is placed outside of the body and generates and focuses acoustic energy to heat tumors or other pre-defined focal regions of tissues inside the body. Because the acoustic energy is precisely focused over tiny areas of tissue, potential thermal injury to surrounding tissues is minimal. Cell death inside the selected treatment area occurs via coagulative necrosis while avoiding injury to intervening and adjacent tissues.</description>
