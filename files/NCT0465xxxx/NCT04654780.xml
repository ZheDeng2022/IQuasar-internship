      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of taxes on unhealthy foods and subsidies for&#xD;
      healthy foods in modifying the purchasing and consumption behavior of people in the&#xD;
      Metropolitan Region, Chile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The application of a tax that increases the price of &quot;High in&quot; foods by 20% will reduce&#xD;
           the purchase and consumption of these foods by 24%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The application of a subsidy that reduces the price of fruits and vegetables by 20% will&#xD;
           increase the purchase and consumption of these foods by 17%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. People of lower socioeconomic status are more sensitive to price changes than people of&#xD;
           higher socioeconomic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological design. The research proposal proposes an experimental design that will select&#xD;
      the participants from a panel composed of people over 18 years of age, men and women, and of&#xD;
      all socioeconomic levels. The methodological design considers a random assignment of the&#xD;
      people eligible for the study into 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First group of intervention (GI1): people who will make their purchases with taxes on&#xD;
           food and beverages &quot;High in&quot;;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second intervention group (GI2): people who will make their purchases with subsidies for&#xD;
           fruits and vegetables;&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Control group (CG) that will make the purchases with the market prices or currently&#xD;
      applied by the supermarkets or purchase scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. Participants will make a monthly simulated purchase through a simulated&#xD;
      supermarket system with products similar to those found in real supermarkets, including &quot;High&#xD;
      in&quot; products and fruits and vegetables. Different prices will be applied to each group&#xD;
      depending on the type of food. With the data of simulated purchases, a variation of the&#xD;
      demand and by socioeconomic subgroup will be calculated. The results will be compared with&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. GI1 participants are expected to modify their purchase intention with the&#xD;
      &quot;High in&quot; food tax, decreasing the purchase of these products in their simulated purchases,&#xD;
      compared to CG participants who will make their simulated purchases without taxes. Likewise,&#xD;
      IG2 participants are expected to modify their purchase intention with the fruit and vegetable&#xD;
      subsidy, increasing the purchase of these foods, compared to CG participants. Finally, it is&#xD;
      assumed that the reduction in simulated purchases of &quot;High in&quot; foods and the increase in&#xD;
      simulated purchases of fruits and vegetables vary according to socioeconomic level.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Experimental design that simulates real purchase scenarios to evaluate the effects of a fiscal policy on purchase intention. Participants will be randomly assigned to the different intervention and control groups. Each participant must make a purchase in the virtual supermarket.&#xD;
The study groups used in this research :&#xD;
First intervention group (IG1), a &quot;High in&quot; food tax will be applied to study the changes in the purchasing and consumption behavior of the participants in this group. The tax will correspond to a 20% increase over the market price, that is, a tax that reaches the levels recommended by the WHO.&#xD;
second intervention group (IG2), a subsidy will be applied to fruits and vegetables that means a reduction of 20% in their price, to study the changes in the purchasing and consumption behavior of the participants of said group.&#xD;
control group (CG) the market or current prices of &quot;High in&quot; foods and subsidies of fruits and vegetables will be applied.</intervention_model_description>
