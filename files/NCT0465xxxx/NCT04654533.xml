  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of an attachment research-informed&#xD;
      intervention adapted to the Danish childcare context in terms of improving the interaction&#xD;
      quality between childcare providers and 0-2-year-old children in center-based childcare. The&#xD;
      intervention is delivered in groups over eight weekly sessions and is based on the manualized&#xD;
      Circle of Security Parenting model, but adapted to the childcare context: Circle of Security&#xD;
      Classroom. Intake is planned to be completed in January 2023 and 110 childcare providers are&#xD;
      estimated to be enrolled in the trial.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well-established that children's early attachment relationship experiences with their&#xD;
      primary caregivers play an important role in psycho-social development. However, it has been&#xD;
      shown that also the child's relationship with other important caregivers, such as early&#xD;
      childcare providers (CPs), are important for socioemotional and academic development. In&#xD;
      particular, if a child grows up in an at-risk context the quality of early childcare is&#xD;
      pivotal for long-term development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with an insecure attachment to their parents are at heightened risk for developing&#xD;
      insecure attachments to their CP. Yet, CP interactive behavior (level of sensitivity) is&#xD;
      shown to be associated with CP-child attachment security, irrespective of the child's&#xD;
      attachment relationship to the primary caregiver. Therefore, CP interactive skills provide an&#xD;
      important target of intervention in terms of promoting healthy child development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized waitlist control trial, this study aims to 1) evaluate the efficacy of an&#xD;
      attachment-based professional development intervention, Circle of Security Classroom (COSC),&#xD;
      on early CPs' interactive skills; 2) investigate how structural factors, such as group size,&#xD;
      child-adult ratio, and staff stability moderate effects of the intervention; and 3) evaluate&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of COSC when implemented in a busy real-life context, that is,&#xD;
      in Danish early childcare centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Childcare centers are recruited from a Danish municipality with a high proportion of at-risk&#xD;
      families. Teams of 2-5 CPs working in Danish childcare centers are allocated to either COSC&#xD;
      (eight weekly two-hour sessions) or a waitlist. A total of 110 childcare providers are&#xD;
      estimated to be enrolled, and the intervention will be delivered in groups of 6-10 childcare&#xD;
      providers. To facilitate implementation, the managers of the participating childcare&#xD;
      providers are invited to participate in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of COSC are measured using observations of video-recorded caregiver-child interaction&#xD;
      (coded for six key interactive skills: Sensitive responsiveness, Respect for autonomy,&#xD;
      structuring and limit setting, Verbal communication, Developmental stimulation, and Fostering&#xD;
      positive peer interactions). Structural factors are measured using observation and&#xD;
      questionnaires answered by childcare providers and managers. Feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      the intervention are evaluated using questionnaires and in qualitative interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will provide new knowledge on whether a relatively cost-effective intervention&#xD;
      can improve the quality of care in Danish childcare centers for young children. Also,&#xD;
      findings on how structural factors influence the quality of care will directly inform&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

    <description>COSC is professional development program for early childcare providers adapted from the Circle of Security-Parenting (COSP) model. It is a manualized intervention that leverages research on attachment relationships combining psycho-education with a mentalization-based approach. The model uses pre-produced video vignettes of secure and problematic caregiver-child interactions to illustrate how caregivers' may struggle in meeting children's' attachment needs.&#xD;
Participants are invited to reflect on how they meet and perhaps still not meet the needs of the children in their care with a particular focus on the challenging or 'difficult' children.&#xD;
The COSP manual has been translated into Danish (Cooper, Hoffman and Powel, 2020, translated by Pedersen, Kronendorf von Wowern, Lier, &amp; Smith-Nielsen), and the additional COSC material has been translated into Danish for the purpose of this study.</description>
