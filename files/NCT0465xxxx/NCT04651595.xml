      upplementing general anaesthesia with caudal analgesia in sphincter sparing procedures might&#xD;
      be useful as it will provide a satisfactory combination of sphincter muscle tone&#xD;
      preservation, good intraoperative and postoperative analgesia along with a reduction in the&#xD;
      consumption of opioids and anaesthetic drugs. To the best of our knowledge, this anaesthetic&#xD;
      technique was not tested in sphincter sparing procedures before.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anal fistulae, defined as an abnormal connection between the distal alimentary tract and the&#xD;
      integument, are among the common illnesses affecting the anal canal, with a prevalence rate&#xD;
      of 8.6 cases per 100,000.1 Usually, anorectal fistulae are safely and reliably treated by&#xD;
      fistulotomy. One of the common complications of fistulotomy is incontinence due to sphincter&#xD;
      injury, with an incidence reaching up to 12%2. Moreover, this technique is not well suited&#xD;
      for complex anal fistulae due to the prevalent risk of incontinence reaching up to 50%2. That&#xD;
      created the need for sphincter sparing procedures to evolve which do not involve division of&#xD;
      any portion of the sphincter complex, thus evolvement of an anaesthetic technique which&#xD;
      spares the presence of muscle tone, and provides good postoperative analgesia.2,3 The choice&#xD;
      of anaesthetic technique for sphincter sparing procedures is challenging. Regional&#xD;
      anaesthetic techniques such as saddle, lumbar epidural, and caudal blocks are considered well&#xD;
      tolerable and reliable for anorectal surgery. Lumbar epidural local anaesthesia does not&#xD;
      produce a uniform anaesthetic effect across the spinal segments as the large size of the L5&#xD;
      and S1 nerve roots may be resistant to the local anaesthetic effect and The cranial spread of&#xD;
      lumbar epidural anaesthesia is somewhat more extensive than the caudal spread which suggest&#xD;
      that the onset of the block of the caudal sacral segments may be later than that of the&#xD;
      lumbar segments. 4On the other hand, saddle anaesthesia is the preferred route for most of&#xD;
      the anorectal surgeries as it abolishes the muscle tone5; however, loss of the muscle tone&#xD;
      consequently increases the possibility of the external anal sphincter injury in complex anal&#xD;
      fistulas. Thus; sphincter sparing procedures are usually performed under general anaesthesia&#xD;
      omitting neuromuscular blocking agents in order to preserve sphincter tone intraoperatively.6&#xD;
      However, the choice of general anaesthesia for this procedure still lacks adequate&#xD;
      postoperative analgesic plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caudal block is not a commonly used route for analgesia in adults due to the evolution of&#xD;
      lumbar epidural block5. The introduction of ultrasound for guiding different blocks,&#xD;
      including caudal block had increased the use of caudal block7 especially when sacral nerve&#xD;
      spread of anaesthetics is preferred over lumbar nerve spread8. Modern epidural dosing&#xD;
      regimens (e.g. 0.0625% to 0.1 % bupivacaine with 2-4 mcg/ml fentanyl) 6,9 reduce the total&#xD;
      local anaesthetic dose required and motor block experienced; potentially allowing the patient&#xD;
      to be ambulatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, Supplementing general anaesthesia with caudal analgesia in sphincter sparing&#xD;
      procedures might be useful as it will provide a satisfactory combination of sphincter muscle&#xD;
      tone preservation, good intraoperative and postoperative analgesia along with a reduction in&#xD;
      the consumption of opioids and anaesthetic drugs. To the best of our knowledge, this&#xD;
      anaesthetic technique was not tested in sphincter sparing procedures before.&#xD;
