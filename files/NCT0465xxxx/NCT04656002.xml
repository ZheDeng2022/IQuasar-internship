      This clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subjects with metastatic&#xD;
      gastric adenocarcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction. In addition, this&#xD;
      clinical trial is performed to analyze the genome-specific response rate and genome analysis&#xD;
      to identify predictive markers that respond to investigational drug administration.&#xD;
