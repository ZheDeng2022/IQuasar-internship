    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to assess the role of plasma concentration&#xD;
      monitoring of treatment drugs for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in&#xD;
      terms of efficacy and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators intend to evaluate the role of anti-drug antibodies, amount of&#xD;
      bound drug to T lymphocytes and receptor polymorphisms in CTLA-4 and PD-1 receptors in&#xD;
      treatment failure among patients with mRCC treated with check point immunotherapy. Moreover,&#xD;
      polymorphisms in the UGT1A1 gene will be correlated with the pazopanib treatment dose.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is ineffective among 25 % of patients.&#xD;
      However, treatment still reduces patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From clinical experience, interindividual dose requirements vary greatly among patients with&#xD;
      mRCC treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect this to partly be explained by great variation in the plasma&#xD;
      concentration of treatment drugs. Furthermore, treatment failure among patients with mRCC&#xD;
      treated with check point immunotherapy has not been fully investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The few studies concerning plasma concentration measurement of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in&#xD;
      patients with mRCC have found that a certain level of drug concentration is necessary for&#xD;
      treatment efficacy. The role of plasma concentration in side effects is yet unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti drug antibodies against the check point inhibitor ipilimumab has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      efficacy and lead to treatment failure among patients with malignant melanoma. The role of&#xD;
      check point inhibitor binding to T lymphocytes and receptor polymorphism in CTLA-4 and PD-1&#xD;
      receptors in terms of efficacy have not yet been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A therapeutic drug interval will allow for quicker and more precise dosing, and early signs&#xD;
      of treatment failure of checkpoint immunotherapy will allow for quicker change of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients treated with TKIs and CPI for more than 6 months have an optimal plasma trough&#xD;
           concentration. Objective response rate, progression free survival (PFS), overall&#xD;
           survival (OS), and toxicity in these patients are favorable compared with pivotal phase&#xD;
           III study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients treated with CPI obtaining response have a higher plasma trough concentration&#xD;
           value of ipilimumab and nivolumab than patients with progressive disease (PD). Patients&#xD;
           treated with CPI who develop PD have a higher amount of ADA than patients with response&#xD;
           to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The greater the amount of bound CPI to T lymphocytes the better the efficacy of CPI on&#xD;
           clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Certain polymorphisms in CTLA-4 and PD-1 are associated with poor outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. UGT1A1 polymorphism is associated with improved survival despite dose reductions in&#xD;
           patients treated with pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will have blood samples drawn at each clinical visit during a 6-months&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma concentration of TKIs will be measured with liquid chromatography-mass&#xD;
      spectrometry at the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Aarhus University Hospital.&#xD;
      Analysis of checkpoint immunotherapy will be be done using in-house bead-based assays,&#xD;
      anti-human IgG detection antibody and in-house developed flow cytometry-based assay at the&#xD;
      Institute for Inflammation Research at Rigshospitalet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival, progression free survival and quality of life using FKSI-19 questionnaire&#xD;
      will be recorded for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study among all Danish patients treated for mRCC over a two year&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
