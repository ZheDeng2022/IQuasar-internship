  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that gabapentin when given orally as a premedication in patients who perform&#xD;
      posterior segment eye surgery under peribulbar block would provide adequate anxiolysis and&#xD;
      arousable sedation as alprazolam and dexmedetomidine with minimal side effects .&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principle goal of sedation for eye surgery is to prepare the patients to stay calm during&#xD;
      surgery. Both insufficient sedation and deep sedation may lead to sudden movements by&#xD;
      patients, which may potentially result in harmful complications during eye surgery. Several&#xD;
      drugs such as propofol, opioids, and dexmedetomidine have been used for sedation during this&#xD;
      procedure [1]. However, each of these drugs has its own limitations, leading to impairment of&#xD;
      patient's cooperation during surgery. Therefore, the potential clinical advantages of&#xD;
      newly-marketed therapeutic drugs should be thoroughly evaluated. [2] Benzodiazepines are&#xD;
      amongst the most popular preoperative medication to produce anxiolysis, amnesia, and sedation&#xD;
      for the patients coming for surgery [3]. Benzodiazepines are reported to be paradoxically&#xD;
      associated with the increased episodes of arousal during sleep, restlessness, and hangover&#xD;
      effects [4]. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine class of antipsychotic drugs, is more&#xD;
      anxioselective than the other premedicants of this group like midazolam, lorazepam, or&#xD;
      diazepam [5]. It has also been reported to show arousal episodes and may cause psychomotor&#xD;
      impairment which is a disadvantage to be used in elderly in general and in day case in&#xD;
      particular [4,6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gabapentin is well-tolerated drug that is associated with anxiolytic and antinociceptive&#xD;
      properties [2]. It is reported that gabapentin has anxiolytic [7] and antinociceptive effects&#xD;
      [8,9]. In another study, it is claimed that this drug does not depress respiration with no&#xD;
      effect on gastric mucosa, platelets, and renal function [9]. Moreover, gabapentin seems to be&#xD;
      an anxiolytic without amnesic effects which is an important advantage for elderly patients.&#xD;
      Leung and colleagues reported that delirium is significantly less in patients receiving&#xD;
      gabapentin before spine surgery[10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective α2 agonist, has been widely used as a sedative in a&#xD;
      variety of clinical settings owing to its analgesic properties, minimal respiratory&#xD;
      depression and easy arousability [11,12].Hypotension and bradycardia, the most frequent side&#xD;
      effects of dexmedetomidine [12], occur in a dose-related manner [13,14]. To avoid these side&#xD;
      effects, a dose adjustment is required. For procedural sedation, a loading dose of 0.25μg/kg&#xD;
      over 10 min followed by maintenance dose of 0.25μg/kg/h provides an adequate level of&#xD;
      sedation, stable hemodynamics and better surgeon satisfaction [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we planned to compare the sedative effects of oral gabapentin, alprazolam and&#xD;
      intravenous of dexmedetomidine on various parameters including anxiety, sedation and&#xD;
      orientation. In our literature review, we could not find any study comparing the effect of&#xD;
      gabapentin and alprazolam on anxiety, pain, sedation scores, satisfaction of surgeon, and&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters in posterior segment eye surgery under peribulbar block.&#xD;
