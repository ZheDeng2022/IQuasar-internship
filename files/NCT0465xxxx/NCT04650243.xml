    <textblock>
      This study explores the feasibility of the reducing medication regimen for Ursodeoxycholic&#xD;
      Acid(UDCA) in the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. The participants will be&#xD;
      distributed randomly into two experimental groups and one control group. The two experimental&#xD;
      groups will receive reduced dosage of UDCA at different level, while the control group will&#xD;
      receive standard dosage of UDCA. The effect of therapy will be evaluated every three months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic, progressive liver disease of autoimmune origin&#xD;
      characterized by nonpurulent destruction of intrahepatic ductule, lymphatic infiltration of&#xD;
      portal area and long-term intrahepatic cholestasis leading to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in&#xD;
      absence of treatment. The diagnosis is made in the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies&#xD;
      (AMA) coupled with an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a histologic confirmation being&#xD;
      mandatory only in seronegative cases or overlap syndrome. Treatment is based on&#xD;
      ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and obeticholic acid, which are proved effective in improving&#xD;
      biochemical index and preventing disease progression. While obeticholic acid is only approved&#xD;
      in USA and Canada, UDCA seem to be the only choice for PBC patients in China. Study has shown&#xD;
      that liver function improvement can be expected in six to nine months when patients receive&#xD;
      standard dosage( 13 -15mg/kg/d) of UDCA. Recovery of liver function takes two years in 20% of&#xD;
      patients ,and five years in 15% to 35% of patients. Lifetime medication is recommended among&#xD;
      patients with good respond to UDCA, while the high cost has placed great burden on patients&#xD;
      as well as the medical service system. Exploration of the reducing medication regimen of UDCA&#xD;
      among stable PBC patients is of great significance under this circumstance. In our study, the&#xD;
      90 recruited patients of refractory PBC will be distributed randomly into two experimental&#xD;
      groups and one control group. The two experimental groups will receive reduced dosage of UDCA&#xD;
      at 250mg bid and 250mg qd respectively, while the control group will receive standard dosage&#xD;
      of UDCA. The effect of therapy will be evaluated every three months, which includes&#xD;
      assessment of symptoms, life quality, disease progression, complete blood count, urinalysis,&#xD;
      liver biochemical markers (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, TBIL, DBIL, TP, ALB), blood lipid (CHO, TG,&#xD;
      LDL, HDL), immunoglobulins, ESR, AMA, liver morphology and cirrhosis degree, along with&#xD;
      peripheral T lymphocyte subpopulations and cytokines test.&#xD;
