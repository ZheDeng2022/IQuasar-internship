      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy on hematologic manifestations of imiglucerase treatment in&#xD;
           Chinese patients who are diagnosed as Gaucher disease type Ⅲ&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety profile of imiglucerase in maximum dose in the label (60U/kg, IV&#xD;
           biweekly) in Chinese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy on viscera manifestations of imiglucerase treatment in Chinese&#xD;
           patients who are diagnosed as Gaucher disease type Ⅲ&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy on bone disease of imiglucerase treatment in Chinese patients&#xD;
           who are diagnosed as Gaucher disease type Ⅲ&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect on quality of life of imiglucerase treatment in Chinese patients&#xD;
           who are diagnosed as Gaucher disease type Ⅲ&#xD;
