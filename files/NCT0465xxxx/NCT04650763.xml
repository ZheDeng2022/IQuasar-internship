      To study the effect of platelet-rich plasma concentrate on marginal bone loss and bone&#xD;
      mineral density in immediate implant placement through CBCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      12 subjects were equally categorized into two groups. Group, I was the control group;&#xD;
      whereas, the subjects in Group II received Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy. All subjects&#xD;
      were given a standard treatment with single implant system. Inserted implants were analyzed&#xD;
      through Cone Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT). Records were registered at the baseline, at&#xD;
      12th week before functional loading and 26th week after functional loading.&#xD;
