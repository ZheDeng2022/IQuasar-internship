  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a common and progressive condition associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Only 25-35% of patients survive 5 years after diagnosis.Sleep&#xD;
      disorders are frequently found in this population with up to 94% of patients complaining of&#xD;
      sleep disorders. Of these, insomnia and sleep disorders are the most common. The frequency of&#xD;
      restless legs syndrome (RLS) varies between 4 and 40% depending on the studies. Patients with&#xD;
      HF frequently experience poor sleep quality which is associated with deterioration in quality&#xD;
      of life, alertness, and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have examined the prognostic impact of sleep disturbances in this population. A&#xD;
      greater morbidity and mortality is observed in the event of poor quality sleep or in the&#xD;
      presence of sleep breathing disorders .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose to evaluate the sleep disorders of patients with HF by&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaires, hypothesizing that complaints of poor sleep are linked to a&#xD;
      poorer cardiovascular prognosis.&#xD;
