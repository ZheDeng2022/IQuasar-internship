  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global older adult population has grown more than any other age group, which could be&#xD;
      explained by the decrease of birth rate and increase of life expectancy. The healthy life&#xD;
      expectancy of older adult in Mexico is 65.8 years, and the population's life expectancy in&#xD;
      general is 74.4 years, this means that the population meeting that age is at increased risk&#xD;
      of developing some disease or dependence during approximately nine years of their life. For&#xD;
      the population over 60 years, the three most frequent health conditions reported were&#xD;
      hypertension (40%), diabetes (24.3%), and hypercholesterolemia (20.4%). In this sense, the&#xD;
      search for a healthy lifestyle is necessary, which includes a healthy diet that includes&#xD;
      supplementation with nutraceuticals and the daily practice of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding nutraceutical supplementation, the cyanobacterium Spirulina maxima (S. maxima) is&#xD;
      an important source of proteins, carotenoids, phenolic compounds and polyunsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids which have been tested for diverse biological activities such as lipid lowering&#xD;
      effects, however, existing studies of effects of S. maxima on body composition, physical&#xD;
      function and blood lipid profile in humans, mainly in older adults, have a low level of&#xD;
      evidence and absence of adequate experimental designs, so its value as a nutraceutical cannot&#xD;
      be assured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of performing systematic physical exercise in older adults have been shown to&#xD;
      have positive effects on body composition and blood lipid profile, so in the present study it&#xD;
      is proposed to evaluate the synergy presented by a supplement such as S. maxima in a&#xD;
      systematic physical exercise program on the body composition, physical function and blood&#xD;
      lipid profile of sedentary older adults with excess weight in a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      crossover, placebo controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to international estimations, there will be an increase in the aging population&#xD;
      worldwide; with projections of a growth in the population older than 60 years from 900&#xD;
      million in 2015 to two billion in 2050. This means that the older population will move from&#xD;
      12% to 22% of the global population. In Mexico, in the year 2000, people aged 60 and older&#xD;
      represented 6.8% of the total population, and an increase of 28% was expected by the year&#xD;
      2050; and only in Baja California State, there were 183,577 inhabitants 65 yr. old and older&#xD;
      (Men = 46.3%, Women = 53.7%). Data from a census in Baja California's cities of Mexicali and&#xD;
      Tijuana municipalities in 2015, showed the highest cluster of older adults above 65 yr.,&#xD;
      especially women. In Tijuana, there were 78,019 inhabitants over 65 years; with a projected&#xD;
      population by 2020 of 101,574, and 176,134 inhabitants by 2030. The healthy life expectancy&#xD;
      of the Mexican older adult is 65.8 years. This means that if the population's life expectancy&#xD;
      in general is 74.4 years, the population meeting that age is at increased risk of developing&#xD;
      some disease or dependence during approximately nine years of their life. For the population&#xD;
      over 60 years, the three most frequent health conditions reported were hypertension (40.0%),&#xD;
      diabetes (24.3%) and hypercholesterolemia (20.4%). These diseases affect all body systems and&#xD;
      prevent them from carrying out daily life activities such as walking, eating, preparing or&#xD;
      buying food, and bathing, among others. In this sense, the search for a healthy lifestyle is&#xD;
      necessary, which includes a healthy diet that includes supplementation with nutraceuticals&#xD;
      and the daily practice of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding supplementation with nutraceuticals, the cyanobacterium S. maxima is an important&#xD;
      source of antioxidants, currently associated with cardiovascular protection properties. For&#xD;
      centuries it has been cultivated and used as a nutritional supplement due to its content of&#xD;
      amino acids and essential fatty acids, vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids and phycocyanins.&#xD;
      Recently, studies on S. maxima have focused on verifying the biological activity of its&#xD;
      components, including hypolipidemic effects. However, most studies have been conducted in&#xD;
      animal models, with only a few studies focused on the biological effect in humans. However,&#xD;
      most studies have been conducted in animal models, with scarce studies focused on its effects&#xD;
      on humans. Previous researches have shown smaller adipose depots, lower blood lipid&#xD;
      concentrations, and lower body mass gain in mice administered with a high-fat diet and S.&#xD;
      maxima than in an high-fat diet mice control. Some studies have found a decrease in body&#xD;
      mass, waist circumference, plasma lipid levels, inflammation, and oxidative stress in&#xD;
      hypertensive obese patients with S. maxima supplementation (2 g for three months). However,&#xD;
      controlled studies focused on the effect of the administration of S. maxima and a systematic&#xD;
      exercise program in humans, have not yet been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on the potential effects of nutraceutical supplements are increasing in number. There&#xD;
      have been reported the effect of 2 g/day of S. maxima supplementation on 40 hypertension&#xD;
      subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial for three months. After the&#xD;
      intervention, they reported a significant reduction of body weight, BMI, and blood pressure&#xD;
      in the group supplemented with S. maxima, compared with that of the placebo group. Some&#xD;
      investigators studied the effect of Spirulina supplementation (1 g/day) during three months&#xD;
      on the body weight, BMI, and lipid profile in patients with dyslipidemia and reported a&#xD;
      significant decrease in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and cholesterol&#xD;
      associated with low-density lipoproteins (LDL-C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some Spirulina compounds can reduce the macrophages infiltration into visceral fat and&#xD;
      prevent the accumulation of liver lipids, resulting in weight reduction, specifically body&#xD;
      fat, and there has been proved the effect of Spirulina supplementation (2 g/day) during two&#xD;
      months on the serum lipid profile of 15 patients affected by type II diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      resulting in a significant reduction of TG, TC, LDL-C, and free fatty acid in blood&#xD;
      concentrations. By means of a better-structured trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the beneficial effects of Spirulina are attributed to its nutritional content, but&#xD;
      its action mechanisms are poorly understood. Some authors suggest that a possible component&#xD;
      responsible of the S. maxima hypolipidemic effect is C-phycocyanin protein, which improves&#xD;
      the blood lipid profile. Some authors suggest that C-phycocyanin increases endogenous enzymes&#xD;
      activity, scavenging free radicals, and downregulates cofactors in fat metabolism like&#xD;
      adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Spirulina hypolipidemic effects can be attributed to the fact&#xD;
      that dietary supplementation with the cyanobacteria seems to have decreased the intestinal&#xD;
      assimilation of cholesterol, probably because Spirulina compounds bind to bile acids in the&#xD;
      jejunum, affecting the micellar solubility of cholesterol before suppressing the cholesterol&#xD;
      absorption. However, these studies were conducted in animal models and therefore their&#xD;
      results cannot be extrapolated to humans, and clinical studies conducted in humans are still&#xD;
      very scarce and appropriate clinical trials are needed to elucidate this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is known that the practice of systematic physical exercise ameliorates the&#xD;
      risk of hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, physical exercise of moderate&#xD;
      intensity has the best protective effect, mainly due to physiological adaptations. Exercise&#xD;
      has been also included as part of multicomponent interventions targeting physical function in&#xD;
      socioeconomically vulnerable older adults in rural communities. Korean older adults (n= 187)&#xD;
      performed a 24-week program that included group exercise, nutritional supplementation and&#xD;
      depression management, among other components. Physical function and depression were measured&#xD;
      before and after the intervention, with significant improvements following the intervention.&#xD;
      Thus, appropriate exercise programs need to be implemented.&#xD;
