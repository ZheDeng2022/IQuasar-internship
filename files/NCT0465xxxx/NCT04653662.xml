  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulation of ear wax in the external ear canal is a common pathology. The presence of ear&#xD;
      wax not only interferes with the clinician's view of the tympanic membrane, but may also&#xD;
      result in hearing loss and vertigo, and may predispose to ear infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of ear wax is facilitated using a variety of cerumenolytics, or ear wax solvents. The&#xD;
      current study is designed to evaluate the safety and the cerumenolytic effects of the Earol&#xD;
      product, when dosed into the auditory canal prior to the dewaxing and ear cleaning procedure.&#xD;
      This study is designed to be conducted in the primary care setting as a prospective clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed literature review has been conducted to provide a background summary of relevant&#xD;
      information on the disease/pathology, other available treatment options and the pre-clinical&#xD;
      testing and clinical research that has been conducted to date on the intended population or&#xD;
      related populations and/or the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim for conducting this clinical investigation is to perform a PMCF to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and performance of Earol. Although there are alternative methods for ear wax removal,&#xD;
      Earol represents a simple method based on natural ingredients (olive oil) which aids the&#xD;
      removal of ear wax as well as prevents appearance of clinical symptoms in the ear canal (E.g.&#xD;
      reducing itching and irritation).&#xD;
