  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in the world and is a leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death among women in developing countries. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy +/-&#xD;
      bevacizumab have been recommended as the first-line treatment for patients who present with&#xD;
      metastatic (e.g. stage IVB), persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer. However, patients in&#xD;
      this setting are rarely curable. Pembrolizumab has been approved for second-line treatment in&#xD;
      patients with advanced PD-L1-positive cervical cancer. However, the response rate achieved by&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibitors as monotherapy is only modest. Preclinical studies found that in mouse models&#xD;
      of B-cell lymphoma, adding a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor sensitized cancers to&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 therapy. Recently, combination treatment of HDAC inhibitors with immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors is widely investigated and has promising results in several cancer types.&#xD;
      Toripalimab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody against PD-1. Chidamide is a class I HDAC&#xD;
      inhibitor. Here we conducted a phase Ib/II, single-arm, multi-center study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of toripalimab in combination with chidamide in patients with metastatic,&#xD;
      persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer.&#xD;

      There are two main parts to this study; Part A, combination dose finding and Parts B, dose&#xD;
      expansion. Part B will either be initiated if RP2D reached in Part A, or not initiated if&#xD;
      RP2D was not reached in Part A. Part A has been designed to identify the recommended dose of&#xD;
      combination of toripalimab plus chidamide for further clinical evaluation based upon&#xD;
      assessment of the safety and tolerability data collected during the first 28 days.&#xD;
      &quot;3+3&quot;design was used in the dose finding cohort. If RP2D was reached in Part A, eligible&#xD;
      patients would be enrolled and receive toripalimab (240mg q3w, intravenously) plus chidamide&#xD;
      (RP2D, twice a week) till disease progression (PD) withdraw of consent, or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
