  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractures of the upper part of the femur may be treated with intramedullary nails. There are&#xD;
      different designs to choose from. The intention of this RCT is to compare two nails with some&#xD;
      of the same properties, but with different lengths. Usually, it is the surgeon who decides&#xD;
      which nail to be used. The literature indicates that there is a lack of good evidence in the&#xD;
      decision-making, and that the choice often depends on personal preferences and experience of&#xD;
      the surgeon. Therefore, the investigators want to compare whether one of the nails has a&#xD;
      better outcome than the other, and in that way be able to give some clearer guidelines for&#xD;
      treatment. Patients will be randomized into two groups, one receiving a long nail and one&#xD;
      receiving an extended-short nail and compare surgical and functional outcomes. Information&#xD;
      from the operation and subsequent check-ups will be analysed. The hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      extended-short nail can reduce operating time, bleeding, fluoroscopy time and give equal or&#xD;
      better functional outcome, without increasing reoperation rates or mortality.&#xD;

      Background Intramedullary nails have in recent years become the preferred technique compared&#xD;
      to DHS when treating proximal femur fractures. A Norwegian RCT has showed the same frequency&#xD;
      of postoperative pain, functional outcome and rate of reoperations comparing the two&#xD;
      techniques. Nails are usually provided in a long and short model. Deciding which nail length&#xD;
      to use is highly discussed, and often a long nail is preferred, because it gives a&#xD;
      theoretically more stable and secure fixation of the femur. There are, however many&#xD;
      advantages of using a short nail. It is less time consuming as there is no need for reaming,&#xD;
      securing the long nail distally requires more fluoroscopy time, and distal locking of the&#xD;
      long nail has also been shown to increase the risk of perioperative fractures. Perioperative&#xD;
      bleeding and postoperative blood transfusions are reduced when using a short nail, and a long&#xD;
      nail may also give more pain distally around the thigh and around the knee owing to cortical&#xD;
      impingement. Finally, the long nail is more expensive compared to short models. There is a&#xD;
      perception in the orthopedic society that there's a higher risk of periprosthetic fractures&#xD;
      with short nails, but the latest generations of nails have improved this problem. Most&#xD;
      studies report no difference in periprostetic fractures between long and short nails.&#xD;
      Recently, new extended-short versions of medullary nails are being produced. The&#xD;
      extended-short nail combines the mechanical properties seen in a long nail and the surgical&#xD;
      simplicity of a short nail. This new nail type may replace the use of several long nails&#xD;
      being placed just to be on the safe side, and thus reduce operating time, bleeding and&#xD;
      postoperative pain associated with a long nail. Biomechanical studies have showed that the&#xD;
      mechanical properties of long and extended-short nails are predominantly comparable, but to&#xD;
      our knowledge no clinical studies comparing the extended-short and long nails have been&#xD;
      performed to date. The advantages of an extended-short nail are potentially great, which&#xD;
      makes it important to clarify which opportunities there are to benefit from this type of nail&#xD;
      for certain types of fractures, both in the interest of the patient as well as the economic&#xD;
      healthcare perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose In a well-defined population of patients with proximal femur fractures within a&#xD;
      certain anatomical area the aim is to compare the extended-short nail with the long nail, to&#xD;
      evaluate differences in functional and surgical outcome.&#xD;

    <description>EQ5D-5L (EuroQoL 5L - health-related quality of life)measures health status terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale</description>
