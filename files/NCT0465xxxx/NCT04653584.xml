  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer&#xD;
      disease and affect 1% of the population over 60 years. The treatment of PD is based on&#xD;
      dopamine replacement therapies (DRT). Nausea is the most frequent adverse event whatever the&#xD;
      drug, occurring in 30-40% of patients at the initiation of DRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Domperidone, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist with antiemetic properties, does not readily&#xD;
      cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing its used in PD. Domperidone may prolong the duration&#xD;
      of the QT interval in predisposed patients, and has been associated with proarrhythmia and&#xD;
      arrhythmic deaths. Arrhythmias, sudden death and cardiac arrest were reported with high&#xD;
      intravenous doses which has led to withdraw of the parenteral form of the drug in 1984. Two&#xD;
      case control studies found an increased risk of sudden death associated with domperidone use.&#xD;
      In these reports, the increased risk was depending on age, dose, and the use of domperidone&#xD;
      in combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Following the discussion created by this alert, the&#xD;
      PRAC of the EMA has issued recommendations restricting domperidone use to patients younger&#xD;
      than 60 years at doses below 30 mg/day and for a short period (7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there is no alternative antiemetic drug to be used in PD, domperidone is commonly&#xD;
      prescribed as a preventive therapy in most PD patients initiating DRT. In this population,&#xD;
      usually older than 60 years, doses of 60 or 80 mg/day are commonly prescribed, for at least 2&#xD;
      months of the DRT escalating dose period or longer. A particular &quot;niche&quot; of domperidone&#xD;
      misuse might be patients treated with continuous subcutaneous administration of apomorphine,&#xD;
      a second line therapy in PD, inducing severe and prolonged nausea in almost all patients.&#xD;
      Little is known about the use of domperidone in PD in France, but misuse of domperidone in PD&#xD;
      patients is probably very high. Data collected from two French PD cohorts, COPARK and DIGPD,&#xD;
      showed that 8-14% of PD patients were treated with domperidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this proposal is to conduct a cross sectional observational study performed in&#xD;
      consecutive patients followed by the 24 PD expert centers of the NS Park network, general&#xD;
      hospitals and private practice neurologists, to describe the actual use of domperidone in PD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Domperidone is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist with antiemetic properties. Domperidone does&#xD;
      not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing its used in PD. Domperidone may prolong&#xD;
      the duration of the QT interval in predisposed patients, and has been associated with&#xD;
      proarrhythmia and arrhythmic deaths. Arrhythmias, sudden death and cardiac arrest were&#xD;
      reported with high intravenous doses which has led to withdraw of the parenteral form of the&#xD;
      drug in 1984. More recently, two case control studies found an increased risk of sudden death&#xD;
      associated with domperidone use. In these reports, the increased risk was depending on age,&#xD;
      dose, and the use of domperidone in combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Following the&#xD;
      discussion created by this alert, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of&#xD;
      the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued recommendations restricting domperidone use to&#xD;
      patients younger than 60 years at doses below 30 mg/day and for a short period (7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there is no alternative antiemetic drug to be used in PD, domperidone is commonly&#xD;
      prescribed as a preventive therapy in most PD patients initiating DRT since more than 30&#xD;
      years. In this population, usually older than 60 years, doses of 60 or 80 mg/day are commonly&#xD;
      prescribed, for at least 2 months of the DRT escalating dose period or longer. A particular&#xD;
      &quot;niche&quot; of domperidone misuse might be patients treated with continuous subcutaneous&#xD;
      administration of apomorphine, a second line therapy in PD, inducing severe and prolonged&#xD;
      nausea in almost all patients. Little is known about the use of domperidone in PD in France&#xD;
      in clinical practice, but misuse of domperidone in PD patients is probably very high. Data&#xD;
      collected from two French PD cohorts, COPARK and DIGPD, showed that 8-14% of PD patients were&#xD;
      treated with domperidone, extrapolating 10,000 to 20,000 potentially exposed patients at&#xD;
      particularly high risk of sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this proposal is to conduct a cross sectional observational study of domperidone&#xD;
      prescription in PD patients consecutively recruited by neurologists both in University&#xD;
      hospitals (24 PD expert centers, thanks to NS-Park/FCRIN network), general hospitals and&#xD;
      private neurologists. This will provide insights about the current prescription of&#xD;
      domperidone, their doses and duration, the PD patients' profiles, and the different&#xD;
      indications for which it is prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will allow describing the use and misuse of domperidone in the PD population in&#xD;
      France. This prospective study will take advantage of the recently released national database&#xD;
      for PD, supported by the French Plan for Neurodegenerative Disease and by the French Network&#xD;
      for Parkinson's disease and Movement Disorders (NS-Park/FCRIN network). This study will help&#xD;
      to set up a tool and standardized operating procedures that can be used for subsequent&#xD;
      similar studies on clinical practice in neurodegenerative diseases through a large network of&#xD;
      academic and private specialists. This information will help Regulatory Authorities to&#xD;
      communicate about the safety profile of the drug. Finally, our results obtained in the French&#xD;
      population will be compared to those from the European Union countries using domperidone and&#xD;
      from which data has been published.&#xD;
