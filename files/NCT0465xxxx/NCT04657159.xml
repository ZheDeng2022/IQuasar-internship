      The overall aim of the study is to evaluate interventional pain management. This is done in&#xD;
      three steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To find matched controls to the patients in the study on cost-effectiveness of IPM and&#xD;
           compare the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To calculate cost-effectiveness of PRP during the period 2010-2016, on a national level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To calculate cost-effectiveness of PRP during the period 2017-2019, after the changed&#xD;
           guidelines for PRP in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two last steps are to provide a background to the results of IPM, and to see if the&#xD;
      results in the subgroup of matched controls of PRP-patients differ from the results from the&#xD;
      whole population.&#xD;

      Chronic pain is one of the major health problems globally, according to the WHO 'global&#xD;
      burden of disease' studies. Previously, the investigators have performed a study on a&#xD;
      feasible approach to be able to treat zygapophyseal joint pain in the thoracic region,&#xD;
      similar to the established methods for treatment in the lumbar and cervical regions which&#xD;
      have been published. The study showed that there was a significant improvement in health&#xD;
      related quality of life (HRQoL) after treatment, and that there were no difference in the&#xD;
      results depending on if it was the cervical, thoracic or lumbar region that was treated. The&#xD;
      study had ethical approval (Dnr 2012-446-31M) and is registered here at clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study explored the health economic aspects of interventional pain management (IPM).&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to do this in comparison with pain rehabilitation programs, and&#xD;
      therefore further ethical approval was searched and gained (2012-446-31M, 2017-542-32, 2018-&#xD;
      507-32) An health-economic evaluation of only IPM was performed showing that patients after&#xD;
      treatment of diagnosed pain-focuses in zygapophyseal joint pain not only improve their HRQoL&#xD;
      but they also reduce their medication, reduced their health-care consumption and gained in&#xD;
      ability to work. The cost per quality adjusted life years gained was below the threshold for&#xD;
      cost-effective health-care according to the threshold-levels defined by the national Board of&#xD;
      Health and Welfare in Sweden. But the investigators need a larger population to select from&#xD;
      in order to get matched controls among patients that have been through pain rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore aims to explore the national register of pain rehabilitation both in&#xD;
      order to find matched controls and in order to make a cost-effectiveness study of pain&#xD;
      rehabilitation program as it is performed in Sweden.&#xD;
