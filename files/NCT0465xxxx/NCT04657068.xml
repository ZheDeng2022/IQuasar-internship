  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called ART0380 in participants with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors. The main goals of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find the recommended dose of ART0380 that can be given safely to participants alone and&#xD;
           in combination with gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the side effects of ART0380 alone and in combination with gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the effectiveness of ART0380 alone and in combination with gemcitabine&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ART0380 is a new investigational medicinal product that is a potent and selective inhibitor&#xD;
      of Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR). ART0380 is being developed as an oral&#xD;
      anti-cancer agent for the treatment of participants with cancers that harbor defects in&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair and in combination with agents including those that cause&#xD;
      DNA damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open-label Phase I/IIa study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      PK and preliminary efficacy of ART0380 as monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine in&#xD;
      participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, advanced or solid tumors that fail to&#xD;
      express Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated protein kinase (ATM) by immunohistochemistry, and high&#xD;
      grade serous ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma.&#xD;
