    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the nutrients in breast milk of Chinese mothers&#xD;
      and its related factors, as well as exploring the early development of infants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast milk contains a variety of nutrients that are beneficial to the early development of&#xD;
      infants, such as lipids, Vitamins and so on. At present, the level of these nutrients in milk&#xD;
      and infant formula are lower and which are present in a different form from that in breast&#xD;
      milk. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the level of nutrients in breast milk&#xD;
      of Chinese mothers and learn about its related factors, as well as exploring the&#xD;
      relationships between these nutrients and the early development of infants.&#xD;
