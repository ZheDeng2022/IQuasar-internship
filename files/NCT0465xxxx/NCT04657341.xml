      Sonazoid as a new generation of ultrasound contrast agent.This study based on the features of&#xD;
      Sonazoid specific angiography and high mechanical index,the role of Sonazoid in assessing&#xD;
      effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients was explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter study.More than 1000 participants will enrolled.Most of&#xD;
      them with CEUS,MRI and pathological follow up.When enhanced MRI is needed in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      cycle of patients, Sonazoid-CEUS examination is added at this time point, and postoperative&#xD;
      pathology will be used as the gold standard, so as to compare the ability of the two imaging&#xD;
      examinations in judging the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will also record the parameter information of imaging examination, pathological&#xD;
      type of pathological examination and immunohistochemical index, etc.Contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound includes lesion location, initial peak tumor volume, 1-minute tumor volume,&#xD;
      2-minute tumor volume, and 5-minute tumor volume, as well as the time for contrast&#xD;
      enhancement, contrast agent clearance, and contrast agent clearance.Whether there is no&#xD;
      enhancement area in the lesion after contrast enhancement, shape after contrast enhancement,&#xD;
      edge after contrast enhancement, order of enhancement, uniformity of enhancement, intensity&#xD;
      enhancement, pattern of enhancement, clear boundary after contrast enhancement, aspect ratio&#xD;
      after contrast enhancement, etc.The magnetic field strength of the equipment is planned to be&#xD;
      recorded in the enhanced MRI information, the name of the MRI contrast agent, the lesion&#xD;
      location, the size of the lesion, and the scanning performance are enhanced (lump-like&#xD;
      enhancement, non-lump-like enhancement, point-like enhancement), time-signal intensity&#xD;
      enhancement curve, DWI signal, ADC value, etc.&#xD;
