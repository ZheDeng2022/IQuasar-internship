  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with triple therapy&#xD;
      an inhaler that contains three types of asthma medications, on participants with poorly&#xD;
      controlled asthma. The triple therapy medication contains fluticasone furoate, an inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid (ICS) which reduces inflammation in the lungs; umeclidinium (UMEC), a&#xD;
      long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), a medication which helps open up the airways; and&#xD;
      vilanterol (VI), a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) which also helps open up&#xD;
      airways, delivered in a single daily inhalation via an Ellipta inhaler. The Investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate lung structure and function using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
      Participants will inhale xenon gas before an MRI image of their lungs is taken. Using a&#xD;
      special technique xenon is visible in MRI images, so this lets us see how air spreads in the&#xD;
      lungs. In healthy lungs, the gas fills the lungs evenly, but in unhealthy lungs, the gas may&#xD;
      fill the lungs unevenly and they will appear patchy. The patchy areas are called ventilation&#xD;
      defects. A CT of the chest will be done to assess the structure of the lungs. The&#xD;
      Investigators will also be using lung function testing and questionnaires to compare them to&#xD;
      MRI ventilation defect measurements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm pilot study in participants prescribed low or medium dose&#xD;
      ICS/LABA inhaled therapy and poorly controlled asthma to quantify hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI&#xD;
      VDP before and after six weeks of therapy with FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 ug QD. Male and females&#xD;
      between 18 and 70 years of age will provide written informed consent to five visits including&#xD;
      screening (Visit 1 week -2), baseline (Visit 2 week 0), mid-study Visit 3 in week 3, study&#xD;
      end (Visit 4, week +6) and safety follow-up (Visit 5 week +8). The general study procedures&#xD;
      are the same for Visit 1/Day -14, Visit 2/Day 0 and Visit 4/Day 42. Visit 3/Day 21 is an&#xD;
      optional clinic visit or phone call. Visit 5 is a phone call check-in for adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Visits 1, 2 and 4, participants are to withhold their medication as previously described.&#xD;
      Vital signs will be recorded at the beginning of the visit. FeNO, spirometry,&#xD;
      plethysmography, FOT, MBNW and 129Xe MRI will be performed pre-bronchodilator. FeNO will be&#xD;
      performed before all other pulmonary function testing. Following 129Xe MRI, all participants&#xD;
      will inhale 4 puffs (100mcg each) of a bronchodilator and quietly rest for 15 minutes. After&#xD;
      15 minutes, participants will undergo post-bronchodilator 129Xe MRI, and once MRI is&#xD;
      complete, participants will undergo post-bronchodilator spirometry, plethysmography, FOT and&#xD;
      MBNW. SGRQ, ACQ-6 and AQLQ will be administered after post-bronchodilator assessments are&#xD;
      completed. For Visit 3, participants who choose to attend an in-person visit are to withhold&#xD;
      their medication as described and the process for Visits 1, 2 and 4 will be followed.&#xD;
      Participants who choose a phone call Visit 3 will be asked a series of questions regarding&#xD;
      their breathing, asthma control and general health and they will complete the SGRQ, ACQ and&#xD;
      AQLQ. For all participants, Visit 5 will entail a phone call check-in for adverse events. CT&#xD;
      will be acquired at Visit 2, whilst MRI will be acquired on Visits 2, 4 and for those who&#xD;
      prefer an in person visit, on Visit 3.&#xD;
