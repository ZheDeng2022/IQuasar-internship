    <textblock>
      Magnesium (Mg) and thiamine (vitamin B1) are micronutrients involved in the regulation of&#xD;
      blood sugar level. Avoidance of wholegrains or fruits and starchy vegetables could impact on&#xD;
      Mg and vitamin B1 intakes and status. Although supplementation can be recommended alongside&#xD;
      low-carbohydrate high fat diets (LCHF) diets, its benefits have never been studied before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test the effect of Mg and vitamin B1 supplements on glucose metabolism in&#xD;
      people following any LCHF diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is clear that Mg involves in both type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention and management, and&#xD;
      following LCHF diets, avoidance of wholegrains, fruits and starchy vegetables, could have a&#xD;
      negative impact on Mg and B1 intakes and status. A systematic review of LCHF diets and&#xD;
      micronutrients confirmed that Mg and B1 intakes were reduced by 50% and 70% following LCHF&#xD;
      diets compared to baseline normal carbohydrate diets, and could be as low as 40% and 75% of&#xD;
      recommended intakes for Mg and B1 respectively. Although supplementation can be recommended&#xD;
      alongside LCHF diets, not all LCHF dieters take supplements, and their benefits during LCHF&#xD;
      diets have never been studied before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale We hypothesise that people who have been following LCHF diets without taking&#xD;
      supplement are potentially at risk of Mg/B1 insufficiency, with negative impact on glucose&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate potential efficacy of Mg/B1 supplementation on glucose metabolism&#xD;
           (mechanistic efficacy/proof of concept) in adults already voluntarily following LCHF&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate effect of Mg/B1 supplementation on Mg/B1 status in adults already&#xD;
           voluntarily following LCHF, who are at risk of Mg/B1 inadequacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test capabilities of measures, procedures, recruitment criteria, and operational&#xD;
           strategies that are under consideration for use in a subsequent, larger, study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify barriers to successful study completion&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate acceptability of methods and instruments to participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a mechanistic efficacy/proof of concept, intervention study with a use&#xD;
      of a randomised-start design. All participants will be assigned to the same intervention but&#xD;
      at different times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 groups of the study - 2 interventions and 1 control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 400 mg of Mg per day for 4 weeks then add on 100 mg of B1 per day for another 4 weeks, a&#xD;
           total duration of 8 weeks (MB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 100 mg of B1 per day for 4 weeks then add on 400 mg of Mg per day for another 4 weeks, a&#xD;
           total duration of 8 weeks (BM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Untreated: Participants with delayed entry (untreated) for 8 weeks (Con)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after intervention/untreated period&#xD;
