  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is an effective tool to improve cardiovascular&#xD;
      fitness and maximal anaerobic power. Different methods of HIIT have been studied but the&#xD;
      effect of a maximal effort cycling and very short exercise time (i.e., 4-s) with short&#xD;
      recovery time (15-30 s) and a high number of repetitions (i.e., 30 bouts) is unknown.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators examined the effects of training at maximal anaerobic power during cycling&#xD;
      (PC) on maximal anaerobic power, peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), and total blood volume in&#xD;
      11 young healthy individuals (age: 21.3Â±0.5 y) (6 men, 5 women). Methods: Participants&#xD;
      trained three times a week for eight weeks performing a PC program consisting of 30 bouts of&#xD;
      4-s at an all-out intensity (i.e., 2 minutes of exercise per session). The cardiovascular&#xD;
      stress progressively increased over the weeks by decreasing the recovery time between sprints&#xD;
      (30 to 24 to 15-s) and thus session time decreased from 17 to &lt; 10 min.&#xD;
