      The duration of the study for a participant will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Screening period: up to 6 weeks. Treatment period: once successfully screened,&#xD;
      enrolled participants will receive study intervention for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety follow-up visit: participants who do not enroll (rollover) into Part B will be asked&#xD;
      to attend a final safety follow-up visit that will take place 22 weeks after Week 24, ie,&#xD;
      approximately at Week 46.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B Treatment period (extension): for all groups, this period will consist of 52 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with BIVV020 (Weeks 24 to 76; Part A and B total treatment period of 76 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety follow-up visit: At the end of the Part B treatment period, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to attend a safety follow-up visit that will take place 22 weeks after the last BIVV020 dose&#xD;
      (Week 98).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there is a follow-up call 56 weeks ±14 days after last dose to confirm negative&#xD;
      result of urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential who are participating in&#xD;
      the study, or to query male participants regarding pregnancy of partners who are women of&#xD;
      childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up telephone call at 56 weeks after last dose is included in the protocol, however&#xD;
      the EoS has been defined as the last safety follow-up visit for the last patient which occurs&#xD;
      at 22 weeks after last dose.&#xD;
