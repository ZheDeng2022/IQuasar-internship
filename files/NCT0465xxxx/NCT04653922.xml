  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, Phase I open-label safety study to evaluate the safety, feasibility&#xD;
      and initial efficacy of a bioengineered corneal stromal substitute after implantation into&#xD;
      the stroma of adults with advanced keratoconus. The bioengineered substitute and implantation&#xD;
      technique may provide a less invasive treatment option for advanced keratoconus than current&#xD;
      surgical approaches, that additionally does not rely on the limited availability of human&#xD;
      donor corneal tissue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, non-controlled ongoing clinical case series in&#xD;
      two participating centers in Indian and Iranian hospitals, to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of minimally-invasive surgery of advanced keratoconus using a bioengineered&#xD;
      corneal stromal substitute on a compassionate basis to alleviate blindness and low vision,&#xD;
      due to the severely limited availability of human corneal donor tissue at these centers&#xD;
      relative to the medical need. Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria are recruited&#xD;
      consecutively and implanted intra-stromally with the bioengineered substitute, as a less&#xD;
      invasive surgery than full-thickness or anterior lamellar corneal transplantation. In the&#xD;
      first phase of the study, a total of 20 patients were recruited and safety and efficacy&#xD;
      outcomes were evaluated in those having a minimum of 6 months of postoperative follow-up. In&#xD;
      the second phase of the study (currently ongoing), up to 40 patients are being recruited,&#xD;
      with one-year postoperative outcomes of all included patients to be evaluated as the final&#xD;
      study endpoint. Primary safety and efficacy outcomes will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>The primary safety endpoint is defined such that a rejection leading to implant removal should occur in no more than 10% of implanted eyes. The implant rejection is defined as a clinical situation when the implanted eye has decreased central corneal clarity and decreased implant clarity, corneal vascularization inside of laser created pocket and inflammation.</description>

    <measure>Corneal curvature measured by keratometry (efficacy measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum and minimum corneal curvature (steepness) of each eye will be measured by a keratometer and reported in diopter (D) unit and represented as &quot;K-value&quot;. The efficacy outcome is that more than 60% of the eyes should have a decrease in K-value at 6 months postoperatively.</description>

    <measure>Central corneal thickness measured by topography techniques (efficacy measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Central corneal thickness (CCT) will be measured in microns and reported using a two-dimensional thickness map made by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and/or Pentacam topography. The efficacy outcome is that more than 60% of the eyes should have an increase in CCT at 6 months postoperatively.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced keratoconus (according to Amsler-Krumeich classification)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who gave their written signed and dated informed consent for participation&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  known diabetes or other neuro-degenerative disorder (as corneal nerves can be affected&#xD;
