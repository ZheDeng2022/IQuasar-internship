  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized single-blind simulator-based trial. 156 4th year medical&#xD;
      students were randomised to receive one of three different suspected diagnoses of a&#xD;
      pre-treating physician (no diagnosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism) prior to the&#xD;
      task to make a focussed assessment and perform first management steps in a patient presenting&#xD;
      to the emergency department. The patient (simulator) suffered from an acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. Video recordings were obtained during simulation and used for data analysis.&#xD;
      Primary endpoint was the participants' final presuptive diagnosis.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized controlled single-blind trial, the participants not being&#xD;
      aware of the purpose of the study. The trial was approved by the regional ethical committee&#xD;
      (EKNZ 85/04) and all participants gave written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical students in their 4th year at the University of Basel, Switzerland were offered to&#xD;
      participate in voluntary workshops at the simulator centre of the medical intensive care unit&#xD;
      of university of Basel hospital. The present study was conducted as part of these workshops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the workshop participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire. The&#xD;
      questionnaire included a) the Big Five personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion,&#xD;
      openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness) (McCrae 1992); b) Rosenberg's self-esteem&#xD;
      scale(Colani); c) the task to diagnose the cardiac rhythm in 12 one-lead ECG rhythms strips&#xD;
      (each correct diagnosis was counted as one point resulting in a maximum of 12 attainable&#xD;
      points); d) the task to list the typical symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction in bullet&#xD;
      point form (each of the following items were counted as one point resulting in a maximum of 6&#xD;
      attainable points: chest pain; radiation of the pain; pain described as constricting,&#xD;
      compressing, or squeezing; at least one accompanied vegetative symptom; dyspnoea; and fear);&#xD;
      and e) the task to list the typical signs symptoms of 4 further medical emergencies&#xD;
      (anaphylactic shock, trauma management, cardiac arrest, syncope) in bullet point form&#xD;
      (answers were coded using a predefined checklist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulator and Scenario:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted using a patient simulator. All participants received a standardised&#xD;
      instruction of the patient simulator (human patient simulator, Leardal SimMan®). This&#xD;
      simulator's features include among others palpable pulses, spontaneous breathing with visible&#xD;
      thoracic excursions, spontaneous movements of the eye lids and a speaker in the mannequin's&#xD;
      head that broadcasts the voice of a remote operator, allowing for verbal interaction with the&#xD;
      participants. For the present trial, the operator was an experienced physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study scenario participants were given the role of a resident-on-call in the&#xD;
      emergency department and were instructed by a senior physician (confederate) to triage a&#xD;
      newly arrived patient. Upon entering the simulator room, the participants encountered the&#xD;
      patient (simulator) lying on a bed and dressed in a hospital gown. Participants were assisted&#xD;
      by a confederate nurse. The nurse was instructed to display a helpful manner, to act only on&#xD;
      command, but not to interfere in any way with the assessment and history taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants performed the scenario on their own and faced a patient with a simulated&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction. Participants were randomized (computer-generated numbers) to&#xD;
      three versions of the scenario. The three versions differed only in the reply of the patient&#xD;
      to the initial question about the reason for his visit. The patient volunteered that he had&#xD;
      phoned his family physician because of acute chest pain and dyspnoea. The family physician&#xD;
      had recommended urgent visit of the emergency department because he judged the situation as&#xD;
      1) medical emergency (control group with no à priori diagnosis); 2) acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (correct à priori diagnosis group); or, 3) acute pulmonary embolism (wrong à&#xD;
      priori diagnosis group). Apart from this randomly allocated initial information, the scenario&#xD;
      was identical in all groups: until the end of the scenario, the patient only spoke when asked&#xD;
      a question and all answers were given according a pre-scripted answer check-list (table)&#xD;
      Participants of the groups with no à priori diagnosis and correct à priori diagnosis were&#xD;
      given 4 minutes study time. Participants of the group with wrong diagnosis were given one&#xD;
      additional minute (i.e. 5 minutes study time) to compensate for probing the given diagnosis.&#xD;
      At the end of the study time, the senior physician entered the room and announced that he&#xD;
      required the participant to temporarily leave his/her patient to help with another emergent&#xD;
      case. The participants were then asked on their presumptive diagnosis and which measures, if&#xD;
      any, the nurse should take during their temporary absence during the next couple of minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis was performed using video recordings obtained during simulations. Video&#xD;
      recordings were analysed independently by two trained raters who noted all questions asked&#xD;
      and all measures taken by the participant. Inter-observer differences were solved by jointly&#xD;
      re-watching the video recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was a correct presumptive diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction or&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome when asked at the end of the scenario by the senior physician or when&#xD;
      previously revealed to the patient and/or the nurse. Mentioning the correct diagnosis as&#xD;
      possible differential diagnosis was rated as correct diagnosis. A co-primary endpoint was the&#xD;
      composite endpoint of a correct presumptive diagnosis OR ordering a 12-lead ECG, the&#xD;
      rationale being that a timely 12-lead ECG will most likely prevent harm to a patient not&#xD;
      correctly triaged as suffering from acute myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints were the number and kind of questions asked during history taking;&#xD;
      probing of the à priori diagnosis; measures taken during assessment; and the results of the&#xD;
      questionnaire. Results of the knowledge part of the questionnaire are reported as percentages&#xD;
      of the attainable maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 20% difference in the primary outcome was considered to be of medical relevance- A power&#xD;
      analysis revealed that approximately 150 teams (50 per group) had to be included to detect&#xD;
      this difference with a power of 0.9 at the 0.05 significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS (version 25). Non-parametric ANOVA, Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      test, chi-square test, Univariate and Multivariate regression analysis, and Cohen's kappa&#xD;
      were used as appropriate. A p &lt; 0.05 was considered to represent statistical significance.&#xD;
      Data are reported as median [Interquartile range {IQR}] unless otherwise stated.&#xD;
