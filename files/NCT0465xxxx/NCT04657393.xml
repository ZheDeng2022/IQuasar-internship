  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decades, research in cardiopulmonary resuscitation was primarily focused on&#xD;
      uninterrupted chest compressions to restore sufficient circulation. Ventilation during&#xD;
      ongoing chest compressions was regarded as potentially deleterious and thus not given any&#xD;
      major scientific focus. Current guidelines advise that ventilation be monitored by end-tidal&#xD;
      CO2 and emphasize that hyperventilation be avoided. Recent findings from arterial blood gas&#xD;
      analyses showed high levels of arterial pCO2, resulting in a frequent occurrence of&#xD;
      hypercapnic acidosis, which may be caused by iatrogenic hypoventilation. Ventilation during&#xD;
      ongoing chest compressions can be hard to achieve, as nearly every breath may be terminated&#xD;
      by simultaneous chest compressions. In case of bag ventilation the applied tidal volumes have&#xD;
      not yet been measured und mechanical ventilators so far were not able to ventilate during&#xD;
      chest compressions, because pressure limit settings induced termination of inspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to provide patients with the best possible ventilation, even under&#xD;
      ongoing cardiac massage. Patients are ventilated with a new turbine-driven ventilator (Monnal&#xD;
      T60, Air Liquide, France), which can deliver adequate tidal volumes within a very short&#xD;
      inspiratory phase due to the inspiratory flow of &gt; 200l/min. Thus, in deviation from the&#xD;
      current recommendations, the ventilation rate can be doubled to 20/min, so that inspiration&#xD;
      coincides with cardiac massage less often. The study compares effective ventilation volumes&#xD;
      applied by two regimes, 10 breaths/min and 20/min. Success in gas exchange is monitored by&#xD;
      arterial blood gas analysis; ventilation parameters are adapted for each patient to&#xD;
      requirements accordingly&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Restoration of circulation is undoubtedly the base of success in cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation (CPR). Current guidelines on CPR require that hyperventilation be avoided&#xD;
      during CPR. Blood gas analysis results from the &quot;BABICA trial&quot; demonstrate that more than 90%&#xD;
      of patients have highly elevated levels of pCO2 and are acidotic, mainly due to hypercapnia.&#xD;
      No hyperventilated or alkalotic patients were found during CPR. Furthermore, higher pO2&#xD;
      values were found to be associated with improved outcomes. Current recommendations to limit&#xD;
      ventilation frequency to 10/min was also critically questioned in a recent study from&#xD;
      Belgium, which did not show any positive effect of low respiration rate compared to higher&#xD;
      ones, cut-off 10/min. There are currently no clinical trials addressing optimal tidal volumes&#xD;
      or minute volumes during CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major obstacle to continuous measurement of respiratory minute volumes during CPR is&#xD;
      ongoing cardiac massage. In a retrospective study in which respiratory volumes were derived&#xD;
      from bioimpedance curves, better outcomes were found in the group of more frequent&#xD;
      ventilations. Common machine ventilators display set values, while expiratory volumes are&#xD;
      averaged and may be overlaid by volume shifts of cardiac massage. In a recent study,&#xD;
      investigators analyzed flow curves, where each breath can be evaluated individually and&#xD;
      volumes can be derived correctly using dedicated software. We were able to test this method&#xD;
      on a comparative study of three ventilators study on anatomical cadavers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to detect whether a higher rate of ventilation using a turbine driven&#xD;
      ventilator is able to provide higher breathing volumes during ongoing chest compressions in&#xD;
      individuals suffering from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Higher ventilation and&#xD;
      oxygenation parameters as well as optimized acid-base-balance and increased rates of ROSC are&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient care (chest compressions, venous access, endotracheal intubation, application of&#xD;
      drugs, defibrillation if necessary) is conducted according to current recommendation for&#xD;
      Advanced Life Support (ALS) as issued by the European Resuscitation Council (ERC).&#xD;
      Ventilation is performed at one of two patterns: the control group is ventilated at 10&#xD;
      breaths per minute, the intervention group is ventilated at 20 breaths per minute. Patterns&#xD;
      are selected randomly by opening a sealed envelope which is fixed on the ventilator. After&#xD;
      successful endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation is carried out using a&#xD;
      turbine-driven ventilator (Monnal T60, AirLiquide, France). Ventilator settings are pre-set:&#xD;
      respiratory frequency is set at 10/min or 20/min (see above), other ventilator parameters&#xD;
      remain identical: Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) 5 mmHg, FiO2 1,0, tidal volume&#xD;
      6ml/kg ideal body weight [men: 50+(0.91x(body length-152.4)), women: 45+(0.91y(body&#xD;
      length-152.4))]. These calculations can be performed on the ventilator itself by entering&#xD;
      patients' age, height and gender. Chest compressions are carried out without interruptions&#xD;
      and without considerations regarding the respiratory cycle. After initiation of ventilation&#xD;
      arterial cannulization and arterial blood gas analysis - if possible- is performed after 5&#xD;
      and 10 minutes of CPR. If these analyses yield critically abnormal results (pCO2&lt;35mmHg or&#xD;
      &gt;75mmHg) changes in ventilation may be made by the prehospital care physician. Study&#xD;
      measurements end after disconnecting the ventilator.&#xD;
