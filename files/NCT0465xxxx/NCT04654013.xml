  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct an embedded mixed methods study in which the primary approach&#xD;
      is a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and the secondary or embedded approach is a&#xD;
      descriptive qualitative study. The aim of the RCT is to assess the impact of presbyopic&#xD;
      correction on workplace productivity and retention in the textile industry in a low&#xD;
      middle-income country. Additional qualitative data will be collected to enhance understanding&#xD;
      of factors linked to reasons why enrolled sew-ers left their job during the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be textile workers aged 30 years and above with uncorrected presbyopia who&#xD;
      are employed by Shahi Exports Private Limited in Karnataka, India.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, 1.1 billion people lack a simple pair of reading glasses to correct impaired near&#xD;
      vision, called presbyopia. Presbyopia can begin as early as age 30 years, commonly becomes&#xD;
      functionally apparent by 40, and is essentially complete by 55 meaning that presbyopia is&#xD;
      most common at the height of the working years. The global productivity loss due to&#xD;
      uncorrected presbyopia has been estimated to exceed US$25 billion, and presbyopia is shown to&#xD;
      be associated with significant impairment in activities of daily living. There is paucity in&#xD;
      trial evidence of the impact on near vision spectacle correction on work productivity and&#xD;
      workplace retention. The largest reported effect sizes among such trials (specifically for&#xD;
      productivity) was the PROSPER trial, which showed that providing inexpensive near vision&#xD;
      glasses increased the daily weight of tea picked among presbyopic, mostly-female Indian&#xD;
      agricultural workers by more than 5 kg (21.7%) compared to those in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: The investigators will choose 1260 textile workers aged 30 years and above with&#xD;
      uncorrected presbyopia who are employed by Shahi Exports Private Limited in Karnataka, India.&#xD;
      They will be randomly assigned into one of two groups: a group receiving free reading glasses&#xD;
      within one week of undergoing vision assessment (&quot;Intervention&quot;) or a group receiving&#xD;
      identical reading glasses at the end of the assessment period (&quot;Control&quot;).The main study&#xD;
      outcome will be the proportion of workers who continue working at the factories in the&#xD;
      intervention group (as opposed to control). The investigators anticipate that the glasses&#xD;
      intervention will increase retention by 20% in the Intervention group at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also assess the workers' efficiency, why they have left employment, how&#xD;
      satisfied and valued they felt at their work and how often they use their glasses for work.&#xD;
      These other outcomes will help the investigators to better understand the causal pathway&#xD;
      between vision and work retention. The investigators will also study the total cost of&#xD;
      providing glasses per additional worker retain their employment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: Will providing free glasses to presbyopic Indian textile workers increase&#xD;
      work retention?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Investigator-masked, multi-center randomized controlled trial with a qualitative&#xD;
      component&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Although presbyopia is safely, effectively and inexpensively treated with glasses,&#xD;
      rates of optical correction in LMICs are as low as 10%. The way in which firms manage workers&#xD;
      has profound implications for performance by way of worker attendance, retention, and&#xD;
      productivity. Similarly, worker engagement, and the extent to which workers feel valued, is a&#xD;
      key determinant of firm performance. As the low-skill workforce in many developing countries&#xD;
      transitions rapidly from agriculture to industrial work, employers struggle with high worker&#xD;
      turnover due to poor working conditions, low pay, and restricted worker rights. Few trials&#xD;
      have been published which address the question of whether healthcare interventions can&#xD;
      improve work performance as well as workplace retention, especially among persons over the&#xD;
      age of 40 in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). There is interest in understanding if&#xD;
      these results obtained in an agricultural setting can be extended to other&#xD;
      financially-important sectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will choose 1260 textile workers aged 30 years and above with&#xD;
      uncorrected presbyopia who are employed by Shahi Exports Private Limited in Karnataka, India.&#xD;
      They will be randomly assigned into one of two groups: a group receiving free reading glasses&#xD;
      within one week of undergoing vision assessment (&quot;Intervention&quot;) or a group receiving&#xD;
      identical reading glasses at the end of the assessment period (&quot;Control&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome 18 month later will be work retention; secondary outcomes are workers'&#xD;
      efficiency, the reasons the workers left their employment, satisfaction and perceived&#xD;
      self-valued at work and glasses wear adherence at work. Attitudes about presbyopia and&#xD;
      spectacle use and intervention cost-effectiveness will be studied.&#xD;
