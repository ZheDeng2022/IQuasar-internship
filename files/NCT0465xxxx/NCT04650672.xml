    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of subjects with NV-AMD to perform&#xD;
      sequential daily self-imaging of their eyes with the self-operated Notal Home OCT device in&#xD;
      their homes for 90 days without on-site supervision. The study will include up to 15&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

      Office Visit screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient will be informed concerning the study and sign the Informed Consent Form&#xD;
           (ICF) prior to conduct of any study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The following data will be collected for each study subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a .Subject's DOB (if allowed) or age b. Gender c .Race d. Ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BCVA on both eyes on the day of the visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Both eyes of the subject will be scanned, non-dilated, with either a commercial Zeiss&#xD;
           Cirrus or Heidelberg Engineering Spectralis OCT device with one (1) acceptable volume&#xD;
           scan of each eye being obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Both eyes of the subject that meet all screening criteria will be enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The following data will be collected for the study eye(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Qualifying diagnosis for the study eye from the subject's medical record&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. From the subject's medical record, the presence of other ophthalmic conditions&#xD;
                including but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Cataract ii. Glaucoma iii. Dry Eye iv. Other macula findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The subject will receive a general overview of the self-operation of the Notal Home OCT&#xD;
           at the investigational clinic facility by trained study personnel. A Notal Home OCT&#xD;
           device is then assigned to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The subject will be reminded that the Notal Home OCT will be delivered to their home and&#xD;
           instructed to self-image the study eye(s) daily using a Notal Home OCT device at home&#xD;
           for 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Set-up with Remote Assistance (Day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of subject eligibility at the Enrollment visit and the subject is&#xD;
      enrolled in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The subject will be contacted by the NVDC to verify their delivery address.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The device will be delivered to the subject's home, with confirmation sent back to the&#xD;
           NVDC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Remote support is available by the NVDC via phone during standard business hours of 8am&#xD;
           - 6pm EST, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The subject will follow the steps detailed in the Set-up Guide included in the box&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-Home Phase (Day 0 to Day 90) Following set-up of the Notal Home OCT,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Day 0: The subject will review the tutorial and will perform one calibration session for&#xD;
           each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Day 1: The subject will perform the first self-imaging session with the Notal Home OCT&#xD;
           on both eyes followed by automated transmission of the scans. This first session will be&#xD;
           considered a practice session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Days 2-90: The patient will perform one self-imaging session followed by automated&#xD;
           transmission on both eyes at home with the Notal Home OCT each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an eye cannot calibrate during 5 separate attempts or fails to test 5 consecutive times,&#xD;
      the subject will be notified by the NVDC to discontinue self-imaging this eye. If there is a&#xD;
      fellow eye also enrolled in the study, the fellow eye will continue&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly Review of Notal Home OCT Images by the PI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physician will review patient images on a weekly basis to perform an assessment of daily&#xD;
      fluid status and document their observations in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine Care Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine care visits may be conducted at the investigator's discretion. The following&#xD;
      procedures will be performed at the routine care visits: BCVA, Spectralis or Cirrus OCT, 3.&#xD;
      Initiate treatment, if necessary, and document which anti-VEGF drug is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Office Exit Visit (approximately 90 days after Day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinic for an office visit approximately ninety (90) days after&#xD;
      the Day 0 (Home Set-up) Visit. At this visit, the exams will be conducted in the following&#xD;
      order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BCVA will be performed on both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Both eyes of the subject will be imaged, using a Cirrus or Spectralis OCT, and reviewed&#xD;
           by the PI to determine fluid status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Initiate standard of care and treatment, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Collect AEs, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subject completes the Notal Home OCT Subject User Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Exit subject from the study.&#xD;

        The study population will include approximately fifteen (15) subjects diagnosed with NV-AMD&#xD;
        in at least one eye with initiation of anti-VEGF treatment within the past 6 months, at&#xD;
        treatment intervals 8 weeks or less, in the NV-AMD eye. At least 50% of the subjects in&#xD;
        each of the two study sites with active NV-AMD at time of enrollment in at least one eye,&#xD;

        Approximately 50% of the eyes with fluid will have intra retinal fluid and at approximately&#xD;
        50% will have sub retinal fluid. Eyes may have both types of fluid.&#xD;
