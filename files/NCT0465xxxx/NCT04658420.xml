    <textblock>
      Suicidal ideation (SI) associated with major and bipolar depression is commonly seen in a&#xD;
      wide range of clinical practice situations including the emergency room (ER). Current&#xD;
      treatment regimens are often unsatisfactory. About a third of patients fail to respond to&#xD;
      currently available therapy, and there are no currently FDA indicated rapid acting treatments&#xD;
      for SI. Suboptimal outcomes have triggered the search for new, well-tolerated and more&#xD;
      effective forms of treatment. Small clinical trials suggest that low dose (0.5mg/kg) ketamine&#xD;
      is safe and effective for SI. We believe adding music during ketamine infusion may reduce&#xD;
      anxiety and lead to more reduced SI based on available evidence. We are testing the&#xD;
      hypothesis that a single infusion of ketamine combined with music enhances tolerability and&#xD;
      improves outcomes in the treatment of SI when combined with treatment as usual in a factorial&#xD;
      study design. One treatment with Ketamine + music will be compared to compared to one-time&#xD;
      treatment with ketamine alone, music alone, or treatment as usual. 50 individuals with a&#xD;
      depressive episode and suicidal ideation will receive intravenous (IV) ketamine 0.5mg/kg&#xD;
      infused over 40 minutes once with 60 minutes of music, 50 individuals will receive IV&#xD;
      ketamine without music, 50 subjects will receive 60 minutes of music once, and 50 patients&#xD;
      will receive treatment as usual without ketamine or music. We anticipate that the ketamine +&#xD;
      music group will have statistically significant indices of improvement in the primary&#xD;
      outcome, suicidal ideation scores on the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      ketamine infusion. Secondary outcomes will include depression scores on the MontgomeryÅsberg&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scale, adverse effects, and SSI scores at the end of 4 weeks.&#xD;
      If, as we anticipate, the results indicate success of ketamine + music for SI, the work will&#xD;
      identify new opportunities to more effectively manage patients with depression and suicidal&#xD;
      ideation presenting to the ER.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine is a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist traditionally used as&#xD;
      a general anesthetic. Recent double blinded randomized control trials of intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      ketamine infusions have been well-tolerated and demonstrated a rapid onset of antidepressant&#xD;
      effect, most notably in subjects with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and&#xD;
      treatment-resistant bipolar depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance. The outcomes of current therapy for depression are poor, with roughly a third&#xD;
      of patient's failing to improve or regressing. The patients are high risk for suicide and the&#xD;
      need for rapid acting, durable treatments for reduction of suicidal ideation is paramount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine has been shown to improve suicidal ideation for at least 6 weeks in the largest&#xD;
      study of ketamine for SI to date in subjects recruited to participate in the clinical trial&#xD;
      and admitted to a research facility. We intend to test ketamine in a more pragmatic trial in&#xD;
      the ER in patients who are not actively recruited, but report SI to ER staff or have SI as a&#xD;
      chief complaint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview. In the current open label randomized control trial, we will examine the suicidal&#xD;
      ideation reducing efficacy of IV ketamine combined with music and treatment as usual in four&#xD;
      groups. All four groups will receive treatment as usual as defined above (potential&#xD;
      hospitalization, medication, psychotherapy, outpatient referrals, suicide safety planning). A&#xD;
      factorial design is being implemented to test two interventions independently and combined:&#xD;
      ketamine and music. One group will receive IV ketamine 0.5mg/kg infused over forty minutes&#xD;
      with one hour of pre-planned music will be compared to 3 other groups: One group will receive&#xD;
      the same dose of ketamine without music, one group will one hour of music without ketamine,&#xD;
      and one group will receive neither music nor ketamine. During the 4-week follow up interval,&#xD;
      subjects from both groups will be contacted by phone for weekly assessment of depression, SI&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A playlist by composer Nils Frahm will be played for 60 minutes. The music is instrumental,&#xD;
      relaxing and subjectively thought to be uplifting by patients who have listened to the music&#xD;
      during ketamine infusions performed previously by the PI for treatment of resistant&#xD;
      depression. Music can be previewed at the link below:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients will be screened for study entry by the emergency room (ER) treating physician who&#xD;
      will be available 24 hours a day who will notify the clinical trials research staff that a&#xD;
      subject is available to be screened. Dr. Robert Creath Er attending will be the primary&#xD;
      coordinator of Er services. The clinical trials staff that will be assigned to the project by&#xD;
      the UTHET north campus department of clinical research. will then screen the subject for&#xD;
      entry to the study, and perform the informed consent process. The subject will then be&#xD;
      randomized by clinical trials staff using block randomization to each group. A 1:1 assignment&#xD;
      to each group will be implemented with permuted blocks between 4 and 6 with equal&#xD;
      probability. Patients entering the study will be voluntarily admitted to the hospital or&#xD;
      monitored in the ER for a minimum of 2 hours after the first IV ketamine or music treatment&#xD;
      and discharged when deemed to not be a suicide risk by a treating physician. A driver will be&#xD;
      required to take the subject home if discharged the same day as the ketamine treatment.&#xD;
      Subjects deemed to be a continued risk to themselves or others will be admitted as per&#xD;
      clinician discretion which is considered treatment as usual. The ER nurse will be&#xD;
      administering the sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine. Vital signs including, blood pressure,&#xD;
      pulse oxygenation will be monitored at fifteen-minute intervals during the infusion, and will&#xD;
      be recorded for 30 minutes after the infusion at fifteen minute intervals. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed up by phone at weekly intervals and voluntary hospitalization will be recommended&#xD;
      for patients with SSI score of ≥4. Psychotropic medications will be adjusted and optimized at&#xD;
      the discretion of the treating physicians at study entry. Medications may be modified during&#xD;
      the 4-week study interval in line with standard practice. Informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      for all participants. Informed consent will be obtained in person when possible or by the&#xD;
      Teams telemedicine app when necessary if research staff is unavailable on site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of this study will be treatment response, defined as a ≥50% score&#xD;
      reduction in the SSI from baseline to 4 weeks after the first ketamine injection. Remission&#xD;
      will be defined as a ≥50% reduction in SSI score with score ≤4. The SSI will be administered&#xD;
      at baseline, prior to each treatment and 24 hours after IV ketamine administration, then&#xD;
      every week during the symptom monitoring follow-up period of 4 weeks. The clinician-rated SSI&#xD;
      assesses current severity of suicidal ideation with 19 items scaled from 0 (least severe) to&#xD;
      2 (most severe). Medications may be adjusted during the study interval. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      will be change in MADRS and SSI score from baseline to 4 weeks after the treatment. Raters&#xD;
      will be blinded to the subject treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 4-week follow up participants will be contacted by phone with follow-up questions&#xD;
      regarding their overall health status, mood and clinical state using MADRS, SSI, QIDS and&#xD;
      other clinical scales listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study/Design. Patients with clinically documented depression with SI will be screened for&#xD;
      diagnosis of depressive episode with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview&#xD;
      (MINI), a structured interview of psychiatric disorders, at baseline to establish the&#xD;
      presence of a major depressive episode. The depressive episode could be associated with major&#xD;
      depressive disorder, bipolar disorder or substance induced depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Portable speakers will be provided playing relaxing music prior to and during the&#xD;
      administration of ketamine for groups 2 and 3 (Nils Frahm playlist-modern classical&#xD;
      composer). This music has been previously used at Christus Mother Francis for therapeutic&#xD;
      ketamine use with good results. Subjects will be inform that music can be stopped by request&#xD;
      at any time. Informed consent and screening will be performed in the UTHET north campus&#xD;
      clinical trials staff at initial presentation. Follow up assessments during weeks 1-4 will be&#xD;
      done by phone. Clinical research staff will randomize subjects to treatment groups as&#xD;
      documented above. Ketamine IV will be supplied by the UT Health East Texas pharmacy. The&#xD;
      administration of ketamine will be initiated by the emergency room nurse with ACLS certified&#xD;
      physician supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the treatment, patients will be undergo psychiatric interview by the University of&#xD;
      Texas Health center at Tyler psychiatric ER consult liaison team as per standard practice. An&#xD;
      ACLS certified physician will be nearby in the ER post-procedure for 1 hour or until a&#xD;
      clinician deems patient is clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan on utilizing the monitoring protocol advised by the American Psychiatric Association&#xD;
      consensus statement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;(1) assessment of respiratory status (i.e., oxygen saturation or end-tidal CO2); (2)&#xD;
      assessment of cardiovascular function (blood pressure and heart rate, reported on a regular&#xD;
      basis every 15 minutes); (3) assessment of the level of consciousness or other documented&#xD;
      assessment of responsiveness; and (4) delineation of criteria for stopping the infusion and a&#xD;
      clear plan for managing cardiovascular or behavioral events during treatment.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be monitored and recorded throughout the study. The most common side&#xD;
      effects associated with ketamine are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, double vision, drowsiness,&#xD;
      elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, anxiety, dissociation (feeling strange and disconnected&#xD;
      from the world), and confusion. Delirium, hallucinations, and nightmares have been associated&#xD;
      with high dose ketamine, but are not common side effects in subanesthetic ketamine treatment.&#xD;
      The subanesthetic dose of 0.5 mg/kg has been documented to be safe and well tolerated in&#xD;
      numerous clinical trials in the treatment of suicidal thoughts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rare but serious possible adverse event associated with ketamine include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac arrest, diabetes insipidus, anaphylaxis, ocular hypertension, increased intracranial&#xD;
      pressure, arrythmia exacerbation or apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital pulse oximetry, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate will be monitored&#xD;
      throughout the injection at 15 minute intervals with a recovery period similar to recent&#xD;
      study of IV ketamine for PTSD and TRD performed at the Minneapolis VA. Vital signs, the&#xD;
      Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) will be assessed pre-dose, at 40&#xD;
      minutes after ketamine infusion has started. Hypertensive emergency, respiratory failure or&#xD;
      cardiac arrest is not known to have occurred in previous clinical trials of IV ketamine for&#xD;
      treatment of depression. Emergency room physicians will be notified and render care in the&#xD;
      event of unexpected medical emergencies. The infusions will be stopped if a patient requests&#xD;
      stopping the infusion, becomes agitated, or goes into respiratory failure or cardiac arrest.&#xD;
      Medical emergencies will be managed by ACLS certified ER physicians. Code BERT will be called&#xD;
      as necessary if a patient becomes acutely agitated and presents a danger to themselves or&#xD;
      others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications will be optimized as per standard practice throughout the 4-week study. Suicide&#xD;
      safety plans, referrals to outpatient treatments will done as per standard practice.&#xD;
      Participants will be directed to contact the nearest ER in case of emergency after initial&#xD;
      hospital discharge. Participants will be contacted weekly during the 4-week study period to&#xD;
      review the patient's health status and administer clinical scales by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment. Informed consent will be obtained. This evaluation will obtain family&#xD;
      history and demographic data. We will perform a urine drug screening (UDS) to rule out recent&#xD;
      undisclosed use of illicit substances that may exclude subjects from the study. Demographic&#xD;
      information is obtained through a standardized form and covers age, race, gender, education&#xD;
      (information both on siblings and their parents), religion, and socioeconomic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out the mood questionnaires rating the severity of the clinical&#xD;
      symptoms. Participants will be asked about previous medications they have taken for mental&#xD;
      health disorders and general medical conditions. Results will be stored in a secure location&#xD;
      by the department of clinical research. Selected mood assessment questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered by our clinical research staff including the MINI Interview. This is the&#xD;
      standard psychiatric research evaluation for ascertainment of psychiatric diagnosis in the&#xD;
      context of research studies. It is a comprehensive structured interview for determining axis&#xD;
      I diagnosis according to the DSM-V to be administered at study entry and takes approximately&#xD;
      15 minutes. We will also use the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS): this&#xD;
      scale rates depressive symptoms, and its psychometric properties are well-established. We&#xD;
      will assess SI with the Suicidal Scale Instrument. The clinician-rated SSI assessed current&#xD;
      severity of suicidal ideation with 19 items scaled from 0 (least severe) to 2 (most severe).&#xD;
      We will also assess dissociation with the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale&#xD;
      (CADSS): Frequency of administration: After every treatment, to monitor the dissociative side&#xD;
      effects status post infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-report questionnaires to assess mood, and quality of life will include Quick inventory&#xD;
      of depressive symptomatology QIDS-SR to measure self-reported depressive symptoms, weekly and&#xD;
      the World health organization quality of life scale.&#xD;
