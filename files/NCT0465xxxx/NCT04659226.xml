  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erenumab, a monoclonal antibody acting on the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)&#xD;
      receptor, is an effective and safe migraine-specific preventive drug. The use of&#xD;
      migraine-specific preventive drugs paves the way for a novel method to study migraine&#xD;
      pathogenesis. Migraine is a complex disorder with several genetic and epigenetic influence,&#xD;
      including that of microRNA. Several microRNAs, including those of inflammation and of&#xD;
      endothelial function, have high expression levels in subjects with migraine; however, the&#xD;
      findings of the available studies are insufficient to provide epigenetic biomarkers for&#xD;
      migraine. Besides, little evidence is available on the role of migraine preventive treatments&#xD;
      in the expression of microRNA. The study aims at evaluating the expression profiles of&#xD;
      microRNAs before and after erenumab treatment prescribed according to clinical indication.&#xD;
      The study will include women with episodic or chronic migraine treated with erenumab 140 mg&#xD;
      monthly according to the Summary of Product Characteristics and local reimbursement criteria.&#xD;
      The study will compare the expression profile of microRNAs in women with episodic and chronic&#xD;
      migraine; besides, it will investigate differences in migraine-associated microRNA expression&#xD;
      according to age, migraine characteristics, pain intensity, response to erenumab,&#xD;
      migraine-related impact and disability.&#xD;
