  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open-label, non-randomised study to assess the mass balance&#xD;
      recovery, absorption, metabolism, and excretion of a single oral dose of [14C]-NT-814 in&#xD;
      healthy male subjects. It is planned to enrol 6 subjects. Each subject will receive a single&#xD;
      dose of 120 mg [14C] NT-814 containing not more than (NMT) 5.6 megabecquerel (MBq) [14C],&#xD;
      administered as an oral suspension in the fasted state. Subjects will remain in the study&#xD;
      until a mass balance cumulative recovery of &gt;90% and &lt;1% of the dose administered has been&#xD;
      collected in urine and faeces within 2 separate, consecutive 24 hour periods.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo preliminary screening procedures for the study up to 28 days before&#xD;
      [14C]-NT-814 administration. Subjects will be admitted in the evening on the day prior to&#xD;
      [14C]-NT-814 administration (Day -1) at which time further screening procedures will be&#xD;
      undertaken to confirm eligibility. Subjects will be dosed in the morning of Day 1 following&#xD;
      an overnight fast of a minimum of 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned that subjects will be released as a group when all subjects have achieved a&#xD;
      mass balance cumulative recovery of &gt;90% and &lt;1% of the dose administered has been collected&#xD;
      in urine and faeces within 2 separate, consecutive 24 hour periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This may result in the subjects being discharged as a group prior to completion of the&#xD;
      planned residency period. If the mass balance discharge criteria are achieved during the&#xD;
      planned residency period, collection of all samples (blood, urine, and faeces) will be&#xD;
      stopped and subjects will undergo discharge assessments. If mass balance discharge criteria&#xD;
      have not been met by all subjects by Day 15, the residency period for the subjects not&#xD;
      achieving the mass balance discharge criteria may be extended up to a maximum of 48 hours&#xD;
      (i.e., up to Day 17). Blood, urine and faeces will be collected for 24 hour intervals during&#xD;
      the extended residency period whilst the subjects are resident in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the mass balance discharge criteria are still not met by Day 17, subjects will enter a&#xD;
      home collection phase during which they will collect 24-hour urine and faeces on a daily&#xD;
      basis up until Day 24 (or until the criteria are met) and then on a weekly basis starting on&#xD;
      Day 31 (until criteria met or Day 45 reached). During the period of weekly collection, mass&#xD;
      balance cumulative recovery will be estimated by means of interpolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional collections will be performed for subjects who still do not meet the criteria&#xD;
      on Day 45. Subjects entering the home collection phase will return on Day 19 ± 12 hours for&#xD;
      blood sample collection. Discharge safety assessments will be performed at the time of actual&#xD;
      discharge from the clinical unit.&#xD;

Treatment-emergent AEs are AEs that commenced during/after the administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP) or commenced before administration of IMP (i.e., a pre-dose AE or existing medical condition) but worsened in intensity during exposure to IMP.</description>
