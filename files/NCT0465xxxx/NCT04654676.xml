    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a prospective study in patients with T2DM on twice daily MHI with&#xD;
      or without metformin therapy. Blinded continuous glucose monitoring was performed at baseline&#xD;
      and following 6 weeks of Vildagliptin therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective study involving adult patients with T2DM attending diabetes clinics in&#xD;
      2 state hospitals in Malaysia. Patients with HbA1c of 7-10% who were treated with stable dose&#xD;
      of twice daily premixed human insulin (30% regular insulin, 70% Neutral Protamine Hagedorn)&#xD;
      for at least 3 months, with or without metformin as combination therapy, were recruited.&#xD;
      Consented participants attended a single education session with a diabetes nurse educator&#xD;
      focusing mainly on self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), hypoglycemia recognition and&#xD;
      management, and the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), before undergoing a 7 days&#xD;
      blinded CGM (Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge, CA) to collect baseline GV data. The participants&#xD;
      were instructed to perform SMBG 4 times daily for CGM calibration and record any symptomatic&#xD;
      hypoglycemic episodes in the SMBG diary. Baseline demographic, insulin dosage as well as&#xD;
      HbA1c and renal function were collected. The results of the CGM were blinded to the study&#xD;
      participants and investigators till the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were then started on Vildagliptin (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) for 6&#xD;
      weeks duration. The dose of Vildagliptin was determined based on calculated eGFR using MDRD&#xD;
      (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) IDMS (isotope dilution mass spectrometry) traceable&#xD;
      formula. Vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily was prescribed for patients with eGFR â‰¥ 50 ml/min&#xD;
      while patients with eGFR &lt; 50 ml/min received Vildagliptin 50 mg daily as per prescription&#xD;
      information recommendation. Drug accountability were assessed by tablet count. Throughout the&#xD;
      study period, insulin doses were kept stable but may be adjusted by the investigators in the&#xD;
      event of recurrent or severe hypoglycemia. The participants were also given the diabetes&#xD;
      team's contact number for adjustment of insulin should they experience more frequent&#xD;
      hypoglycemia with initiation of Vildagliptin, as per usual clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repeat 7 day CGM was performed after 6 weeks of Vildagliptin therapy. Changes in weight,&#xD;
      insulin dosage and any symptomatic hypoglycemia episodes occurring during the study period&#xD;
      were recorded. Data collected from the CGM device were analyzed with EasyGV software to&#xD;
      derive the glycemic variability parameters. Primary outcome measures for GV were changes in&#xD;
      mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and standard deviation of the mean glucose&#xD;
      levels (SD). The investigators also examined other secondary GV measures including M value,&#xD;
      mean absolute glucose (MAG), continuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA), low blood&#xD;
      glucose index (LBGI), high blood glucose index (HBGI) and lability index (LI). In addition,&#xD;
      quality of glycemic control with addition of DPP4-I treatment by assessing the % time in&#xD;
      range (TIR) with blood glucose in target range of 3.9-10.0 mmol/L, % time above range (TAR),&#xD;
      % time below range (TBR) and % of time spent in clinically significant level 2 hypoglycemia&#xD;
      (blood glucose &lt; 3.0 mmol/L regardless of symptoms) were explored. Area under the curve (AUC)&#xD;
      above and below blood glucose target of 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L respectively as well as glycemic&#xD;
      estimate, i.e. estimated HbA1c (eA1c) from CGM data were also assessed before and after&#xD;
      Vildagliptin treatment.&#xD;
