      This study is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, open-label, staged clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ELS System in subjects undergoing&#xD;
           transanal endoluminal procedures in the rectum and distal colon (up to 17 cm from the&#xD;
           anal verge).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate a program for training surgeons and their teams to successfully use the ELS&#xD;
           System.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) is the current standard treatment for non-malignant&#xD;
      colorectal polyps in the United States. Large colorectal polyps are most often removed&#xD;
      piecemeal when using EMR, as en-bloc resection becomes increasingly challenging with&#xD;
      increasing lesion size. The major drawback of EMR is its low en-bloc resection rate. The&#xD;
      piecemeal nature of the resection hinders margin assessment, which consequently results in&#xD;
      low R0 resection rates and causes uncertainty regarding the appropriate treatment plan for&#xD;
      the patient going forward. This outcome results in surveillance colonoscopies at shorter&#xD;
      intervals to evaluate for recurrence, which in turn, increases patient anxiety and poses a&#xD;
      burden on the healthcare system. Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) enables en bloc&#xD;
      resection and therefore improved histopathological assessment of margins and has been&#xD;
      reported to have highly improved R0 resection rates when compared with EMR. ESD is a common&#xD;
      treatment option for large colorectal lesions in Asia; however, the technical difficulty and&#xD;
      steep learning curve, which are mainly attributed to the lack of traction and countertraction&#xD;
      capability, have resulted in low adoption of ESD in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ColubrisMX Endoluminal Surgical (ELS) System represents a marked advancement in the&#xD;
      removal of non-malignant colorectal lesions. Robotic-assisted instrumentation with bimanual&#xD;
      dexterity allows for application of traction and counter-traction and closure of the defect&#xD;
      via suturing, and enables the technically challenging, single-handed ESD procedure to be&#xD;
      conducted via a two-handed, robotic-assisted, transanal endoluminal surgical approach. The&#xD;
      ELS System consists of two main components: the Patient Cart and the Surgeon Console. This&#xD;
      system gains access by means of a flexible overtube (Colubriscope) that can be manually&#xD;
      inserted up to 17 cm into the distal colon. The ELS System provides full visualization of the&#xD;
      surgical site and the ability to manipulate up to two surgical instruments and a&#xD;
      robotic-assisted third-party flexible endoscope (Olympus GIF-XP190), which is referred to as&#xD;
      the &quot;videoscope&quot;. The ELS Surgical Instruments are robotically assisted with full&#xD;
      triangulation and articulation with up to 7 degrees of freedom to provide enhanced dexterity&#xD;
      in narrow endoluminal anatomy.&#xD;
