      The purpose of the RCT trial is to determine whether endovenous radiofrequency closure&#xD;
      catheter and endovenous radiofrequency closure generator is not inferior to ClosureFast™ and&#xD;
      ClosureRFG™ in treating varicose veins of lower extremity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, multi-center, 1:1 randomized using endovenous radiofrequency&#xD;
      closure catheter and endovenous radiofrequency closure generator versus ClosureFast™ and&#xD;
      ClosureRFG™ to treat varicose veins of lower extremity. And parimary endpoint is Complete&#xD;
      closure rate of great saphenous vein at 6 months post-procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Closure is defined as Doppler ultrasound examination (including color flow, compression, and pulsed Doppler) showing closure along the entire treated target vein segment with no discrete segments of patency exceeding 5 cm. Recanalization is defined as openings along the treated segment exceeding 5 cm in length as detected by duplex ultrasound.&#xD;
Complete closure rate = the number of subjects with closure of target vein in the group / the total number of subjects in the group x100%</description>

    <time_frame>at 6 months post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline in venous clinical severity score (VCSS) (0-30, higher scores mean a worse outcome) in outpatient services. the VCSS was derived by the American Venous Forum from the CEAP classification and provides means by which clinical outcomes in venous disease can be monitored in time.Compared to the CEAP, VCSS is said to be more responsive to changes in disease severity, thus making it great for progressive rankings. It proved good inter and intra observer reproducibility and is often cited in quality of life assessments.</description>

The Aberdeen Varicose Vein questionnaire (AVVQ) with 14-question survey was used to determine the quality of life of patients with varicose veins both before and after surgery.</description>
