  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are highly effective lipid-lowering drugs, the combination of which makes it&#xD;
      possible to achieve the target level of LDL-C in most patients with familial&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia (FH). However, the effectiveness of treatment of FH patients strongly&#xD;
      depends on adherence to lipid-lowering therapy and to the healthy lifestyle, as well as the&#xD;
      detection of the disease and the therapy prescription as early as possible, better in&#xD;
      childhood. The aim of the study is to assess the impact of genetic testing and motivational&#xD;
      counseling on the effectiveness of treatment and cascade screening in patients with FH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several tasks of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the effect of knowledge of patients with FH about the result of their FH&#xD;
           genetic testing on the adherence to a healthy lifestyle and hypolipidemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the impact of knowledge of patients with FH about the result of their FH&#xD;
           genetic testing on the effectiveness of cascade screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the influence of motivational counseling of patients with FH on the adherence&#xD;
           to a healthy lifestyle and hypolipidemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the impact of motivational counseling of patients with FH on the effectiveness&#xD;
           of cascade screening.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The trial is a randomized prospective cohort study. The study will include patients 18 years of age and older with a probable or definite diagnosis of FH according to the Dutch criteria (6 points or more). A total of 180 patients will be included in the study. All patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups for genetic testing. Randomization will be performed as block randomization with a 2:1 allocation ratio (2 with genetic testing : 1 without genetic testing). The allocation ratio 2:1 was chosen because in the group with genetic testing there will be cases where mutation(s) associated with FH will be identified and cases where the mutation(s) will not be identified. A separate analysis is planned in patients with genetic testing and identified mutation(s) and in patients with genetic testing but no identified mutation(s).&#xD;
Each study group will be randomized into 2 subgroups depending on the conduct of motivational counseling with an 1:1 allocation ratio.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>DNA is extracted using the QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The DNA concentration is measured on a Qubit 4.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA (TFS)). NGS is performed on Nextseq 550 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The library preparation is performed using the SeqCap EZ Prime Choice Library kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The Roche panel is used, consisting of 244 (CDS + 25 bp padding) genes including LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9. Reads are aligned to the reference genome (GRCh37). Sequencing analysis resultes in fastq files. Data processing is performed with BWA, Picard, bcftools, GATK3 and generally followed the GATK best practices for variant calling. For clinical interpretation, genetic variants with frequencies in the gnomAD database &lt;0.5% are selected. The pathogenicity of variants is assessed according to the ACMG / AMP2015 guidelines. The identified SNPs are validated by Sanger sequencing (3500 DNA Analyzer, TFS).</description>

    <description>All patients will be prescribed ezetimibe and statins (atorvastatin / rosuvastatin) at the maximum dosage. If somebody has an intolerance to atorvastatin, the drug will be replaced with rosuvastatin and vice versa. In case of intolerance to all drugs from the statin group, the patient will be prescribed ezetimibe with a PCSK9 inhibitor (alirocumab / evolocumab). After receiving the results of the lipid spectrum, ALT, if necessary, the lipid-lowering therapy may be corrected.</description>
