      This research aims to evaluate the ability of individual reminiscence therapy (RT), using a&#xD;
      simple reminiscence format, to improve the overall cognitive function, memory, emotional&#xD;
      status and quality of life (QoL) of older adults with neurocognitive disorders (NCD)&#xD;
      attending social care and support services. A multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      is proposed in Azores archipelago with repeated measures (pre-intervention, post-intervention&#xD;
      and follow-up). Intervention group will hold 26 individual RT sessions, twice a week for 13&#xD;
      weeks. Control group participants will maintain their treatment as usual. Make a subsample&#xD;
      analysis of the main clinical diagnoses, and compare the results of sample and subsample with&#xD;
      a previous study that had the same intervention protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurocognitive disorder (NCD) is one of the main causes of disability among older adults and&#xD;
      its prevalence is increasing due to the ageing of the population. It is estimated that&#xD;
      globally, neurocognitive disorders affect 44.35 million people and it is expected that by the&#xD;
      year 2050 the number of those affected worldwide will triple up to 135.46 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absence of an effective pharmacological treatment that halts or delays the development of&#xD;
      the disease has aroused interest in non-pharmacological therapies (NPT) as a complement to&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment that can improve the quality of life of people with neurocognitive&#xD;
      disorders. One of the most researched NPT and with the greatest tradition in this field is&#xD;
      Reminiscence Therapy (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT implies the discussion of past activities, events and experiences, usually with the help&#xD;
      of triggers (e.g., photographs, home objects and other familiar items from the past, music,&#xD;
      any object or stimulus) that serve to stimulate memories. In its application to dementias, RT&#xD;
      is based on the fact that the memory deficit of people with dementia implies that they are&#xD;
      able to remember events from their past life, especially from childhood to early adulthood,&#xD;
      but not newer facts. It focuses on preserved capacities and memories, promotes communication&#xD;
      and enables the person to connect with his past and recover his sense of personal identity.&#xD;
      In this way, the RT can be understood as an intervention on the edge of those of cognitive&#xD;
      orientation and those centred on emotion, with potential interactive effects on&#xD;
      autobiographical memory and psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In simplified form, there are at least two approaches to RT. The first approach as a &quot;life&#xD;
      review&quot; where participants are guided through significant experiences of their biography&#xD;
      trying to give meaning to their lives. This type of RT is more structured and is usually&#xD;
      conducted in an individual format. It may involve the production of &quot;life books&quot;. This&#xD;
      approach is considered to have an integrative function aimed at achieving a sense of&#xD;
      validation, coherence and reconciliation with one's past. Another approach that call general&#xD;
      or simple reminiscence, implies the stimulation of autobiographical memory during&#xD;
      conversations on specific themes of the past (e.g, holidays, food and drink, work) using&#xD;
      stimulus to trigger memories. It has been described as an unstructured autobiographical&#xD;
      memory narration. This reminiscence format can be conducted both individually and in groups&#xD;
      and promotes communication between participants who share their memories and stories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In either format that RT is applied on, the introduction of triggering stimulus (e.g.,&#xD;
      photographs, music, old objects) to help memory is considered fundamental. These triggers can&#xD;
      be generic, reflecting common experiences in the lives of people relevant to their age group&#xD;
      (e.g., a school manual can serve as a reminder of the experience during their school stage),&#xD;
      or specific, with stimulus related to the person's own experiences (e.g., photographs of an&#xD;
      important vital event such as their wedding day or a journey during their youth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for the effectiveness of RT, according to a recent review by Cochrane, there is some&#xD;
      evidence on its positive effects on cognition, QoL, communication and possibly on the mood of&#xD;
      people with dementia, even if the benefits are small. Despite the distinction between the two&#xD;
      different approaches to RT (general reminiscence vs. life history), the therapy modality does&#xD;
      not seem to be as important to achieve positive effects as the individual or group format of&#xD;
      the sessions and the context in which the intervention is administered (people living in the&#xD;
      community or institutionalised).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, according to the results of the review study, the RT seems to be able to&#xD;
      generate a small benefit on cognitive function immediately after the intervention, although&#xD;
      it usually does not continue after a longer follow-up period. Regarding the administration&#xD;
      format, the individual RT seems slightly superior in its effects on cognition both&#xD;
      immediately and after a follow-up period. In any case, its effects seem comparable to those&#xD;
      of other cognitive stimulation modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for the effect of RT on quality of life (QoL), an individual RT study based on life&#xD;
      review, showed an improvement in Qol-AD. The effects with a group modality do not seem&#xD;
      consistent, showing little or no effect on QoL, although the key factor may be the context of&#xD;
      application (community vs. institution), with better group RT results in institutionalised&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a multicentre study conducted in Portugal with older adults with neurocognitive disorders,&#xD;
      in individual format, there was a significant effect on the overall cognition, memory and QoL&#xD;
      of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group RT was associated with a likely effect on communication both after the intervention and&#xD;
      in the follow-up. This effect was not replicated in the individual RT, with uncertain&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, despite the evidence on the effect of RT on the mood of elderly people without&#xD;
      dementia, in the case of people with dementia only a small effect on mood was found for those&#xD;
      participating in individual RT. In the portuguese multicentre studies there were no&#xD;
      significant differences in depressive symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above, this research proposal aims to evaluate the ability of individual RT&#xD;
      within a general reminiscence format, to improve overall cognitive function, in particular&#xD;
      memory, emotional state (depression and anxiety) and QoL of older adults with neurocognitive&#xD;
      disorders attending social care and support services in the Azores archipelago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention in the endpoint assessment and&#xD;
      the duration of the effects at three months follow-up. Furthermore, an analysis of results&#xD;
      based on the diagnosis of the participants is proposed for those diagnoses with sufficient&#xD;
      representation in the sample (more than 20 cases in each group). Additionally, it is proposed&#xD;
      to analyze the factors that predict the response to the intervention (responder analysis).&#xD;
      Finally, the results of this study will be compared and can be analyzed together with those&#xD;
      of a previous study that used the same individual RT program and the same experimental design&#xD;
      (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT04047238).&#xD;
