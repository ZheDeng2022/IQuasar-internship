  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Routine examination of vitamin D levels is carried out by checking serum 25 (OH)D levels,&#xD;
      which indicate circulating vitamin D levels. While serum 1.25 (OH) D levels are less&#xD;
      frequently utilized, they represent the active form of vitamin D and could be a substitute&#xD;
      for checking vitamin D levels. This study aims to find the correlation between vitamin D&#xD;
      levels, namely 25 (OH) D and 1.25 (OH) D saliva, which correlate with serum 25 (OH) D and&#xD;
      1.25 (OH) D levels in the examination of salivary vitamin D, and which could be a substitute&#xD;
      for checking serum vitamin D levels.&#xD;

      Province, Indonesia. The parameters studied were 25 (OH) D and 1.25 (OH) D levels of saliva&#xD;

    <description>Salivary 25 (OH) D assay can be used to replace serum 25 (OH) D assay in healthy people as a non-invasive alternative. Examination using saliva as a substitute for serum testing is expected to facilitate the examination of 25 (OH) D.</description>

    <description>The tests carried out were examination of 25 (OH) D and 1.25 (OH) D levels of serum and saliva, examination of demographic data, and other anthropometries. The examination was carried out by taking 5 mL of blood and 2 mL of saliva, and then checking the serum and saliva levels of 25 (OH) D and 1.25 (OH) D. Before the examination, the research subjects were asked not to consume food or drink for at least 90 minutes before being examined. Centrifugation was carried out (2500 g, 10 minutes) and the product immediately stored at -20 oC. In the serum examination, after the blood was drawn, centrifugation was carried out and the product stored at -20 oC for further determination of the levels of 25 (OH) D and 1.25 (OH) saliva.</description>
