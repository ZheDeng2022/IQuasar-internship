      Background: Haptic systems represent the highest level of computer based education&#xD;
      technologies and enable students to learn at the highest level. These applications increase&#xD;
      the student's focus as well as making the education non-monotonous and insuring teaching&#xD;
      permanent by ensuring the active participation of the student.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of using haptic technology&#xD;
      in teaching urinary catheter application skill on the level of success and satisfaction about&#xD;
      this skill.&#xD;

      Method: This randomized-controlled experimental study was conducted with nursing students&#xD;
      registered at a public university between December 2018 and March 2019. The sample of the&#xD;
      study included 78 second grade students who gave consent after being informed about the aim&#xD;
      of the study and who met the inclusion criteria. Control (n=39) and experimental (n=39)&#xD;
      groups were determined through randomization using simple numbers table. Urinary&#xD;
      catheterization application skill was taught with the standard curriculum (demonstration on&#xD;
      the model) to the control group while it was taught with haptic-controlled computer based&#xD;
      simulation technology to the experimental group. Data were collected using &quot;Structured&#xD;
      Student Introduction Form,&quot; &quot;Skill Checklist for Teaching Urinary Catheterization Skill&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;Questionnaire for Satisfaction with Training Methods.&quot;&#xD;

    <measure>Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>The survey consists of 16 statements and the participants were asked to give a score for each instruction method on a five-item Likert-type scale between 1 and 5 (1-absolutely not agree, 5-absolutely agree). It is found that as the scale score average increases, students' satisfaction with the educational method increases, and as the scale score average decreases, their satisfaction with the education method decreases. In the evaluation of the scale, students are given a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 80 points for their satisfaction with their educational methods.</description>

    <description>After the theoretical lesson, the students in the experimental group were taken to the laboratory room where the 3D Systems Touch Haptic Simulator is located. The simulator has a choice of 45 minutes of full instruction, 5 minutes of haptic arm only, or the option. Since the preparation of the material in the full teaching method in the simulator takes a long time, these steps were removed to show similarity with the control group. The skill practice option for an average of 5-10 minutes where all steps of the Checklist for Teaching Urinary Catheterization Skill can be applied was used. Urinary catheterization with 3D Systems Touch Haptic Simulator was explained by 1 researcher who was responsible for the Fundamentals of Nursing course.</description>

    <description>After the theoretical lesson, the control group was taken to Fundamentals of Nursing Skill Laboratory. 1 researcher, who is responsible for the Fundamentals of Nursing, was explained on the Simple Urinary Catheterization Model by applying the steps of &quot;Checklist for Teaching Urinary Catheterization Skills&quot;. The students were allowed to ask questions and the questions asked were answered. Then all the students in the control group were taken to an empty class. The two researchers prepared the necessary materials for the urinary catheterization skill practice in the same way in separate rooms. The doors were closed to keep the environment calm during the application. One student was taken to each laboratory rooms in order not to be affected by each other. While the student was practicing, both researchers filled in the Checklist for Teaching Urinary Catheterization Skills. Satisfaction Questionnaire was given to the student who completed the application and asked to fill it.</description>
