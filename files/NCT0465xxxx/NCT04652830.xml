  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diastasis of the rectus abdominis muscles (DRAM) is a common condition after pregnancy and&#xD;
      after great loss of weight. Distension of linea alba is a normal process during pregnancy&#xD;
      caused by the growing fetus as well as from hormonal changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the majority of cases, DRAM regresses during the postpartum period and the abdomen resumes&#xD;
      its normal function. I some cases, however, the DRAM persists for a long period. This may&#xD;
      result in trunk instability, back pain and decreased abdominal muscle strength. Risk factors&#xD;
      for persisting DRAM are multiparity, high maternal age and cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about how DRAM affects abdominal function. The lack of studies on the impact&#xD;
      of DRAM on trunk instability and back pain has made it difficult to evaluate studies aiming&#xD;
      at reducing the problems caused by DRAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative management, including training aiming at strengthening the abdominal muscles, is&#xD;
      usually considered the first hand alternative. There are, however, few studies on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of training programs for the purpose of preventing DRAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific training&#xD;
      program during a limited period of time postpartum in women with DRAM. The investigators also&#xD;
      intend to study the changes in anatomy of linea alba during the postpartum period and explore&#xD;
      whether the changes are affected by the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a randomized single-blind controlled trial. Women with&#xD;
      diastasis of &gt; 3 cm will be invited. The aim is to include 70 women. Half of them will be&#xD;
      randomized to a training program for 3 month and the other half will be followed as a control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the study, the line alba is examined with ultrasound. The width of the&#xD;
      diastasis is registered. The laxity and thickness of line alba are also evaluated. The&#xD;
      abdominal circumference is measured at rest and under straining, in different postures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the study, the woman is request to rate her level of physical activity&#xD;
      (Baecke questionnaire) pain, self-assessed functional level (DRI), back pain (Oswestry low&#xD;
      back disability index), urinary incontinence (UDI-6, IID-7) and quality of life (EQ-5D). The&#xD;
      Abdominal Trunk Function Protocol (ATFP) is also registered at the start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessors performing the ultrasound examination and physical examinations are blinded to&#xD;
      the allocation. Women allocated to the training program perform exercises with a duration of&#xD;
      ten minutes 6 days a week. They also perform 3 exercises with a duration of 60 seconds three&#xD;
      times a day. The exercises are continued for three months. All women, those allocated to&#xD;
      training as well as the control group, are invited to follow-up examinations 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At both follow-up examinations the abdominal wall is investigated with ultrasound, the&#xD;
      abdominal circumference is measured and the woman is requested to respond to all the&#xD;
      questionnaires that she received at the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will focus on the effect of the training program on the width and laxity of the&#xD;
      linea alba as well as symptoms of back pain, trunk instability and incontinence.&#xD;
