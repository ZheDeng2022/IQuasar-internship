  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, insufficient Physical Activity (PA) and sedentary life style is recognized as major&#xD;
      causes of mortality among young and older adults. Approximately, 5 million deaths are&#xD;
      attributed due to physical inactivity (PI), which contributes around 6% of global death. The&#xD;
      recent evidence shows that 80 million individuals in Pakistan suffered with non-communicable&#xD;
      diseases, due to PI that ultimately lead to sedentary behavior. Therefore, the clinical&#xD;
      practitioners have been highlighting in improving the physical activity among young adults&#xD;
      not only to prevent chronic disease but also to reduce the risk factors. Despite of the fact,&#xD;
      a large number of young adults are PI where this proportion remains high among women. WHO&#xD;
      reports that generally, PI is found to be more prevalent in women, due to workload of house&#xD;
      chores and care giving role in influence of cultural expectations, especially in low socio&#xD;
      economic status. Furthermore, several other factors including high cost of fitness programs,&#xD;
      access to physical activity facilities, transportation and most importantly time barrier are&#xD;
      the major cause of insufficient PA. Addressing the above barriers, different exercise&#xD;
      training protocols have been developed to reduce weight in short span of time and then to&#xD;
      maintain it. According to American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), High Intensity Circuit&#xD;
      Training (HICT) is a circuit-style workout that uses individual body weight as a resistance&#xD;
      therefore eliminating the need of expensive gym equipment such as dumbbells, barbells kettle&#xD;
      bells and many more. In addition, HICT can be performed in any environment (at home, parks&#xD;
      and in small place) as per the feasibility of the person. However, overweight and obese women&#xD;
      are found to adhere easily with short bout of exercises (10 minutes) then same women with&#xD;
      long duration of exercises. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide cost effective and&#xD;
      efficient exercise intervention that may not only reduce the disease burden but also motivate&#xD;
      young sedentary females for group activity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A total 60 healthy sedentary overweight females will be recruited from Sikandrabad. The&#xD;
      participants shall be screened by using standardize Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PAR-Q &amp; YOU). After screening, a healthy participant will be allowed to attend the&#xD;
      orientation session, where a qualified and trained instructor shall discuss and describe the&#xD;
      exercise training protocol. The High Intensity Circuit Training comprises of 7 full body&#xD;
      exercises as per recommendation of ACSM, where the participants shall be given total of 18&#xD;
      sessions of their respective protocol, comprising of 20 minutes, 3 times/ week for duration&#xD;
      of six weeks. Pre and post assessment will be performed for each participant on all three&#xD;
      quantitative outcome measures; Physical Fitness, Body fat percentage and Waist-hip ratio. The&#xD;
      training protocol will be terminated on the happening of following event; a) Decrease in&#xD;
      oxygen saturation &lt; 90%assessed b) Increase in Heart Rate above the highest limits of&#xD;
      Targeted Heart Rate c) if subject feel any discomforts, dizziness, fainting or difficulty in&#xD;
      breathing during performance.&#xD;
