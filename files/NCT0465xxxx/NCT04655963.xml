  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few treatments are available for post-stroke rehabilitation. The current study aims to&#xD;
      develop a novel, short-term, high-dose repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)&#xD;
      based intervention to improve post-stroke cognitive problems. This study will test the safety&#xD;
      as well as changes in cognitive function and brain activation with the administration of an&#xD;
      accelerated rTMS protocol in chronic stroke.&#xD;

      The goal of this pilot study is to determine whether a repetitive high-dose form of&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation is a promising and safe treatment for stroke-related cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved&#xD;
      treatment for depression, and is used commonly to treat people for their depression. In&#xD;
      studies of rTMS for depression and other disorders, individuals have experienced improved&#xD;
      cognitive function. Thus, we are testing here whether cognitive function in individuals with&#xD;
      chronic stroke could be improved by rTMS.&#xD;

    <description>This study will be demonstrating the safety of using rTMS in stroke patients by assessing adverse events and side effects using the intermittent transcranial brain stimulation (iTBS) Review of Systems questionnaire. The minimum value of the iTBS scale is 0 and the maximum is 75, the higher the score the more severe the side effects meaning a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>This study will be demonstrating the feasibility of using rapid transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in stroke patients by assessing retention throughout the study and using a credibility scale. The credibility scale maximum is 36 and minimum is 0, a higher ratings means higher credibility score which is a better outcome.</description>
