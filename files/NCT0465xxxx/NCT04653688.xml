  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to evaluate disease progression of patients with Parkinsonian&#xD;
      syndrome of various severity through regular home-based gait parameters analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We identified several steps in this project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acquisition of gait data in 120 patients with Parkinsonism at different stages in&#xD;
           hospital and ecological condition (during 10 days at home), in a repetitive manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 30 Early PD patients, before 3 years of disease duration (MDS criteria, 2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 30 PD patients with motor fluctuations (5 to 8 years of disease duration) (MDS&#xD;
                criteria, 2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 30 PD patients with FoG (10 years of disease duration) (MDS criteria, 2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. 30 patients with MSA (less than 5 years after the first symptom)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control groups will be composed by 30 healthy volunteers Correlation analysis with&#xD;
           clinical measurements and biomarkers, namely blood biomarkers for neurodegeneration&#xD;
           (4HN, NFLT …) and multimodal MRI repeated assessments (Iron overload, inflammation and&#xD;
           degeneration) and genetic panel for common haplotypes involved in Parkinsonism.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes of UMSARS I-II versus baseline in MSA subgroup</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline at 12weeks, at 24 weeks and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>UMSARS contains four parts, the UMSARS-1 and UMSARS-2 are reported in this outcome. UMSARS-1 scores symptoms of neurological and autonomic dysfunction (12 questions). UMSARS-2 is motor examination (14 questions). All questions range from 0 (normal) to 4(extreme dysfunction). Higher scores mean greater the impairment. Negative change from baseline values indicate improvement.</description>

    <description>MSA-QoL is a patient-rated health-related Quality of life scale for patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Visual Analog score is designed to determine overall life satisfaction in patient with MSA. Scale is given response option format (0 - extremely unsatisfied with life 100 - extremely satisfied with life), where higher scores indicate better satisfaction/quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>at baseline at 24 and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (SE-ADL) evaluates patients' perceptions of global functional capacity and dependence. Scoring is expressed in terms of percentage, in 10 steps from 100 to 0 (100% indicates completely independent, 0% indicates bedridden with impaired vegetative functions), so that the lower the score, the worse the functional status. The assessment is conducted by a trained clinician.</description>
