  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial identifies the best dose and clinical benefit of giving pemigatinib&#xD;
      following standard induction chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia. Pemigatinib selectively inhibits FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor) activity,&#xD;
      a receptor that may contribute to the growth of leukemia cells. The genetic changes&#xD;
      responsible for activating the growth of leukemia cells can be unique to each patient and can&#xD;
      change during the course of the disease. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cytarabine and&#xD;
      daunorubicin work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of pemigatinib (INC054828) following standard of&#xD;
      care induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess preliminary efficacy associated with study intervention. II. To assess the&#xD;
      safety profile of the study intervention. III. To evaluate time-to- marrow recovery between&#xD;
      cycles of pemigatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess minimal residual disease (MRD) by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and/or next-generation sequencing of acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) genetic abnormalities in bone marrow and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Quantify FGF2/FGFR immunohistochemical staining of marrow core biopsies and compare to&#xD;
      historical controls at various timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess ex vivo sensitivity of patient-derived mononuclear cells to pemigatinib with and&#xD;
      without FGF2 supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate pemigatinib-induced changes in stromal expression using cultured bone marrow&#xD;
      samples and compare to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate the impact of pemigatinib on the need for intravenous (IV) phosphate replacement&#xD;
      after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pemigatinib followed by a dose-expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive cytarabine IV on days 1-7, daunorubicin IV on days 1-3, and&#xD;
      pemigatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 8-21 in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with hematologic count recovery (assessed between days 25-42)&#xD;
      after induction proceed to consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive high dose cytarabine IV twice daily (BID) on days 1, 3, and&#xD;
      5, and pemigatinib PO QD on days 8-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

             acute myocardial infarction within 6 months from day 1 of planned induction therapy,&#xD;
             New York Heart Association class III or IV congestive heart failure, and uncontrolled&#xD;
             arrhythmia (participants with pacemaker or with atrial fibrillation and well&#xD;
             controlled heart rate are allowed). History or presence of an abnormal&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the investigator's opinion, is clinically meaningful.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A screening QT interval by Fridericia's Correction Formula (QTcF) interval &gt; 480&#xD;
                  ms will result in exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For participants with an intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval &gt; 120&#xD;
                  ms), the JTc interval may be used in place of the QTc with approval from&#xD;
                  Sponsor-Investigator. The JTc must be =&lt; 340 ms if JTc is used in place of the&#xD;
                  QTc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram &lt; 45% prior to initiating&#xD;
             pemigatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection that is not well-controlled by antibacterial or antiviral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of prohibited medications including use of any potent CYP3A4 inducers&#xD;
             within 14 days or five half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided but, if medically necessary, is&#xD;
                  permitted with a dose reduction of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Based on the low overall bioavailability of topical ketoconazole, there are no&#xD;
                  restrictions on topical ketoconazole&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of prohibited medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to pemigatinib, or its excipients, when administered alone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding at the time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would jeopardize the&#xD;
             safety of the participant or compliance with the protocol&#xD;
