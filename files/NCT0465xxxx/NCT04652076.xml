  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and the clinical activities of NP137 when&#xD;
      combined with pembrolizumab and/or chemotherapies in patients with advanced/metastatic&#xD;
      gynecological cancers (2 types: endometrial carcinoma and cervix carcinoma).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients with locally advanced/metastatic uterine (endometrial or cervical)&#xD;
      cancer progressing/relapsing after at least one prior systemic treatment remains poor. The&#xD;
      development of new innovative anti-tumor drug candidates as single agent or in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy or check point inhibitors is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NP137 is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody targeting specifically and&#xD;
      selectively Netrin-1. By blocking Netrin-1, NP137 is capable of restoring apoptosis in tumor&#xD;
      cells in vitro and in vivo, leading to therapeutic activity in various animal cancer models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependence receptors inhibitor such as NP137 might be a novel choice to improve the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The herein proposed study will be a multicenter, open-label, randomized, Phase I/II trial&#xD;
      with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety run in part to assess the safety of the therapeutic combinations for the first 6&#xD;
      patients enrolled in each of the therapeutic combinations independently of the tumor type.&#xD;
      According to safety rules, these therapeutic combinations will be investigated or not in the&#xD;
      Phase II part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase II part will be then conducted using an adaptive Bayesian approach allowing to&#xD;
      quickly stop treatment cohorts without evidence of efficacy and/or select promising treatment&#xD;
      cohorts. The Phase II part will be initiated with a preliminary step to assess the clinical&#xD;
      activity of the proposed therapeutic combinations in 2 tumor types before proceeding to the&#xD;
      activation of extension phase II part of the study. For each cohorts, clinical activity will&#xD;
      be assessed through by sequential statistical analysis at specific timepoints.&#xD;
