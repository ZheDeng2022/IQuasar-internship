  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This work is part of a broader research with women with fibromyalgia. The aim of this study&#xD;
      is to establish the effectiveness of implementation intentions to manage the preference for&#xD;
      avoiding pain and fatigue and stop walking exercise, versus to maintain the approximate&#xD;
      behavior (walking), taking into account high and low pain catastrophizing conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a widespread and diffuse musculoskeletal chronic pain problem not associated&#xD;
      with inflammatory or degenerative changes, often accompanied by fatigue and sleep problems,&#xD;
      in addition to anxiety, depression and cognitive dysfunction. Its prevalence in Europe for&#xD;
      adults is estimated at 2.5% with a higher proportion of women. The treatment incorporates&#xD;
      physical activity and exercise as one of its therapeutic aims has shown positive effects on&#xD;
      health outcomes.However, it has been reported that women with fibromyalgia are less active&#xD;
      than others with similar socio-demographic characteristics.Theories of behavioral&#xD;
      self-regulation that taking into account motivational and volitional processes&#xD;
      (implementation intentions) provide a conceptual framework to work with the incorporation and&#xD;
      maintenance of the exercise, helping these people to create strong goals and handle the&#xD;
      different self-regulation problems that can arise. These include the ones related to the&#xD;
      preference for avoidance goals (pain or fatigue avoidance) against performing or keep doing&#xD;
      an activity (walking exercise). This work searches to help women with fibromyalgia to manage&#xD;
      the above mentioned inhibitors to incorporate and maintain long-term physical exercise&#xD;
      walking. We consider the heterogeneity of people with fibromyalgia in pain catastrophizing,&#xD;
      which makes necessary to adapt interventions aimed to promote physical exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect participants with high catastrophizing and implementation intentions to control the&#xD;
      preference for avoiding pain or fatigue will walk more time than the other conditions.&#xD;
