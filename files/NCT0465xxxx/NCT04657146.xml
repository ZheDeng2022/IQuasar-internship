  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' recent studies show that large numbers of T cells in patients and mice&#xD;
      with intracranial tumors are sequestered in bone marrow. This phenomenon mysteriously&#xD;
      confines a pool of functional, naïve T cells with anti-tumor capacity to a compartment where&#xD;
      they are unable to access tumor, eliciting a mode of T cell dysfunction categorized as&#xD;
      &quot;ignorance.&quot; The investigators have uncovered that loss of the sphingosine-1-phosphate&#xD;
      receptor 1 (S1P1) from the surface of T cells mediates their sequestration in bone marrow,&#xD;
      while blocking internalization of S1P1 facilitates stabilization of the receptor on T cells&#xD;
      and frees them for anti-tumor activities. As the investigators look to design interventions&#xD;
      targeting β-arrestin mediated S1P1 internalization as a novel anti-tumor strategy, they need&#xD;
      to better understand variations in sequestration across patients, over time, and with&#xD;
      treatment. Assessing these variations and biomarkers that may accompany them will help to&#xD;
      establish a target treatment population, as well as the optimal timing for intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess variations in blood and bone marrow T cell counts as they relate to treatment&#xD;
           time-points in patients with glioblastoma (GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess variations in S1P1 levels and their correlation with blood and bone marrow T cell&#xD;
           counts over the course of treatment in patients with GBM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the associations between tumor size and degree of lymphopenia and bone marrow T&#xD;
           cell sequestration observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) subclasses with respect to the degree of&#xD;
           lymphopenia and bone marrow T cell sequestration observed at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine patient plasma, tumor supernatant, and tumor ribonucleic acid (RNA) for markers&#xD;
           that are associated with lymphopenia, T cell S1P1 levels, and bone marrow T cell&#xD;
           sequestration. Initial candidates will include transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) 1/2,&#xD;
           tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-33, IL-6, catecholamines, signal&#xD;
           transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) RNA, and Kruppel-like factor 2&#xD;
           (KLF2) RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare T cell phenotypes in the blood and bone marrow of patients exhibiting versus not&#xD;
           exhibiting T cell lymphopenia or sequestration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Compare differences in tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte numbers and phenotypes between&#xD;
           patients with and without lymphopenia / sequestration at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Establish baseline β-arrestin 1 and 2 expression in patients and assess variation across&#xD;
           individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Archive samples for subsequent assessment of β-arrestin recruitment to the cytoplasmic&#xD;
           component of T cell S1P1, as well as the capacity to inhibit such recruitment in vitro&#xD;
           with candidate small molecules.&#xD;
