  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, dose finding phase Ib trial studies the tolerability and the best dose of&#xD;
      fluzoparib in combination with apatinib and to see how well these two drugs work together as&#xD;
      second-line treatment of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. The safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib will be explored. Both dose escalation&#xD;
      and dose expansion parts are included in this study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The degree of malignancy of small cell lung cancer is extremely high. About 60% to 70% of&#xD;
      patients are diagnosed as extensive. The median survival time of the disease is only 9 to 10&#xD;
      months, and the 2-year survival rate is less than 10%. Fluzoparib is an oral potent,&#xD;
      selective poly-ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and PARP-2 inhibitor. Apatinib is an oral&#xD;
      selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor.This open-label, dose&#xD;
      finding phase Ib trial studies the tolerability and the best dose of fluzoparib in&#xD;
      combination with apatinib as second-line treatment of patients with extensive stage small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. The safety and efficacy of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
