      This project is to evaluate and compare the impact of tDCS stimulation location on augmenting&#xD;
      MT effects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mirror therapy (MT) has emerged as an effective treatment approach for stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;
      To augment the effects of MT, one appealing approach is to combine MT with transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) to promote neuroplasticity. However, it remains&#xD;
      undetermined as to how tDCS may be effectively and efficiently applied in conjunction with&#xD;
      MT. The long term goal of this project will be to identify the optimal combination approach&#xD;
      of MT and tDCS to enhance recovery after stroke. The stimulation timing and location of tDCS&#xD;
      in relation to MT will be varied, and the scientific evidence will be built upon by the&#xD;
      evaluation of comprehensive outcome measures. This project will also investigate the possible&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) physiological and motor control mechanisms, and study predictors&#xD;
      of treatment success to identify the appropriate patient population for the hybrid regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the first aim of this project is to evaluate and compare the impact of tDCS&#xD;
      stimulation location on augmenting MT effects. The tDCS will be applied either before or&#xD;
      concurrently with MT, and will be applied either over primary motor cortex (M1) or premotor&#xD;
      cortex (PMC). Outcome measures will include behavioral performances selected based on the&#xD;
      International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework, EEG&#xD;
      physiological measures, and kinematic control of upper extremity (UE) movements. All the&#xD;
      outcome measures will be assessed before and immediately after the intervention, and only&#xD;
      behavioral performances will be evaluated at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that immediately after intervention, the participants who receive MT combined&#xD;
      with tDCS will demonstrate greater improvements in the outcomes than those who receive MT&#xD;
      with sham tDCS. Investigators also hypothesize that the stimulation location of tDCS will&#xD;
      induce differential therapeutic effects on the outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of this study is to examine the retention performance of the behavioral&#xD;
      outcomes at 3-and 6-month follow-up. Investigators hypothesize that the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      the hybrid therapy will be retained 3 and 6 months post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third aim of this study is to perform subsequent analysis of exploring whether patients&#xD;
      with primary motor cortex involved will respond to various types of treatment differently&#xD;
      from those without primary motor cortex involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth aim of the study is to identify the characteristics of responders for the hybrid&#xD;
      therapy. The possible predictors of post treatment changes in behavioral (the aspects of&#xD;
      activities and participation), EEG physiological, and kinematic measures will be determined.&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that the behavioral (the aspect of motor impairment), the EEG&#xD;
      physiological and the kinematic measures will be good predictors for the treatment outcomes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline, posttest (1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>A wireless EEG device will be used to evaluate treatment-induced changes on cortical activity by ERD of mu rhythm EEG during the movements for reaching for pressing the desk button. The mu rhythm is a specific frequency range (8-12 Hz) in the EEG signal and the amplitude decrease in mu-rhythm power (called ERD) can be used to depict the temporal pattern of cortical activity when preparing, producing, and controlling movement events.&#xD;
The averaged area of the entire ERD curve under the reference level will be used as the amplitude parameter of cerebral activation. To characterize the ERD difference between the affected hemisphere and the unaffected hemisphere, a lateralization index (LI) will be used: LI = (ERDR- ERDL)/(ERDL+ERDR), where ERDR and ERDL represent the overall ERD areas (cerebral activation) of the C4 and C3 (or F4 and F3) channels. Significant increase of ERD in the damaged hemisphere and increase of LI will be indicators for a good recovery.</description>

    <measure>Kinematic Protocols</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, posttest (1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>The movement of the markers will be captured with a 7-camera motion analysis system. The reaching movements will be recorded at a frequency of 120 Hz, and low-pass filtered at 5 Hz using a 2nd-order Butterworth filter with dual-passes. The kinematic variables for data analysis will include reaction time(RT), movement time(MT), peak velocity(PV), the percentage of MT where peak velocity occurs(PPV), movement units(MU), and maximum grip aperture(MGA).&#xD;
MGA is obtained only during the reach-to-grasp tasks. Less RT and MT suggest better movement efficiency, while higher amplitude of PPV indicates a more preplanned movement. A fewer number of MUs would suggest a smoother movement induced by the treatment. Larger MGA indicates a better, skilled strategy. Larger changes in the angles of shoulder, elbow, and wrist will indicate a better movement, while smaller angular changes and movement distance of the trunk will represent less trunk compensatory movement.</description>

    <measure>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, posttest (1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>Consisting of 19 items, the PSQI measures several different aspects of sleep, offering seven component scores and one composite score.

    <measure>Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, posttest (1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the ActiGraph GX3 accelerometers (ActiGraph, Shalimar, FL, USA) to quantitatively measure the AOU outside the laboratory settings (Domene &amp; Easton, 2014). The participants will wear the actigraphy on bilateral wrist for 3 consecutive days before and after the intervention. The participants will be required to carry the actigraphy during all day activities except for water-based activities, such as bathing or swimming. The accelerometer will record the number of moves each minute, and the average counts of move per minute will be calculated as the primary outcome measure. Data recorded by the actigraphy will be analyzed with the MAHUFFE software (http://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/). The use of actigraphy to measure arm use and physical activity has been established for patients with stroke (Freedson, Melanson, &amp; Sirard, 1998; Maguire et al., 2012).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MyotonPro</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, posttest (1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the MyotonPRO device(http://www.syna-med.com.tw/pdf/MyotonPRO%20leaflet%20for%20printout.pdf) to evaluate the viscoelastic properties of UE muscles. The parameter characterized by MyotonPRO will include muscle tone, muscle stiffness, and muscle elasticity. To measure the muscular properties, the probe of the MyotonPRO will be placed perpendicular to the skin surface of the targeted muscle, and the device will create a brief mechanical impulse and evoke decaying oscillations of the muscle. The acceleration transducer will then record the damped oscillations and deformation of the muscle being tested and produce the myotonometric measurements. The clinimetric properties of the myometer have been established in patients with stroke.&#xD;
MyotonPRO's measurable parameters allow objectively to assess the efficacy of different interventions, sports exercise, symmetry, injuries or aging. MyotonPRO has more than one measurable parameters, they couldn't combined to report.</description>
