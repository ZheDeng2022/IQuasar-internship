    <textblock>
      The investigators are going to study the analgesic efficacy of intraperitoneal instillation&#xD;
      of a combination of Magnesium sulphate with bupivacaine versus ordinary used parenteral&#xD;
      analgesics for pain relief after laparoscopic surgeries in pediatrics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery is a modern surgical technique used for various surgeries such as&#xD;
      cholecystectomy, appendectomy and hernia repair. There are a number of advantages of this&#xD;
      technique including reduced pain and bleeding, shorter recovery time and hospital stay, and&#xD;
      over all reduced healthcare costs. The type of pain after laparoscopic surgery differs&#xD;
      considerably from that occurs after laparotomy. Usually patients experience diffuse pain in&#xD;
      abdomen, back and shoulder. Acute pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy has three different&#xD;
      components: incisional pain (somatic pain), visceral pain (deep intra-abdominal pain), and&#xD;
      shoulder pain (presumably referred visceral pain) . Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a&#xD;
      commonly observed phenomenon after laparoscopic procedures. Its incidence increases depending&#xD;
      on the anesthetic techniques used. Pain intensity usually peaks during the first&#xD;
      postoperative period and usually declines over the following 2-3 days. Pain can prolong&#xD;
      hospital stay and lead to increased morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inadequately treated pain may lead to splinting, loss of sighing and decrease in vital&#xD;
      capacity, and these may contribute to postoperative pulmonary morbidity. Various multimodal&#xD;
      approaches have, therefore, been tried to ameliorate postoperative pain. These include&#xD;
      parenteral analgesics, local infiltration with local anesthetics, epidural and intrathecal&#xD;
      opioids and local anesthetics, interpleural and intercostals nerve blocks as well as&#xD;
      intraperitoneal routes that in turn has been explored with local anesthetics and opioids . In&#xD;
      order to get an instant relief, polypharmacy is commonly practiced which can be potentially&#xD;
      harmful to the patient and can lead to re-admission. It has been appreciated that multiple&#xD;
      glutamate receptors are expressed on peripheral nerve terminals, and these may contribute to&#xD;
      peripheral nociceptive sensation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of magnesium sulphate via different routes has been used in anaesthetic&#xD;
      practice for decreasing perioperative pain. Parenteral magnesium sulphate has been used for&#xD;
      many years as an antiarrhythmic agent and for seizure prophylaxis in eclampsia and&#xD;
      preeclampsia. It is N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and suppresses these&#xD;
      receptor induced inflammation and hyper responsiveness . The antinociceptive effect of&#xD;
      magnesium sulphate is not only useful in chronic pain, but it also determines in part, the&#xD;
      duration and intensity of postoperative pain . These effects are due to calcium antagonism&#xD;
      and decrease influx of calcium into the cell and antagonism of NMDA receptor. As these&#xD;
      receptors regulate neuronal signalling and are involved in pain processing, magnesium&#xD;
      sulphate by blocking this receptor, decreases postoperative pain as well .&#xD;
