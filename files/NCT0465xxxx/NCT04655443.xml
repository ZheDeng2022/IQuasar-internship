    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical research study. The objective of this study is to evaluate if&#xD;
      clinical risk factors as well as structural features on echocardiography affect the&#xD;
      maintenance of sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion at 30 days. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate 140 patients to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly diagnosed arrhythmia in the United States. A&#xD;
      systematic review of worldwide population-based studies estimated that approximately 33&#xD;
      million people were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in 2010. The prevalence of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation in the United States increases with advancing age. Approximately 1% of patients&#xD;
      with atrial fibrillation are under 60 years of age whereas more than one-third are over 80&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although atrial fibrillation is commonly diagnosed and continues to have increased incidence&#xD;
      in the country, patients continue to be admitted to the hospital for worsening symptoms of&#xD;
      chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Long-term complications of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation include cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular events, thromboembolic events, and&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many medications have been established to convert patients from atrial fibrillation to normal&#xD;
      sinus rhythm; however procedures of cardioversion and ablation have also proven to be&#xD;
      effective. A study, the AFFIRM trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in&#xD;
      2002 discussed the benefit of converting patients to sinus rhythm versus keeping patients in&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation, however making sure their heart rates were well-controlled. This study&#xD;
      did not demonstrate a significant difference in death, ischemic stroke, or major bleeding in&#xD;
      both treatment arms suggesting there is no benefit of converting patients from atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. However, with increasing health costs occurring around&#xD;
      the country, every effort should be made to help improve patient symptoms and avoid&#xD;
      unnecessary hospitalizations. A study published in the Journal of American College of&#xD;
      Cardiology in 2004, &quot;Effect of rate or rhythm control on quality of life in persistent atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation: Results from the Rate Control Versus Electrical Cardioversion (RACE) study,&quot;&#xD;
      concluded that the quality of life was impaired in patients with atrial fibrillation. Another&#xD;
      study published in 2012, &quot;Economic Burden of Atrial Fibrillation: Implications for&#xD;
      Intervention,&quot; reported total costs of atrial fibrillation care in the United States to be&#xD;
      estimated to be $6.65 billion per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is designed to look at patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent electrical&#xD;
      cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm and create a prediction model to identify specific risk&#xD;
      factors, which may contribute to persistent atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction models have been established in regards to maintaining sinus rhythm, including the&#xD;
      Hatch Score, which examined risk factors of hypertension, history of TIA or stroke, chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure that predisposed patients to persistent&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation. Another score established was the LADS score, which observed risk&#xD;
      factors of left atrial diameter, age, history of stroke, and smoking status as predictors of&#xD;
      persistent atrial fibrillation. The purpose of our study is to create a new prediction model&#xD;
      using clinical and echocardiographic parameters to determine if these factors will predict&#xD;
      persistent atrial fibrillation after electrical cardioversion. Transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiographic parameters include imaging of the left atrial appendage (LAA) and&#xD;
      calculating the LAA ejection fraction (LAAEF) by 3D or biplane Simpson method (based on image&#xD;
      quality), and using pulse-wave Doppler to calculate the LAA exit velocity and S/D ratio&#xD;
      across the pulmonic vein. Transthoracic echocardiographic parameters include estimated&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial pressure (PASP) using tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet velocity, left&#xD;
      atrial volume index (LAVi), left ventricular (LV) size, LV hypertrophy (LVH) and left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).&#xD;
