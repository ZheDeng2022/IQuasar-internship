  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder with prevalence rates of at&#xD;
      least 4% among the middle-aged male Caucasians and Hong Kong (HK) Chinese populations. It is&#xD;
      characterized by repetitive episodes of upper airway obstruction, causing intermittent&#xD;
      hypoxia, sleep fragmentation, disabling daytime sleepiness, impaired cognitive function and&#xD;
      poor health status. OSAS patients are at increased risks of non-fatal and fatal&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality including sudden death, in addition to being more&#xD;
      prone to road traffic accidents. However, there is no long term follow up of patients with&#xD;
      OSAS on the incidence of cardiovascular disease, compliance on the therapy and the impact of&#xD;
      the quality of life. The study is aimed to carry out a prospective observational study&#xD;
      assessing the role of OSAS as a possible cause of increased cardiovascular risk and cognitive&#xD;
      decline.&#xD;

        Consecutive patients are recruited from the Respiratory Clinic at the Prince of Wales&#xD;
        Hospital with clinical suspicion of sleep-disordered breathing. The Respiratory Clinic&#xD;
        receives referral from hospital specialists and general practitioners. The clinical&#xD;
        evaluation procedure includes an interview by a respiratory specialist followed by either&#xD;
        an inpatient polysomnography or home polygraphic study according to the patients' clinical&#xD;
        characteristics and preference in concordance of the guidelines from the American Academy&#xD;
        of Sleep Medicine (AASM). Sleep records will be scored based on standardized criteria of&#xD;
        AASM.&#xD;
