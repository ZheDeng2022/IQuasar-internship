      Endocare® treatment is a stand-alone software medical device, which is composed of a mobile&#xD;
      application and an accessory VR headset, intended to mitigate the pain for patients prone to&#xD;
      endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitigation of pain is realized through sequences of treatments via audio and visual&#xD;
      stimulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Endocare® treatment's main functionality, which addressed the intended purpose, is&#xD;
      conducting sequences for treatment to mitigate the pain sensed by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The software will allow mitigating the sensed pain through 3D Virtual Reality via sequences&#xD;
      of environments. The software will emit through sequences of 3D environments, auditory and&#xD;
      visual stimulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical device is a CE marked Class I device. Women suffering from endometriosis present&#xD;
      recurrent pelvic pain impairing their quality of life. The endometriosis-related pain has&#xD;
      pejorative repercussions on sexual, family and professional life. Currently, the physician&#xD;
      armamentarium is limited to analgesics and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs to treat&#xD;
      endometriosis-related pain. Endocare® treatment intends to relieve pain thanks to its action&#xD;
      on central nervous system. This study will describe the evolution of pain in patients&#xD;
      experiencing endometriosis-related pain after a single treatment of Endocare® or a digital&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a digital control as a comparator is the only way to show a specific effect of the&#xD;
      Endocare® treatment. Therefore, a digital control displaying visual and auditive sequences&#xD;
      with no expected effect will be used for the study. This digital control, for which only a&#xD;
      placebo effect may occur, will be displayed on a tablet instead of VR (Colloca et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analysis will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis. The statistical analysis&#xD;
      will be performed using the SAS 9.4 (or higher) software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be described by the number of observations, mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, minimum, maximum and median. Categorical variables will be described by the number&#xD;
      and percentage of each modality. Percentages will be calculated on the number of observed&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
