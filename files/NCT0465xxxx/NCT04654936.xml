  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of a 12 week online dietary&#xD;
      promoting MIND diet behaviour. This study also tests the effectiveness of the MIND diet on&#xD;
      cognitive function, mood, quality of life and participants capability, opportunity and&#xD;
      motivation towards adoption of the MIND diet.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized controlled prospective follow up study, condition (control Vs&#xD;
      intervention) x time(baseline Vs follow up) ANOVA with repeated measures design. Outcome&#xD;
      measures for COM-B, cognitive function, mood and quality of life were recorded for both the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups. With power set at .80, and alpha = .05, G*Power indicated&#xD;
      that a sample size of 36 would be required. Forty-one participants took part in the study.&#xD;
      Participants were healthy male, and female aged between 40-55 years old living in Northern&#xD;
      Ireland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 intervention arms and one control group. The intervention was designed using the&#xD;
      Behaviour Change Wheel, with prior qualitative research informing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS) with significance set at P &lt; 0.05 throughout&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and Negative Affect Scale bref was used to measure mood 4 times a day over 4 days at baseline and follow-up. The maximum score for positive affect is 50 with higher scores representing higher levels of positive affect. Negative affect scores are a maximum of 50 with lower scores representing lower levels of negative affect.</description>
