  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label uncontrolled single-center study for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      Performance characteristics (efficacy and safety) of the dermal filler &quot;MMG-23-04-2019&quot; on&#xD;
      the female genital area for the medicinal, functional and reconstructive indications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Dermal Filler is recommended for the female intimate areas, especially the internal area&#xD;
      of the vagina (vaginal vestibule, introitus, vaginal walls, clitoris, &quot;G&quot; spot) for the&#xD;
      following indications: vaginal dryness or discomfort, vaginal atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main functional ingredient is cross-linked hyaluronic acid of non-animal origin, produced&#xD;
      through bacterial fermentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MMG-23-04-2019 is contained in pre-filled, graduated and disposable sterile syringe with&#xD;
      Luer Lock adapter with 1 ml of net content and 20 mg/ml hyaluronic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MMG-23-04-2019 has been classified as a Class III medical device under Annex IX of&#xD;
      Directive MDD 93/42 EEC since it is a long-term, invasive and absorbable medical device.&#xD;

    <measure>The change in the Gloria Bachmann Vaginal Health Index (VHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Day 30 (4 weeks) and Day 60 (up to 8 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The VHI is a score formed by 5 parameters (vaginal elasticity, vaginal secretions, pH, epithelial mucous membrane, vaginal hydration). The final score defines the degree of atrophy in the genitourinary tract by assigning a single score to each parameter. The maximum possible score is 25, while the minimum possible score is 5.</description>

    <description>The absolute change in VAS, ranged between 0 (no pain) and 10 (worst possible pain), judged by the Principal Investigator.</description>

    <description>The PGI-I is a transition single question scale, asking the patient to rate their urinary tract condition now, as compared with how it was prior to before beginning treatment on a scale from 1 (Very much better) to 7 (Very much worse)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change if the Nugent Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Day 60 (up to 8 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The Nugent Score is a Gram stain scoring system for vaginal swabs to diagnose bacterial vaginosis, relying on scoring of individual types of organisms; a score of 0 to 10 is derived from a weighted combination of the following: large Gram-positive rods (lactobacilli; decrease in Lactobacillus scored as 0 to 4), small Gram-negative or Gram-variable rods (G. vaginalis or other anaerobes; scored as 0 to 4), and curved Gram-negative or Gram-variable rods (Mobiluncus spp.; scored as 0 to 2).</description>
