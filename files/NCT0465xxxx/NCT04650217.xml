    <textblock>
      In this new research study, 80 adults aged &gt; 60 years with a significant depressive disorder&#xD;
      and slowed processing and/or gait speed will be randomized to receive levodopa (L-DOPA; which&#xD;
      the Candidate has previously shown to increase psychomotor speed and decrease depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in older adults), aerobic exercise (itself an effective antidepressant treatment as&#xD;
      monotherapy), or their combination in a 2x2 design incorporating placebo and a&#xD;
      stretching/toning control. Participants will be evaluated before and after this 12-week&#xD;
      duration study across cognitive domains, psychiatric symptoms, gait kinematics and mobility,&#xD;
      and task-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) focused on effort-based decision making and&#xD;
      reward processing. Data from this study will contribute toward the development of improved&#xD;
      treatment and prevention strategies to maximize the functioning and active healthspan of&#xD;
      older adults with neuropsychiatric disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Late-Life Depression [LLD]), is prevalent, disabling, and associated with high rates of&#xD;
      completed suicide. Among the LLD patients at the highest risk of these adverse outcomes are&#xD;
      those who manifest decreased processing speed and/or decreased gait speed. To develop&#xD;
      urgently needed novel therapeutics for LLD, a reasonable approach is to target systems&#xD;
      underlying the development and persistence of psychomotor slowing. One such approach has been&#xD;
      to augment dopaminergic signaling since post-mortem experiments and in vivo neuroimaging&#xD;
      studies have implicated age-related dopaminergic decline in the development of slowing.&#xD;
      L-DOPA is the immediate precursor of dopamine, is converted to dopamine in presynaptic&#xD;
      dopaminergic nerve terminals, and enhances dopaminergic transmission in multiple brain&#xD;
      regions. As opposed to other dopaminergic interventions (i.e., dopamine receptor agonists and&#xD;
      stimulants), a large literature shows beneficial effects of L-DOPA on cognitive performance&#xD;
      and gait in patients with Parkinson's disease, all while being a safe and well-tolerated&#xD;
      medication that is difficult to differentiate from placebo in terms of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second therapeutic strategy that has been tested for LLD and is relevant to psychomotor&#xD;
      slowing is aerobic exercise training. A number of reports and meta-analytic reviews suggest&#xD;
      that exercise is an effective non-pharmacologic treatment for depression, including&#xD;
      depression in older adults. The largest recent study found that progressive aerobic exercise&#xD;
      conducted three times weekly for 30min over 24 weeks was effective for depression and was&#xD;
      tolerated extremely well (14.3% drop-out rate, 70% intervention adherence). Exercise training&#xD;
      may be effective for LLD by counteracting deleterious age-related changes related to its&#xD;
      development and maintenance, such as by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, normalizing&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity, and decreasing physical disability and&#xD;
      social isolation. Exercise also appears to facilitate adaptive neuroplastic changes in the&#xD;
      hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as well as&#xD;
      increased white matter connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While both dopaminergic augmentation and exercise are promising interventions, neither&#xD;
      treatment alone may be sufficient to address the serious adverse medical and psychiatric&#xD;
      outcomes associated with LLD and psychomotor slowing. In our preliminary study (NYSPI IRB#&#xD;
      7270), L-DOPA was associated with significant improvements in gait speed, but the effect size&#xD;
      of this improvement was only moderate (d=0.4). L-DOPA failed to increase average gait speed&#xD;
      in this study above the 1m/s threshold associated with functional disability and increased&#xD;
      mortality risk in epidemiologic samples. While exercise has not been studied specifically in&#xD;
      this patient population, meta-analyses of exercise interventions in older adults suggest&#xD;
      overall effects on gait speed are modest (d=0.3) and perhaps not clinically significant.&#xD;
      Thus, one goal of this study is to combine these interventions having complementary&#xD;
      mechanisms of action to realize a greater therapeutic benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes task-based functional MRI that will allow us to probe the differential&#xD;
      therapeutic mechanisms of L-DOPA and exercise and further elucidate the nature of&#xD;
      effort-based decision making and reward deficits in LLD. Decision making about voluntary&#xD;
      behavior requires weighing the benefit of potential rewards against the effort cost required&#xD;
      to achieve them. This calculation is performed by separable populations of dopaminergic&#xD;
      midbrain neurons whose signals for value and effort are integrated with the ventral striatum&#xD;
      (VS). Anterior VS (AVS) consistently has been shown to encode subjective value, increasing&#xD;
      with the probability of reward and decreasing with effort discounting, while recent work&#xD;
      suggests dorsomedial VS (dmVS) activates during the initiation of effortful action. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that older adults are biased toward inactivity (and thereby at risk for&#xD;
      depression) on the basis of dopaminergic decline that diminishes subjective value estimates&#xD;
      and increases the effort cost of action (i.e., by the development of slowing). Among PD&#xD;
      patients, L-DOPA increases willingness to work independently of facilitating movement by&#xD;
      increasing subjective value estimates. By increasing fitness and helping individuals learn&#xD;
      about their increasing capacities, exercise may facilitate effort initiation. Below, we&#xD;
      evaluate whether complementary effects on effortful behavior may be achievable via L-DOPA&#xD;
      increasing subjective value and Exercise reducing effort cost.&#xD;
