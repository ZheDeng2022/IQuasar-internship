  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of nabiximols as&#xD;
      adjunctive therapy compared with placebo on a clinical measure of velocity-dependent muscle&#xD;
      tone in the lower limbs (Modified Ashworth Scale Lower Limb Muscle Tone-6 [MAS LLMT-6]) in&#xD;
      participants with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have not achieved adequate relief from&#xD;
      spasticity with other antispasticity medications.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each period of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-treatment,&#xD;
      2-period, crossover trial includes a 7-day Baseline period, a 3-week treatment period&#xD;
      (comprising a 2-week titration phase and a 1-week maintenance phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will enter the 7-day baseline period of each treatment period. During&#xD;
      baseline, participants will maintain their optimized oral MS antispasticity medication&#xD;
      regimen and record their 11-point NRS spasticity score and spasm count using an electronic&#xD;
      daily diary. On Day 1, eligible participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment&#xD;
      sequences, each composed of 2 treatment periods, with administration of multiple doses of&#xD;
      nabiximols or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be advised to titrate the investigational medicinal product (IMP),&#xD;
      beginning with 1 spray/day, to an optimized dose or to a maximum of 12 sprays/day over the&#xD;
      first 14 days of treatment. Participants should continue at the same dose level achieved at&#xD;
      the end of the titration phase ±1 spray divided into a morning dose and an evening dose for&#xD;
      the remainder of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower limb muscle tone, health-related quality of life, safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics will be evaluated during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who complete the trial will participate for a maximum of 90 days, which consists&#xD;
      of a maximum 29-day screening period and a maximum 61-day treatment period (s), including&#xD;
      washout between periods, and safety follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Nabiximols is a complex botanical medicine formulated from extracts of the cannabis plant that contains the principal cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) and also contains minor constituents, including other cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid plant components, such as terpenes, sterols, and triglycerides. Each spray delivers 100 microliters (μL) of nabiximols. Nabiximols will be self-administered by participants as an oromucosal spray in the morning and evening, up to a maximum of 12 sprays per day for 12 weeks.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Has had a diagnosis with any disease subtype of multiple sclerosis (MS), by revised&#xD;
             2017 McDonald criteria, for at least 12 months prior to Visit 1 and is expected to&#xD;
             remain stable for the duration of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) untransformed score of at least 2 in 2 or more of&#xD;
             6 muscle groups (right knee flexors, left knee flexors, right knee extensors, left&#xD;
             knee extensors, right plantar flexors, or left plantar flexors) at Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving optimized treatment with at least 1 oral antispasticity drug&#xD;

             prior to Visit 1. Despite optimization, the participant does not have adequate relief&#xD;
             of spasticity symptoms, including muscle spasms. Optimization of antispasticity&#xD;
             medications is defined as having reached the most efficacious and best tolerated dose&#xD;
             according to the relevant local prescribing information. The participant must be&#xD;
             willing to maintain the same antispasticity medication and not plan to initiate a new&#xD;
             course of physiotherapy for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If currently receiving an approved MS disease-modifying therapy, it must be at a&#xD;
             stable dose for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 and be expected to remain stable&#xD;
             for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If currently receiving dalfampridine or fampridine, it must be at a stable dose for at&#xD;
             least 3 months prior to Visit 1 and is expected to remain stable for the duration of&#xD;
             the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Randomization (Visit 2): Completed at least 5 of 7 days of their electronic diary&#xD;
             reporting during the 7 days immediately preceding Visit 2 (Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has taken nabiximols, cannabis, or a cannabis-derived product for medicinal or&#xD;
             recreational purposes in the 30 days prior to Visit 1 and unable to abstain for the&#xD;
             duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Did not tolerate or did not respond adequately to treatment with nabiximols or another&#xD;
             cannabis-based medication if exposed at any time before the 30-day period prior to&#xD;
             Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any concomitant disease or disorder that has spasticity-like symptoms or that may&#xD;
             influence the participant's level of spasticity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical history suggests that relapse/remission is likely to occur during the trial,&#xD;
             which, in the opinion of the investigator, is expected to influence the participant's&#xD;
             spasticity&#xD;
&#xD;

             sexual abstinence) during the trial and for 3 months thereafter. Participants using&#xD;
             combined hormonal methods or a progestogen-only pill or injection or implant should&#xD;
             use an additional barrier method such as a male condom or diaphragm during the trial&#xD;
             and for 3 months thereafter.&#xD;

             investigator, may interfere with trial participation, data interpretation, or conduct&#xD;
             of trial procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of severe psychiatric disorder that may be exacerbated by the use of a&#xD;
             cannabinoid-containing product.&#xD;
&#xD;
