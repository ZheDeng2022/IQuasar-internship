  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test an online support group designed to help young&#xD;
      adults who have had cancer treatment to manage their mood during a pandemic. Investigators&#xD;
      hope to learn more about what effects a support group may have upon the health and well-being&#xD;
      of young adults who have undergone cancer treatment by offering an online support group that&#xD;
      teaches healthy coping skills in a practical and acceptable way. Investigators would also&#xD;
      like to know if certain parts of the online material is more effective in helping subjects&#xD;
      manage their mood.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Efficacy in Pandemic Conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The improvement of self-efficacy for young adult cancer survivors navigating pandemic conditions will be assessed by comparing the change in the Cancer Behaviour Inventory-Brief (CBI-B) version (a 12-item validated questionnaire used widely as a measure of self-efficacy for coping with cancer) from baseline to Visit 8. To test the change over the 8 weeks, a paired t-test (using the baseline and Visit 8 scores within the same patient) will be used; the expected difference in the CBI-B between the two scores would be no change. Score range is 1 (not at all confident) to 9 (totally confident) (minimum score of 12, maximum score of 108). Sum the scores for the 12 items with higher scores indicating greater coping efficacy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Depression and Anxiety Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Three instruments will provide information on baseline, Visit 8, and change over time.&#xD;
1) The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) - 5-item mental health screener of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the coronavirus. Scoring is on a 5-point scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (nearly every day). Scores greater than or equal to 9 indicates probable dysfunctional coronavirus-related anxiety. 2) Mini-Mental Adjustments to Cancer - 29-items that measures present experiences using a 4-point Likert scale - ''Definitely does not apply to me'' (1) to ''Definitely apply to me'' (4). Five subscales include: Helpless-Hopeless, Anxious Preoccupation, Cognitive Avoidance, Fighting Spirit and Fatalism), AND 3) Purpose in Life Test - 20-items that measures sense of purpose and meaning in life will be utilized to estimate anxiety levels. Score range 20-100. Scores less than 50 may indicate a lack of meaning or purpose in life. A paired t-test will be used to assess the change in the scores.</description>
