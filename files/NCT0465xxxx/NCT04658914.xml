  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the widespread introduction of vaccines against Rotavirus, Rotavirus continues to be&#xD;
      a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in the developing world. This study will&#xD;
      assess protection against rotavirus infection and investigate immune correlates of protection&#xD;
      following vaccination with a novel trivalent VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine used alone or in&#xD;
      combination with oral rotavirus vaccine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label clinical trial of Rotarix and trivalent VP8 subunit vaccine&#xD;
      given alone or in combined schedules to 720 infants in Zambia at 6, 10 and 14 weeks followed&#xD;
      by challenge at 18 weeks used to assess mucosal immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified through antenatal and child health monitoring&#xD;
      clinics in selected facilities in Lusaka Zambia. Interested parents will be invited to the&#xD;
      clinical research site for informed consent procedures and assessment of eligibility.&#xD;
      Children meeting the eligibility criteria with written informed consent for participation&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of the four available study arms using simple randomization in&#xD;
      block sizes of 8. Blood, stool, and saliva samples will be collected prior to completing&#xD;
      vaccination according to randomization arm. All parents/guardians will be provided with post&#xD;
      immunisation diary cards to document any reactions following vaccination. Trained study staff&#xD;
      will contact parents and guardians of enrolled participants weekly to enquire on the child's&#xD;
      health and assist with documentation of solicited reactions following vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled children will be followed up for at least five months following enrollment. Follow&#xD;
      up vaccinations will be provided each month until all children have completed all assigned&#xD;
      study vaccinations. Upon completion of study vaccination, participants will be challenged&#xD;
      with oral rotavirus vaccine, Rotarix TM to assess mucosal immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study will be to detect a reduction in the proportion of&#xD;
      children shedding vaccine rotavirus in stool at any timepoint 5-9 days after challenge, among&#xD;
      children immunized with P2-VP8 subunit vaccine alone or in combination with Rotarix, compared&#xD;
      with infants receiving Rotarix alone. The primary outcomes will be prevalence of rotavirus&#xD;
      (Rotarix) shedding at any timepoint in samples collected 5,7 and 9 days after challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i.) Seroconversion following vaccination: Detection of an increase in seroconversion in&#xD;
      either of the combined vaccination arms compared with Rotarix alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii.) Immune boosting. We will compare the number of gut-homing (alpha 4 beta 7+)&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) rotavirus VP8-specific Antibody secreting&#xD;
      cells (ASCs) 7 days after the third clinic visit in 50 infants from each study arm (i.e.&#xD;
      after the first VP8 vaccine booster dose, after the third VP8 vaccine dose (alone or in&#xD;
      combination with Rotarix), or after no vaccine (control) in the Rotarix only arm).&#xD;

We estimate that approximately 50% (range 30-70%) of children previously vaccinated with 2 doses of Rotarix will shed Rotarix detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) at any timepoint 5-9 days after challenge</description>

Seroconversion based on anti-VP8 antibodies has not been studied after Rotarix administration but may be similar.</description>
