  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single (part 1) and multiple ascending (part 2) oral doses&#xD;
      of GLPG4399, in adult, healthy, male subjects. In addition, the effect of food and the&#xD;
      relative bioavailability (rBA) of GLPG4399, will be evaluated (part 3 and 4).&#xD;
