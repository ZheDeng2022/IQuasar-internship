    <textblock>
      An open-label study to clinically assess a novel wearable advanced compression technology&#xD;
      (Dayspring™) undertaken to determine if potential barriers to lymphedema self-care were&#xD;
      effectively addressed. The Dayspring™ device is a novel FDA-cleared wearable solution that is&#xD;
      portable and easy-to-use sequential compression system. The following endpoints are examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improvement in QoL in subject with upper-extremity edema after 28 days as measured by&#xD;
           the LYMQOL disease-specific validated assessment tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arm volume maintenance or improvement as measured prior to and after 28 days of device&#xD;
           use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Safety as assessed by reported adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient satisfaction as measured by visual analog scale (VAS) and survey at the end of&#xD;
           the study; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Adherence to therapy as measured with a smart phone app.&#xD;

    <measure>LYMQOL (LYMphedema Quality of Life)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Lymphedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (LYMQOL), a validated disease-specific QoL tool, was also administered at baseline and at day 28. Overall QoL is scored on a single item by the patient on a scale of 1-10.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Arm Volume Maintenance or Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Limb volume measurement was performed by using a calibrated tape measure to measure circumference from the wrist and the ulnar styloid process and at 4cm increments to the axilla. Measurements were taken for both upper extremities. If both extremities exhibited edema, a study arm was designated for treatment. Measurements were taken by the same investigator throughout the study. Volume was calculated based on cylindrical segment analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient survey</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analog scale (VAS) and study survey were administered at the end of the study to measure patient satisfaction (day 28). The six-item questionnaire was used to document the time of day the device was used, if daily activities were supported during use, function, and symptoms. All were measured on a scale from 1-5. The VAS was administered to previous users of pneumatic compression devices to assess preference and likelihood to recommend to others with lymphedema.</description>
