  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One's appetite has a role in controlling food intake and maintaining energy balance, but its&#xD;
      effect on body metabolism related to obesity is still questionable. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      was to determine the levels of neuropeptide Y in healthy people and to see differences in&#xD;
      gender and anthropometric parameters. The hypothesis of this study was that there would be&#xD;
      differences in neuropeptide Y levels in groups with gender and anthropometric parameter&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;

      One's appetite has a role in controlling food intake and maintaining energy balance, but its&#xD;
      effect on body metabolism related to obesity is still questionable. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      was to determine the levels of neuropeptide Y in healthy people and to see differences in&#xD;
      gender and anthropometric parameters. The hypothesis of this study was that there would be&#xD;
      differences in neuropeptide Y levels in groups with gender and anthropometric parameter&#xD;
      differences. This study was a cross-sectional study involving 62 study subjects, male and&#xD;
      female, who did not have chronic diseases or metabolic disorders. This research was conducted&#xD;
      from April to September 2020. The parameters examined in this study were neuropeptide Y&#xD;
      levels and anthropometric parameters. The statistical analysis performed was the Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      test to see the differences between groups. The mean age of the research subjects was 40.48 Â±&#xD;
      10.85 years, with the same ethnic distribution. The distribution of men and women was more&#xD;
      women than men. Based on anthropometric examination, it was found that obesity nutritional&#xD;
      status was more common in the female group than in the male group; however, serum&#xD;
      neuropeptide Y levels were found to be significantly different between male and female groups&#xD;
      (male group was higher).&#xD;

    <description>This examination was conducted by drawing blood serum from research subjects and performing centrifugation with 2000-3000 revolutions per minute (RPM) for 20 minutes. Furthermore, we carried out blood serum tests to check neuropeptide Y levels using the Human Neuropeptide Y Enzyme-link Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit</description>
