  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The larynx is a cartilaginous organ of the respiratory system located in the throat, which&#xD;
      plays an essential role in respiratory function, swallowing and sound production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of advanced tumours, the surgical option most often remains total laryngectomy,&#xD;
      with the corollary of a major impact on quality of life, not so much because of the loss of&#xD;
      voice, but because of the presence of a definitive tracheostoma with particularly deleterious&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of the work of the different teams around the world has focused on restoring&#xD;
      phonatory function, but no technique - apart from the artificial larynx developed in the ENT&#xD;
      department of the Hautepierre Hospital - has yet succeeded in removing the tracheotomy&#xD;
      orifice, requiring the restoration of a common passage between the respiratory and swallowing&#xD;
      passages. If nutrition and phonatory function can still be supplemented after such an&#xD;
      operation (oesophageal rehabilitation, implant placed between the trachea and oesophagus),&#xD;
      natural breathing is no longer possible. Patients are forced to wear a permanent tracheotomy&#xD;
      opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently only 2 ways to try to restore all the functions of the larynx after total&#xD;
      laryngectomy: i) laryngeal transplantation, but this procedure requires maintaining&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment, which is not possible in patients suffering from cancer of the&#xD;
      larynx, which is not a vital organ, ii) artificial larynx made of biomaterials (titanium),&#xD;
      the first cases of which were performed worldwide in the ENT department of the Strasbourg&#xD;
      University Hospital in 2012, results published in the NEJM (API 2008-2009 HUS No. 4493- IDRCB&#xD;
      No.: 2011-A00032-39. However, difficulties were encountered with the use of the titanium&#xD;
      prosthesis due to the bulk and rigidity of the removable and non-removable part, which caused&#xD;
      residual swallowing difficulties (false routes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now possible, due to the development of new allograft techniques in humans for tracheal&#xD;
      replacement (studies published on a large number of cases with several years of hindsight,&#xD;
      cf. references), to switch to the &quot;all biological&quot; using an aortic graft stented with a&#xD;
      silicone stent. We wish to use these grafts in laryngeal restoration after total laryngectomy&#xD;
      by our team, while exploiting all the data and experience acquired (unique in the world)&#xD;
      within the ENT department of Hautepierre Hospital. This new conceptual leap should make it&#xD;
      possible to significantly improve the patient's quality of life and the performance&#xD;
      previously acquired in clinical trials on the artificial larynx in its entirety (breathing,&#xD;
      phonation) or partially (swallowing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators thus propose to evaluate this new artificial larynx in aortic allograft,&#xD;
      the objective of which is to supplement the respiratory, swallowing and phonation functions&#xD;
      in patients laryngectomized for carcinological causes.&#xD;
