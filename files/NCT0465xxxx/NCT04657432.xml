  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to be safe,&#xD;
      feasible, and acceptable. Conventionally, rTMS investigations have relied on rational&#xD;
      decision trees for dosage determination. The purpose of this study is to systematically&#xD;
      examine an accelerated protocol of intermittent theta burst (iTBS). Study 1 aims to provide a&#xD;
      quantifiable dose-response curve for iTBS and depressive symptom reduction in major&#xD;
      depression. Study 2 aims to determine the role of individual variations of their functional&#xD;
      networks compared to the site of stimulation and clinical outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Study 1: Participants will be randomized to 10 different doses of accelerated intermittent theta burst rTMS for remediation of depression symptoms. The goal is to determine the optimal dose in terms of efficacy while minimizing burden and side effects.&#xD;
Study 2: Participants will be assigned to 10 active sessions (per treatment day) of accelerated rTMS for 5 treatment days. All doses are active and within established therapeutic levels of rTMS. The goal is to determine the role of individual variations of their functional networks compared to the site of stimulation.</intervention_model_description>
