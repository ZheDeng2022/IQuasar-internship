  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate which is more effective resistance or aerobic&#xD;
      exercises on cancer related fatigue and immunity in breast cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The problem of cancer related fatigue and decreased immunity, as a result of treatment with&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients is not well known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue and decreased immunity have a negative impact on work, social relationships, mood,&#xD;
      and daily activities and cause significant impairment in overall quality of life, Furthermore&#xD;
      the need of this study is developed from the lack of information in the published studies&#xD;
      about the effect of the treatment with chemotherapy among breast cancer patients on inducing&#xD;
      fatigue and decreasing immunity and the effect of resistance and aerobic exercises on&#xD;
      improving these changes.&#xD;

    <description>The Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) is quick and easy to complete for patients, and not time consuming. It is also helpful for physicians and other health care workers in the follow-up of their patients. The FAS has proven to be a valid questionnaire to assess fatigue in cancer patients, but also in many other patients with chronic diseases</description>

    <description>Resistance exercises will be involved in this technique are for upper and lower limb (Exercise program including shoulder flexion, abduction and horizontal adduction, elbow extension and flexion, calf raise, leg extension and squatting) three times daily and five times per week. The 1 repetition maximum (1RM) is measured at baseline and following the intervention. Initially, participants will do two circuits using 50% of their 1RM and repeat them 10 times for the first and second weeks, progressing to two circuits, using 60% of their 1RM and repeat 10 times for the third and fourth weeks. In fifth and sixth weeks, participants will do three circuits using 60% of their 1RM and repeat 10 times. In the last 6 weeks, patients will do three circuits using 70% of their 1RM and repeat 10 times. Time of exercise equal time of rest</description>

    <description>Aerobic training (AT) program of submaximal intensity will include a 45-minute session five times per week under the supervision of the researcher. Aerobic exercise will consist of three phases: warm-up, training and cool down. At the beginning of exercise session, subjects will have a ten-minute warm-up. The warm up protocol will be slowly running on treadmill. Then, the warm-up phase will be followed by the training phase. At baseline, the training phase will be commenced with two 30- minute running on treadmill at 50% of their maximal heart rate (MHR) in the first week and increased to 70% MHR by the final week of training. By the end of exercise session, subjects will have a five-minute cool down. The cool down protocol will be slowly running on treadmill. The vital measures such as HR and blood pressure was monitored before patient left the department (Dimeo et al.,2016), maximum heart rate will be calculated using the formula: (HR Max =220- age)</description>

    <intervention_name>Treadmill</intervention_name>
    <description>Treadmill is not used to harness power, but as exercise machines for running or walking in one place. Rather than the user powering the mill, the machine provides a moving platform with a wide conveyor belt driven by an electric motor or a flywheel. The belt moves to the rear, requiring the user to walk or run at a speed matching that of the belt. The rate at which the belt moves is the rate of walking or running. Thus, the speed of running may be controlled and measured</description>
