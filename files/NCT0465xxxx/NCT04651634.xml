  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study in patients with previously untreated locally advanced head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three&#xD;
      different doses of MIT-001 compared to the placebo in prevention of oral mucositis (OM) in&#xD;
      patients with HNSCC who are undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis associated with cancer therapy carries a significant morbidity. OM is a common&#xD;
      complication in patients receiving CCRT used for treating HNSCC. Mucositis lesions can be&#xD;
      painful, affect nutrition and quality of life (QoL), and have a significant economic impact.&#xD;
      However, a definitive intervention regime has not been established. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      essential to develop appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MitoImmune Therapeutics Inc. (hereafter referred to as Sponsor) has developed MIT-001 which&#xD;
      can scavenge abnormal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), enabling the cells to retain&#xD;
      mitochondrial membrane permeability and mitochondrial function. This eventually inhibits&#xD;
      additional ROS production, indicating that MIT-001 can prevent excessive inflammation caused&#xD;
      by ROS. In addition, MIT-001 may possibly 1) block inflammatory cytokine production via&#xD;
      inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF kB) or inflammasome dependent pathways, 2) inhibit&#xD;
      necrosis/necroptosis via blocking high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) mediated cytokine&#xD;
      production, and 3) balance regulation between T helper type 1/17 (Th1/17) and regulatory T&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the pathophysiological progression of CCRT-associated OM, initiated by direct injury&#xD;
      to basal epithelial cells which experience deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and increased&#xD;
      ROS levels, Sponsor expects the prevention of OM in patients receiving CCRT of locally&#xD;
      advanced HNSCC with MIT 001 by effectively scavenging increased ROS induced by CCRT.&#xD;

Placebo group will receive placebo, manufactured with the same properties and appearance as MIT 001, at same treatment frequency as MIT-001 with CCRT.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This study design will minimize bias and provide reference data (i.e., data from placebo treated subjects) which will aid in the interpretation of results. To limit the occurrence of conscious and unconscious bias in the conduct and interpretation of safety and efficacy results, the study is double blind where the subject, the Investigators/site staff, and the Sponsor staff remain unaware of the treatment assignment. The planned safety assessments that will be performed during the study are considered acceptable measures for ensuring the safety of subjects during a clinical study.</masking_description>
