      This evidence raises the need to determine the assistance quality care in asthma population&#xD;
      in the influential area of Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria through the&#xD;
      assistance quality care indicators established by GEMA guidelines. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to obtain clinical data that allow to assess assistance quality degree in order to find&#xD;
      improvement opportunities to achieve a better control of asthmatic patients within this&#xD;
      influential area.&#xD;

      Asthma is a heterogenic chronic disease characterized by acute symptomatic episodes of&#xD;
      varying severity, including intermittently inflammation and narrowing of the airways in the&#xD;
      lungs. The prevalence of this disease is high as affects more than 300 million people&#xD;
      worldwide, which varies by country. In Spain, the prevalence it is estimated to be around 5%,&#xD;
      ranged between 1% in Huelva and 4,7% in Albacete, according with the European Community&#xD;
      Respiratory Survey (ECRHS), and seems to be increased due to a higher rate of asthma&#xD;
      diagnosis1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's important to note that in this condition there is a substantial proportion of patients&#xD;
      with inadequate control of their disease, which conducts to a higher morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality2. The poor disease control is associated to an important negative impact in&#xD;
      patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL), causing them daily activity impairment,&#xD;
      loss of work productivity and the need of using unscheduled doctor visits and hospital&#xD;
      services3, 4. The direct and indirect costs in patients with a poor disease control&#xD;
      represents an important proportion of the total cost of asthma, which it's estimated to be&#xD;
      around 1-2% of the total public healthcare resources in developed countries, especially in&#xD;
      patients with severe-persistent asthma4, 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The facts previously exposed turns this disease into a major public health problem due to its&#xD;
      high prevalence within all age and sex groups and the high proportion of uncontrolled&#xD;
      patients, which causes a high health burden to the National Health System, and which affects&#xD;
      directly on the affected patients, as well as their families and the society6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, during the past decades multiple clinical practice guidelines have been&#xD;
      designed to improve the quality of care in patients with asthma and to reduce the high public&#xD;
      burden associated to this disease7. International guidelines such as the Global Initiative&#xD;
      for Asthma (GINA) and national guidelines as Guía Española para el Manejo del Asma (GEMA) in&#xD;
      Spain, both of them stating that a good disease control can be achieved by most of asthma&#xD;
      patients, were launched to increase the technical training of health professionals in order&#xD;
      to reach a better disease management and conduct to a better quality of life in these&#xD;
      patients 8, 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, GEMA guidelines also includes a tool to assess the level of assistance quality&#xD;
      care through 8 indicators covering 4 dimensions: diagnose, non-pharmacological treatment,&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment, monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, since guidelines have been launched, there's still evidence of high proportion of&#xD;
      patients with poorly disease control and large impact in patient's health-related quality of&#xD;
      life10. Despite the availability of therapeutic recommendations through guidelines, clinical&#xD;
      studies have shown that there's poor adherence to guidelines goals3. The Asthma Insight and&#xD;
      Reality surveys, which were performed in several regions worldwide, concluded that all&#xD;
      participating countries didn't met GINA goals. Specifically, in Central and Eastern Europe,&#xD;
      the results showed a high proportion of asthma population who described physical activity&#xD;
      limitations (68,2%) and acute symptoms during the previous 4 weeks (74%). Regarding disease&#xD;
      monitoring, it' important to note that the results demonstrated that a 36,2% of asthmatic&#xD;
      patients had never performed a lung function test11. A recent study conducted in Spain and&#xD;
      Italy also evidenced a generally poor disease control, with around 50% of participant&#xD;
      patients being considered uncontrolled12, and that strategies were needed to improve the&#xD;
      management of this disease as it was concluded in a study performed in Spain to assess the&#xD;
      disease control according to GINA criteria13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of costs, it's estimated that around 70% of the total cost of the disease is&#xD;
      determined by this poor control and management14. An adequately disease management based in a&#xD;
      higher use of preventive anti-inflammatory medication, a better education in asthma patients&#xD;
      and an accurately follow of the recommendations of guidelines would result in a greater&#xD;
      disease control and in a reduction of associated costs15, 16, 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evidence raises the need to determine the assistance quality care in asthma population&#xD;
      in the influential area of Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria through the&#xD;
      assistance quality care indicators established by GEMA guidelines. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to obtain clinical data that allow to assess assistance quality degree in order to find&#xD;
      improvement opportunities to achieve a better control of asthmatic patients within this&#xD;
      influential area.&#xD;

        The study will be performed in Hospital Virgen de la Victoria, which it's the reference&#xD;
        hospital that usually attends the asthma population of its influential area. Only patients&#xD;
        that meet the eligibility criteria will be included in the study, and it is planned that a&#xD;
        total estimation of 300 patients with asthma diagnose will be included in it. The whole&#xD;
        patients will be recruited by the site investigator and collaborators, who will conduct the&#xD;
        subject's medical chart review. Before the patient's study inclusion, the investigator team&#xD;
        must have been obtained the signed informed consent (appendix 3) of each patient recruited&#xD;
        and according to ICH GCP and to local legal requirements.&#xD;
