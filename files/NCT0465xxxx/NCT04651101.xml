      patients in shiraz, Iran. Patients were undergone selective coronary angiography from radial&#xD;

      This cross-sectional study was conducted in Shiraz. Clinical data were collected from the&#xD;
      patients of Professor Kojuri cardiovascular clinic in Shiraz, Iran ( Iran, Fars Province,&#xD;
      Shiraz, Niayesh Boulevard, Email: kojurij@yahoo.com, webpage: http://kojuriclinic.com/ )who&#xD;
      came to clinic from March 2018 to March 2020. Inclusion criteria was all of the new patients&#xD;
      who referred to Professor Kojuri cardiovascular clinic. Exclusion criteria were patients with&#xD;
      more than 100ng/ml 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 serum level, parathyroid disorders,&#xD;
      end-stage-renal-disease (ESRD) and paraneoplastic syndromes. Patients with more than 10mg/L&#xD;
      Hs-CRP serum level also were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete history and physical exam were taken from the patients and risk factors such as&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes mellitus, age and gender were considered. 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 was&#xD;
      checked for all patients. Blood pressure and took electrocardiography (ECG) for all patients&#xD;
      were done. The dependent variable was the prevalence of Coronary Artery disease; the&#xD;
      independent variable was vitamin D deficiency; and intervening factors were age, gender,&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes mellitus and level of Hs-CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Patients were undergone selective coronary angiography from radial artery approach by an&#xD;
      expert interventional cardiologist. Angiography videos were reviewed by a team of expert&#xD;
      cardiologists. Based on the results of coronary angiography, patients were classified as&#xD;
      non-significant CAD with stenosis less than 50% and significant CAD with stenosis more than&#xD;
      50% stenosis. In this review diabetic and hypertensive patients is considered by criteria of&#xD;
      American diabetes association 2018 &amp; American heart association 2017 . Patient's serum level&#xD;
      of 25-hydroxy vitamin D on their first visit was considered as index of vitamin D level.&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency and sufficiency are defined respectively as serum level of 25-hydroxy&#xD;
      vitamin D less than 30ng/ml and serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D more than 30 ng/ml .&#xD;
      Patients with Parathyroid disorders and paraneoplastic syndromes were excluded&#xD;
