  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (car-t) is one of the most effective therapies for&#xD;
      malignant tumors (especially hematological tumors). Like other immunotherapies, the basic&#xD;
      principle is to use the patient's own immune cells to clear cancer cells. Chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor (car) is the core component of car-t, which endows T cells with the ability to&#xD;
      recognize tumor antigens in an independent manner, which enables car modified T cells to&#xD;
      recognize a wider range of targets than natural T cell surface receptors (TCR). The basic&#xD;
      design of car includes a tumor associated antigen binding region (usually derived from scFv&#xD;
      segment of monoclonal antibody antigen binding region), transmembrane region and&#xD;
      intracellular signal region. The selection of target antigen is a key determinant for the&#xD;
      specificity and effectiveness of car and the safety of genetically modified T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCMA is a specific surface protein of B lymphocytes, which plays an important role in the&#xD;
      development, proliferation and differentiation of B cells. BCMA is highly expressed in&#xD;
      malignant mm plasma cells and provides a large number of anti apoptotic signals, which makes&#xD;
      bcam an ideal target in targeted immunotherapy. At present, a variety of immunotherapy&#xD;
      strategies targeting BCMA are being carried out in laboratory and clinical practice, which&#xD;
      have achieved encouraging therapeutic effects in multiple myeloma and effectively promoted&#xD;
      the development of targeted immunotherapy.&#xD;
