  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to explore satisfaction with vision correction and ease of use of&#xD;
      PFM (Personal Face Masks) in a group of spectacle wearers who were randomised to continue&#xD;
      wearing spectacles or be fitted with daily disposable contact lenses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a two arm parallel-group, randomised study. Subjects wearing single vision&#xD;
      spectacles were recruited to participate in the study. Subjects were randomised to either&#xD;
      continue to use their spectacles or to be fitted with the study daily disposable (DD) contact&#xD;
      lens.&#xD;

          3. They are willing and able to follow the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. They are a 'neophyte' (i.e. someone who has not worn contact lenses previously, with&#xD;
             the exception for the purposes of a trial fitting).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. They have a contact lens spherical prescription between +8.00D and -10.00D (inclusive)&#xD;
             based on the ocular refraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. They have a cylindrical correction of -0.75DC or less in each eye based on the ocular&#xD;
             refraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. They own and habitually wear single vision spectacles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. They are willing to be fitted with contact lenses and understand they may be&#xD;
             randomised to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. They are willing to wear the contact lenses (if relevant) or spectacles for at least 8&#xD;
             hours per day, 5 days per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. They are able to wear the supplied surgical masks for the majority of time that they&#xD;
             need to wear PFM and will wear the PFM for at least one hour a day for at least four&#xD;
             days per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. They can attain at least 0.20 logMAR distance high contrast visual acuity in each eye&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. They have had cataract surgery.&#xD;

             have keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. They are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. They have any ocular abnormality which would, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             normally contraindicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. They have any infectious disease which would, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             contraindicate contact lens wear or pose a risk to study personnel; or they have any&#xD;
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic&#xD;
             reaction.&#xD;

             face mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial or&#xD;
             research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.&#xD;
