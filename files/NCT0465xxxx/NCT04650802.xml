      Stroke survivors may have a latent, propulsive capacity of the paretic leg, that can be&#xD;
      elicited during short, intensive gait training interventions. The aim of this study was&#xD;
      therefor to investigate the effect of a five-week gait training on paretic propulsion,&#xD;
      propulsion symmetry, gait capacity, and daily-life mobility and physical activity in chronic&#xD;
      stroke survivors. We hypothesize that the robotic gait training will improve propulsion&#xD;
      symmetry and, thereby, gait speed and functional gait tasks. In addition, we expect that&#xD;
      improved gait capacity might lead to less impact of stroke on daily-life mobility and a&#xD;
      higher physical activity level. Thirty-three chronic stroke survivors with impaired paretic&#xD;
      propulsion (≥8% difference in paretic vs. non-paretic propulsive impulse) will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this proof-of-concept study. Participants receive five weeks individual robotic gait training&#xD;
      targeting paretic propulsion (60 minutes, two time a week). The robotic gait training is&#xD;
      complemented with daily home exercises (15 minutes/day) focusing on increasing strength and&#xD;
      practice of learned strategies in daily life. Propulsion measures, self-selected gait speed,&#xD;
      performance on functional gait tasks, and daily-life mobility and physical activity are&#xD;
      assessed five weeks (T0) and one week (T1) before the start of the intervention, and one week&#xD;
      (T2) and five weeks (T3) after the end of the intervention.&#xD;
