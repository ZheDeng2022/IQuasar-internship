  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United States. Suppression of male&#xD;
      hormone levels by using GnRH agonist (&quot;hormone blocking therapy&quot;) for a few years is&#xD;
      routinely used to treat prostate cancer. While the treatment is very effective, it decreases&#xD;
      muscle mass and increases fat mass. This results in a decrease in insulin action (also called&#xD;
      insulin resistance) and increases the likelihood of diabetes. It may also contribute to risk&#xD;
      of developing heart disease. The investigators propose to conduct a trial that will:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. study the mechanisms through which GnRH agonists cause insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate a treatment that can decrease insulin resistance. This is a randomized, placebo&#xD;
           controlled, double-blind trial. Forty-four men with prostate cancer will be recruited in&#xD;
           the trial before starting GnRH agonist therapy. Participants will undergo metabolic&#xD;
           studies to evaluate insulin action (called insulin clamp), abdominal fat tissue biopsy&#xD;
           to study insulin action at the cellular level and blood draws. The study volunteers will&#xD;
           then be given either a placebo tablet or pioglitazone tablet to take once a day for the&#xD;
           next six months. The metabolic tests, blood test and fat tissue biopsy will be obtained&#xD;
           again at the end of the study.&#xD;

      STUDY PLAN The Study will be conducted at Saint Louis University. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      conduct a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 44 men with&#xD;
      nonmetastatic prostate cancer who will receive ADT with long acting GnRH agonist. Patients&#xD;
      will be recruited from clinical practice of division of Urology. The patients that are&#xD;
      planning to undergo ADT as part of standard of care treatment for their prostate cancer will&#xD;
      be offered a choice of enrolling in the study prior to initiating ADT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will undergo EHC, subcutaneous fat biopsy and have a blood sample drawn prior&#xD;
      to starting ADT. The subjects will then be randomized to 30 mg pioglitazone or placebo tablet&#xD;
      daily for 6 months. Blood samples will be drawn 2 and 4 months following the initiation of&#xD;
      the study drug. The final study visit will be at 6 months. Subjects will undergo EHC, fat&#xD;
      biopsy and blood sampling and will be discharged from the study. Study visits will be&#xD;
      conducted at clinical research center of division of Endocrinology at Salus Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will complete the following procedures prior to participating in the study:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical History. Subjects who are on insulin or sulfonylureas for diabetes will be&#xD;
           advised that pioglitazone use may lead to low blood sugars. Subjects with congestive&#xD;
           heart failure will be advised of the possibility that their edema or shortness of breath&#xD;
           may worsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical Exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lab test: CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) if not available in medical&#xD;
           records from last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who qualify and consent to take part in the study will be assigned a number by a&#xD;
      computerized random number generation program and will be randomized (1:1) to receive either&#xD;
      pioglitazone or placebo. An unblinded pharmacist will prepare the study product. Study&#xD;
      investigators, staff and the study participants will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline study visit: This visit will happen prior to starting ADT. The participants will&#xD;
      come fasting and have blood drawn to measure CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), total&#xD;
      and free testosterone, SHBG and LH. MNC and serum will be stored for the research laboratory.&#xD;
      Subcutaneous fat biopsy will be performed. Following the biopsy, EHC will be started&#xD;
      (procedures described below). Subjects will be given an 8 week supply of pioglitazone 30 mg&#xD;
      or placebo pills containing cellulose. For patient taking gemfibrozil, the dose will be 15 mg&#xD;
      daily. Subjects will start the study drug one week after initiating the ADT. The subjects&#xD;
      will take the study drug once a day in the morning. Subjects who take insulin or&#xD;
      sulfonylureas will be asked to contact their doctor and report to the study team if&#xD;
      hypoglycemia is experienced. The study physician may change the diabetes therapy if&#xD;
      warranted. A letter will be sent to providers (who manage patient's diabetes) of all patients&#xD;
      notifying them of possible changes in patient's diabetes regimen. All subjects with heart&#xD;
      failure will be advised to report shortness of breath or worsening of edema to their doctors&#xD;
      and to the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 8 and 16 study visits: The participants will come fasting and have blood drawn for&#xD;
      research laboratory. Participants will be given supply of study drug for another 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will be seen by a study physician for physical exam. Diabetic patients using&#xD;
      insulin or sulfonylureas will discuss their blood sugars with the study physician. The study&#xD;
      physician may choose to decrease the dose or stop insulin or sulfonylureas to avoid&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. If therapy is changed, a letter will be sent to patient's diabetes provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 24 study visit (end of study): The participants will come fasting and have blood drawn&#xD;
      to measure CBC, CMP, total and free testosterone, SHBG. Blood will be drawn. MNC and serum&#xD;
      will be stored for the research laboratory. Subcutaneous fat biopsy and EHC will be&#xD;
      performed. The subjects will then be discharged from the study and follow with their&#xD;
      physicians. Diabetic patients will be told of the possibility that their blood sugars may&#xD;
      increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES Measurement of whole body glucose uptake by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp:&#xD;
      Subjects will come to the clinical research center in the morning after an overnight 10 hour&#xD;
      fast. Patients with blood sugar &gt;180 mg/dl will be re-scheduled. Diabetes medications will be&#xD;
      held on the morning of EHC. Long acting insulin (if being taken) will be held the night&#xD;
      before the clamp. Insulin clamp will be started with a priming dose of short acting human&#xD;
      insulin given over 10 minutes and then an infusion at the rate of 80mU/m2/min. 20% glucose&#xD;
      infusion will be started at 5 minutes and glucose infusion rate will be titrated to maintain&#xD;
      blood glucose concentration at 90 mg/dl. Twenty mEq of KCL will be added to one liter of 20%&#xD;
      glucose. Insulin will be infused for three hours. Blood sample will be collected to measure&#xD;
      insulin concentrations at 0, 60, 120, 150 and 180 minutes. Insulin sensitivity will be&#xD;
      calculated from the glucose infusion rates during the last 30 min of the clamp (steady state)&#xD;
      divided by the steady-state plasma insulin concentration divided by body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fat aspiration procedure: Subcutaneous fat tissue aspiration will be performed on abdomen at&#xD;
      a 10 cm distance from umbilicus. The skin will first be prepared and a sterile drape will be&#xD;
      placed around the appropriate area. Under local anesthesia, 500mg-3g of fat tissue will be&#xD;
      obtained. The adipose tissue will be centrifuged to remove blood and fluid contaminants. The&#xD;
      upper adipose tissue will be collected into a separate sterile tube, washed twice with cold&#xD;
      sterile Phosphate Buffered Saline and centrifuged to remove the saline. Total RNA, nuclear&#xD;
      extracts and total cell lysates will be prepared from the adipose tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical laboratory assays: Total and free testosterone concentrations will be measured by&#xD;
      liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and equilibrium dialysis (12). SHBG, LH, CBC,&#xD;
      CMP will be measured by standard assays. All measurements will be carried out by Quest&#xD;
      diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mononuclear cells (MNC) isolation: Blood samples will be collected in Na-EDTA and carefully&#xD;
      layered on Lympholyte medium (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, ON). Samples will be&#xD;
      centrifuged till two bands separate out at the top of the RBC pellet. The MNC band will be&#xD;
      harvested and washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution. This method provides yields&#xD;
      greater than 95% MNC preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantification of mRNA Expression by RT-PCR: Expression of inflammatory mediators involved in&#xD;
      insulin resistance and those that mediate insulin signaling will be tested by RT-PCR in mRNA&#xD;
      isolated from MNC and adipose tissue. Total RNA will be isolated from MNC and adipose tissue&#xD;
      using commercially available RNAqueous®-4PCR Kit and adipose tissue RNA Isolation kit&#xD;
      (Ambion, Austin, TX). Real Time RT-PCR will be performed using Stratagene Mx3000P QPCR System&#xD;
      (La Jolla, CA), Sybergreen master mix(Qiagen, CA) and gene specific primers for IKK-β,&#xD;
      SOCS-3, PTEN, PTP-IB, JNK-1, TLR-4, IL-1β, IR, IRS-1, AKT-2, GLUT-4 (Life Technologies, MD).&#xD;
      All values will be normalized to the expression of a group of housekeeping genes including&#xD;
      actin, ubiquitin C and cyclophilin A. The normalization factor used is calculated by GeneNorm&#xD;
      software and is based on the values of all housekeeping genes used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Western blotting: MNC and adipose tissue total cell lysates will be prepared. Electrophoresis&#xD;
      and immunoblotting will be carried as described before (13). Polyclonal antibodies against&#xD;
      IR, AKT-2, SOCS-3, IKK-β and actin will be used and all values will be corrected for loading&#xD;
      to actin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma measurements: ELISA will be used to measure plasma concentrations of insulin,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein, adiponectin, TNF-α and IL-1β. FFA concentrations will be measured by a&#xD;
      colorimetric assay. The research laboratory measurements will be conducted in the Endocrine&#xD;
      laboratory at Doisy Hall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: The focus of the proposed research is to evaluate the efficacy of pioglitazone&#xD;
      treatment on insulin sensitivity men receiving ADT. Transformations of the data in order to&#xD;
      meet statistical assumptions may be considered. The results will be computed as mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation. The primary endpoint of the study is to detect a difference in insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity as measured by whole body glucose uptake during EHC after treatment with&#xD;
      pioglitazone as compared to placebo. There are no prior studies analyzing the effect of&#xD;
      pioglitazone in men undergoing ADT. However, studies of pioglitazone in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes have shown an increase in insulin sensitivity of ~30% (14-16). Change in insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity following pioglitazone or placebo for 24 weeks will be compared among the groups&#xD;
      by unpaired t-test. Estimating a difference in insulin sensitivity of 30%, a sample size of&#xD;
      22 patients per treatment group (assuming a drop-out rate of 20%) should provide adequate&#xD;
      power (Beta = 0.8) to detect a significant difference (alpha = 0.05), provided the standard&#xD;
      deviation of the residuals is not greater than the mean difference. Thus 44 men will be&#xD;
      recruited in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary End Points: The secondary endpoints for the study will be comparison of the&#xD;
      relative change from baseline in HOMA-IR, insulin signaling and inflammatory mediators after&#xD;
      pioglitazone or placebo.&#xD;
