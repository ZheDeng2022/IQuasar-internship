    <textblock>
      Occupational balance is a concept related to health and well-being. Therefore, determining&#xD;
      the factors affecting this concept is important for health promotion interventions. There is&#xD;
      no study in the literature on the relationship between socio-demographic factors and&#xD;
      occupational balance. The results of this study are thought to provide new information to the&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Occupational balance is about the perception of having the 'right mix' of activities in life.&#xD;
      This balance is analyzed according to types of activity such as self-care, productivity and&#xD;
      leisure time, as well as different dimensions such as the physical, mental and social&#xD;
      dimensions required to engage in activities. Occupational balance is a concept related to&#xD;
      health and well-being. Therefore, determining the factors affecting this concept is important&#xD;
      for health promotion interventions. There is no study in the literature on the relationship&#xD;
      between socio-demographic factors and occupational balance. The results of this study are&#xD;
      thought to provide new information to the literature.&#xD;
