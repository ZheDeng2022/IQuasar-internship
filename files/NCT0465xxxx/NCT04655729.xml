  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to generate novel minimally-invasive serum protein signatures and&#xD;
      biomarkers in children and adolescents with Crohn's Disease (CD) that correlate with and can&#xD;
      predict and monitor patients who will have a prolonged response to Infliximab so that&#xD;
      personalized medicine can be applied to patients with CD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, observational study will enroll 120 unique pediatric Crohn's disease patients&#xD;
      between the ages of 3-20 years among multiple sites. Patients will be naïve to TNF inhibitor.&#xD;
      If patient is going to start infliximab or infliximab biosimilar, patient may be enrolled in&#xD;
      study. Study length will be from commencement of infliximab until the infusion visit given at&#xD;
      least 1 year after initiation. During the study, if the patient fails infliximab or&#xD;
      biosimilar, they will be complete study once failure is indicated and discontinued on&#xD;
      infliximab or biosimilar. Patients may be on concurrent IBD therapy such as antibiotics,&#xD;
      mesalamines, immunomodulators and may continue in study if non-standard induction schedule or&#xD;
      changes made during induction or maintenance to dose or frequency. Excluded patients will be&#xD;
      those receiving infliximab or biosimilar infusions at home due to need for blood collection&#xD;
      at time of infusion, on systemic corticosteroids (topical preparations such as budesonide are&#xD;
      allowed), and those who have already undergone significant bowel surgery relating to their&#xD;
      Crohn's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will take place in conjunction with previously scheduled routine clinic visits&#xD;
      or infusion visits. At initial study visit, demographics, medical and surgical history, PARIS&#xD;
      classification, PCDAI, weight and height, fecal calprotectin, labs, EGD and colonoscopy&#xD;
      report and pathology report, cross-sectional imaging reports and concurrent medications will&#xD;
      be obtained and entered. Parameters measured at each study visit will include any obtained&#xD;
      labs, weight and height, PARIS classification, PCDAI, infliximab dose (mg/kg) and dose&#xD;
      interval. There will be four study visits throughout the course of 1 year after initiating&#xD;
      infliximab. At these four visits, blood will be obtained in PAXgene tubes for RNA analysis&#xD;
      and serum for banking for SOMAscan analysis.&#xD;
