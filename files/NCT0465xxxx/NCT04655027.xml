  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, parallel design, multicenter&#xD;
      prospective study to evaluate the effect of roxadustat versus rHuEPO treatment on the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) iron absorption in patients with anemia of Stage 4 and Stage 5 CKD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study, after eligibility confirmation patients will be randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to either roxadustat or rHuEPO arms for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll eligible dialysis and non-dialysis patients ≥18 years of age, who have&#xD;
      anemia of CKD, and are either dialysis-dependent (DD) and on a stable dose of rHuEPO within 4&#xD;
      weeks prior to screening, or are non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) and are being treated with&#xD;
      rHuEPO (ie, on a stable dose of rHuEPO within 4 weeks prior to screening), or are rHuEPO&#xD;
      -naïve at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be contacted before the first Screening Visit (Visit 1) for the symptoms of&#xD;
      coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and for any contact with COVID-19 positive person&#xD;
      within the past 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, the duration of participation in the study will be approximately 8 to 9&#xD;
      weeks divided into 3 periods: Screening Period (approximately 2-3 weeks); Treatment Period (2&#xD;
      weeks) and Post-Treatment Follow-up Period (4 weeks).&#xD;
