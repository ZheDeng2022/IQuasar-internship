  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bleb failure is reduced with Punch trabeculectomy procedure. Wide sclerostomy during surgery&#xD;
      is wanted but controllable. This can be done with single securing suture, releasable sutures&#xD;
      and topical intraoperative mitomycin-c. Average IOP without fluctuation (risk factor) can&#xD;
      protect the optic nerve.&#xD;

      This is a prospective randomized study. Patients had uncontrolled glaucoma on maximum&#xD;
      tolerated medical therapy including acetazolamide tablets were enrolled in this clinical&#xD;
      trial and were randomized to tight flap technique group (group A) and loose flap technique&#xD;
      group(group B). Randomization assigned 40 patients to group A and 40 patients to do group B.&#xD;
      A total of 80 patients were enrolled in the Study between 2012 and 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During trabeculectomy, Trabecular meshwork and scleral lamellae were excised made an opening&#xD;
      with the kelly scleral punch 1.0 mm 3-5 bites. At 12 o'clock 10/0 nylon monofilament stitch&#xD;
      was used to close the apex of triangular scleral flap tightly and two releasable stitches&#xD;
      were used at the sides of triangular scleral flap in group A. Fig-1 At 12 o'clock 10/0 nylon&#xD;
      monofilament stitch was used to secure the edges of the flap at the apex of and two-four&#xD;
      releasable stitches were used at the sides of triangular scleral flap in group B. The&#xD;
      intraocular pressure and bleb morphology were followed for one year after surgery.&#xD;
