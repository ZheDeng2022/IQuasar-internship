  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among subacute stroke patients (within 4 weeks after the onset), patients who are unable to&#xD;
      walk are divided into experimental groups and control groups, and conventional rehabilitation&#xD;
      treatment including physical therapy and occupational therapy is performed for 4 weeks or&#xD;
      more in all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robot assisted inclined bed treatment and FES were performed, and the control group performed&#xD;
      conventional inclined bed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of robot-assisted inclined bed&#xD;
      treatment by tracking observation and comparative analysis of the lower limb function, gait&#xD;
      ability, bone density and muscle mass of each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients appropriate for the selection criteria are divided into experimental group and&#xD;
      control group in random permuted blocks to conduct the study. In the experimental group, FES&#xD;
      was performed at the same time as the robot-assisted inclined bed treatment once a day for 30&#xD;
      minutes, 5 days a week for 4 weeks, and the control group performed conventional inclined bed&#xD;
      treatment for 30 minutes once a day for 4 weeks, 5 days a week. Separately from this in all&#xD;
      groups, functional electrical stimulation treatment is performed once a day in the area&#xD;
      except the lower extremities. In addition, all patients receive palliative physical therapy&#xD;
      for 4 weeks for 1 hour a day. All subjects undergo a physical examination and whole body&#xD;
      composition assessment before and after 4 weeks of treatment, and f/u after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
