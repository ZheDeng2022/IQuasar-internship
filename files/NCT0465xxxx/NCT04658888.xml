      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of offering self-sampling for&#xD;
      high risk HPV testing in order to increase the number of women who are screened for cervical&#xD;
      cancer. The hypothesis of this study is that women who are notified of a need for cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening by letter and are also offered a self-sampling kit for cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening will have a higher rate of screening than women notified by letter alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use an intervention arm (letter and option to request a self-sampling kit)&#xD;
      compared to a control arm (letter alone, standard of care) as a reminder that they are out of&#xD;
      date for their cervical cancer screening. Women who are out of date with their cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening will be identified using the Electronic Medical Record and randomized to the&#xD;
      study group in a 2 to 1 ratio (2 for the control arm and 1 to the intervention arm). The&#xD;
      primary endpoint that will be evaluated in this study is the method of completion of cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening and the use of the self-sampling kit, which will be monitored over a three&#xD;
      month period after the letters have been mailed. A secondary endpoint will be the overall&#xD;
      rate of cervical cancer screening of all people mailed a letter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Cancer Society estimates that 4,170 women in the United States will die from&#xD;
      cervical cancer in 2018. It is possible to prevent many of these deaths through screening and&#xD;
      appropriate follow-up in women with positive screens (1). Self-sampling for HPV testing may&#xD;
      be a viable option for cervical cancer screening, particularly among women who do not obtain&#xD;
      regular screening in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of offering self-sampling for&#xD;
      high risk HPV testing to in order to increase the number of women who are screened for&#xD;
      cervical cancer. This study will use an intervention arm and a control arm. Women in the&#xD;
      control arm will receive a standard letter stating that they need to be screened and should&#xD;
      contact their primary care provider. Women in the intervention arm will receive a modified&#xD;
      version of the letter informing them of a self-sampling option with a pre-addressed post card&#xD;
      that allows them to request a self-sampling kit. Once the postcard is returned these women&#xD;
      will receive a self-sampling kit in the mail to collect their sample. The kit will come with&#xD;
      a pre-paid mailer so that the participant can return their kit for processing at the Penn&#xD;
      State Hershey Clinical laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are out of date with their cervical cancer screening will be identified using the&#xD;
      Electronic Medical Record by the use of a set of queries that have been developed to extract&#xD;
      this patient population. Eligible women will be randomized to the study group in a 2 to 1&#xD;
      ratio (2 for the control arm and 1 to the intervention arm). The primary endpoint that will&#xD;
      be evaluated in this study is the method of completion of cervical cancer screening and the&#xD;
      use of the self-sampling kit, which will be monitored over a three month period after the&#xD;
      letters have been mailed. A secondary endpoint will be the overall rate of cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening of all people mailed a letter. Participants will be recruited continuously until&#xD;
      the anticipated sample size has been met. A total of 1,211 participants are expected to&#xD;
      participate in this study, 807 in the control arm and 404 in the intervention arm. The study&#xD;
      team will calculate the proportion of participants who obtain cervical cancer screening from&#xD;
      the clinic or the self-sampling kit and use chi-square tests for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a self-collected cervical sample produces a negative result, the participant will be&#xD;
      contacted by a study physician with these results. If the sample produces a positive result&#xD;
      for low-risk HPV the participant will be contacted by a study physician to schedule a pap&#xD;
      test. If the sample produces a positive result for high-risk HPV the participant will be&#xD;
      contacted by a study physician for a colposcopy. The pap test and colposcopy are both&#xD;
      standard of care for these results. The study team will monitor the completion of the&#xD;
      screenings and subsequent procedures.&#xD;
