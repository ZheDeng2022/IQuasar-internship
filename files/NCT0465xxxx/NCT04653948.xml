      Maternal immunisation is an evolving field that deserves special attention given its&#xD;
      potential to have a significant positive impact on the health of women and children globally,&#xD;
      and the potential safety and risk considerations associated with research in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of maternal immunisation is to boost maternal levels of specific antibodies to&#xD;
      provide the newborn and young infant with sufficient immunity at birth, through trans&#xD;
      placental transfer in-utero, to protect them through the period of increased vulnerability.&#xD;
      Protection should be adequate to last until they are able to respond to their own active&#xD;
      immunisations or infectious challenges. The success of the maternal neonatal tetanus&#xD;
      immunisation program demonstrates the utility of this approach. Several other vaccines are&#xD;
      recommended in pregnancy, including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Promising new&#xD;
      vaccines for group B streptococcus (GBS) , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus are under development. They are targeted for use in pregnant women in high-,&#xD;
      middle-, and low-income countries. However, these vaccines are likely to be of most benefit&#xD;
      in LMICs that have high rates of vaccine preventable diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second work-package (WP2) of the PREPARE portfolio will describe the baseline maternal&#xD;
      and neonatal outcomes using anonymised data collected using the routine Kawempe electronic&#xD;
      medical records (EMR) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, comprehensive data on pregnancy, neonatal and infant outcome will also be&#xD;
      collected in a prospective cohort of women enrolled in the first and second trimesters while&#xD;
      attending antenatal care at Kawempe Hospital with follow-up of the mother-infant pair(s) up&#xD;
      until at least 14 weeks postpartum to establish longer term outcomes. Standardised case&#xD;
      definitions will be used to classify the outcomes.&#xD;

      Maternal Immunisation research in LMICs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal immunisation is an evolving field that deserves special attention given its&#xD;
      potential to have a significant positive impact on the health of women and children globally,&#xD;
      and the potential safety and risk considerations associated with research in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to undertaking any maternal vaccine study, it is vital that the background rates of&#xD;
      pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are clearly documented as these vary by setting, so that&#xD;
      safety signals during vaccine trials can be correctly assessed . Given the important&#xD;
      contribution that maternal immunisations could make to reducing maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      morbidity, efforts are underway to standardise case definitions used to classify adverse&#xD;
      events in maternal vaccine trials. Historically, this has not been the case, limiting&#xD;
      comparability between countries and pre and post-licensure. In 2014, in response to a call&#xD;
      from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and with funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates&#xD;
      Foundation, the GAIA (Global Alignment on Immunisation Safety Assessment in pregnancy)&#xD;
      consortium was formed, with the goal of developing a harmonised, globally concerted approach&#xD;
      to actively monitor the safety of clinical trials, vaccines and immunization programs in&#xD;
      pregnancy. The group have developed 21 standardised case definitions for the classification&#xD;
      of adverse obstetric and neonatal events including the need to follow up vaccinated women for&#xD;
      6 months and infants for one year following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting Uganda has a long history of conducting prevention of mother to child HIV&#xD;
      transmission (PMTCT) trials as well as vaccine trials for Ebola and Human Immunodeficiency&#xD;
      Virus 9. The established National Drug Authority (NDA) and National Immunisation Technical&#xD;
      Advisory Group (NITAG) provide pharmacovigilance capacity and an effective platform for&#xD;
      monitoring drug and vaccine safety. Makerere University John Hopkins University Research&#xD;
      Collaboration (MUJHU) has led multiple PMTCT and HIV therapeutic trials 10. This&#xD;
      collaboration with St George's University, who are leaders in immunisation research, presents&#xD;
      a unique opportunity to develop a maternal vaccination platform for future trials in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding has been provided from the European Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership&#xD;
      (EDCTP) to develop a maternal vaccine trial platform at Kawempe National Referral Hospital.&#xD;
      It is anticipated that a tetanus, diptheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 2020 followed by two GBS vaccine trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study site, Kawempe National Referral Hospital, is developing as a centre of excellence&#xD;
      for maternal and child health studies in Uganda with several large studies of neonatal&#xD;
      encephalopathy, neonatal resuscitation (Clinical Trials - NCT03133572) and birth defects 11&#xD;
      being conducted at the site. Capacity building activities in Kawempe have included&#xD;
      implementation and piloting of an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance routine&#xD;
      data collection. This system provides an opportunity for embedding vaccine surveillance&#xD;
      activities for adverse pregnancy outcomes into routine data capture systems which support&#xD;
      clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kawempe Electronic Medical Record The Uganda Electronic Medical Record (UgandaEMR) is an&#xD;
      electronic health record system developed to capture patient level data collected during&#xD;
      service delivery. The system is supported by Uganda's Ministry of Health through its&#xD;
      Department of Health Informatics (DHI) with technical support from the CDC funded Monitoring&#xD;
      and Evaluation Technical support program (METs) under the Makerere University School of&#xD;
      Public Health. The system was developed based on open source technology, OpenMRS, and was&#xD;
      initially implemented to capture patient level data for HIV care and treatment programs. The&#xD;
      system has been rolled out to more than 600 health facilities countrywide and METS aim to&#xD;
      rollout it out to 1000 health facilities by the end of 2019. Makerere University John's&#xD;
      Hopkins University Research Collaboration (MUJHU) pioneered extension of the system to&#xD;
      capture Maternal and Child Health (MCH) information through a pilot implementation initiated&#xD;
      in February 2017 in the high-volume national referral hospital in Kawempe, Kampala.&#xD;
      Additional data entrants were deployed to capture the e-data in parallel to the standard&#xD;
      paper register-based data collection coupled with training and continuous quality improvement&#xD;
      measures to support and promote complete and accurate recording in the hospital source forms.&#xD;
      An evaluation of the pilot implementation found significant improvement in completeness of&#xD;
      both paper and electronic data collected during service delivery from an average of 60% at&#xD;
      baseline to over 90% at the end of the pilot implementation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBS Vaccine Research The PREPARE project is an international collaboration that aims to&#xD;
      accelerate GBS vaccine development and licensure. It is composed of five work packages (WP).&#xD;
      As part of the EDCTP funded PREPARE project two GBS vaccine trials (PREPARE WP4 and 5) will&#xD;
      be conducted at Kawempe National Referral Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for GBS clinical trials, PREPARE WP2 aims to characterise the Kawempe National&#xD;
      Referral hospital baseline pregnancy, neonatal and infant outcomes in preparation for future&#xD;
      GBS vaccine trial studies. Pregnancy is associated with complications which must be&#xD;
      differentiated from adverse events associated with the administration of vaccines. The&#xD;
      frequency of such pregnancy related complications varies significantly by geographical&#xD;
      location and the prevalence of such pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are poorly documented in&#xD;
      majority of developing countries.&#xD;
