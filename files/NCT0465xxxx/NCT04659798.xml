  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will provide information on outcomes in people with multiple myeloma, or systemic&#xD;
      AL amyloidosis, or both, under standard care. AL is short for amyloid light-chain. Standard&#xD;
      care means the participant will be treated according to their clinic's standard practice. The&#xD;
      study sponsor will not be involved in how participants are treated but will provide&#xD;
      instructions on how the clinics will record what happens during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to learn if treatment duration makes a difference in how participants&#xD;
      with multiple myeloma or systemic AL amyloidosis respond to their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will be treated according to their clinic's standard practice.&#xD;
      Participants must have started their treatment up to 12 months before taking part in this&#xD;
      study. During the study, the participants will visit their clinic every 3 months. These are&#xD;
      extra visits to their clinic's standard visits.&#xD;

      This is a prospective non-interventional study to assess the DoT and response in participants&#xD;
      with MM or systemic AL amyloidosis in standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll approximately 250 participants (220 with MM and 30 with systemic AL&#xD;
      amyloidosis). Participants will be enrolled in 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with MM Participants with AL amyloidosis The study will have a prospective data&#xD;
      collection of the participants from clinical records and scheduled visits following the&#xD;
      routine clinical practice. All participants will receive treatment at study start and this&#xD;
      treatment must have been started within 12 months before the participant's enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center study will be conducted in Spain. Participants will be followed until 12&#xD;
      months after enrollment. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

&#xD;
             AL amyloidosis diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In suspected AL amyloidosis, a histological diagnosis is essential and, where&#xD;
                  possible, a biopsy should be taken from an apparently affected organ.&#xD;
                  Alternatively, a subcutaneous abdominal fat aspirate and bone marrow biopsy may&#xD;
                  be examined for amyloid.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Congo red staining with classical apple green birefringence under polarized light&#xD;
                  should be used to test for the presence of amyloid on any histological specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The diagnosis of amyloid requires an experienced laboratory as false negative and&#xD;
                  false positive diagnoses on the basis of histology are not infrequent. Other&#xD;
                  (non-AL) amyloid fibril types should be excluded by using immunohistochemistry,&#xD;
                  deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis, protein sequencing or mass spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Under treatment for MM or systemic AL amyloidosis at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have started treatment up to 12 months before inclusion for MM or systemic AL&#xD;
             amyloidosis, irrespective of the treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Having first, second, third or fourth line of treatment for MM or systemic AL&#xD;
             amyloidosis, irrespective of the treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In case of participants with Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM) who are&#xD;
             candidates to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), the ASCT has to be performed&#xD;
             before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants with planned cessation of treatment for MM or systemic AL amyloidosis&#xD;
             from participation to the study (example, due to pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participating in blinded clinical trials, or in clinical trials with no possibility of&#xD;
             obtaining information required in this study, or in clinical trials in which&#xD;
             participation in other studies is not allowed.&#xD;
