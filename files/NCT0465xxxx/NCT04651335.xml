    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare and analyze how the visual gaze training in the&#xD;
      afferent direction and the visual gaze training in the efferent direction using virtual&#xD;
      reality affects the improvement of the neglect phenomenon in patients with subacute stroke&#xD;
      with unilateral neglect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the behavioral intention test (BIT) test and the Mini-Mental Screening Examination&#xD;
      test (MMSE) test for the group of unilateral neglected patients with stroke findings among&#xD;
      all eligible patients for this experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate subjects are selected and randomly divided into two groups. One group uses an&#xD;
      afferent virtual reality program, and the other uses an efferent virtual reality program to&#xD;
      train five times a week for a total of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before training, a computer experience scale 21 was additionally performed, and to find out&#xD;
      the degree of unilateral negligence, evaluation was performed using the Behavioral&#xD;
      Inattention Test (BIT) and Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS)22, and the angle of deflection&#xD;
      (deviation angle), out-of-focus time, gaze time, failure rate, and head rotation trajectory&#xD;
      were evaluated. In addition, reaction time, failure rate, and head rotation trajectory were&#xD;
      evaluated using a virtual reality program (Assessment program-V2) to evaluate the degree of&#xD;
      unilateral negligence. After that, BIT, CBS, and Assessment program-V2 tests are performed to&#xD;
      determine the degree of improvement in visual ignorance due to each program.&#xD;
