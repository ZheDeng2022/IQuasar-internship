  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that will evaluate disease status in children that have been newly&#xD;
      diagnosed high-grade glioma with TRK fusion. The evaluation will occur after 2 cycles of the&#xD;
      medication (Larotrectinib) have been given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate the safety of larotrectinib when given with chemotherapy in your&#xD;
      children; as well as the safety larotrectinib when given post-focal radiation therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, we will assess the disease control rate (Continued Complete&#xD;
      Response-CCR, Complete Response-CR, Partial Response-PR and Stable Disease-SD) as well as&#xD;
      survival rate (overall survival- OS and progression free survival- PFS) in children with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed HGG with TRK fusion who receive 2 cycles of larotrectinib monotherapy&#xD;
      administered orally, twice daily, at 100 mg/m2 continuously on a 28-day cycle schedule. After&#xD;
      2 monotherapy cycles of larotrectinib, patients with CCR or CR will continue to receive&#xD;
      larotrectinib maintenance therapy as monotherapy for a total of 12 cycles. Patients ≤ 48&#xD;
      months with PR or SD after 2 cycles of larotrectinib will go on to receive combination&#xD;
      therapy with standard backbone chemotherapy (BABYPOG or HIT-SKK). Patients &gt; 48 months of age&#xD;
      (or patients ≥ 36 months of age, or patients with DIPG &gt;18 months of age, at the discretion&#xD;
      of the local investigator) will receive focal radiation therapy. A surgical cohort study will&#xD;
      be explored whereby patients who have had a tumor biopsy/partial resection at their local&#xD;
      institution and are planned to subsequently undergo definitive resection will receive 3-5&#xD;
      days (6-10 doses) of larotrectinib pre-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design of this trial requires 15 patients evaluable for disease control and for&#xD;
      safety/ toxicity of larotrectinib as monotherapy. The surgical cohort will enroll up to 4&#xD;
      patients and will count towards the total 15 evaluable patients. A minimum of 6 patients will&#xD;
      be evaluable for safety toxicity of larotrectinib in combination with standard-of-care&#xD;
      chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&#xD;

             pontine gliomas (DIPG), whose tumors are documented in a CLIA/CAP certified lab (or&#xD;
             clinically equivalent method considered standard in non-US sites) to harbor an NTRK&#xD;
             fusion alteration by FISH, PCR, or next generation sequencing are eligible. Patients&#xD;

&#xD;
        For sites that do not have CLIA-certified equivalent (certified laboratory) to assess NTRK&#xD;
        fusion, testing will be conducted centrally at NCH. NTRK testing will be performed by NGS&#xD;

             definitive surgery at an enrolling site will be eligible to enroll onto the surgical&#xD;
             study. DIPG patients are not eligible for the surgical cohort.&#xD;
