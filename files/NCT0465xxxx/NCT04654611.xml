  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to document the effect of switching from preserved prostaglandin&#xD;
      analogues monotherapy to preservative free tafluprost 0.0015%. The endpoints analyzed are&#xD;
      side effect improvement in these patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Importance: Glaucoma medications are often preserved with agents such as benzalkonium&#xD;
      chloride, which commonly lead to ocular surface diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: To investigate the effect of switching to a preservative-free prostaglandin&#xD;
      analogue, tafluprost 0.0015% on treatment tolerability and ocular surface diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This was a prospective, open label, non-randomised, observational study performed in&#xD;
      a single hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients of Asian descent who have primary open angle glaucoma and ocular&#xD;
      hypertension (n = 28), who received preserved prostaglandin monotherapy for longer than 3&#xD;
      months, and has a National Eye Institute ocular surface staining scale score higher than 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients were switched from preserved prostaglandin monotherapy to preservative-free&#xD;
      tafluprost 0.0015%. Patients were analysed at baseline (Visit 0), 1 month (Visit 1) and 3&#xD;
      months (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: The main parameter measured is the change in the fluorescein staining&#xD;
      score at Visit 2.&#xD;

    <description>The fluorescein stained area of the cornea will be measured according to the National Eye Institute/Industry (NEI/I) method. NEI grading scale consists of a grid that divides the corneal area into five sections, each of which is assigned a score between zero and 3 depending of the amount and distribution of Corneal Fluorescein Stain (CFS); the total CFS score ranges from 0/15 (absence of corneal epitheliopathy) to 15/15 (severe epitheliopathy)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age of 21 years or older and those who can provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have corneal disorders due to the prostaglandin usage. (At least one eye&#xD;
             must have a score above 1 on the NEI scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Intraocular pressure (IOP) ≤ 21 mm Hg in the study eye at the screening examination&#xD;
             (under treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If only one eye is eligible, it is to be evaluated. If both eyes are eligible, then&#xD;
             the eye with a higher NEI score will be selected for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pretreatment must be monotherapy with any of the following preserved ophthalmic&#xD;
             solutions; latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost or tafluprost and its period must be&#xD;
             longer than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Outpatients who can visit the clinic on the designated day as instructed by the&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
