    <textblock>
      This study is composed of two stages: Part A initial dose escalation and Part B maintenance&#xD;
      dose escalation. Both parts will adopt the classical 3+3 dose escalation design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose for phase Ia part A is 0.1 mg/kg QW, followed by 3 dose cohorts (0.3mg/kg&#xD;
      QW, 0.8mg/kg QW and 1mg/kg QW). Duration of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation is 14&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will have 5 dose cohorts(3mg/kg QW, 10mg/kg QW, 20mg/kg QW 30mg/kg QW and 45mg/kg QW).&#xD;
      DLT observation period is 28 days. The subject number for each cohort in Part B will be&#xD;
      increased to 6 if the subject number enrolled in each cohort is less than 6.&#xD;

    <description>PART A :The patients confirming to the eligibility criteria will be assigned to the 4 dose groups (0.1mg/kg, 0.3mg/kg, 0.8mg/kg, 1.0mg/kg, respectively) based on the sequence of inclusion. Each patient will receive an intravenous infusion of MIL95 every week on Day 1 for a maximum of Twelve weeks.&#xD;
PART B:One recommended dose as a priming dose will be selected from 4 dose groups(0.1mg/kg、0.3mg/kg、0.8mg/kg、1.0mg/kg) based on results of PART A. Each patient will receive a priming dose of MIL95 on Day 1 Cycle 1.The patients will be assigned to the 5 maintenance dose groups (3mg/kg, 10mg/kg, 20mg/kg, 30mg/kg, 45mg/kg, respectively) based on the sequence of inclusion. The maintenance dose was given on Day 8,15,22 Cycle 1 and on Day 1,8,15,22 Cycle 2+. Each cycle was 28 days.</description>
