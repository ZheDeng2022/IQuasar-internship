  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with poor prognosis worldwide. The&#xD;
      asymptomatic of early-stage HCC may lead most patients diagnosed at advanced stages. This&#xD;
      highlights the importance of HCC screening among high-risk populations to detect HCC at early&#xD;
      stages and achieve better survival. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of HCC&#xD;
      in China, but the utilization of HCC screening is suboptimal among patients with HBV&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no-theory based intervention, to our knowledge, has been reported to&#xD;
      improve HCC screening decision-making and uptake among patients with HBV infection .&#xD;
      Therefore, based on our previous systematic review, the current study has proposed a&#xD;
      nurse-led decision counseling program to improve decision-making and uptake of HCC screening&#xD;
      among patients with HBV infection in mainland China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in intervention group will receive nurse-led decision counseling. The&#xD;
      intervention components include 40-minute education and tailored information regarding HCC&#xD;
      screening. At the second week, decision support will be provided through 30-minute telephone&#xD;
      call. At the third week, another telephone call (20 minutes) will be provided to help&#xD;
      participants identify and address barriers to HCC screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in control group will receive usual care. After the intervention and at 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up, the study will collect data related to HCC screening uptake rates. Findings are&#xD;
      paramount to promote informed choice in HCC screening and early HCC detection to improve&#xD;
      survival outcomes among patients with HBV infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the intervention group will receive the following three-week, three-session&#xD;
      intervention. The details are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education (20 min). At first week, education will be delivered through face-to-face for the&#xD;
      following information: (1) HBV infection and increased HCC risk; (2) HCC screening&#xD;
      recommendations regarding eligibility, available screening tests and recommended screening&#xD;
      intervals; (3) pros/advantages of undergoing HCC screening; (4) cons/disadvantages or&#xD;
      uncertainties of undergoing HCC screening; (5) implications of positive screening results;&#xD;
      and (6) health costs. The education material will be present in a self-made manual, which&#xD;
      will be explained and distributed to each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tailored psychosocial information (20 min). It will be conducted after education. The&#xD;
      tailored messages will be developed to form a message library for each sub-scale of the&#xD;
      preventive health model instrument with scoring â‰¤ 3 and &gt; 3. The contents will be based on&#xD;
      HCC screening guidelines and recommendations. The nurse counsellor will select and explain&#xD;
      tailored information based on individual's responses to the preventive health model&#xD;
      instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Values clarification exercises (30 min). At the second week, the decision counselor will work&#xD;
      with participants through telephone-based way to go through values clarification exercises,&#xD;
      in which participants will: (1) review the listed pros and cons decision factors of&#xD;
      undergoing HCC screening one by one; (2) indicate the extent to which each pros and cons&#xD;
      matters to them by giving stars; (3) add any other reasons for choosing or not choosing HCC&#xD;
      screening and indicate their importance; and (4) indicate their decision preferences toward&#xD;
      undergoing HCC screening, unsure, or not undergoing HCC screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploring and addressing implementation barriers (20 min). At the third week, the decision&#xD;
      counselor will work with participants, through telephone-based ways, to explore possible&#xD;
      barriers to undertake HCC screening; identify possible solutions or available resources to&#xD;
      the identified barriers via brainstorming; and encourage implementation of the chosen&#xD;
      solution to overcome the barriers and schedule for HCC screening.&#xD;
