  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the aging of populations worldwide, we observe an increase of age-related diseases and&#xD;
      loss of autonomy with consequent personal, social, medical and economic implications. The&#xD;
      aging population is a target for geriatric medicine, necessitating the development of&#xD;
      specific diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in order to estimate cardio vascular risk in&#xD;
      these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thought that arterial stiffening and endothelial dysfunction are among the earliest&#xD;
      vascular properties altered with the onset of cardiovascular disease. Moreover aging is&#xD;
      characterized by progressive fragmentation and break down of the elastic components of the&#xD;
      aortic media, which are partially replaced by highly cross-linked collagen leading to&#xD;
      stiffening, dilation, and elongation of the aorta . A major underlying mechanism of these&#xD;
      modifications is endothelial dysfunction due to high oxidative stress and low-grade&#xD;
      inflammation. Reactive hyperemia index (RHI), a key outcome of peripheral arterial tonometry&#xD;
      (PAT) has recently become a reliable tool to measure microvascular endothelial function. Some&#xD;
      studies have recently demonstrated the interest to measure in elderly patients arterial&#xD;
      stiffness parameters in order to prevent loss of autonomy. This cross sectional study aimed&#xD;
      at demonstrating the link between arterial stiffness evaluated by pulse wave velocity and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction evaluated by RHI to implement the tools of cardio vascular risk&#xD;
      evaluation in a population of elderly patients referred in a geriatric day hospital.&#xD;

      This study is a cross sectional monocentric retrospective study in a geriatric day hospital&#xD;
      population coming for frailty and cardio vascular evaluation : clinical data of 148 patients&#xD;
      hospitalized from April 2018 to December 2019 (20 months) of the Measurement of the&#xD;
      ARterial-Cardiac AGEing and prevention evaluation of FRailty (MARCAGE.FR) geriatric day&#xD;
      hospital of Nancy were retrospectively analyzed. Eligible patients were those who had&#xD;
      benefited from an EndoPAT® measurement and arterial stiffness evaluation and aged over 60&#xD;
      years. Exclusion criteria to analyze aortic pulse wave velocity was the presence of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation and for EndoPAT® a poor quality of the signal. 105 among these 148 patients were&#xD;
      finally selected as they present EndoPAT® good signal (reviewed by two operators).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects arrived in a fasting state at the geriatric day hospital where anthropometric,&#xD;
      frailty evaluation, hemodynamic and transcutaneous measurements of aortic pulse wave velocity&#xD;
      (AoPWV) were performed at rest. Some of them had a cerebral Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      examination. Participants were requested not to smoke or drink tea or coffee for 30 minutes&#xD;
      and to sit quietly for 10 minutes at least, before blood pressure and other hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters were measured. Individuals were considered hypertensive if they had systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (SBP) values &gt; 150 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values &gt; 90 mm Hg or&#xD;
      if they were previously diagnosed as hypertensive and treated with one or more&#xD;
      antihypertensive drug.&#xD;
