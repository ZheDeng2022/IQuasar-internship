    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving American College of Rheumatology Response 20/50/70</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12, Week 24,Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>ACR responders are participants with at least 20%, 50% and 70% improvement from baseline for tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), and at least 3 of the 5 remaining core set measures: Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) which measures participants perceived degree of difficulty performing daily activities, acute phase reactant as measured by hsCRP, Patient's Assessment of Pain-Visual Analog Scale (Pain-VAS), Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PaGADA_VAS), and Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PhGADA_VAS).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joint Count (DAS28)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 24, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 consists of a composite score of the following variables: tender joint count out of 28 (TJC28), swollen joint count out of 28 (SJC28), hsCRP [milligrams per liter (mg/L)], and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PaGADA_VAS) on a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) VAS (0=very well to 100=very poor). A decrease in DAS28-CRP indicates an improvement in participant's condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 24,Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The disability assessment component of the HAQ assesses a subjects level of functional ability and includes questions of fine movements of the upper extremity, locomotor activities of the lower extremity, and activities that involve both upper and lower extremities.</description>
