  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common cause of low back pain with radiculopathy among the working population is a&#xD;
      Lumbar Disc Herniation (LDH). In general, the natural history of sciatica is favourable with&#xD;
      spontaneous remission. For the subgroup with more severe symptoms that do not resolve the&#xD;
      vocational prognosis is unfavourable in more than 1/3 of the patients. Factors negatively&#xD;
      affecting return to work were unskilled labour and less than 40 weeks of employment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other than poorer prognosis for patients undergoing discectomy six months or later after the&#xD;
      onset of symptoms, there is no consensus on the timing of discectomy. National guidelines in&#xD;
      Denmark recommend referral to a spine surgeon if the patient's symptoms have not resolved&#xD;
      within 8-12 weeks. However, recent studies have shown that duration of sick leave is&#xD;
      associated with poorer clinical outcomes and lower return to work rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to establish if early surgical evaluation of patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic LDH can improve return to work rates. A secondary purpose is to analyse the&#xD;
      socioeconomic benefits or costs of an earlier surgical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled study of two parallel groups of patients who contact their&#xD;
      general practitioner for pain relief due to LDH and have been on a minimum of 2 weeks of paid&#xD;
      leave. The patients will be randomised to either fast track surgical evaluation or usual&#xD;
      care. After informed consent, the subjects will be followed for a period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are ethical considerations to address including the potential risk of performing&#xD;
      surgery if the patient's symptoms could have resolved spontaneously. On the other hand,&#xD;
      delayed discectomy could increase the risks of developing chronic pain and loss of work.&#xD;
      Thus, the intervention being studied is early referral to a spine surgeon and not discectomy&#xD;
      per se. This allows the subject to make a preference-based decision with the surgeon to have&#xD;
      a discectomy or not.&#xD;

      Design The study design will be a randomized parallel group prospective study of patients&#xD;
      from the region of Southern Denmark and the region Zealand with sciatica due to LDH&#xD;
      randomized to either early surgical evaluation or usual care as per recommendations from the&#xD;
      Danish National Health Board&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Study subjects are identified from the patient population in the region of&#xD;
      Southern Denmark and the Region of Zealand clinically diagnosed with LDH by their general&#xD;
      practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation procedure Eligible patients are randomised into one of two arms, usual care or&#xD;
      fast track surgical evaluation with a 1:1 Block sealed envelope randomisation used. A&#xD;
      randomized block design, stratified by the two surgical sites, is used to ensure equal&#xD;
      distribution of the two treatment arms in regions. The randomisation procedure is concealed&#xD;
      and administered by the primary investigator. Randomisation is performed after the patient&#xD;
      has signed the informed consent form. The result of the randomisation is documented in the&#xD;
      subjects' trial record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject withdrawal If a subject develops a clinically significant medical or surgical&#xD;
      condition that in the opinion of the investigator could impact the patient's ability to&#xD;
      successfully complete the trial or otherwise interfere with outcomes, the subject will be&#xD;
      withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient during the trial or follow-up period receives other medical or invasive&#xD;
      intervention that in the opinion of the investigator could impact on the patient's ability to&#xD;
      successfully complete the trial or otherwise interfere with outcomes, the subject will be&#xD;
      withdrawn,&#xD;
&#xD;
      These subjects will not be included in the final analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient course In Denmark the General Practioners' (GP's) are organised in clusters to ensure&#xD;
      a uniform quality of treatment. The study will be presented to all pre-existing GP-clusters&#xD;
      in the two participating regions at a GP-cluster meeting prior to the study by investigator.&#xD;
      Individual written consent from the GP to participate is obtained at the meeting. All GP's&#xD;
      not present will be identified and contacted individually to obtain written consent. All&#xD;
      participating GP's are informed and consent that all study subjects will, for the duration of&#xD;
      the study, be seen and treated by the investigator GP regarding their LDH, to include all&#xD;
      consultations, scripts, off work certificates, referrals etc. for as long as the patient is&#xD;
      part of the study. All patient encounters will be documented, and relevant information given&#xD;
      to respective GP's ongoing. Two laminated coloured A4 posters are distributed to each GP, one&#xD;
      for the GP and one for reception with trial name, screening criteria and investigators phone&#xD;
      number and e-mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the GP's who participate and don't participate in the study are recorded. All patients&#xD;
      that meet screening criteria are asked if investigator can contact them by phone.&#xD;
      Investigator then calls the patient to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria. If study&#xD;
      subject is found eligible then they will be thoroughly informed of the study and informed&#xD;
      consent is obtained per mail and an appointment for clinic visit with the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator is scheduled within one week is given. Information and inclusion of participants&#xD;
      will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Health Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      System in Denmark, from which approval will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first interview and examination, all study subjects' complete questionnaires as&#xD;
      per Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects in Usual Care will be treated following the Danish National Guidelines; get&#xD;
      relevant prescriptions, certificates, x-ray and physio/chiropractor referral as per standard&#xD;
      recommendations Study subjects in Fast Track arm will get an MRI done on the same day. All&#xD;
      MRIS will be performed and read at Middelfart Sygehus or Zealand University Hospital. If the&#xD;
      MRI shows concordant findings of herniated disc, the subject will be referred to a spine&#xD;
      surgeon to be seen within one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon will assess the patient and ensure the magnetic resonance image (MRI)&#xD;
      demonstrates a lumbar disc herniation, with the level and side corresponding with clinical&#xD;
      symptoms such as lower extremity radicular pain and/or affection of neurological function.&#xD;
      The subject and the surgeon will discuss the benefits and risks of a discectomy with the&#xD;
      subject. A decision regarding discectomy will be made taking into consideration the subject's&#xD;
      preference. If the surgeon and subject decide on discectomy, the surgery is scheduled within&#xD;
      the same week. Total timespan from first interview to surgery will be no longer than 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All discectomies for subjects in Fast Track arm will be performed at one of three Spine&#xD;
      Surgery Centres, Middelfart Sygehus, Odense Universitets Hospital (OUH) or Department of&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Surgery, Zealand University Hospital, KÃ¸ge. Depending on the surgeon's&#xD;
      preference, the surgical techniques will vary between open discectomy with or without the use&#xD;
      of microscope and tubular-discectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discectomies for subjects in Usual Care will be performed by a qualified spine surgeon but&#xD;
      not necessary at one of the three centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients irrespectively to study arm and treatment site are scheduled to standard&#xD;
      post-operative out-patient program with clinic visits as all Danish patients are legally&#xD;
      entitled to a free course of rehabilitation in the municipal centers. Rehabilitation programs&#xD;
      typically last 8-10 weeks and consist of either team or individual training 1-2 times weekly&#xD;
      combined with home exercises (13) Study subjects in both arms will be mailed questionnaires&#xD;
      as per table 1 and a SMS text reminder 3 days later if reply haven been recorded. This will&#xD;
      be handled automatically by RedCap. If still no reply is recorded, then investigator will&#xD;
      phone the study subject 7 days post mail.&#xD;
