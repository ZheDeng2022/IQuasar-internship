  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 1 diabetes are recommended to perform at least 150 minutes of accumulated&#xD;
      physical activity each week, however fear of hypoglycaemia is a well-known barrier to&#xD;
      exercise in these patients. Previous experimental studies have almost exclusively focused on&#xD;
      investigating cardiovascular effects of hypoglycaemia under resting conditions, however other&#xD;
      underlying circumstances prior to or during a hypoglycaemic event, (e.g. exercise) are rarely&#xD;
      discussed in the literature but might, nevertheless, be of significant clinical importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to investigate the QT interval dynamics and&#xD;
      prothrombotic factors during exercise-related hypoglycaemia in comparison with hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      under resting conditions, in patients with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen patients with type 1 diabetes will be recruited for a crossover study including two&#xD;
      test days, a combined euglycaemic- hypoglycaemic clamp combined with an exercise session and&#xD;
      an euglycaemic- hypoglycaemic clamp during bed rest, respectively. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      participants will be schedueled for a 24-hours followup visit after each test day for the&#xD;
      purpose of investigating prolonged prothrombotic effects of hypoglycaemia. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomised 1:1 to start with the combined exercise-clamp or the resting-clamp. The two test&#xD;
      days will be separated by at least 4 weeks to minimise carry-over effects. A group of fifteen&#xD;
      healthy individuals with normal glucose tolerance matched for age, gender and body mass&#xD;
      index, will be recruited for a single blood test aiming to compare baseline coagulation&#xD;
      status with patients with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
