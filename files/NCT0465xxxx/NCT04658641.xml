  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease and essential tremor are chronic movement disorders for which there is no&#xD;
      cure. When medication is no longer effective, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is recommended.&#xD;
      Standard DBS is a neuromodulation method that uses a simple monophasic pulse, delivered from&#xD;
      an electrode to stimulate neurons in a target brain area. This monophasic pulse spreads out&#xD;
      from the electrode creating a broad, electric field that stimulates a large neural&#xD;
      population. This can often effectively reduce motor symptoms. However, many DBS patients&#xD;
      experience side effects - caused by stimulation of non-target neurons - and suboptimal&#xD;
      symptom control - caused by inadequate stimulation of the correct neural target. The ability&#xD;
      to carefully manipulate the stimulating electric field to target specific neural&#xD;
      subpopulations could solve these problems and improve patient outcomes. The use of complex&#xD;
      pulse shapes, specifically biphasic pulses and asymmetric pre-pulses, can control the&#xD;
      temporal properties of the stimulation field. Evidence suggests that temporal manipulations&#xD;
      of the stimulation field can exploit biophysical differences in neurons to target specific&#xD;
      subpopulations. Therefore, our aim is to evaluate the direct neurophysiological effects of&#xD;
      complex pulse shapes in DBS movement disorder patients. This will be achieved using a&#xD;
      two-stage investigation: stage one will study the neural response to different pulse shapes&#xD;
      using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Stage two will study the neural responses to&#xD;
      different pulse shapes using intra-operative local field potential (LFP) recordings. This&#xD;
      study only relates only to the collection of EEG and LFP recordings in DBS patients. The&#xD;
      protocol does not cover any surgical procedures, which already take place as part of the&#xD;
      patient's normal clinical care.&#xD;

      Parkinson's disease and essential tremor are chronic movement disorders for which there is no&#xD;
      cure. When medication is no longer effective, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is recommended.&#xD;
      Standard DBS is a neuromodulation method that uses a simple monophasic pulse, delivered from&#xD;
      an electrode to stimulate neurons in a target brain area. This monophasic pulse spreads out&#xD;
      from the electrode creating a broad, electric field that stimulates a large neural&#xD;
      population. This can often effectively reduce motor symptoms. However, many DBS patients&#xD;
      experience side effects - caused by stimulation of non-target neurons - and suboptimal&#xD;
      symptom control - caused by inadequate stimulation of the correct neural target. The ability&#xD;
      to carefully manipulate the stimulating electric field to target specific neural&#xD;
      subpopulations could solve these problems and improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that modifying the electrical waveform (e.g. pulse duration, pulse&#xD;
      polarity, etc.) determine the spatial selectivity in functional electrical stimulation. Also,&#xD;
      a recent clinical study examined for the first time the acute effects of anodic compared to&#xD;
      cathodic neurostimulation in 10 PD patients. They found that thresholds for anodic&#xD;
      stimulation were significantly higher than thresholds for cathodic stimulation, which is in&#xD;
      agreement with previous research in animal studies and model calculations. However, they also&#xD;
      reported a better clinical effect of anodic compared to cathodic stimulation. Furthermore, a&#xD;
      modeling study from Anderson et al. (2018) found that fiber orientations can be selectively&#xD;
      targeted depending on the stimulus waveform (i.e. cathodic or anodic). Another recent study&#xD;
      examined the effect of an active symmetric biphasic pulse in 8 PD and 3 ET patients. They&#xD;
      found that this pulse shapes produced significant clinical improvements compared to the&#xD;
      standard clinical pulse shape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the symmetric biphasic pulse shape, the asymmetric pre-pulse shows great potential&#xD;
      for the refinement of DBS therapy. If the pre-pulse is anodic, it has a hyperpolarizing&#xD;
      effect and is therefore referred to as a hyperpolarizing pre-pulse. If it is cathodic, it has&#xD;
      a depolarizing effect near the electrode and is therefore referred to as a depolarizing&#xD;
      pre-pulse. Clinical studies focused on the use of asymmetric pulse shapes to improve the&#xD;
      spatial selectivity by selectively exciting fibers in cochlear implant listeners13-16.&#xD;
      Modeling studies indicate that a hyperpolarizing pre-pulse can actually decrease the&#xD;
      threshold for axons and that the threshold is decreased more for axons close to the electrode&#xD;
      than axons further away. This indicates that a hyperpolarizing pre-pulse may help focus the&#xD;
      effects of stimulation to axons near the electrode, thus leading to an increase in the&#xD;
      therapeutic window and potentially more efficient symptom control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that temporal manipulations (i.e. the use of complex pulse shapes,&#xD;
      specifically biphasic pulses and asymmetric pre-pulses) of the stimulation field can exploit&#xD;
      biophysical differences in neurons to target specific subpopulations. Ultimately, this may&#xD;
      lead to an increase in the therapeutic window and/or more efficient symptom control. In this&#xD;
      study, we aim to understand the neural mechanism underpinning the clinical effects observed&#xD;
      by manipulating the pulse shapes, by comparing neurophysiological responses to the standard&#xD;
      clinical pulse shapes to the responses to the complex pulse shapes. This will be achieved&#xD;
      using two approaches. The first approach will study neural responses to different pulse&#xD;
      shapes using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. The second approach will study neural&#xD;
      responses to different pulse shapes using intra-operative local field potential (LFP)&#xD;
      recordings. This study and research protocol relates only to the collection of EEG and LFP&#xD;
      recordings in DBS patients. The protocol does not cover any surgical procedures, which will&#xD;
      already take place as part of the patient's normal clinical care.&#xD;
