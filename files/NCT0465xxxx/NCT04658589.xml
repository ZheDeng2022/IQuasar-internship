      The study was designed as single-country, multi-center, open-labelled, randomized (1:1),&#xD;
      phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      238 patients with medically and technically operable advanced gastric adenocarcinoma in&#xD;
      middle or distal 1/3 of stomach are enrolled and randomly assigned to laparoscopic&#xD;
      gastrectomy group and open gastrectomy group. 4 cycles of mFLOT chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      conducted before and after gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is comparison of D2 lymph node dissection compliance rate&#xD;
      between open surgery group and laparoscopic surgery group after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on locally advanced gastric cancer was confirmed from&#xD;
      a prospective clinical trial. Oncologic safety and excellence of the laparoscopic gastrectomy&#xD;
      surgery was recently established for locally advanced gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, neither technical nor oncologic stability was established for laparoscopic&#xD;
      gastrectomy surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Anticipated benefits from laparoscopic&#xD;
      gastrectomy surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy are as follows: 1) Reduced postoperative&#xD;
      complications; 2) Reduced intra- or postoperative transfusion and patient's pain after&#xD;
      surgery; 3) Enhance postoperative recovery (shortened hospitalization duration); 4)&#xD;
      Facilitate completion rate of adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
