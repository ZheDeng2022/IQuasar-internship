    <textblock>
      In patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI), the study's purpose was to&#xD;
      determinate factors associated with mortality and poor functional outcome at 3 months in&#xD;
      patients aged ≥ 65 hospitalized in ICU and to compare outcome at 3 months between younger&#xD;
      patients (18-64 years) vs older patients (≥65 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traumatic brain injury is a common cause of hospitalization for trauma and accounting for&#xD;
      roughly 37% of all injury-related death in Europe. This was particularly true for patients ≥&#xD;
      65 years old and in the most severe case(Glasgow coma score ≤ 8) with mortality rates between&#xD;
      31 to 51%. Over time, epidemiological patterns of TBI are changing. Indeed, in high-income&#xD;
      countries, overall incidence is steadily decreasing, but increasing in elderly population&#xD;
      with falls becoming the leading cause of TBI. In parallel, the World Population Ageing 2019&#xD;
      report of the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social&#xD;
      Affairs reported 703 (9%) million persons aged ≥65 years in the global population and that&#xD;
      this proportion is projected to rise further to 16 % in 2050. Accordingly, we could expect&#xD;
      that TBI in elderly would be increasing and could explain why mortality did not improved in&#xD;
      the latest decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study performed in three neuro-intensive care unit (ICUs) from 1997 to 2007, 6-month&#xD;
      mortality in patients aged of 70-79 and ≥ 80 years was 59% and 79%, respectively. In severe&#xD;
      elderly (≥ 65 years) TBI patients admitted in ICU, hospital and 6-month mortality was 64.6%&#xD;
      and 72.9%, respectively. Beyond mortality, TBI can lead to poor functional neurologic outcome&#xD;
      and elderly patients are more prone to survive with disabilities according to a higher rate&#xD;
      of comorbidities, frequent use of oral anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet and/or previous&#xD;
      brain disorders. In patients hospitalized in ICU, age (&gt; 59 years) was the strongest&#xD;
      parameter associated with an unfavorable outcome including death, vegetative state and severe&#xD;
      disability, at 6 month. Moreover, TBI elderly patients (≥ 65 years) had worse functional&#xD;
      outcome at discharge than younger patients. Identifying elderly patients who may benefit from&#xD;
      ICU remained challenging, since there is no consensual guideline of triage. Traumatic&#xD;
      brain-injured patients are particularly concerned by this issue. Nevertheless, few data are&#xD;
      available related to outcome in elderly TBI patients requiring ICU.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a multicentre, retrospective, observational study from April 2013&#xD;
      to February 2019 in the surgical ICUs of 5 level 1 Trauma centers in France. The&#xD;
      investigators collected data from the &quot;regional intensive care network of the great west of&#xD;
      france&quot; (AtlanRéa) database. The AtlanRéa database registers prospectively and consecutively&#xD;
      numerous informations about brain injury and trauma patients hospitalized in ICUs, in order&#xD;
      to provide epidemiologic informations for this population. Data were collected by clinical&#xD;
      research assistants in each participating ICU, using an electronic case report form. The&#xD;
      investigators assessed data regarding outcomes after discharge from ICUs through phone&#xD;
      interview led by dedicated clinical research assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data were entered in the database: Age, gender and body mass index, previous&#xD;
      medical history, and more specifically the presence of cardiac insufficiency, chronic renal&#xD;
      failure defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/min.1.73 m-1,&#xD;
      chronic respiratory illness, neurologic background, diabetes, neoplasia history, previous&#xD;
      TBI, active smoking and chronic alcoholism. Mechanism of injury (domestic accident, road&#xD;
      traffic crash, fall from heights or others). The Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) score determinates&#xD;
      in the prehospital setting or at admission at hospital before intubation and/or sedation, and&#xD;
      the presence of at least one nonreactive and dilated pupil at the initial management.&#xD;
      Severity of illness according to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) the&#xD;
      Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The&#xD;
      investigators also specified the severity of TBI by the abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) and&#xD;
      reported the associated injuries from 5 territories (face, chest, abdomen, extremity&#xD;
      (including pelvis) and external). Initial CT-scan was classified according to the Marshall&#xD;
      classification in six categories (Diffuse injury I, II, III, IV, evacuated mass (V) and&#xD;
      non-evacuated mass lesion (VI)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data during the patients' hospitalization are also entered in the database: use&#xD;
      of an intracranial pressure (ICP) catheter, occurrence of intracranial hypertension (defined&#xD;
      as an ICP above 20 mmHg in absence of confounding factors), and use of barbiturates and/or&#xD;
      osmotherapy, decompressive craniectomy, and other neurosurgical procedure. The occurrence of&#xD;
      intercurrent events occurring during ICU stay, including infections, Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Distress Syndrome (ARDS), need of vasopressor drugs, acute renal failure, thrombophlebitis,&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism, hemorrhage, infection and tracheostomy. The investigators specified the&#xD;
      need for intubation and durations of mechanical ventilation, central venous catheterism and&#xD;
      vasopressor. The investigators also recorded the decision in ICU to withdraw or withhold life&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of stay in ICU, ICU and 3-month mortalities and patient outcome were assessed&#xD;
      using the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) score at 3 months. The investigators&#xD;
      dichotomized the GOSE score between the four lower values (corresponding to unfavorable&#xD;
      outcome- GOSE 1 to 4) and the four upper values (corresponding to favorable outcome- GOSE 5&#xD;
      to 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis All statistical analysis will be performed using R software 3.3.1&#xD;
      (package pROC) and SAS 9.1 Statistical Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). For&#xD;
      quantitative continuous variables, position and dispersion parameters (mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, median, interquartile range) will be calculated. For qualitative variables,&#xD;
      proportion rates will be calculated. For groups' comparison, we used independent-samples&#xD;
      t-tests for normally distributed continuous variables, and Mann-Whitney U-tests for&#xD;
      non-normally distributed continuous variables. Χ² tests will be performed for categorical&#xD;
      variables. To build the model for multivariate analysis, the investigators selected among the&#xD;
      variables with a p ≤ 0.20 according to the univariate analysis. The investigators performed&#xD;
      logistic regression model to identify factors associated with in-ICU mortality and&#xD;
      dichotomized GOSE score at 3 months. The Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)&#xD;
      will be calculated. For continuous variables, diagnosis of log linear behavior was&#xD;
      established, and if not confirmed, the variable will be divided into categories and treated&#xD;
      as categorical variables. Model's fit will be assessed by checking residual plots and Cook's&#xD;
      distance. The calibration of the model will be tested by Goodness of Fit Hosmer-Lemeshow&#xD;
      test. A p ≤0.05 will be considered statistically significant for all the comparisons.&#xD;
