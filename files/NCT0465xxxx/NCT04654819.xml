      The present study investigates confidence levels reported among intern dentists who used&#xD;
      dental anesthesia simulators, before performing local anesthesia on patients as well as&#xD;
      patient reports on intern dentist confidence levels to deliver anesthesia injections and&#xD;
      compare them to those who did not receive dental anesthesia simulator education. Application&#xD;
      success rates will also be investigated and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was carried out in the dental anesthesia simulator laboratory and in the faculty&#xD;
      clinics of Ankara University, Faculty of Dentistry. A hundred volunteer intern dentists who&#xD;
      completed the third year of the 5-year undergraduate education program and who had not&#xD;
      performed local anesthesia on a patient contributed. Seventy intern dentists received&#xD;
      training on dental anesthesia simulators, and made applications on patients, while 30 intern&#xD;
      dentists made applications without training on the dental anesthesia simulators and served as&#xD;
      control. With a prepared single questionnaire, intern dentists made self-assessment of&#xD;
      preparedness and confidence, educators made assessment of application success rates and&#xD;
      treated patients evaluated intern dentists' confidence levels.&#xD;

      Ethical approval was obtained from the Ankara University Faculty of Dentistry Clinical&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee (Approval no: 14/16). The study was carried out in the dental&#xD;
      anesthesia simulator laboratory and in the faculty clinics of Ankara University, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry within a 2-year period. During the first year of the study, the faculty did not&#xD;
      have DAS availability. During this first year 30 intern dentists who had completed the third&#xD;
      year of the 5-year undergraduate education program and who could not receive DAS training&#xD;
      before their first anesthesia application on a patient, were recruited as a control group&#xD;
      among consent to participate. During the second year of the study after DAS became available,&#xD;
      70 intern dentists who had completed the third year of the 5-year undergraduate education&#xD;
      program and who had not applied local anesthesia to a patient, were recruited as a study&#xD;
      group among consent to participate. The study group applied their first anesthesia&#xD;
      application on a patient after DAS education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study 10 conduction anesthesia models mounted on metal rods, (CAM SUG2005-UL-SP,&#xD;
      Nissin Dental Products Kyoto, Japan, Figure.1), were provided. The part-task simulators had&#xD;
      11 anesthetic contact sensor points (7 in the upper jaw and 4 in the lower jaw) with 32&#xD;
      anatomically shaped teeth, audio signal and light signal indicators when correct position and&#xD;
      angle was achieved. The models had clear pink upper and lower gingivae allowing view of&#xD;
      injection, making it ideal for beginner intern dentists, while allowing a more realistic&#xD;
      training experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups attended theoretical presentations an interactive lesson about IANB from an oral&#xD;
      and maxillofacial surgery professor. Technical information about DAS were also covered for&#xD;
      the study group lessons. Following lessons, both groups answered a questionnaire concerning&#xD;
      preparedness. Afterwards, intern dentists in the control group carried on with patient&#xD;
      application whereas the study group carried on with DAS education before continuing on&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During DAS lessons the intern dentists applied IANB on simulators. The illumination of the&#xD;
      light and sound indicator on the model as a result of injection to the pterygomandibular&#xD;
      region was accepted as a successful application. The results of the first five IANB&#xD;
      applications made by the intern dentists were recorded. Intern dentists who completed the DAS&#xD;
      training completed a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After trainings, both groups applied IANB to a patient for the first time in the clinic and&#xD;
      completed another questionnaire. The intraoperative and immediate postoperative complications&#xD;
      were monitored. Tingling sensation on the lip and tongue, reported by the patient, was&#xD;
      accepted as criteria for profound anesthesia. After achieving anesthesia, the questionnaire,&#xD;
      was answered by the patient on whom the application was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Section 1: Expectations After Theoretical Education&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The theoretical training adequately prepared me for my first anesthesia application. *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I feel ready for my first anesthesia application. * Section 2: Expectations After DASM&#xD;
           Training&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The DASM training adequately prepared me for my first anesthesia application. *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I feel ready for my first anesthesia application. *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It was useful to work on the DASM before my first anesthesia application. * Section 3:&#xD;
           IANB application&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explain if complications developed during anesthesia application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I was nervous during anesthesia application. *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I was sure of myself during anesthesia application. *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I was confident in determining the front edge of the mandible. *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I was sure of myself when determining the area to enter the dental injector. *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I was sure of myself as the dental injector entered soft tissue. *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I was sure of myself as the dental injector progressed through the soft tissue. *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I felt that the dental injector touched the mandible. *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I provided anesthesia. **&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I do not need surveillance in my next application. *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It was/would have been useful to work on the DASM before my first anesthesia&#xD;
           application. * Section 4: To be filled out by your patient&#xD;
