  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial that aim to verify the&#xD;
      safety and the efficacy of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive&#xD;
      and motor symptoms in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) over the left dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease&#xD;
      characterized by deposition of tau and motor, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Since no&#xD;
      effective treatment is available, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as tDCS,&#xD;
      could be a valid complementary therapeutic approach. The tDCS modulates the spontaneous&#xD;
      activity of the neural network by applying a direct current flow on the cortical brain areas&#xD;
      (anodic or cathodic stimulation). Despite its efficacy in psychiatric disorders, the&#xD;
      therapeutic use of tDCS in neurodegenerative diseases requires more systematic studies. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to verify the safety and efficacy of tDCS in PSP on motor, cognitive and&#xD;
      behavioral symptoms.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be recruited and randomized in two parallel group: group 1 will receive anodal left dlPFC tDCS (real tDCS) and group 2 will receive sham stimulation for 5 days/week for 2 consecutive weeks, in a 2:1 ratio, respectively. Each participant will undergo a clinical evaluation at baseline (T0), immediately after 2 weeks of either real or sham tDCS (T1), at 45-day (T2) and at 3-month follow up (T3) from baseline. PSP phenotypes will be uniformly distributed between treatment arms (ie, =Richardson's syndrome versus non-Richardson's syndrome=1:1).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Randomization, monitoring and data management will be performed locally. Randomization will be performed using an online list randomizer (random.org). The study coordinator will generate the random allocation sequence before enrollment. Then, one sub-investigator will perform clinical evaluations and another one will administer the treatment.</masking_description>

    <description>tDCS is delivered by a battery-driven constant current stimulator thought a pair of saline soaked surface sponge electrodes. The active electrode (anode) is placed on the scalp over the left dlPFC (F3) according to the 10 to 20 international electroencephalogram coordinates) and the cathode is placed over the right deltoid muscle. During real stimulation a constant current of 2mA (milli Ampere) is applied for 20 minutes.</description>
