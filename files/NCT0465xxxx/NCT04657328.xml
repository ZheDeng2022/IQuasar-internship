      Sonazoid as a new generation of ultrasound contrast agent.This study based on the features of&#xD;
      Sonazoid specific angiography and high mechanical index,the role of Sonazoid in the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of breast benign and malignant tumors was explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, multi-center study.With pathology as the gold standard, based on&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative analysis, Sonazoid-CEUS was compared with MRI to explore the&#xD;
      diagnostic efficacy (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) of Sonazoid-CEUS for breast tumor&#xD;
      in different pathological types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will also record the parameter information of imaging examination, pathological&#xD;
      type of pathological examination and immunohistochemical index.Contrast-enhanced ultrasound&#xD;
      includes lesion location, initial peak tumor volume, 1-minute tumor volume, 2-minute tumor&#xD;
      volume, and 5-minute tumor volume, as well as the time for contrast enhancement, contrast&#xD;
      agent clearance, and contrast agent clearance.Whether there is no enhancement area in the&#xD;
      lesion after contrast enhancement, shape after contrast enhancement, edge after contrast&#xD;
      enhancement, order of enhancement, uniformity of enhancement, intensity enhancement, pattern&#xD;
      of enhancement, clear boundary after contrast enhancement, aspect ratio after contrast&#xD;
      enhancement, etc.The magnetic field strength of the equipment is planned to be recorded in&#xD;
      the enhanced MRI information, the name of the MRI contrast agent, the lesion location, the&#xD;
      size of the LESION, and the scanning performance are enhanced (lump-like enhancement,&#xD;
      non-lump-like enhancement, point-like enhancement), time-signal intensity enhancement curve,&#xD;
      DWI signal, ADC value, etc.&#xD;
