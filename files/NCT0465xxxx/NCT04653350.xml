  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      in Pakistan 9.9 million people are osteoporotic and 7.2 million amongst them are women.&#xD;
      Globally after every 3 seconds there is occurrence of fragility fracture.In Pakistan females&#xD;
      carries different risk factors based on distinct culture, environment, diet and lifestyle. So&#xD;
      there is dire need to conduct more high quality clinical trials at National level in order to&#xD;
      establish strong evidence in favor of low cost but highly effective exercise protocols for&#xD;
      such a significant public health issue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In postmenopausal age, women bones get weak and easily fracture after 50years. In Pakistan&#xD;
      every other female is silently suffering from this disease leading to bone, joint pain and&#xD;
      disability. This project is innovatively designed first time in Pakistan to target weak bones&#xD;
      of women with high intensity, progressive exercise training. The objectives of this study are&#xD;
      to determine the effects of a high intensity multi-modal exercise training on bone mineral&#xD;
      density and functional performance in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial screening based on history, subjective fracture risk calculations and&#xD;
      subjective osteoporosis screening. Females fulfilling criteria and willing to participate in&#xD;
      exercise trial will be recruited in the study. At baseline, DEXA scan will be done for&#xD;
      Femoral and lumbar bone density. All performance based testing for functional performance&#xD;
      outcome measures would be done at baseline, after 3 months &amp; after 6 months. Patient will be&#xD;
      called twice a week for 8months and DEXA will be repeated after 8months of training. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that supervised exercise training will improve bone mineral density and&#xD;
      functional performance in postmenopausal women with low bone mass.&#xD;
