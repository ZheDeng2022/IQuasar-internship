  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is an under-reported but prevalent symptom in Parkinson´s Disease (PD), impacting&#xD;
      patients' quality of life. Both pain and PD conditions cause cortical excitability reduction,&#xD;
      but mental representations techniques are thought to be able to counteract it, resulting also&#xD;
      effective in chronic pain conditions. The investigators of the present project aim to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of a novel mental representation protocol in the management of pain in&#xD;
      PD patients during the ON state. The investigators hypothesize that Action Observation (AO)&#xD;
      and Motor Imagery (MI) training through a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) using Virtual&#xD;
      Reality (AO+MI-BCI) can improve clinical pain and its central processing features.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson´s Disease (PD) affects between 4.1 and 4.6 million people in the world. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of PD is currently clinical and based on its motor manifestations (bradykinesia,&#xD;
      rest tremor, and rigidity). However, non-motor symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric manifestations are present in more than 70% of subjects. Pain affects about&#xD;
      85% of patients but is paradoxically under-reported and consequently under-treated in PD&#xD;
      patients with a great impact on their quality of life. Levodopa, which is the election&#xD;
      treatment in PD, has shown controversial results regarding pain sensitivity and has been&#xD;
      shown ineffective for enhancing the endogenous pain modulation system. Furthermore, there is&#xD;
      a lack of management protocols and nonpharmacologic treatments for pain in PD. Several&#xD;
      syndromes are hypothesized to be involved in PD pain generation. Generally, PD patients&#xD;
      suffer from alterations in peripheral transmission, sensitive-discriminative processing, pain&#xD;
      perception, and pain interpretation in multiple levels, due to neurodegenerative changes in&#xD;
      dopaminergic pathways and non-dopaminergic pain-related structures. Therefore, central&#xD;
      mechanisms are proposed to be crucial for the development and establishment of pain in PD&#xD;
      patients. Regarding pain processing features, PD patients have reduced pain thresholds, an&#xD;
      augmented Temporal Summation (TS) after repetitive nociceptive stimulus, and the impairment&#xD;
      of their Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) is correlated with greater severity and premature&#xD;
      onset of the disease. Cortical excitability reduction is common in patients with pain.&#xD;
      Therefore, diverse therapies are being developed to counteract this cortical excitability&#xD;
      reduction and obtaining, consequently, effective pain relief. In consonance with these&#xD;
      findings, in PD condition, especially in off state, there is also evidence of cortical&#xD;
      excitability decrease but, to the best of investigators´ knowledge, there are no studies&#xD;
      targeting cortical excitability to treat pain in PD. Thus, the present study proposes mental&#xD;
      representation techniques for the treatment of PD-related pain. The mental representation&#xD;
      techniques included in the protocol will be Action Observation (AO) and Motor Imagery (MI).&#xD;
      The combination of AO and MI has shown to synergically increase cortical excitability,&#xD;
      influencing the activation of cortical areas such as M1 and DLPFC. Specifically in PD, AO and&#xD;
      MI have also demonstrated to produce corticomotor facilitation. In addition, mental&#xD;
      representation training can produce neurophysiological activity similar to actual exercise&#xD;
      training, which has shown to decrease the intensity and severity of pain in PD patients. The&#xD;
      main aim of this study is to conduct an independent parallel randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      based on AO+MI-BCI targeting changes in 1. validated general and specific PD related pain&#xD;
      scales and 2. psychophysical measurements of pain modulation mechanisms. The investigators´&#xD;
      main hypothesis is that AO+MI-BCI will be superior to their respective control placebo&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be a double-blinded experimental longitudinal prospective randomized controlled trial with a parallel design. The randomization will be realized through randomization software. All the participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria and have none of the exclusion ones will be randomly allocated into two groups: AO+MI through a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) training paradigm in Virtual Reality (VR) (AO+MI-BCI) or AO of non-related with movement illustrations (AO-control). Allocation concealment will be ensured by the inclusion of the assigned group in closed opaque envelopes that will be opened at the time of the intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Double-blind criteria will be achieved by following the same protocol with the same instruments in both groups. The evaluator will not be able to stay in the same room during the intervention and patients will not know the instructions and specific hypotheses of each protocol. The statistician will be blinded through the assignment of neutral numbers to both groups. Patients recruited will not meet in waiting rooms to avoid them to comment on their experience during the protocol. Unblinding will be permissible when any event could suppose a risk for the patient's health.</masking_description>

    <description>Patients will undergo the treatment through the NeuRow platform. NeuRow is a gamified Brain-Computer Interface training paradigm in Virtual Reality (or neurogame) that allows patients to perform the same actions as they would do in real-life by imaging the movement. In NeuRow, patients will see a boat and two high fidelity virtual arms gripping two oars in the first-person view. Patients will have to imagine the movement of each corresponding hand to rotate each oar and progress, observing the movement imagined on screen. The goal of the task is to collect as many flags as possible in a fixed amount of time. In order to improve adherence, the number of flags collected will be recorded in each session. It will be able to adapt the boat speed, turn speed, and cut-off angle, to help patients not to deviate in excess from the target. The treatment itself will be performed for 20 minutes each session, divided into 4 series of 5 minutes to prevent fatigue.</description>
