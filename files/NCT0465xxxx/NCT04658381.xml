  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Albinism is a genetic condition, resulting from mutations in at least 19 known genes&#xD;
      responsible for the production of melanin in the skin, hair and eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ophthalmological manifestations are a constant feature of this disease. Albinism is believed&#xD;
      to be responsible for 5% of visual impairments worldwide and all albino patients have some&#xD;
      degree of fovea plana. In the milder forms, it is a slightly less marked foveolar depression&#xD;
      with conservation of the normal diameter of the cones and, therefore, good visual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its known association with various ocular pathologies such as albinism,&#xD;
      aniridia, nanophthalmia and retinopathy of prematurity, fovea plana was found in 3% of a&#xD;
      population of normal children (without known ocular or systemic pathology) in a study&#xD;
      conducted in 2014 to determine a pediatric normative basis for macular volume measured by&#xD;
      optical coherence imaging (Stratus OCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, a study carried out at the Hospital Foundation Adolphe de Rothschild showed&#xD;
      that at least 35% of parents of albino children, who are totally asymptomatic, present with&#xD;
      fovea plana in OCT. This frequency is higher than the 3% prevalence of fovea plana in&#xD;
      asymptomatic subjects without a family history of albinism, suggesting a modulation of&#xD;
      heterozygosity for a known gene for albinism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to verify, in patients with fortuitously discovered fovea plana&#xD;
      (preoperative OCT for cataract surgery), with conservation of visual function and without&#xD;
      known or manifest albinism, whether they are carriers of mutation in one of the genes&#xD;
      referenced for albinism. This will also allow us to characterize these foveolar profiles in&#xD;
      OCT according to the classification of Thomas et al., as well as in terms of retinal&#xD;
      capillary density in OCT-Angiography, in order to know whether it is the same type of fovea&#xD;
      plana or if the phenotype differs depending on the genetic damage.&#xD;

Briefly, the exons of the genes are selected by capture and are amplified by PCR simultaneously, in a single reaction, and then sequenced by Illumina technology. The analysis will only concern genes involved in albinism and in genetic pathologies associated with fovea plana.</description>
