  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complex Regional Pain Syndrome type 1 (CRPS1) is a disabling pain syndrome. Its definitive&#xD;
      treatment has not been established and the results of current treatments are often&#xD;
      unsatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis is difficult to establish because the vast majority of CRPS regresses within a&#xD;
      few weeks. However, some forms are hyperalgesic with a major chronic painful picture, very&#xD;
      debilitating and responding poorly to treatments with possible permanent sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of CRPS remains difficult and unsatisfactory and is symptomatic,&#xD;
      multidimensional and multidisciplinary involving medical, paramedical and socio-professional&#xD;
      workers. The priority therapeutic objectives are analgesia, maintenance or gain of joint&#xD;
      range and maintenance or restoration of motor functions. This treatment is not the subject of&#xD;
      a consensus and its implementation is sometimes the responsibility of specialized centers&#xD;
      such as &quot;pain relief&quot; centers or even Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (MPR) structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies using ketamine as a treatment for CRPS1 show encouraging results with a&#xD;
      decrease in neuropathic pain. Ketamine is a low dose pain reliever. Ketamine has been studied&#xD;
      as an adjuvant for the treatment of chronic pain, particularly neuropathic pain. The results&#xD;
      suggest that ketamine decreases pain intensity and reduces opioid reliance when used as an&#xD;
      adjunct to chronic and acute pain. Ketamine is believed to have a greater analgesic effect in&#xD;
      patients with CRPS1 compared to other chronic pain syndromes. In these studies, ketamine was&#xD;
      used intravenously, subcutaneously, orally, intranasally, or topically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesotherapy allows microdose local treatment to be carried out limiting side effects,&#xD;
      ensuring compliance and easy to implement. The injected solutions often contain a local&#xD;
      anesthetic (procaine or lidocaine). It allows better local tolerance from the start of&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, through its vasodilator effect on the microcirculation, it increases&#xD;
      the effectiveness and tolerance of other injected products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no studies using ketamine administrated by mesotherapy. Based on the scientific&#xD;
      literature, there are good reasons to believe that this treatment could be effective on the&#xD;
      neuropathic pain of CRPS1 and well tolerated.&#xD;

This benefit-risk balance will be estimate in a hierarchical fashion using the method of pairwise comparisons. The VAS will be used as the first endpoint (benefit) and the highest grade of AE in a given patient as the second endpoint (risk). No clinical relevance threshold will be specified for the two criteria for the primary analysis, but they will then be added as a sensitivity analysis.</description>
