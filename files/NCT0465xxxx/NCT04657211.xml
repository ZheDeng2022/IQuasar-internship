    <textblock>
      TETRIS is a multi-center, prospective observational cohort study. It will include&#xD;
      participants with COPD who are on an existing combined treatment of long-acting muscarinic&#xD;
      antagonist (LAMA), long-acting beta 2 agonists (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a disabling respiratory disease characterized by airflow obstruction and associated&#xD;
      symptoms, including breathing difficulties caused by shortness of breath and wheezing, airway&#xD;
      hyperactivity, chronic cough, sputum production, exercise intolerance, and poor quality of&#xD;
      life. In accordance with the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease)&#xD;
      recommendations, it is important to assess the characteristics and treatment patterns of&#xD;
      participants prior to triple therapy initiation, in order to determine adherence to these&#xD;
      guidelines and understand how participants progress to triple therapy. Despite a clearly&#xD;
      defined guidance from GOLD treatment recommendations for the initiation and maintenance of&#xD;
      triple therapy, treatment changes in Germany, including de-escalation, are often seen in&#xD;
      treatment reality. This study is intended to gain a better understanding of what influences&#xD;
      the treatment decision of German physicians in primary and secondary care under real life&#xD;
      conditions, to elicit the reasons for treatment changes and to describe long-term outcomes&#xD;
      with participants initiated on triple therapy over a period of two years. This study will&#xD;
      also describe the temporal dynamics of treatment pattern and to unravel potentially complex&#xD;
      participant's journeys in different German regions and also to identify and follow-up a&#xD;
      variety of 'treatable traits' in COPD participants, which when modified may lead to improved&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;
