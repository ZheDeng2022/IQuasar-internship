      This prospective observational study will evaluate the performance of the DiLumen C2&#xD;
      Endolumenal Interventional Platform and its instruments. Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      at up to 5 clinical sites. Patient data will be collected before the procedure, during the&#xD;
      procedure, and up until the patient is discharged from the hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, post-market evaluation of the performance of the DiLumen C2&#xD;
      Endolumenal Interventional Platform (&quot;C2 device&quot;) used as an endoscopic dual balloon&#xD;
      accessory device used to ensure complete positioning, visualization, and diagnosis in&#xD;
      endoscopic treatments in the large intestine. The DiLumen Endolumenal Interventional Knife&#xD;
      (&quot;IK device&quot;) and the DiLumen Endolumenal Interventional Grasper (&quot;IG device&quot;) are disposable&#xD;
      instruments used with the C2 device. These devices are cleared by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for commercial use in endolumenal therapies and will be used on-label in&#xD;
      this study. The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the C2&#xD;
      device and its related instruments. Intra-procedure parameters (procedure timepoints,&#xD;
      anesthesia use, polyp location and description), final pathology/histology, and general&#xD;
      complications will also be evaluated. Investigators will also be asked to assess the ease of&#xD;
      use of the C2Interventional Platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish this goal, up to 100 subjects will be enrolled at up to 5 clinical sites and&#xD;
      treated using the C2 device and related instruments. Evaluations will be performed&#xD;
      pre-procedure, during the procedure, and at discharge. Assessments will include polyp&#xD;
      classification/pathology, procedure timepoints, final pathology/histology, adverse events,&#xD;
      and ease of use. As per the FDA cleared product labeling this study will be limited to&#xD;
      subjects undergoing an endoscopic procedure to remove polyps in the large intestine.&#xD;

        The subject population includes adults (ages 18-85 years) men and women scheduled to&#xD;
        undergo a colorectal ESD. Subjects will be recruited from the investigator's standard&#xD;
        patient population as seen in their routine clinical practice and will be screened for&#xD;
        participation according to the protocol defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
