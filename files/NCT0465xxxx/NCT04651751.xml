  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The limitations of applying social cognitive models to understand physical activity (PA) have&#xD;
      led to the emergence of several new PA models within the past decade. The Multi-Process&#xD;
      Action Control (M-PAC) is a comprehensive PA model that proposes intention is established&#xD;
      from outcome expectations, perceived capability, and opportunity, then the success of&#xD;
      translating this to behavior depends on affective judgments and behavioral-regulation. Over&#xD;
      time, M-PAC proposes that behavior is can become maintained through the formation of identity&#xD;
      and habit. The purpose of this study was to investigate the trajectory of change of these&#xD;
      M-PAC constructs across time in a randomized controlled trial. Participants (n=85) were&#xD;
      inactive new gym members and were randomized into a control (n=41) or intervention (n=44)&#xD;
      group. The intervention group attended a workshop and received a booster phone call follow-up&#xD;
      at week four. Measures for both groups included accelerometry and M-PAC at baseline and eight&#xD;
      week follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>GT3X+ Actigraph Activity Monitors (for measuring physical activity)</measure>

    <description>Participants wear accelerometers for one week at baseline and at week eight to record their physical activity.</description>

    <measure>1.Self-Report Behavioural Automaticity Index (self report, survey question</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week four, week eight</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Report Behavioral Automaticity Index (SRBAI) was used to assess preparatory habit. The SRBAI consists of 4 items on a 5-point Likert scale with 1 being strongly disagree to 5 being strongly agree. The question stem stated ''When I prepare to exerciseâ€¦'' which was then followed by four items on the scale: ''I do it without having to consciously remember'', ''I do it automatically'', ''I do it without thinking'', and ''I start before I realize I am doing it''.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Environmental Cues (self report, survey question)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week four, week eight</time_frame>
    <description>The following item was used to assess if participants implemented the use of cues: &quot;I use cues at home to remind me to exercise (e.g. placing a water bottle on my desk or gym clothes on the bed). The item was rated on a five point Likert scale which ranged from &quot;1=strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;5= strongly agree&quot;.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Temporal Consistency (self report, survey question)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week four, week eight</time_frame>
    <description>The item was worded &quot;How consistently do you exercise at the same time each day? (e.g., exercising every morning at 7 am, or exercising daily after supper)&quot;. The question was asked on a five point Likert scale which range from &quot;1=not consistent at all&quot; to &quot;5=very consistent&quot;.</description>

    <description>Those who were randomized into the intervention group attended a workshop where the PI delivered a presentation that focused on establishing a preparatory exercise habit by using the M-PAC approach and proposed habit model. Participants were then provided with instructions on completing their exercise plan sheet.</description>
