      By World Health Organization (WHO) definition overweight (body mass index (BMI) &gt;24.9) and&#xD;
      obesity (BMI &gt;29.9) are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation with many possible&#xD;
      impacts on individual's health. Association between obesity and associated metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      (obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 and dyslipidemia) and oral health has become&#xD;
      clear from several studies that proved increased odds of obese patients for developing of&#xD;
      caries-related pathologies and periodontal disease. Periodontal disease, a major cause of&#xD;
      tooth loss in adults, is an inflammatory disease of periodontal tissue that is initiated by&#xD;
      dental plaque bacteria and is modulated by the inflammatory-immune host response factors.&#xD;
      Relation between periodontal disease and obesity is bi-directional, through sharing of&#xD;
      several proposed local and systemic pathogenesis mechanisms. For treatment of obesity,&#xD;
      bariatric surgery (BS) procedures are methods of choice, when other less invasive options&#xD;
      fail. They are safe, cost-effective, improve overall health and increase life expectancy.&#xD;
      There are several types of BS interventions and most commonly performed BS is laparoscopic&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy and with second most often, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Studies on influence&#xD;
      of BS on periodontal health showed diverse results, with some showing no effect, while others&#xD;
      demonstrated an increase in the prevalence of periodontitis as well as a further&#xD;
      deterioration of periodontal tissues after BS procedure. However, studies on the prevalence&#xD;
      of gingivitis, a reversible plaque-induced inflammation of gingiva, and its progression to&#xD;
      periodontitis in BS patients is lacking. Furthermore, dental and periodontal status are not&#xD;
      routinely evaluated in patients before or after BS. To the best of our knowledge studies on&#xD;
      the effect of periodontal therapy before BS are lacking.&#xD;

      Obesity is becoming one of the mayor worldwide health problems due to increasing prevalence.&#xD;
      In the Slovenia 63.4% of population are overweight (24.99 kg/m² &lt; BMI &lt; 29.99 kg/m²) and&#xD;
      28.6% are obese (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m²). Obese patients have a predisposing factor of many chronic&#xD;
      diseases including periodontal disease (PD). PD is an inflammatory disease of tooth&#xD;
      supporting tissues that is initiated by dental plaque bacteria and modulated by the&#xD;
      inflammatory-immune host response factors. Some of the causes for periodontitis in obese&#xD;
      individuals are hyperinflammatory response, different fat metabolism and higher degree of&#xD;
      insulin resistance. On the other hand, periodontitis is thought to have a negative effect on&#xD;
      some obesity related comorbidities by rising systemic inflammation, increasing insulin&#xD;
      resistance, lipid profile and endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methods have been proposed for weight loss like dieting, physical exercise,&#xD;
      pharmacologic treatment and surgical intervention. Bariatric surgery (BS) has been shown to&#xD;
      be an effective weight loss strategy and is proposed as a frontline therapy for adult&#xD;
      patients with severe obesity. The outcomes of bariatric surgery show decreased levels of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory markers such as Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukine-6 (IL6)&#xD;
      and C-reactive protein (CRP) and therefore improvement of general inflammation status.&#xD;
      Research papers observing association between BS and PD mostly advocate worsening of&#xD;
      periodontal status and oral health as a complication of BS. Observational studies have shown&#xD;
      that obese patients undergoing BS procedures have a high prevalence of periodontal disease&#xD;
      and even though metabolic parameters are advancing to normal values after BS, inflammatory&#xD;
      response to plaque bacteria in the gingiva is increased, with possible additional destruction&#xD;
      of periodontal tissues. The reasons for high prevalence as well as deterioration after BS&#xD;
      procedure is not completely understood. To the best of our knowledge, there are no&#xD;
      interventional studies with non-surgical periodontal therapy that aim to lower PD progression&#xD;
      after BS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to investigate the influence of non-surgical periodontal therapy 1 month before BS&#xD;
      in patients diagnosed with periodontitis and gingivitis on the level of reduction in&#xD;
      local/systemic inflammatory and periodontal parameters. The second aim is to test whether&#xD;
      implemented periodontal therapy has some impact on metabolic parameters and comorbidities of&#xD;
      obesity after BS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be selected in a randomized, interventional, blinded (examiner),&#xD;
      prospective study, from 70 obese patients indicated for BS with criteria obesity class III&#xD;
      (ITM over 40 kg/m2) and class I and II with obesity if related disease are present: diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus type II, Hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnea, articular pain,&#xD;
      polycystic ovary syndrome. Patients will be recruited from Department of Abdominal Surgery,&#xD;
      University Medical Centre Ljubljana, were BS procedure will be performed, and pre- and&#xD;
      post-operative systemic and obesity related data will be collected. All relevant medical data&#xD;
      will be taken from the records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the oral health intervention will be held at the Department for Oral Diseases and&#xD;
      Periodontology, Dental Clinic, University Medical Centre Ljubljana. At the first visit&#xD;
      general health, socioeconomic, dental information will be recorded by a questionnaire before&#xD;
      surgical procedure. At the same time patients will undergo periodontal examination (number of&#xD;
      the teeth, prosthetic rehabilitation status, full mouth plaque score (FMPS), full mouth&#xD;
      bleeding score (FMBS), periodontal pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL),&#xD;
      bleeding on probing (BOP), recession, furcation involvement, teeth mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After oral examination, two study groups will be established (gingivitis n=30; and&#xD;
      periodontitis patients n=40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month before scheduled BS periodontal therapy will be performed in all patients regarding&#xD;
      their periodontal diagnosis (e.g. periodontitis or gingivitis) and previously predetermined&#xD;
      randomisation to (test and control group) All included patients will be properly instructed&#xD;
      and motivated for oral hygiene and fill out OHIP-14 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with gingivitis in the test group (n=15) will be treated with supragingival&#xD;
      debridement and with probiotic lozenges with strains of Lactobacillus brevis and&#xD;
      Lactobacillus plantarum once a day for 3 months and in the control group (n=15) by&#xD;
      low-intensive supragingival plaque removal, as a placebo treatment, and placebo probiotics&#xD;
      lozenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with periodontitis in the test group (n=20) will be treated by conventional&#xD;
      non-surgical root debridement and in the control group (n=20), as a placebo treatment, by&#xD;
      low-intensive supragingival plaque removal with mechanical brush and professional tooth paste&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
