  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urge urinary incontinence (UUI) is a common problem in older women, which vastly reduces&#xD;
      quality of life. UUI sufferers frequently report situational triggers (e.g. approaching the&#xD;
      front door) leading to urinary urgency and/or leakage, which can be caused by psychological&#xD;
      conditioning. This project will test the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of brief&#xD;
      mindfulness (MI) and non-invasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation;&#xD;
      tDCS) to reduce reactivity to personal urgency cues and attenuate symptoms of UUI. This is a&#xD;
      novel step towards providing personalized efficacious non-pharmacologic treatment for UUI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a highly prevalent, morbid and costly (up to $83&#xD;
      billion/year) disorder among older women, with up to 36% of those over 65 afflicted. One&#xD;
      commonly experienced phenomenon among those with UUI is conditioned bladder responses to&#xD;
      external triggers, often labeled &quot;situational incontinence.&quot; Situational incontinence is&#xD;
      described by sufferers as urinary urgency and leakage when confronted with specific&#xD;
      contextual triggers or cues, such as approaching the front/garage door 'latch-key&#xD;
      incontinence', and exposure to running water such as doing dishes. Generally ascribed to&#xD;
      'bladder spasms' (detrusor overactivity), studies have revealed that anywhere between 42% and&#xD;
      80% of women with UUI experience situationally provoked urgency, with approximately 26% of&#xD;
      those experiencing situationally triggered leakage. The researchers recent work has focused&#xD;
      on developing methods to recreate exposure to individuals' situational urgency cues, testing&#xD;
      the impact of &quot;urgency&quot; and &quot;safe&quot; cues on self-report urgency and actual leakage, and&#xD;
      finally assessing the role of bladder control mechanisms in the brain in response to these&#xD;
      personal situational cues. The researchers found that women with situational UUI experienced&#xD;
      increased urgency and leakage when exposed to personal &quot;urgency&quot; versus &quot;safe&quot; photographic&#xD;
      cues from their daily lives. Further, brain areas related to attentional and visuospatial&#xD;
      processing were activated during exposure to urge, but not safe, cues. Past studies of&#xD;
      urgency simulated by bladder filling, show that prefrontal cortex, a seat of executive&#xD;
      control, is activated to aid in controlling bladder activation. However, the study found that&#xD;
      the PFC was not recruited during exposure to visual cues among women with situational&#xD;
      urgency. Thus, the researchers propose that interventions capable of enhancing PFC activation&#xD;
      during exposure to urgency situations should enable women to gain executive control over cues&#xD;
      and result in less cue-provoked urgency and leakage, as well as overall UUI symptomatology.&#xD;
      Using these now well-tested methods to personalize stimuli with photographs of&#xD;
      urgency-provoking situational cues, the goal is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      compliance of these promising methods to attenuate urgency-related reactivity and reduce UUI&#xD;
      symptoms. These novel methods include: (1) Brief mindfulness (MI) focused on body scan and&#xD;
      acceptance language, (2) Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the&#xD;
      dorsolateral PFC, and (3) a combination of MI + tDCS. Sixty women with situational UUI will&#xD;
      be randomized into a 7-session study, with a mail-in follow up 1-week post-training. All&#xD;
      participants will undergo 4 urgency-cue exposure training sessions during which they will&#xD;
      engage in one of the three interventions, based on group. Changes in urgency will be assessed&#xD;
      via pre-post training differences in: Cue-reactivity to personal urge and safe cues, reaction&#xD;
      time to a urinary Stroop task, self-report severity of bladder problems, and UUI episodes and&#xD;
      urgency ratings on a daily bladder diary. Attenuating reactivity to situational urgency cues&#xD;
      will increase our ability to complement and enhance the efficacy of UUI therapy and reduce&#xD;
      symptom burden for its many sufferers.&#xD;
