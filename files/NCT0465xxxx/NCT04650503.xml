  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease affecting approximately 10% of the population, the&#xD;
      majority of patients with very mild to mild asthma. Asthma is characterized primarily by the&#xD;
      presence of symptoms clinical variables, reversible airway obstruction and airway&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness. Inflammation is a key factor in the pathophysiology of the disease.&#xD;
      Eosinophilic inflammation is the most common type. However, in the literature it is usually&#xD;
      associated with more severe and difficult to control asthma. Although mortality associated&#xD;
      with asthma has drastically decreased in recent years, several events still occur. Strangely&#xD;
      enough, these frequently affect mild asthmatics. Although there is still a misunderstanding&#xD;
      in relation to these events, the most recent practice guides have recommended an approach&#xD;
      based on the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in all, including mild asthmatics. This&#xD;
      change of therapeutic cap is still debated, but indicates a need for new studies in this&#xD;
      population. Recently, the investigators demonstrated that a subgroup of asthma patients with&#xD;
      mild asthma had a eosinophilia. The evolution of this subgroup without bronchial obstruction&#xD;
      or respiratory symptoms remains unknown. Indeed, it seems imperative to determine the fate of&#xD;
      these subjects in comparison with asthma mild non-eosinophilic since it could be a subgroup&#xD;
      at risk of poor outcome. The objective of this study will be to examine the course of asthma&#xD;
      in very mild to mild asthma patients who exhibit eosinophilic inflammation of the respiratory&#xD;
      tract compared to noneosinophilic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective observational, longitudinal study. Participants for whom a result&#xD;
      of induced sputum showing an eosinophil level greater than or equal to 3% was observed at&#xD;
      least 1 year ago will be contacted to participate in the study. They will be matched for age,&#xD;
      gender and duration of asthma to subjects without eosinophilia. These subjects will not be on&#xD;
      bronchial anti-inflammatory medication. They will have a complete evaluation including&#xD;
      respiratory function tests, a methacholine challenge and sputum induction. They will also&#xD;
      complete questionnaires on controlling their asthma and exacerbations.&#xD;
