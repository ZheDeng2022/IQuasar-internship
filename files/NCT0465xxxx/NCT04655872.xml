  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is objective to evaluate the in vivo absorption, excretion and biotransformation&#xD;
      pathways of [14C]-TPN171H in Chinese male healthy volunteers, and to reveal the overall&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of TPN171H in human body, so as to provide basis for rational&#xD;
      use of the drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, single-center study to evaluate the mass-balance and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of TPN171H in approximately 6 healthy male subjects receiving a single oral&#xD;
      10 mg dose of TPN171H containing approximately 100 microcuries of [14C]-TPN171H. Subjects&#xD;
      will be checked in to the research unit from approximately 24 hours prior to dosing and&#xD;
      remain in house until greater than 80% of the administered radioactivity is collected from&#xD;
      bodily excreta or until less than 1% of the administered radioactivity is recovered from&#xD;
      excreta in two consecutive time intervals, and blood sample radioactivity concentration at&#xD;
      two consecutive time points less than 3 times the plasma background value. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the main biotransformation and elimination pathways of TPN171H in the human body&#xD;
      and will seek to identify compound's major metabolites.&#xD;
