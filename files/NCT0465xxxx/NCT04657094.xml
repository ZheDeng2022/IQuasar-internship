      This phase II trial studies the effect of acalabrutinib in treating autoimmune hemolytic&#xD;
      anemia that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory)&#xD;
      in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the efficacy of acalabrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate acalabrutinib's ability to induce short term and sustained hemoglobin response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the toxicity of acalabrutinib. III. Evaluate efficacy of acalabrutinib in CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the effect of acalabrutinib on T-cell functionality in an autoimmune disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Treatment with acalabrutinib may be continued beyond 12 cycles for a maximum of 36&#xD;
      cycles if, in the opinion of the treating physician, the patient might benefit from ongoing&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and at least every 4&#xD;
      months for up to 12 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) - overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 cycles of therapy (each cycle is 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as proportion of patients who achieve complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). The probability of having AIHA-ORR at 6 cycles will be measured and reported with 95% exact confidence interval (CI). An exact binomial test against a null hypothesis of 30% rate will be performed at the 1-sided alpha of 0.05 to determine whether the AIHA-ORR rate at 6 cycles is disappointing or promising.</description>

    <measure>Autoimmune hemolytic anemia - overall response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 12 cycles of therapy (each cycle is 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as proportion of patients who achieve complete and partial response. The probability of having AIHA-ORR at 3 or 12 cycles will be measured and reported with 95% exact CI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion while receiving acalabrutinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>Will be defined as the number of PRBC transfusions from start of protocol treatment through end of treatment. The frequency of PRBC transfusion will be summarized by descriptive statistics. The difference between the average number of PRBC transfusion per month during protocol treatment versus the average number of PRBC transfusion at baseline (in the past 6 months before protocol treatment, if available) will be assessed by paired t-test.</description>

    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug until time of relapse, death, or end of follow-up, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>AIHA-specific RFS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods along with 95% CI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Autoimmune hemolytic anemia sustained response</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first documented AIHA CR/PR until death or relapse of AIHA, whichever is earlier, assessed up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>Will be estimated among patients who achieve AIHA CR/PR on protocol treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence and type of treatment-related toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence, type, severity, and attribution of toxicities on the study will be assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (non-hematologic) and International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2018 (hematologic). Toxicity events will be tabulated and summarized using descriptive statistics such as count and percentages, by severity, attribution, and system organ class.</description>

    <time_frame>After 6 or 12 cycles of therapy (each cycle is 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Will be defined as the proportion of patients achieving CLL CR/PR after 6 or 12 cycles respectively. Will be assessed and reported with 95% CI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia - specific event-free survival (EFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug until time of progression, death, start of new therapy, or end of follow-up, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate CLL-specific EFS, and the summary statistics (e.g., 12-month survival, median survival, 95% confidence intervals) will be provided.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

    <description>Will be estimated among patients who achieve CLL CR/PR on protocol treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate duration of CLL response, and the summary statistics (e.g., 12-month survival, median survival, 95% confidence intervals) will be provided. Duration of CLL response will be estimated only among responders (i.e. participants achieving CLL CR/PR at least once).</description>

    <time_frame>After 3, 6, and 12 cycles of therapy (each cycle is 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Flow cytometry will be used to assess T-cell repertoire and evaluate changes associated with acalabrutinib. The distribution of T-cell subtypes distribution will be described by mean, standard deviation, minimal, and maximal values. Comparison of group variables will be as assessed using a nonparametric test of independence (e.g., Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test).</description>
