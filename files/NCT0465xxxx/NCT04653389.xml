      This study aims to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of the perioperative&#xD;
      multidisciplinary therapy that combines the preoperative transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization(TACE) and the anti-programmed-death-1 antibody (anti-PD-1) Sintilimab&#xD;
      Injection with or without radiotherapy of vein tumor thrombus followed by postoperative&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 injection in the treatment of technically resectable hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      patients with vein thrombosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an insidious onset, high degree of invasion, and rapid&#xD;
      disease progression. Tumor cells can easily invade the intrahepatic vasculature, especially&#xD;
      the portal vein or hepatic venous system, and form portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) or&#xD;
      hepatic vein tumor thrombus (HVTT).PVTT/HVTT is one of the main adverse factors for the&#xD;
      long-term survival of HCC. The location and scope of its occurrence are closely related to&#xD;
      the prognosis, and it is also a main hindrance to the improvement of the overall curative&#xD;
      effect of HCC in recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the treatment of HCC converts to multi-disciplinary therapy, the neoadjuvant therapy will&#xD;
      be commonly used in the treatment of HCC with PVTT.Early clinical data already support a safe&#xD;
      combination of immune checkpoint inhibition with TACE. Moreover，The preliminary results of&#xD;
      our previous trial (CISLD-5) showed that TACE combined with anti-programmed-death-1 antibody&#xD;
      in patients with BCLC stage A/B HCC beyond Milan criteria has a significant effect.In&#xD;
      addition, radiation therapy (RT) can irradiate both the tumor thrombus and the primary tumor&#xD;
      .In numbers of retrospective studies, preoperative radiotherapy can achieve radical resection&#xD;
      in some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to analyze the safety and efficacy of preoperative TACE and anti-PD-1 Injection&#xD;
      combined with or without preoperative radiotherapy of vein tumor thrombus and postoperative&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 injection in the treatment of technically resectable hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      patients with vein thrombosis.&#xD;
