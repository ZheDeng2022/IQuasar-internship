  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular (CV) diseases are the most frequent type 1 diabetes (T1D) complications. A&#xD;
      recent epidemiological study showed that patients with T1D have a two-fold CV mortality risk,&#xD;
      even in case of good glycemic control. In addition, it has been shown that patients with T1D&#xD;
      with no traditional CV risk factors had about a 80% higher risk of cardiovascular event&#xD;
      compared to non-diabetic individuals. This indicates that further modifiable risk factors in&#xD;
      relation to CV mortality remain to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the candidates that could help to disentangle the factors associated with the&#xD;
      increased CV mortality in T1D patients is glycemic variability which could contribute to&#xD;
      diabetes complications. Indeed, severe hypoglycaemia, one of the most severe consequence of&#xD;
      glycaemic variability, are associated with a higher mortality in patients with type 1 and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the relation between glycemic variability, insulin therapy modalities&#xD;
      and CV risk as well as some other questions related to health determinants of T1D, we are&#xD;
      building up a large observational, prospective, multi-centric cohort study of patients&#xD;
      gathering 15,000 patients with T1D, age above 6 years old, to perform the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collecting clinical information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating Glycemic variability (assessed by the coefficient of variation of glucose&#xD;
           (CV) calculated from automatically downloaded continuous glucose monitoring data (CGM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biobanking including plasma, DNA, urine, saliva and hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collecting patients' reported outcomes through auto-questionnaires (online&#xD;
           questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doing an active follow-up for a period of 30 years with an intermediate visit every 3&#xD;
           years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to link the data to national Health data system (Système National de Données de&#xD;
      Santé, SNDS) in order to exhaustively collect health events as death, CV events and&#xD;
      hospitalizations (including severe hypoglycemia).&#xD;

      1. STUDY DESIGN &amp; TIMELINE&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Study design The SFDT1 is an real-life non-randomized multicentric prospective study&#xD;
           with limited intervention (biobanking, patient questionnaires during visits, and a&#xD;
           direct-to-patient electronic follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Timeline Participants will be actively followed-up for 30 years, with both clinical&#xD;
           visits every 3 years and a regular online follow-up in-between visits through the e-PRO.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion period: 3 years Duration of participation for each patient: active follow-up&#xD;
           for 30 years Total duration of the study: 33 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SITES' PROFILE The minimum of 57 (34 for adults and 23 for children) expected recruiting&#xD;
           sites are divided into three categories including university hospital centres, general&#xD;
           hospital centres, and private diabetologist offices linked to hospital centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SAMPLE SIZE The sample size calculation was performed based on our primary objective&#xD;
           which is to identify new risk factors of MACE, beyond the traditional risk factors. The&#xD;
           investigators based our calculation on a dichotomous outcome (MACE yes/no) with a design&#xD;
           of an independent prospective cohort. The investigators expect the new risk factors to&#xD;
           be associated with CV risk with a low to moderate magnitude, with relative risk between&#xD;
           1.10 and 1.50. Based on our most extreme assumption (RR=1.10) and with an overall&#xD;
           probability of MACE events set to 0.25 (Circulation 135 , 1522-1531, 2017) for the&#xD;
           unexposed group during the 30 year follow-up, a power set to 80%, an α risk of 5%, and&#xD;
           the exposed group considered as the extreme quintile group of the exposure of interest&#xD;
           (glycaemic variability for instance), the required minimal number of patients is 15080.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators finally decided to target the inclusion of 15000 patients with T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDIED POPULATION 4.1 Inclusion Criteria Adults and children (age &gt;= 6 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Type 1 diabetes, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Age at diagnosis of diabetes &gt; 1 year and &lt;= 35 years Insulin treatment initiated within&#xD;
           the first 12 months following diabetes discovery Affiliation to the French social&#xD;
           security scheme (RIPH-2 constraint) Ability to speak and read French Ability to give&#xD;
           written informed consent 4.2 Non-inclusion Criteria Patient under guardianship or&#xD;
           protection for vulnerable people&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. BIAS 5.1 Investigator selection bias All diabetology care centers will be informed by&#xD;
           the SFD channels (newsletter, conference, etc.) in order to limit selection bias. Any&#xD;
           center can propose to join the study and its application will be evaluated upon its&#xD;
           clinical research quality standards, track records and this study's inclusion and&#xD;
           logistic (biobank) capacity. The objective is to include patients treated in&#xD;
           universities and non university public and private centers; as well as in private&#xD;
           practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this study, the investigators will not include the minority of patients with T1D only&#xD;
           followed by their general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Patient selection bias In the centers, all patients fulfilling the inclusion and non&#xD;
           inclusion criteria will be proposed to participate to SFDT1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Some parts of the study (e-PRO, CGM device data, Biobank, genetic analyses) will be&#xD;
           optional according to the choices of the patients, inducing bias. For example, the&#xD;
           oldest patients or the ones with a lower digital literacy or without digital support&#xD;
           will less frequently participate to e-PRO. Therefore, confounding factors, including age&#xD;
           and socioeconomic factors, will be taken into consideration to interpret the results of&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 Information bias Direct-to-patient data forms are self-reported by patients.&#xD;
           Therefore, their medical accuracy and quality could be lower than those provided only by&#xD;
           physicians. On the other hand, this methodology based on PROs not only allows to access&#xD;
           richer information (QoL, etc.), compared to methodologies usually reported in clinical&#xD;
           trials, but also at a higher frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CGM devices are not used by all patients. Consequently, glucose level real-time&#xD;
           monitoring will be missing for some patients. The investigators consider this choice as&#xD;
           to be the closest as possible of real-life conditions. On the other hand, the&#xD;
           investigators are technically ready to manage other data formats uploaded by&#xD;
           investigators from new monitoring devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. BENEFITS / RISKS Since the proposed study will be observational-like, no extra visit&#xD;
           will be required and no additional data will be requested beyond the ones that are&#xD;
           supposed to be collected in usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Benefits The participating patients will be clearly informed that they will not benefit&#xD;
      directly but will contribute to a research effort that could make an impact on T1D care in&#xD;
      the following years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Risks Patients will be followed in routine care. They will not run any interventional&#xD;
      action beyond the biobank samples collection. However, this act is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the project being sponsored by a non profit organisation, requiring and managing a&#xD;
      consequent amount of data, on a long term, it has been designed in a privacy-by-design&#xD;
      perspective with strong data securities with the support of a specialised partner (SANOÏA),&#xD;
      as to bring the highest privacy and personal data security to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed of their rights according to GDPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      burden of the disease: Delivering monthly or even quarterly questions and/or validated forms&#xD;
      to patients during a significant number of years could increase the perceived and&#xD;
      psychological burden of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To manage this risk some actions are engaged: the patients' forms are actively sourced, tuned&#xD;
      and tested during study conception with patients' associations involved; the patients&#xD;
      actively confirm their participation to the e-PRO platform; the patients can switch off the&#xD;
      invitation service that reminds them by email / SMS that he has forms to fill; the patients&#xD;
      can revoke their participation to the study whenever they want to;&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY CONDUCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SITES&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Sites Recruitment Prior to the start of the study, the investigators plan to contact&#xD;
           all kinds of French diabetes point-of-care centers by email or mail to offer to join the&#xD;
           study with the support of the French-speaking society of Diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators aim to include at least 70 sites. 1.2 Sites Activation This initiation&#xD;
           will include a detailed review (20 minutes) of the protocol and study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each site will receive the investigator study file, which contains all regulatory&#xD;
           documents, by post before the initiation visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study site initiations will be performed on site. Three centers initiation visits&#xD;
           will be analysed during internal project meetings. Any adaptations in terms of content&#xD;
           presented during the initiation visits will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following initiation, each center will be contacted by phone to follow-up on patient's&#xD;
           recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each biobank capable center will receive SOPs and adequate tubes for biological sampling&#xD;
           from patients for the biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators of each site will be informed on the expected way of using CGM device&#xD;
           web portals in the perspective of getting harmonised data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PATIENTS INFORMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients (or caregivers for children) matching the inclusion criteria and not&#xD;
           matching exclusion criteria are invited to participate during the inclusion period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator will give the patient a &quot;patient information sheet&quot; and obtain the&#xD;
           patient's agreement through a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PATIENTS ENROLLMENT MODALITIES 3.1 Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
           To guarantee for a smooth study execution and patient motivation, it is critical that&#xD;
           the minimal set of information required to include a patient and activate its e-PRO&#xD;
           portal be input in a timely manner by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Also, the investigators will separate the inclusion related data (&quot;flash inclusion&quot;) and&#xD;
           the baseline visit related data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The &quot;flash inclusion&quot; required data are: date of inclusion, age, gender, year of disease&#xD;
           onset, name + e-mail adress + mobile number, Once this flash inclusion done, the&#xD;
           platform: generates the Anonymous Patient_ID that will have to be reported in the&#xD;
           &quot;corresponding&quot; table staying in the site in the format according to their practices;&#xD;
           activates the e-PRO participation funnel, Some sites might prefer to use a &quot;buffer&quot; form&#xD;
           in paper format. In this case they commit to fill the data online in less than 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Baseline visit Clinical examination The routine standardised set of physical&#xD;
           measurements of the patient will be collected and recorded in a case report form from&#xD;
           trained staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CGM device web portal Investigators will check the appropriate data-sharing activation&#xD;
           with their enrolled patients' CGM device web portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Face to face questionnaires In addition to usual clinical examination, investigators or&#xD;
           clinical research associates (CRAs) will use validated questionnaires or parts of them&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.3.3 Biobank sample collection Once a participant is enrolled and has given his or her&#xD;
           consent, a biological sample collection is set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Trained staff will withdraw different biological samples (serum, plasma, hair, urine,&#xD;
           saliva) from each participant. In children, the amount of blood collected will be&#xD;
           adjusted to the patient's body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.4 Participation to the e-PRO Investigators will collect email and mobile phone number&#xD;
           of recruited patients. This information will be automatically and safely stored in a&#xD;
           separate database and this will allow a robot to contact the patient to send&#xD;
           &quot;invitations&quot; to fill their PRO forms online.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A few minutes after inclusion, patients will receive an email with a unique URL. By&#xD;
           clicking on this link, they will be asked to input a secure code (OTP) received on their&#xD;
           mobile phone. By processing to this 2-channel authentication the investigators assure&#xD;
           the patients' effective identity. At this step the patients define their own password to&#xD;
           access to the e-PRO.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If this procedure is not completed the patient will receive 3 reminders by email and&#xD;
           SMS. In the absence of any validation within 2 weeks, the patient will be tagged as &quot;not&#xD;
           participant&quot; to the e-PRO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PATIENT FOLLOW-UP MODALITIES&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Visits in Site&#xD;
&#xD;
           Routine visits will be proposed every three years (±0.5 years) during 30 years during&#xD;
           the active follow-up of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each visit is made of: Clinical examination and usual care visit data (i.e.: CGM data&#xD;
           retrieved if patient has a CGM or laboratory results), Face to face questionnaires,&#xD;
           Biological analysis (biobank) if specifically consented, with an additional specific&#xD;
           consent for genetic analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Between visits, in a direct-to-patient way When the patient actively consents with&#xD;
           the confirmation funnel described in 6.3.4 then he receives regular invitations to fill&#xD;
           his online forms. An &quot;invitation&quot; is a digital message (SMS and email) to invite the&#xD;
           patient to fill his or her online form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These data are around the following dimensions: sex life, life with the disease,&#xD;
           treatment burden, QoL, nutrition, sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. END OF STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection will end at the last follow-up visit of the last patient included, which&#xD;
           should theoretically be after 33 years after the first included patient. The database&#xD;
           will then be cleaned and frozen to initiate the final analysis phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. BIOBANK Collection of blood, saliva, hair and urine will be attempted for each&#xD;
           participant at baseline. Availability of these samples will be indicated in the e-CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Blood Total amount of blood: 25 ml (below 2.5% of total blood volume) are collected in&#xD;
      various preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children, the amount of blood collected will be adjusted to the patients' body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not preferable to use heparin as an anticoagulant, as heparin may interfere with&#xD;
      subsequent amplification of DNA by PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Urine One 5 ml tube will be collected and stored at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Saliva Saliva sample is stable at ambient temperature but will be stored at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Hair Hair will be used for research of drug exposure and toxin impregnation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.5 Storage All collected samples will be stored following regulatory conservation conditions&#xD;
      (-80°C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6 Circuit&#xD;
&#xD;
      UHC and GHC will collect the full complement of biological samples and will store them in&#xD;
      regulatory conditions before sending them to the central laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular shipments (every 6 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. at Centre de Ressources Biologiques (CRB) Hôpital Bichat&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. sending a sample to the laboratory of Lille for DNA extraction (genetic analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6.7 Genetic analyses For participants (and caregivers for paediatric patients) who&#xD;
      consented to do genetic analyses, DNA extraction will be done from blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of genetic analysis : DNA microarrays will be realised. Several types of&#xD;
      analysis may be considered depending on the phenotype of interest and will be studied in the&#xD;
      cohort. Lately, the strategy of &quot;genome-wide polygenic score&quot; showed its power to cluster&#xD;
      groups of patients. Moreover, the investigators can also consider rare genetic variants&#xD;
      studies by exome or whole genome sequencing.&#xD;

      We will look for an association between CV events and inflammation, oxidative stress markers&#xD;
      in urine, saliva or plasma. At the end of the research, the samples can be used for&#xD;
      subsequent analyses not foreseen in the original protocol that may be interesting in the&#xD;
      context of the pathology according to the evolution of scientific knowledge, provided that&#xD;
      the patient is not opposed, as indicated in the information / consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hair will be used for research of drug exposure and toxin impregnation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After DNA samples extraction, genetic association analyses will be performed. DNA microarrays&#xD;
      will be realised. Several types of analysis may be considered depending on the phenotype of&#xD;
      interest and will be studied in the cohort . Lately, the strategy of &quot;genome-wide polygenic&#xD;
      score&quot; showed its power to cluster groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, we can also consider rare genetic variants studies by exome or whole genome&#xD;
      sequencing.&#xD;
