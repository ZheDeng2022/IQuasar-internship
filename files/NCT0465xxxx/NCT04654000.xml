  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to set up a prospective randomized controlled trial to control the security and&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of adjuvant treatment by rheopheresis in necrotizing-ulcered&#xD;
      calciphylaxis in the hemodialysis population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Calciphylaxis, also known as uremic calcifying arteriolopathy (UCA), is a rare disease that&#xD;
      causes painful ischemic skin lesions due to microvascular calcification and thrombosis of the&#xD;
      dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are the&#xD;
      main target for calciphylaxis. Rheopheresis is a therapeutic apheresis to treat&#xD;
      microcirculatory disorders. This double filtration plasmapheresis eliminates a defined&#xD;
      spectrum of high molecular weight proteins from human plasma including relevant factors for&#xD;
      vascular inflammation and thrombose. We propose a prospective randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      compared the efficacy of rheopheresis as adjuvant treatment to the standard of care compared&#xD;
      to standard care with Sham-apheresis.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients with complete wound healing of the calciphylaxis-mediated ischemic lesions after 12 weeks of rheopheresis treatment (a total of 17 sessions).</measure>
    <time_frame>at 12 weeks of treatement</time_frame>
    <description>Complete wound healing is defined as the absence of livedoid peri-lesional inflammation with presence of granulation tissue (stage 3 healing process) and/or epithelization (stage 4) over the entire ulcer surface of calciphylactic lesions. The healing of the lesions will be illustrated with a photographic support. And the pictures will be examined a second time in a centralized and blind way by two referring dermatologists.&#xD;
In case of multiple calciphylaxis skin lesions, monitoring and evaluation will be done on the largest lesion at the time of patient's inclusion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patient with partial wound healing of the calciphylaxis mediated lesions after rheopheresis treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks and 12 weeks of rheopheresis treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The partial healing is defined by a partial reepithelialization (validated if 3 of following 4 criteria are present: 1-absence of necrosis; 2- granulation; 3 less inflammatory bordering 4- 20% decrease of the lesion size). The evolution of the size of the lesions and the partial healing of the wound will be illustrated by a photographic support.</description>

    <measure>Evolution of the self-reporting pain using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline (V0) to 12 weeks of rheopheresis (V2)</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) describes the pain intensity at 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Evolution of the level of antalgic consumed according to World Health Organisation (WHO) classification</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline (V0) to 12 weeks of rheopheresis (V2)</time_frame>
    <description>The level of consumed antalgic is defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification&#xD;
Level I analgesics = peripheral analgesics or not morphine have the lowest analgesic power&#xD;
Level II analgesics = weak morphine.&#xD;
Level III analgesics = strong morphine agonists and antagonists.</description>

    <description>The Wound-QoL measures the disease-specific, health-related quality of life of patients with chronic wounds. It consists of 17 items on impairments which are always assessed in retrospect to the preceding seven days.</description>
