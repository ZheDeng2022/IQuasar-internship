  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-cohort, multi-center Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of MGD013 in ① Cohort 1: patients with unresectable, recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma who have failed prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy; ② Cohort 2:&#xD;
      patients with untreated, unresectable recurrent or metastatic, mucosal or acral lentiginous&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted in two parts for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Part I: Safety evaluation&#xD;
      and efficacy exploration for MGD013. Part II: Efficacy expansion based on results from Part I&#xD;
      to further evaluate the efficacy effect of MGD013.&#xD;
