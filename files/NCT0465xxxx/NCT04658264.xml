      Diabetes is a chronic disorder of metabolism characterized by hyperglycemia, defect in&#xD;
      Insulin secretion, defection in Insulin action or both, which has a high potential for&#xD;
      serious complications with high mortality and morbidity, if poorly treated. Outcome improves&#xD;
      with better control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a very common disorder with current global prevalence of 425 million and the latest&#xD;
      diabetes survey of Pakistan in 2017-18 shows a prevalence of 26 % in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle intervention especially nutritional modification was the earliest intervention&#xD;
      tried and still relevant. Strict Diet plans are difficult to follow; hence a functional Food&#xD;
      based intervention is more likely to be acceptable. Various functional foods have been tried&#xD;
      in diabetes but beta glucan , a soluble fiber found in barley has been widely tested and&#xD;
      found to be effective not only in controlling glycemia, but also in improvement of&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, blood pressure and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been planned with the objectives of formulating a composite flour based on&#xD;
      wheat and barley, which is palatable, economical and can be used instead of wheat flour in&#xD;
      the routine diet of people with diabetes.Xanthan Gum shall be added to compensate for the&#xD;
      gluten loss. Various ratios of the flour shall be tested for sensory qualities, rheology, and&#xD;
      glycemic index, and beta glucan content, and an acceptable flour with best attributes shall&#xD;
      be further evaluated through proximate analysis and finally tested in a randomized in an open&#xD;
      label randomized controlled clinical trial in real patients at Akhuwat Medical Center which&#xD;
      is a charity facility.The sample size for a power of 90 has been calculated to be 31 and&#xD;
      adding for dropouts , rounded up to 35 for each group. 70 Adult non pregnant Type 2 Diabetics&#xD;
      above the age of 25, with no serious comorbidity shall be recruited and randomized through&#xD;
      computer generated random number table. One group shall receive the 2 kg of composite flour&#xD;
      every week for 3 months in addition to usual treatment while the con troll group shall&#xD;
      receive only the usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMI, HbA1C, Creatinine, fasting lipid profile and ALT shall be measured at the start and end&#xD;
      of the study, while ,Fasting and post meal sugars, BP, appetite, satiety, and compliance&#xD;
      shall be measured every week. The data shall be processed in SPSS 23 This study is expected&#xD;

      Background: Diabetes is a chronic disorder of metabolism characterized by hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      defect in Insulin secretion, defect in Insulin action or both, which has a high potential for&#xD;
      serious complications with high mortality and morbidity, if poorly treated. Outcome improves&#xD;
      with better control. It is a very common disorder with current global prevalence of 425&#xD;
      million and the latest diabetes survey of Pakistan in 2017-18 shows a prevalence of 26 % in&#xD;
      adults. Lifestyle intervention especially nutritional modification was the earliest&#xD;
      intervention tried and still relevant. Strict Diet plans are difficult to follow; hence a&#xD;
      functional food based intervention is more likely to be acceptable. Various functional foods&#xD;
      have been tried in diabetes but beta glucan, a soluble fiber found in barley has been widely&#xD;
      tested and found to be effective not only in controlling glycemia, but also in improvement of&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, blood pressure and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Wheat-barley composite flour replaced with wheat in the diet of diabetics will&#xD;
      improve their glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The study shall be conducted in two phases. In phase-1, a wheat barley composite&#xD;
      flour shall be developed. Four preparations of the flour shall be developed consisting of&#xD;
      pure full grain wheat flour, and three combinations of wheat and barley (W:B) in the ratio of&#xD;
      70:30, 65:35 and 60:40 shall be prepared. Food grade xanthan gum shall be added; 0.5 grams&#xD;
      each to all the three wheat barley composites in order to compensate for the gluten loss. All&#xD;
      the four flours shall be tested for sensory qualities, rheology, glycemic index, and beta&#xD;
      glucan content, and an acceptable composite flour with best attributes shall be further&#xD;
      evaluated through proximate analysis. This chosen composite shall be tested in phase-2, in a&#xD;
      randomized open label randomized controlled clinical trial in real patients at Akhuwat&#xD;
      Medical Center which is a charity facility. The sample size for a power of 90 has been&#xD;
      calculated to be 31 and adding for dropouts, rounded up to 35 for each group. 70 Adult non&#xD;
      pregnant Type 2 Diabetics above the age of 25, with no serious comorbidity shall be recruited&#xD;
      and randomized through computer generated random number table. One group shall receive the 2&#xD;
      kg of composite flour every week for 3 months in addition to usual treatment while the&#xD;
      control group shall receive only the usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: BMI, HbA1C, Creatinine, fasting lipid profile and ALT shall be measured at&#xD;
      the start and end of the study, while, Fasting and post meal sugars, blood pressure,&#xD;
      appetite, satiety, and compliance shall be measured every week. Change in HbA1C from baseline&#xD;
      to end of study will be our primary outcome while changes all the other parameters will be&#xD;
      our secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The data shall be processed in SPSS 23. HbA1C, BMI, Lipid profile,&#xD;
      creatinine and ALT shall be for analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and weakly changes in Fasting&#xD;
      and post meal sugars, blood pressure, appetite, satiety and compliance shall be evaluated&#xD;
      through factorial analysis to assess the effect of composite flour over time. Both analyses&#xD;
      shall be conducted with a Significance Level at P - value &lt; 0.05 for all the parameters&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: This study is expected to show a significant improvement in glycemic&#xD;
      control with a possible benefit in BP, satiety, weight and lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is a very common chronic disorder across the globe including Pakistan. Poor control&#xD;
      of this disease can lead to serious and fatal acute as well as chronic complications.&#xD;
      Management of diabetes is however difficult and cumbersome, especially in the sense that it&#xD;
      involves continued lifestyle modifications, including dietary constraints and restraints. It&#xD;
      would be ideal for people with diabetes to have one such food in their diet, which can manage&#xD;
      their diabetes and relieves them of all the bother to manage their every single meal for&#xD;
      maintaining a reasonable glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This ideal though seems very far at this moment, functional foods and nutraceuticals are a&#xD;
      fair step in this direction. Barley due to its high content of the soluble fiber beta glucan&#xD;
      has been shown to help glycemic control, but barley does not make good dough, while isolated&#xD;
      beta glucan is very expensive to be used in every day diet of the common man.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Present study is designed with the objective of formulating a nutritionally efficient&#xD;
      wheat barley composite flour, which is not only palatable and economical but can replace the&#xD;
      wheat flour chapattis in the diet of people with t ype-2 diabetes and will improve their&#xD;
      glycemic control simply by this substitution. This effect shall be substantiated through a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wheat-barley composite flour replaced with wheat in the diet of diabetics will improve their&#xD;
      glycemic control&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS This Study will be conducted in two phases&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Product development and Nutrient Profiling,&#xD;
&#xD;
