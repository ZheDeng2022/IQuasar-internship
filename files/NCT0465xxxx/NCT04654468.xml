    <description>Participants will receive a loading series of crovalimab comprised of an intravenous (IV) dose on Day 1, followed by weekly crovalimab subcutaneous (SC) doses for 4 weeks on Week 1 Day 2, then on Weeks 2, 3, and 4. Maintenance SC dosing will begin at Week 5 and will continue Q4W (every 4 weeks) thereafter for a total of 24 weeks of study treatment. After 24 weeks of crovalimab treatment, participants who derive benefit from the drug may continue to receive crovalimab.</description>

    <description>Crovalimab will be administered at a dose of 1000 mg IV (for participants with body weight between 40 and 100kg) or 1500 mg IV (for participants with body weight &gt;=100kg) on Week 1 Day 1. On Week 1 Day 2 and on Weeks 2, 3 and 4, it will be administered at a dose of 340 mg SC. For Week 5 and Q4W thereafter, it will be administered at a dose of 680 mg SC (for participants with body weight between 40 and 100kg) or 1020 mg SC (for participants with body weight &gt;=100kg).
