  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work in our group has revealed that short-term (7-day) administration of antidepressants&#xD;
      produces positive biases in the processing of emotional information in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Such effect might be an important neuropsychological mechanism of antidepressant action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will investigate the effect of seven-day administration of simvastatin 20mg&#xD;
      on emotional and reward processing tasks in healthy volunteers. There is evidence that&#xD;
      statins may exert antidepressant effects via anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant pathways, and&#xD;
      it is therefore predicted that simvastatin will have positive effects on emotional and reward&#xD;
      processing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common and associated with considerable health disability (Kassebaum-2016).&#xD;
      Traditional antidepressants mainly work by modulating monoamine levels in the synaptic cleft&#xD;
      (Harmer-2017); however, the evidence that depression is caused by impaired serotonin or&#xD;
      noradrenaline activity is weak and inconsistent (Cowen-2015), and indeed current&#xD;
      antidepressant strategies remain burdened by partial efficacy, poor side-effects profile, and&#xD;
      a slow onset of therapeutic action (Penn-2012). Therefore, there is a pressing need to&#xD;
      develop antidepressant medications with novel non-monoaminergic mechanisms of action&#xD;
      (Jha-2018) - or, conversely, to identify alternative pathophysiological pathways leading to&#xD;
      depression that can be targeted with new drugs. Intriguingly, there is growing evidence that&#xD;
      both peripheral and central inflammation play a role in the pathophysiology of depression&#xD;
      (Miller-2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with depression consistently show negative biases in emotional processing, which are&#xD;
      believed to play a key role in the aetiology and maintenance of their clinical symptoms&#xD;
      (Roiser-2013). Overall, robust evidence suggests that early changes in emotional processing&#xD;
      can serve as valid surrogate markers of antidepressant efficacy (Harmer-2017); for example,&#xD;
      seven days' treatment with selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
      (citalopram and reboxetine respectively) compared to placebo decreases the recognition of&#xD;
      negative facial expressions and recall of negative versus positive stimuli in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers (Harmer-2004). Conversely, another study using the pro-inflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      interferon-α showed that inflammatory-mediated depression can be associated with an increased&#xD;
      recognition of negative facial expressions (Cooper-2017). Furthermore, depression associated&#xD;
      with inflammation is characterised by significant symptoms of anhedonia (Miller-2017), which&#xD;
      has been linked to diminished neural responses to reward anticipation (Felger-2017). Such&#xD;
      reward-deficit is particularly refractory to conventional serotoninergic and noradrenergic&#xD;
      antidepressants (McCabe-201), and even the antidepressant bupropion (a noradrenaline and&#xD;
      dopamine reuptake inhibitor), whilst inducing positive changes in emotional processing,&#xD;
      appears not to improve reward processing (Walsh-2018). However, the reversal of this deficit&#xD;
      in reward processing is still considered as a valuable marker of target engagement for&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs in depression, as a more sensitive outcome measure than traditional&#xD;
      rating scales designed to capture the global clinical symptomatology (Miller-2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins are recommended and have&#xD;
      been widely used since the '80s for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases (NICE 2014). It is now established that these medications have significant&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects that are independent from their lipid-lowering properties&#xD;
      (Jain-2005), as well as appearing early in treatment only after seven day of administration&#xD;
      (Macin-2011). Statins are considered extremely safe drugs: their more common side-effect are&#xD;
      muscle pain or weakness (usually mild and quickly responding to stopping or switching&#xD;
      medication) and elevation of liver transaminases (significant only in case of pre-existing&#xD;
      hepatic disease), whereas more serious adverse events include rhabdomyolysis (very rare but&#xD;
      severe myopathy associated with elevated creatine kinase and myoglobinuria), new-onset&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (in predisposed individual with pre-existing hyperglycaemia), and&#xD;
      haemorrhagic stroke (in patients with prior haemorrhagic stroke or lacunar infarct); however,&#xD;
      clinical trials have ultimately concluded that such adverse events attributed to statin&#xD;
      therapy in routine practice are not actually caused by it (Collins-2016). Other common (≥&#xD;
      1/100, &lt; 1/10) but usually mild side-effects include: nasopharyngitis, pharyngo-laryngeal&#xD;
      pain, epistaxis, headache, and gastrointestinal disturbances (constipation, diarrhoea,&#xD;
      flatulence, dyspepsia, nausea). Importantly, a potential antidepressant effect for statins&#xD;
      has been confirmed in animals (Kilic-2012), as well as clinically in observational&#xD;
      (Parsaik-2014) and interventional studies (Salagre-2016). Although their anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      and anti-oxidant properties have been proposed, the precise mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      antidepressant effects of statins remain unclear, therefore further translational studies&#xD;
      have been advocated in order to elucidate this aspect (Köhler-Forsberg-2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this exploratory study, we will investigate the effect of seven-day administration of&#xD;
      simvastatin 20mg once daily compared to placebo on emotional and reward processing tasks in&#xD;
      50 healthy volunteers. In view of the previous evidence that statins may exert antidepressant&#xD;
      effects via anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant pathways, we predict that simvastatin will&#xD;
      have positive effect on emotional and reward processing.&#xD;
