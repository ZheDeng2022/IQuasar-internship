  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to determine the pharmacological and biochemical association between ribociclib&#xD;
      exposure and CYP3A variants in African American/Blacks and Non-Hispanic White patients. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that patients treated with ribociclib who are CYP3A5 poor&#xD;
      metabolizers may be exposed to higher levels of ribociclib than CYP3A5 intermediate or normal&#xD;
      metabolizers. The findings could allow clinicians to tailor treatments to maintain&#xD;
      therapeutic doses while limiting toxicities.&#xD;

      This prospective, multicenter, cohort study will assess ribociclib (600 mg PO daily)&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics in female patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer. This design will be used for two independent, race-based cohorts: 18 African&#xD;
      American/Black patients and 18 Non-Hispanic White patients. Women are eligible if they are&#xD;
      older than 18, have HR+/HER2- mBC and are candidates for treatment with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor&#xD;
      and endocrine therapy. Patients are ineligible if currently prescribed a medication that&#xD;
      inhibits or induces the CYP3A isoenzymes, have baseline electrocardiogram abnormalities, or&#xD;
      are otherwise considered to be ineligible for ribociclib. Participants will provide serial&#xD;
      blood samples during the first cycle (collected immediately prior to the ribociclib dose, and&#xD;
      0.5hr ± 5min, 1hr ± 5min, 2hr ± 15min, 4hr ± 15min, 6hr ± 15min after the daily dose of&#xD;
      ribociclib). Plasma samples will be analyzed via mass spectrometry to characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (e.g., AUC0-24, Cmax). Pharmacogenetic testing will be performed using the&#xD;
      PharmacoScanTM microarray, which tests 4,627 markers in 1,191 genes, including variants in&#xD;
      CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.&#xD;

             discontinued 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Concomitant medications, herbal supplements, and/or fruits that are strong&#xD;
                  inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Medications that have a narrow therapeutic window and are predominantly&#xD;
                  metabolized through CYP3A4/5&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Chronic dosing of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and prednisone is known&#xD;
                  to lead to induction of CYP3A enzymes, thereby potentially reducing ribociclib&#xD;
                  drug exposure to sub-therapeutic levels. Systemic corticosteroid treatment should&#xD;
                  not be given during the study treatment with ribociclib, except for:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Topical applications (e.g. for rash), inhaled sprays (e.g. for obstructive&#xD;
                       airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g. intra-articular)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  A short duration (&lt; 5 days) of systemic corticosteroids ≤ to the&#xD;
                       anti-inflammatory potency of 4 mg dexamethasone (e.g. for chronic&#xD;
                       obstructive pulmonary disease or as an antiemetic).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Medications that prolong the QTc interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric illness or social situation that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant liver disease, including active viral or other&#xD;
             known hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active hepatitis B (defined as having a positive hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
             [HBsAg]) or known active hepatitis C (defined as a positive test for hepatitis C viral&#xD;
             load by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with past hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or resolved HBV infection&#xD;
                  (defined as having a negative HBsAg test and a positive antibody to hepatitis B&#xD;
                  core antigen [anti-HBc] antibody test) are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with positive hepatitis C antibody AND negative quantitative hepatitis C&#xD;
                  by PCR AND no clinical/laboratory evidence of cirrhosis are eligible. Patients&#xD;
                  who have completed curative therapy for HCV are eligible if they meet all other&#xD;
                  parameters for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients are not required to undergo testing for HBV or HCV for enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known uncontrolled HIV infection defined as any of the following 3 criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CD4 counts ≤ 350 cells/μL; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum HIV viral load ≥ 400 copies/mL; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have been taking an antiretroviral regimen for &lt; 4 weeks prior to treatment with&#xD;
                  study drugs if anti-retroviral therapy is deemed necessary or appropriate by the&#xD;
                  investigator.&#xD;
