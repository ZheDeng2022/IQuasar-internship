  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a group of movement disorders characterized by twisting, repetitive movements, or&#xD;
      abnormal postures caused by involuntary muscle contractions and is characterized by a young&#xD;
      age of onset and a high disability rate. Early intervention can reduce disability incidence,&#xD;
      improve the patient's quality of life, and reduce the burden on families and society.&#xD;
      Multiple international guidelines on dystonia have found deep brain stimulation (DBS) to be a&#xD;
      safe and effective treatment for refractory dystonia. The globus pallidal internus (GPi) is&#xD;
      the mostly widely used target for dystonia. However, there are limitations on the GPi DBS&#xD;
      treatment, including slow onset of beneficial effects, poor improvement of axis symptoms, and&#xD;
      potential stimulation-related side effects. Previous studies have described the highly&#xD;
      successful use of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) in patients with&#xD;
      refractory dystonia, suggesting that STN DBS is an effective and persisting alternative to&#xD;
      pallidal deep brain stimulation. However, all STN DBS treated cases have been analyzed in&#xD;
      open-label uncontrolled cohort studies, leading to limited data with a high level of evidence&#xD;
      on the STN DBS in dystonia. Further, the investigators hypothesized STN has potentially more&#xD;
      effectiveness when compared with GPi, and may be more power-saving and quick-acting. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators will organize a prospective randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      parallel-group, multicenter study comparing active versus sham stimulation in isolated&#xD;
      segmental or generalized dystonia to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of STN DBS by&#xD;
      measuring the impact on motor status, mental status, quality of life, the rate of response of&#xD;
      the patients (the number of patients with ≥30% improvement in the movement score on the&#xD;
      Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale) and the rate of adverse events during the trial.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In this study after having DBS leads implanted successfully, 38 patients will be randomly assigned to either the control or experimental group with a 1:1 allocation. The experimental group will receive continuous DBS stimulation for 3 months, while controls will have sham stimulation for 3 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The randomization will be conducted by the Coordination Center of Clinical Trials (CenTrial) in order to keep the researchers managing the data and the statistician blind to group assignment and the study conditions. All the clinical assessments done during the trial period will be double-blind, e.g., neither the patient not the clinician or study personnel involved in the scoring will not be aware of the condition of stimulation. All personnel, except the physician-programmer responsible for the DBS setting, will be blinded to the identity of the parameters. While programming the programmer will not sit face-to-face with the patient, but in another room adjusting the parameter wirelessly with the help of the attending doctor who will inform the programmer of the patient's reaction. The electrical parameters will be tested in all patients which means they all will perceive similar stimulation related sensations during each follow-up.</masking_description>

    <description>In the STN DBS stimulation group, patients will receive a continuous DBS stimulation for 3 months and the first default parameters applied will be monopolar setting (0.5 V under threshold that causes side effects, 135 Hz, 90 µs, at one of the two dorsal contacts). If the default parameters are found not suitable for an individual patient due to unexpected reasons, an alternative method will be applied (e.g., decreased voltage) to try to maintain full compliance with the scheduled study.</description>

    <description>In the sham stimulation group, the programming will also start within 1 week after the surgery, but at each follow-up the DBS system will be turned off after the parameter is adjusted to the threshold that causes side effects without continuous stimulation. After the 3-month double-blind period the patients can choose to set on the DBS system again and receive regular continuous stimulation treatment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Deep brain stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been in use to treat patients with movement disorders since 1989, with many thousands of publications showing its effectiveness. DBS for dystonia received the US FDA mark in 2003 and China FDA mark in 2016. In this study, the DBS system devices are manufactured and donated by SceneRay (Suzhou, China). The Stimulator System is implanted by a qualified neurosurgeon and consists of three implantable components: the leads, the extension wires and the neurostimulator. The DBS programming will start within 1 week after the surgery completed.</description>
