    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate if the application of chlorhexidine gluconate dressing on&#xD;
      surgical drain sites can decrease drain site infection vs the standard of care (dry, sterile&#xD;
      gauze).&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants displaying signs of wound infection</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Month 6</time_frame>

    <measure>Number of participants displaying sterility of seroma</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Sterility of seroma will be measured by assessing whether the serous collection of fluid has absence of infection.</description>

    <description>On the day of the operation, after the procedure has concluded and the drains have been placed, the surgical drain site that has been randomized to be in the experimental group will receive the chlorhexidine gel dressing. The dressing will remain on the patient until the drain has been removed and the surgical site will be assessed for signs of infection.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Receiving two surgical drains during one of the following types of operative&#xD;
             procedures: breast reduction, breast augmentation, abdominoplasty, panniculectomy,&#xD;
             brachioplasty, thigh lift, lower body lift, belt lipectomy, back latissimus dorsi&#xD;
             reconstruction, bilateral breast reconstruction, or bilateral chest reconstruction.&#xD;
             These drains may be in fairly close proximity to one another but they must emerge from&#xD;
             different areas of the skin, that way they can be considered to be located in two&#xD;
             different sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Concurrent implantation of any foreign objects, such as a breast implant&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who receive postoperative antibiotics without a suspected or identified site&#xD;
             of infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects allergic to or hypersensitive to chlorhexidine gluconate. Before enrolling in&#xD;
             the study, patients will be asked about previous exposure to chlorhexidine products&#xD;
             and about their allergies. Those with potential allergic or adverse reaction to&#xD;
             chlorhexidine will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
