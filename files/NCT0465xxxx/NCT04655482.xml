      Type 3 neovascularization is a subtype of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD)&#xD;
      that is characterized by intraretinal neovascularization. Treat-and-extend (TAE) regimen is a&#xD;
      widely-used, effective anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment regimen for&#xD;
      neovascular AMD, regardless of subtypes of AMD. The purpose of the present study is to&#xD;
      investigate the 18-month treatment outcome of TAE in type 3 neovascularization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 3 neovascularization also called retinal angiomatous proliferation is a subtype of&#xD;
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that is characterized by intraretinal&#xD;
      neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of type 3 neovascularization is relatively lower than other subtypes of&#xD;
      neovascular AMD, constituting 10 to 20% of entire neovascular AMD. However, it is a very&#xD;
      important disorder because it often leads bilateral visual deterioration. The high risk of&#xD;
      bilateral involvement is characteristic of type 3 neovascularization. In some cases, the&#xD;
      visual prognosis of the initially uninvolved eye with better vision, is poorer than the&#xD;
      initially involved eye. In addition, profound visual loss may occur during the treatment&#xD;
      course, especially in undertreated cases. Thus, preserving vision is particularly important&#xD;
      in type 3 neovascularization, which subsequently highlights the importance of investigating&#xD;
      more effective treatment strategies. Previous study suggested the need for proactive&#xD;
      treatment in type 3 neovascularization to reduce the risk of abrupt visual loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treat-and-extend (TAE) regimen is a widely-used, effective anti-vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor treatment regimen for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), regardless&#xD;
      of subtypes of AMD. However, since type 3 neovascularization is at high risk of GA, there has&#xD;
      been some debate regarding the benefit of TAE, when compared to the as-needed regimen, for&#xD;
      treating type 3 neovascularization. Despite some controversy, reports indicated that&#xD;
      increased injection frequency is associated with development or progression of GA. Thus, it&#xD;
      is important to balance efficacy and efficiency when treating type 3 neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 3 neovascularization is a disorder in which the treatment outcome of TAE regimen was&#xD;
      first reported. Nevertheless, only limited evidence has been available regarding the efficacy&#xD;
      of TAE using aflibercept in this disorder. In addition, all the previous studies were&#xD;
      retrospective, based on relatively small study population. Moreover, results of extending the&#xD;
      injection interval to 4 months have not yet been reported. Recently, ALTAIR study provides a&#xD;
      scientific evidence that injection interval can be extended to 4 months when using TAE&#xD;
      regimen. In type 3 neovascularization, extending the injection interval is not only decreases&#xD;
      treatment burden of the patient, but also may improve long-term visual outcomes because it&#xD;
      may decrease the injection frequency. If this regimen is found to be effective in type 3&#xD;
      neovascularization, it may contribute to more widespread use of TAE regimen using aflibercept&#xD;
      for type 3 neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there are two questions which have not been addressed in previous TAE studies&#xD;
      for type 3 neovascularization. The first question is &quot;Is the treatment using TAE regimen can&#xD;
      impede the fundamental progression of the disorder?&quot;. Since visual loss in type 3&#xD;
      neovascularization usually develops in stage 3 disorder (eyes exhibits serous pigment&#xD;
      epithelial detachment on OCT, it will be a very meaningful result if TAE can impede stage&#xD;
      progression. The second question is &quot;Is there any clues to predict the recurrence of fluid?&quot;&#xD;
      Since avoiding under-treatment is very important in type 3 neovascularization, it is very&#xD;
      important to identify any factor predictive of recurrence. To address this question, it is&#xD;
      necessary to evaluate the serial changes in vascular morphology of type 3 neovascularization&#xD;
      lesion. Previously, however, this kind of approach cannot be performed because it requires&#xD;
      frequent, serial indocyanine-green angiography examination. Fortunately, recent advent of&#xD;
      OCT-angiography provides simple and safe evaluation of vascular morphology. By using&#xD;
      OCT-angiography, any vascular morphologic changes preceding the recurrence of fluid during&#xD;
      the TAE treatment can be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate the 18-month treatment outcome of TAE in&#xD;
      type 3 neovascularization. The maximum injection interval was set as 4 months. Since the&#xD;
      ALTAIR study nicely show how to extend the interval to 4 months, the study protocol of ALTAIR&#xD;
      study was partly adopted in the present study.&#xD;
