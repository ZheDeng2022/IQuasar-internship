  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this blind comparative study was to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine,&#xD;
      fentanyl and their combination on airway reflexes and hemodynamic responses to tracheal&#xD;
      extubation in Adult chronic male smoking patients scheduled for abdominal surgeries (of&#xD;
      average 2-3 hours duration).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tracheal extubation is associated with acute, transient, significant and undesirable&#xD;
      hemodynamic and airway responses that may persist into the recovery period. Respiratory&#xD;
      complications after tracheal extubation are three times more common than complications&#xD;
      occurring during tracheal intubation and induction of anesthesia (4.6% vs 12.6%) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peak changes are noticed about 1 minute following extubation and may continue until 10&#xD;
      minutes . The reflexes ranges from coughing, bucking, agitation to bronchospasm,&#xD;
      laryngospasm, laryngeal oedema, negative pressure pulmonary oedema, tachycardia,&#xD;
      hypertension, arrhythmias, left ventricular failure, myocardial ischemia, increased bleeding,&#xD;
      raised intracranial and intraocular pressure and cerebrovascular hemorrhage in susceptible&#xD;
      individuals. Although most patients can tolerate these transient effects without any&#xD;
      significant consequences, but this could be detrimental in patients operated for cardiac,&#xD;
      neuro or ophthalmic lesions especially if hypertensive or diabetic. However, Tracheal&#xD;
      extubation in smokers will increase difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking is a risk factor for intraoperative and postoperative complications mainly related to&#xD;
      pulmonary and cardiovascular systems. Long-term exposure to cigarettes causes an increased&#xD;
      response to the mechanical stimulation caused by extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking affects oxygen transport and delivery , Irritants in smoke increase mucous secretion&#xD;
      which becomes hyper viscous with impaired tracheobronchial clearance . Smoking increases&#xD;
      sympathetic activation due to increased release of catecholamines and the delay in nicotine&#xD;
      clearance from the neuroeffector junction leading to higher blood pressure, tachycardia, and&#xD;
      increase peripheral vascular resistance .&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a smooth extubation, there should be no straining, movement, coughing, breath holding or&#xD;
      laryngospasm. Extubation at light levels of anesthesia or sedation can stimulate reflex&#xD;
      responses via tracheal and laryngeal irritation . A variety of drugs such as esmolol,&#xD;
      alfentanil, diltiazem, verapamil, fentanyl, and lidocaine have been used to control&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes and upper airway tract events, but they all have limitations and side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha2 agonists decrease the sympathetic outflow and noradrenergic activity, thereby&#xD;
      counteracting hemodynamic fluctuations occurring at the time of extubation due to increased&#xD;
      sympathetic stimulation. Dexmedetomidine, an Î±2-adrenoreceptor agonist with a distribution&#xD;
      half-life of approximately 6 minutes has been successfully used for attenuating the stress&#xD;
      response to laryngoscopy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single dose of dexmedetomidine before extubation proved to attenuate both airway and&#xD;
      hemodynamic reflexes during emergence from anesthesia providing smooth extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of a single dose of dexmedetomidine to a low-dose infusion of remifentanil&#xD;
      during emergence from sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia was effective in attenuating cough&#xD;
      without further respiratory depression after thyroid surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administered 10 minutes before induction in chronic male smokers, dexmedetomidine was found&#xD;
      to suppress increased heart rate and rate-pressure product at 1 and 3 minutes after&#xD;
      intubation and, therefore, decrease the need for myocardial oxygen more than fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine produces sedation while sparing responsiveness to CO2, and thus, it has less&#xD;
      effect on respiratory depression. Consequently, it has found utility and regulatory approval&#xD;
      for use in bronchoscopic examinations and for weaning intensive care unit patients from&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. In addition, dexmedetomidine has been shown to reduce emergence&#xD;
      agitation in children and adults after general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, has been reported to reduce the prevalence of coughing during&#xD;
      and after extubation and to suppress the sneezing reflex after abdominal hysterectomy and&#xD;
      periocular injections . Fentanyl has also been reported to attenuate the cardiovascular&#xD;
      responses to tracheal extubation in elective gynecologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were Adult chronic male smokers, thus representing the population in which&#xD;
      secondary response to laryngoscopy and intubation is most common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will be divided by mean of randomized complete block design into 3&#xD;
      comparable groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (A) : (n= 22) will receive Dexmedetomidine 1ug/kg body weight IV diluted to 100ml&#xD;
      normal saline (NS) over 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (B) : (n=22) will receive Fentanyl 1 ug/kg body weight IV diluted to 100 ml normal&#xD;
      saline (NS) over 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (C): (n=22) will receive both Dexmedetomidine 1ug/kg body weight mixed with fentanyl&#xD;
      1ug/kg in 100 ml normal saline (NS) over 15 minutes Pre-anesthetic checkup was conducted and&#xD;
      a detailed history and complete physical examination recorded. Routine investigations like&#xD;
      complete blood picture, blood grouping/typing, blood urea and serum creatinine were done.&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria will be informed about the procedure and its possible&#xD;
      complications. Finally, written consent will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine anesthetic technique was used using propofol 2mg/kg, fentanyl 1.5 ug/kg, atracurium&#xD;
      0.5 mg /kg, oxygen and sevoflurane. Standard monitoring with electrocardiography (EKG), pulse&#xD;
      oximetry (SpO2), noninvasive BP and End tidal Co2 was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 15 minutes before the estimated time of end of surgery (or at the beginning of closure&#xD;
      of skin incision,), inhalation agent (sevoflurane) was cut off and patients in each group&#xD;
      received the specified solution intravenously over 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group A received dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg intravenous (IV) in 100 ml normal&#xD;
      saline (NS) over 15 minutes ,patients in group B, received Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg (IV) in100 ml NS&#xD;
      over 15 minutes, while patients in group C received both Dexmedetomidine 1ug/kg mixed with&#xD;
      fentanyl 1ug/kg in 100 ml normal saline (NS) over 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When patients' spontaneous respirations were considered sufficient and patients were able to&#xD;
      obey simple commands residual neuromuscular block was antagonized with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg&#xD;
      and atropine 0.02 mg/kg. Oropharyngeal secretions were aspirated before extubation. The&#xD;
      endotracheal tube was removed after spontaneous ventilation had returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist performing the extubation was blinded to the study drugs. HR, systolic&#xD;
      BP and diastolic BP and oxygen saturation were recorded at the start of bolus drug injection&#xD;
      and thereafter at 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 minutes., Also at the time of extubation and thereafter&#xD;
      at 1, 3 and 5 minutes after extubation followed by every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. Duration&#xD;
      of anesthesia and surgery are noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS advanced statistics (Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences), version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Numerical data will be described as median&#xD;
      and interquartile range or range or mean and standard deviation as appropriate, while&#xD;
      qualitative data were described as number and percentage. Chi-square (Fisher's exact) test&#xD;
      was used to examine the relation between qualitative variables as appropriate. Testing for&#xD;
      normality was done using Kolmogrov-Smirnov test and Shapiro-Wilk test&#xD;
