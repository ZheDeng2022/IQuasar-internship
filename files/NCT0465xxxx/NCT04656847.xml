  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional, ambispective study was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of bisoprolol and perindopril SPC in previous myocardial infarction&#xD;
      patients with HTN and CAD treated with the drug for 12 weeks in the daily clinical practice.&#xD;
      SPC will be used according to the approved instruction for medical use of the medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre, observational, incomparative, ambispective study, which will&#xD;
      retrospectively and prospectively collect clinical variables and socio-demographic data from&#xD;
      medical records of patients with HTN and previous MI initiated with bisoprolol/perindopril&#xD;
      SPC in real life settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, observational, incomparative, ambispective study, which will&#xD;
      retrospectively and prospectively collect clinical variables and socio-demographic data from&#xD;
      medical records of patients with HTN and previous MI initiated with bisoprolol/perindopril&#xD;
      SPC in real life settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be collected retrospectively from medical records of stable CAD patients&#xD;
      with HTN and a history of MI, including disease history of the patient. To be included in the&#xD;
      study for further prospective observation a patient should have been administered bisoprolol/&#xD;
      perindopril SPC within first three months before the Index Date. (Fig.1). Therefore, criteria&#xD;
      for non-inclusion or inclusion of the patient in the study are to be retrospectively&#xD;
      evaluated by the investigator using recorded clinical data available from medical records.&#xD;
      Once a physician makes decision to include a patient in the study and, in particular, on the&#xD;
      prospective observation for 3 months, a visit to the clinic for obtaining signed patient's&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study should be appointed and made within 1 month from the&#xD;
      Index Date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective screening and evaluation of patient's eligibility to inclusion/ exclusion&#xD;
      criteria for entering the study allows mitigating a potential risk of deliberative medicine&#xD;
      administration within the observational program. Such studies are carried out in case of&#xD;
      observational programs when the studied drug is administered in line with indications&#xD;
      according to the instruction for its medical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several multicenter, non-interventional, open, incomparable studies have been performed with&#xD;
      bisoprolol/perindopril SPC in patients with HTN and coronary heart disease. A total of 70&#xD;
      general practitioners and cardiologists from primary care facilities will participate in the&#xD;
      program. Each doctor will include about 7-8 patients. In total, it is planned to include at&#xD;
      least 500 patients.&#xD;
