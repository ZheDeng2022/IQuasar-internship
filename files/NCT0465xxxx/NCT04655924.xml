    <description>This is approved as a physician partially-blinded study and, as such, physicians are blinded to the primary outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate time to remission between groups. The hypothesis is that time to remission will be shorter in the active intervention group compared to the active control group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate response rate between groups. The hypothesis is that the response rate (defined as 50% improvement in symptoms) and time to response, will be higher and lower, respectively, in the active intervention group compared to the active control group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Disability with WHODAS rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate between-group differences in patient disability outcomes. The hypothesis is that the physicians in the active intervention arm will produce superior patient outcomes to those physicians using usual guideline-informed practice, in terms of patient function as measured by a rating scale (WHODAS).</description>

    <measure>Medication Adherence Rates</measure>

        Patient Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  diagnosed with major depressive disorder by a physician using DSM-V criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients must confirm that they are comfortable being treated for depression by their&#xD;
             physician, who may propose a range of treatment options, such as medications or&#xD;
             psychotherapies, consistent with best practice guidelines for depression which are&#xD;
             included in the application. Physicians will be required, as in usual practice, to&#xD;
             explain treatments to patients and patients will be able to give and withdraw consent&#xD;
             for treatment in general or for specific treatments as in usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  bipolar disorder of any type&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  inability or unwillingness of the individual to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  inability to manage patient in an outpatient setting (i.e. imminent suicidality)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  active major depression is not the main condition being treated (i.e. the patient has&#xD;
             depressive symptoms in the context of severe substance abuse or a psychotic disorder,&#xD;
             but a primary diagnosis of major depressive episode (MDE) cannot be made or would&#xD;
             result in inappropriate care).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  inability to use the tool (i.e. patient cannot interface with a mobile phone or&#xD;
             computer due to delirium, or another medical condition)* *Note that for patients who&#xD;
             do not have access to mobile or desktop devices but are able to use them or to be&#xD;
             trained to use them, these will be provided to them at no cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Physician Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  any family doctor/primary care physician or psychiatrist accredited in Canada or the&#xD;
             USA who treats patients with depression on at least a monthly basis, as well as&#xD;
             residents from these specialities supervised by a participating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  comfortable prescribing the range of potential treatments which could have&#xD;
             probabilities provided for them by the CDA&#xD;
&#xD;
        No Physician Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
