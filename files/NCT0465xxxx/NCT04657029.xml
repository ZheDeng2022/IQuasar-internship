    <textblock>
      A single-blinded crossover study. Participants attended two separate sessions at the&#xD;
      university campus, completing an aerobic exercise intervention in one session and a resting&#xD;
      control condition in the other session. Sensorimotor adaptation was assessed before and after&#xD;
      each session. Participants were twenty people with chronic stroke. Intervention completed was&#xD;
      treadmill exercise at mod-high intensity for 30 minutes.&#xD;

      Participants Twenty people with chronic stroke participated in the study (aged 61 ± 13 years;&#xD;
      76% male).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design In a cross-over design, each participant was pseudo-randomised to&#xD;
      complete an intervention condition (Treadmill) or control condition (Rest) first, returning&#xD;
      at least one week later (washout period) to complete the alternate condition. A minimum&#xD;
      washout period of one week was used to allow for any physiological changes due to exercise to&#xD;
      return to resting levels, but to minimise any stroke recovery-associated changes to function.&#xD;
      Participants were asked to refrain from exercising in the 24 hours prior to their visit. At&#xD;
      each visit, participants completed the sensorimotor adaptation task on two occasions, pre and&#xD;
      post intervention, resulting in four assessment timepoints (PreControl, PostControl and&#xD;
      PreTreadmill, PostTreadmill). The post intervention assessment aimed to commence within 15&#xD;
      minutes of completing the treadmill or rest condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The intervention condition consisted of a single session of moderate-high&#xD;
      intensity aerobic exercise (65% of heart rate reserve) for 30 minutes walking on a standard&#xD;
      treadmill (Landice L7 treadmill), with arms placed comfortably by participants on the rail&#xD;
      (in front) or swinging freely. Information describing the specific features of the training&#xD;
      session (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure response, treadmill speed, total distance walked)&#xD;
      were recorded to monitor the response to exercise and adherence to the exercise protocol. The&#xD;
      single treadmill session included a progressive increase in intensity (usually increased&#xD;
      speed, or gradient) to reach the target heart rate (approx. 5 mins) as well as a cooling down&#xD;
      period (approx. 5 mins) to allow for participants to return towards resting levels for vital&#xD;
      observations. The warm-up and cool-down were included as part of the total 30 minutes of&#xD;
      walking exercise. Target heart rates were calculated using the Karvonen method with levels&#xD;
      adjusted for those taking heart rate lowering medications (i.e. beta blockers), following&#xD;
      methods previously published in post stroke populations. Heart rate was measured using a&#xD;
      chest strap monitor (polar-electro) and monitored by a research assistant who facilitated&#xD;
      changes in treadmill parameters to enable participants to reach their target. Participants&#xD;
      were asked to self-rate their intensity of exercise every 10 minutes verbally using BORG's&#xD;
      6-20 scale rating of perceived exertion. Participants were instructed to walk at a pace that&#xD;
      resulted in a rating between 11 (fairly light) and 14 (somewhat hard) on the scale. The&#xD;
      control condition involved an equivalent time period (30 minutes) of seated resting where&#xD;
      participants were provided with an education session about the impact and effects of stroke&#xD;
      by the same research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensorimotor adaptation task Apparatus and setup. Participants were seated in front of a desk&#xD;
      (approximately 50 cm from their coronal plane) and asked to move a digitising pen (15.95 cm&#xD;
      long, 1.4 cm wide, 17 g) on a digitizing tablet (WACOM Intuos4 PTK 1240, size: 19.2 x 12 in.,&#xD;
      resolution = 0.25 mm) from an origin to a target point. The pen's position on the tablet (XY&#xD;
      coordinates) was sampled at 100 Hz and displayed in real time as a circular cursor with a&#xD;
      5-pixel radius (1.25 mm) on a horizontally placed computer monitor. Direct vision of the hand&#xD;
      was prevented by placing the tablet and the hand directly beneath an opaque stand, with the&#xD;
      horizontal monitor placed atop the stand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task instructions. Participants first received task instructions to move an on-screen cursor&#xD;
      from the start to the target, in a straight line, in a single movement, as quickly and as&#xD;
      accurately as possible. Further, participants were instructed that the feedback of the&#xD;
      movement would be changed from time-to-time, and that participants were to change their&#xD;
      movement in response to this change of feedback, whilst keeping movements as straight as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each trial, the participants' task was to move from the origin location through the target&#xD;
      location as quickly and accurately as possible using their dominant upper limb. Targets were&#xD;
      presented in one of three locations (210, 225 or 240 degrees from the right horizontal plane)&#xD;
      in random order. These target directions were selected such that target-reaching movements&#xD;
      involved the horizontal adductors of the shoulder joint. After moving through the target, or&#xD;
      past the target, a high-pitched tone sounded to indicate trial completion. Following&#xD;
      completion of a trial the origin location was re-displayed immediately and participant&#xD;
      directed to repeat task. If the participant did not complete a successful trial, they were&#xD;
      directed to return to the origin location and repeat the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, participants encountered 18 baseline trials under normal (correct) feedback with no&#xD;
      rotation. Participants then immediately completed 66 adaptation trials, where the visual&#xD;
      feedback on the display monitor was perturbed by rotating it 30 degrees in a clockwise&#xD;
      direction (1st testing day) or counter-clockwise direction (2nd testing day). After the&#xD;
      adaptation block, to notify participants that the perturbation had been removed, a popup&#xD;
      dialog box appeared with the statement &quot;In the next few trials, the disturbance that the&#xD;
      computer applied would be removed. Please aim straight to the target.&quot; The instructions&#xD;
      on-screen were read out by the experimenter to ensure it was understood. This was immediately&#xD;
      followed by 6 no-feedback trials. Finally, participants completed 36 washout trials under&#xD;
      normal cursor feedback conditions (i.e., no cursor rotation), to return behaviour to an&#xD;
      unadapted state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Processing and Analysis Custom scripts written in LabVIEW scored reach directions, which&#xD;
      were quantified at the 15th data point (150 milliseconds into the reach), as online movement&#xD;
      corrections typically occur after 150 ms into a reach. Trials with reach direction outside a&#xD;
      120 degree range of the target (60 degrees on either side of the target) were discarded as&#xD;
      outliers. Trials were binned into cycles of one visit to each of the three targets. The&#xD;
      dependent variable was percent adaptation, which quantified reach directions in every cycle&#xD;
      relative to the ideal reach direction by calculating reach directions as a percentage of&#xD;
      ideal reach directions resulting from perfect adaptation performance. Ideal reach direction&#xD;
      was 30 degree clockwise for a 30 degree counter-clockwise rotation, and 30 degrees&#xD;
      counter-clockwise for a 30 degree clockwise rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percent adaptation=100% × (reach direction)/(ideal reach direction)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As observed previously, there was a rapid error reduction phase of reaching where a majority&#xD;
      of learning occurred followed by a slower rate of adaptation. Here, as the targets were&#xD;
      spaced close together, rapid error reduction occurred in trials 1-9 (i.e., the first three&#xD;
      cycles), similar to recent work. At completion of the fourth cycle, adaptation was greater&#xD;
      than 70% both before and after the treadmill and control conditions. We thus selected the&#xD;
      first three cycles to quantify rapid error reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual differences in reach directions at baseline can affect measures of adaptation.&#xD;
      Previous methods of accounting for this by subtracting pre-perturbation behaviour from&#xD;
      post-perturbation behaviour is more sensitive to noisy baselines and risk of Type 2 error. To&#xD;
      account for pre-perturbation baseline biases, we entered percent adaptation averaged from the&#xD;
      final three cycles before rotation onset (i.e., percent adaptation in the last five baseline&#xD;
      cycles) as covariates in all of our analysis of covariance analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the adaptation trials, there were two cycles where no feedback was provided to the&#xD;
      participant. That is, unlike all previous trials where participants could follow a tracking&#xD;
      cursor with their vision, the participants received no real time feedback about where they&#xD;
      were reaching. The first no-feedback cycle was taken as a measure of implicit learning,&#xD;
      similar to previous work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our outcome measures of interest were (1) adaptation performance (2) implicit aftereffects,&#xD;
      quantified as reaches that remained adapted despite notification of perturbation removal in&#xD;
      the no-feedback block and (3) explicit learning, estimated as the volitional disengagement of&#xD;
      adapted behaviour after receiving notification of perturbation removal (i.e., the change in&#xD;
      percent adaptation from the mean of the last three adaptation cycles to the first no-feedback&#xD;
      cycle after receiving notification that the perturbation was gone), and (4) de-adaptation&#xD;
      performance. To evaluate these measures, we ran ANCOVAs with the between-subjects factor&#xD;
      Intervention Order (Control First, Treadmill First) and the within-subjects factors:&#xD;
      Intervention (Control, Treadmill), Time (Pre-Intervention, Post-Intervention) and (where&#xD;
      applicable) Cycles (cycles 1..3), with pre-rotation biases as covariates of no interest&#xD;
      (estimated from mean percent adaptation in the last three baseline cycles). Where&#xD;
      appropriate, Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were applied. Alpha was set at 0.05. SPSS v24.0&#xD;
      was used for statistical analyses.&#xD;
