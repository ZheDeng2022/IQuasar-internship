      Study to asess the effects of Iberogast® (STW5) and Iberogast® N (STW5-II) in intestinal gas&#xD;
      transit and abdominal symptoms of patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome or&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every day great amounts of gas enter into the intestine from several sources, including air&#xD;
      swallowed during meals and gas produced by colonic fermentation by intestinal bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that gastric nutrients delay emptying of gastric gas in healthy&#xD;
      subjects, and this effect is exacerbated in patients with functional dyspepsia, leading to a&#xD;
      lower tolerance to gastric gas and greater gas-related epigastric symptoms. Likewise,&#xD;
      patients with lower functional gut disorders, like irritable bowel syndrome or functional&#xD;
      bloating, have an altered transit and evacuation of intestinal gas that is associated to&#xD;
      abdominal symptoms. In addition, bloating and abdominal distension are gas-related abdominal&#xD;
      symptoms that are common to both upper and lower functional gut disorders, and referred by a&#xD;
      majority of patients, as their most bothersome symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STW5 (Iberogast®) is a medicinal product composed by 9 herbal preparations that has been&#xD;
      shown to promote changes in gastric tone, gastrointestinal motility, intestinal inflammation&#xD;
      and visceral sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iberogast® is approved in Spain for treatment of gastrointestinal disorders like dyspepsia&#xD;
      and gastritis, as well as for symptomatic relief of associated symptoms as epigastric pain,&#xD;
      bloating, flatulence, gastrointestinal colics, nausea and epigastric burning sensation&#xD;
      (extract from Summary of product characteristics, SmPC) ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STW5-II (Iberogast N®) is an herbal medicinal preparation consisting of six herbal extracts&#xD;
      (Iberis amara whole plant, caraway fruits, liquorice roots, peppermint leaves, lemon balm&#xD;
      leaves, and chamomile flowers). It contains an extract combination of Iberis amara as an&#xD;
      alcoholic fresh plant extract as well as plant extracts of caraway fruits, liquorice roots,&#xD;
      peppermint leaves, lemon balm leaves, and chamomile flowers as alcoholic drug extracts. The&#xD;
      preparation contains 31% ethanol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iberogast N® was approved in Germany only on 07 Oct 2010 and is indicated for the treatment&#xD;
      of functional gastrointestinal diseases like functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome (IBS) . It was marketed with only very few packs to keep the license. It is approved&#xD;
      for adolescents and adults from the age of 12 years, as for patients below the age of 12 no&#xD;
      data are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iberogast N was tested in five controlled clinical trials with a dosage scheme of 3 x 20&#xD;
      drops/day over 4 to 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy was proven in the indications FD (four studies) and IBS (one study). Approximately&#xD;
      441 participants have been treated with Iberogast N in clinical studies. The analysis of AEs&#xD;
      did not lead to any safety signal or concern and supports the favorable benefit risk profile&#xD;
      of BAY98-7410 (STW 5-II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three subjects from the overall safety population that participated in 6 interventional&#xD;
      studies, experienced at least one SAE, including 1 subject of 139 (0.71%) treated with&#xD;
      BAY98-7410 (STW 5-II) (female, 43 years old, hospitalized due circulatory problems, treatment&#xD;
      was discontinued) and 2 subjects (1.5%) of 133 treated with placebo (1 male, 65 years old,&#xD;
      hospitalized due psychiatric disorders triggered by stressful life events, treatment was&#xD;
      discontinued; 1 female, 47 years old, diagnosed during hospitalization with anemia, treatment&#xD;
      was discontinued). All SAEs were only reported for the interventional study STW5&#xD;
      II/212-D-03-III-V and were assessed as not related to study treatment (Information from&#xD;
      Investigator Brochure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, laboratory investigations of the subjects during the clinical trials gave no&#xD;
      evidence for clinically relevant changes caused by treatment with Iberogast N.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional gut disorders comprise a large number of chronic medical conditions that may&#xD;
      affect all the segments of the gastrointestinal tract, from the esophagus to the anus,&#xD;
      characterized by a combination of disturbances including dysbiosis, altered permeability,&#xD;
      altered immunological responses and microinflammation, motor and sensory dysfunction, and&#xD;
      altered processing of the gut stimuli by the central nervous system. The most prevalent&#xD;
      functional gastrointestinal disorders are functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome.&#xD;
      Functional dyspepsia is characterized by symptoms (pain, burning, fullness and early satiety)&#xD;
      referred to the epigastrium, whereas irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by abdominal&#xD;
      pain and altered bowel habits. In both disorders gas-related abdominal symptoms, like&#xD;
      abdominal bloating and distension, are among the most frequently referred symptoms. Treatment&#xD;
      of these gas-related abdominal symptoms is often disappointing, and patients are often&#xD;
      advised to follow very restrictive diets, like the low-FODMAP diet, to control these&#xD;
      symptoms. However, these restrictive diets are not harmless, because they can lead to&#xD;
      malnutrition, and to severe alterations of gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now-to-date, despite the prevalence of gas-related abdominal symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      functional gut disorders, and the multitarget effects of the herbal preparation Iberogast,&#xD;
      with several mechanisms of action like changes in motility and sensitivity that could act on&#xD;
      bloating and gas retention, there are no studies exploring the effects of Iberogast on&#xD;
      intestinal gas transit and tolerance in subjects with functional gut disorders. Hence, the&#xD;
      aim of the present trial is to determine the effects of Iberogast, and the simplified formula&#xD;
      Iberogast N, on intestinal transit and tolerance in subjects with functional dyspepsia and&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome according to Rome IV criteria, using a methodology for the study of&#xD;
      gas transit that has been largely used and validated by the investigation team.&#xD;
