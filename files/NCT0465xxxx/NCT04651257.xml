      Nipple discharge is a relatively frequent complaint in females, being the third most common&#xD;
      breast symptoms prompting medical care, after breast pain and breast palpable mass. Over 80%&#xD;
      of females will have an episode of nipple discharge during their fertile life,which can be&#xD;
      categorized as lactional which is milky in nature and occur during pregnancy or breast&#xD;
      feeding. Physiological nipple discharge, is yellow, milky or greenish in nature, it cannot&#xD;
      happen spontaneously and it can often be seen coming from multiple orifices,Some causes of&#xD;
      physiological nipple discharge are hypothyroidism and medication side-effects. . Pathological&#xD;
      nipple discharge is defined as a clear, serous, or bloody secretion , spontaneous,&#xD;
      discharging from a single duct and unilateral. It is frequently caused by a benign lesion,&#xD;
      such as intraductal papilloma (35-56%) or ductal ectasia (6-59%), but an underlying&#xD;
      malignancy can be present in a percentage of cases reported to be variable from 5 to 33%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Majority of nipple discharge cases are more frequently due to benign conditions, so less&#xD;
      operative ,nonsurgical methods can be applied to limit the need for surgical intervention ,&#xD;
      the woman that presents with nipple discharge should be managed as follow , ultrasound which&#xD;
      is always performed in cases with nipple discharge for detection of ductal carcinoma in situ&#xD;
      or invasive carcinoma , the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound were 65% and 75% to&#xD;
      85%respectively ,mammography which plays an important role in diagnosis of breast diseases&#xD;
      however it has low (20-25%)sensitivity in cases with nipple discharge as the associated&#xD;
      lesions are usually retro areolar ,small, intraductal and non calcified so negative&#xD;
      mammography do not exclude the possibility of underlying disease , ductography,which has long&#xD;
      been considered the gold standard for evaluation of nipple discharge but it has low&#xD;
      sensitivity , MRI has high sensitivity in evaluation of nipple discharge up to 88% to 95%,&#xD;
      and its negative predictive value is (90%) , demonstrate not only ductal lesions but also&#xD;
      lesions in adjacent parenchyma and it is superior in assessment of location and extent of a&#xD;
      lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, contrast enhanced digital mammography has shown a very high sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity in diagnosis of breast lesions, it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration in 2011. The utility of CEM in the diagnostic setting for evaluation of breast&#xD;
      lesion is 100% sensitivity, 87.7% specificity, 76.2%, positive predictive, 100%negative&#xD;
      predictive .CEM has been found to result in more accurate tumor size estimation . In the&#xD;
      evaluation of suspicious micro calcifications, the negative predictive value of CEM has been&#xD;
      reported to be up to 93% . The literature also suggests that the improved performance of CEM&#xD;
      relative to that of mammography is greater in women with dense breast tissue as compared with&#xD;
      nondense breast tissue, with fewer false-negative cases . Additionally CEM can evaluate&#xD;
      response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and assessment of disease recurrence and also in&#xD;
      screening of high risk women .&#xD;
