  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the benefit of treatment with a physician administered intracanalicular&#xD;
      dexamethasone insert in evaporative dry eye disease (DED) patients with meibomian gland&#xD;
      disfunction (MGD) and underlying inflammation undergoing iLUX MGD Treatment System.&#xD;

      This prospective study will use a fellow-eye design for 30 participants, (2 groups of 15)&#xD;
      equating to 60 eyes. All eyes will receive bilateral iLUX MGD Treatment System. The most&#xD;
      symptomatic eye will be selected to receive DEXTENZA® insertion on the day of the procedure&#xD;
      (study eye). In group 1, the other eye will be assigned to receive prednisolone acetate 1% on&#xD;
      a 4,3,2,1 month taper schedule (active comparator). In group 2, the other eye will receive&#xD;
      punctal &quot;sham&quot; dilation (control eye). If there is no obvious symptomatic difference, the&#xD;
      right eye will receive the intracanalicular insert. The study group will consist of 30 eyes&#xD;
      receiving DEXTENZA® insertion. The control group will consist of 15 eyes receiving&#xD;
      prednisolone acetate 1% and 15 eyes receiving sham punctum dilation. Thus, for every eye in&#xD;
      the study group, there will be a paired eye with similar baseline characteristics in the&#xD;
      control group sourced from the same participant. This fellow-eye design allows for greater&#xD;
      control of potential confounders tied to participants' systemic and ocular health.&#xD;
