  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of stereotactic radiosurgery and pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      treating patients with meningioma that has come back (recurrent). Stereotactic radiosurgery&#xD;
      is a type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position the patient&#xD;
      and precisely give a single large dose of radiation to a tumor. It is used to treat brain&#xD;
      tumors and other brain disorders that cannot be treated by regular surgery. Pembrolizumab is&#xD;
      a humanized monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a common type of protein made in the body in&#xD;
      response to a foreign substance. Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against&#xD;
      infection. Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory for use in treating patients; an&#xD;
      antibody that is made in the lab is also known as a humanized monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to block&#xD;
      the action of the receptor PD-1. It has been studied in lab experiments and in other types of&#xD;
      cancer. The PD-1 receptor works to keep the immune system from noticing tumor cells. The&#xD;
      addition of pembrolizumab to stereotactic radiosurgery may improve the progression free&#xD;
      survival of patients with meningioma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of stereotactic radiation and pembrolizumab for treatment of&#xD;
      recurrent meningioma compared to historical control based on progression free survival at 12&#xD;
      months (PFS12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall survival and further assess progression free survival of stereotactic&#xD;
      radiation and pembrolizumab for treatment of recurrent meningioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess immune-related tumor effects pembrolizumab treatment in meningioma using&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in conjunction with assessment by Response Assessment in&#xD;
      Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO) and Immunotherapy (i)RANO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess neurocognitive function and quality of life with pembrolizumab and radiation&#xD;
      using the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) Scale, and European Organisation for&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire brain tumour module&#xD;
      (QLQ-BN20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess safety of the combined treatment modalities in meningioma, through evaluation&#xD;
      of grade III adverse events (AEs) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within -3 to 0 days from the start of stereotactic radiation therapy, patients receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22. Cycles repeat every 6&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery on day 1 or days 1-5 of cycle 1 in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 12 weeks for&#xD;
      2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter for up to 5 years.&#xD;
