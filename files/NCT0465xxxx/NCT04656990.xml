  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the effects of an integrated intervention on the gross&#xD;
      motor and social-emotional development of rural preschool boys and girls. A secondary purpose&#xD;
      was to examine intervention effects on physical activity and sedentary behavior. An&#xD;
      exploratory aim was to examine the role of executive functioning skills on intervention&#xD;
      outcomes. This study featured a repeated measures (baseline, six-month posttest, three month&#xD;
      retention [nine-month follow-up]), control group, experimental design. Classrooms were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the experimental or control groups. Experimental participants&#xD;
      received intervention while control participants received business as usual curricula.&#xD;

    <description>Attention &amp; Executive Function - The allocation of one's limited capacities to deal with an abundance of environmental stimulation. Children ages 3-17: Normative scores are provided separately for each year of age to take into account expected developmental changes A score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average for the test-taking participant's age. A score of 115 or 85, for example, would indicate that the participant's performance is 1 SD above or below the national average, respectively, when compared with like-aged participants</description>
