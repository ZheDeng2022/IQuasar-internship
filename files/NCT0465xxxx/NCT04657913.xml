    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of spray use on dry mouth and thirst of&#xD;
      patients who had undergone major abdominal surgery. The methods used to alleviate the thirst&#xD;
      and dry mouth experienced by patients undergoing major abdominal surgery are limited. This&#xD;
      research was conducted as a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study sample includes patients who had undergone major abdominal surgery induced by upper&#xD;
      or lower gastrointestinal system malignancies. The patients who met the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      were informed about the purpose of the study and were invited to the study. Those who&#xD;
      accepted to participate in the study were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who had undergone major abdominal surgery with general anesthesia (induced by upper&#xD;
      or lower gastrointestinal system malignancies), who do not have any oral and nasal diseases,&#xD;
      who do not have visual, hearing, speech and understanding problems, who were in the American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II grades, who were aged 18 or over and agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose mouth and tongue mucosa integrity was degraded, who had a cognitive disorder,&#xD;
      or were suffering from neurological, renal, cardiac or pulmonary disorders that could affect&#xD;
      the test results, or who use psychoactive drugs were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard anesthesia protocol was implemented to all patients suitable for the study. In&#xD;
      the postoperative period, the standard rational dose antibiotic therapy (1st generation&#xD;
      cephalosporin + metronidazole), metoclopramide HCL, NSAIDs, LMWH, N-acetylcysteine (NAC),&#xD;
      H2-receptor blockers (ranitidine HCL), pethidine HCL 50 mg/ml, when required, and maintenance&#xD;
      fluid therapy (Combination of normal saline, lactated Ringer's and Dextrose) by their weight&#xD;
      were administered to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Control Group: No intervention was performed on the patients in the control group. To&#xD;
      prevent ethical violations, patients received routine clinical practice (a small amount of&#xD;
      water was administered orally, using a syringe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Intervention Group: Cold water kept at +40 C in the refrigerator was added into 50cc&#xD;
      spray-head bottles and administered to patients orally in the postoperative phase, by&#xD;
      spraying twice hourly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third intervention Group: Cold normal saline (0.9% NaCl) kept at +40 C in the refrigerator&#xD;
      was added into 50cc spray-head bottles and administered to patients orally in the&#xD;
      postoperative phase, by spraying twice hourly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No intervention was performed on patients from midnight thru 06:00 AM, in order not to&#xD;
      disturb the circadian rhythms of all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering surgery end time and circadian rhythms of patients, the data of the patients were&#xD;
      recorded at the post-operative 4, 8, 20, 24, 36, 40th hours. The flow chart of the study is&#xD;
      shown in Figure 1. In the cold water and cold normal saline applications, 50cc glass bottles,&#xD;
      plastic spray head, and cover were used. New material was used for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative measurements: Patients' data such as age, gender, comorbid diseases, ASA&#xD;
      (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade, diagnosis, preoperative thirst intensity,&#xD;
      preoperative mouth dryness intensity, preoperative oral health condition were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements Postoperative evaluations were made after the interventions. Intensity&#xD;
      of Thirst: VAS with a range of 0-10 points (0: mild, 10 very severe) was used while the&#xD;
      thirsty severity of all patients were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity of Mouth Dryness: VAS with a range of 0-10 points (0: never experiencing mouth&#xD;
      dryness, 10: experiencing very intense mouth dryness) was used while the mouth dryness&#xD;
      severity of all patients were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Health Condition: To assess patients' oral health condition, the Oral Health Assessment&#xD;
      Tool (OHAT) was used. The first four items of the scale that assess lips, tongue, gums and&#xD;
      tissue, and saliva were used. The lowest score to be obtained from the scale is 0, while the&#xD;
      highest score is 8 (0=healthy; 1=changes; 2=unhealthy). A higher OHAT score indicates a poor&#xD;
      oral condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva PH: To measure the PH of saliva, the patient's saliva sample in a sterile container&#xD;
      was assessed using PH test strips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Satisfaction: To evaluate patient satisfaction, overall satisfaction was scored using&#xD;
      a 10-point numerical rating scale (NRS) from 0 (complete dissatisfaction) to 10 (complete&#xD;
      satisfaction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the postoperative 4th hour, the severity of thirst and dry mouth, oral health status and&#xD;
      saliva PH values were evaluated in terms of differences between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the postoperative 8th hour, the severity of thirst and dry mouth, oral health status and&#xD;
      saliva PH values were evaluated in terms of differences between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the postoperative 20,24,36 and 40th hour, the severity of thirst and dry mouth, oral&#xD;
      health status and saliva PH values were evaluated in terms of differences between the groups.&#xD;
