  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Midazolam is a commonly used drug in gastrointestinal endoscopy due to the good&#xD;
      cardiovascular stability and mild respiratory depression for elderly patients. However, there&#xD;
      is the concern about the the longer and less predictable recovery or the potential for repeat&#xD;
      sedation when the active metabolite becomes bioavailable. Remimazolam Tosilate is an&#xD;
      innovative benzodiazepine with better sedation effect and less recovery or resedation issues&#xD;
      than midazolam, which possibly make the drug more suitable in elderly patients. We aim to&#xD;
      clarify whether remimazolam tosilate is better than midazolam in elderly patients undergoing&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before starting the endoscopy procedures, patients were randomized to receive remimazolam&#xD;
      tosilate or midazolam to maintain sufficient sedation, then remifentanil was slowly injected&#xD;
      for patients' sufficient analgesia during the examination. We aim to use patients' recovery&#xD;
      time, cognition function and other measurement scales to clarify whether remimazolam tosilate&#xD;
      is better than midazolam in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy.&#xD;
