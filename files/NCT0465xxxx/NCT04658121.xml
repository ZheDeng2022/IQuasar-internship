    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) is doing a study to estimate the number of people who&#xD;
      have or have had the SARS-CoV-2 virus in different communities in the United States. This&#xD;
      study is being done to help determine the best places to perform future research studies that&#xD;
      will test new drugs for treatment or prevention of COVID-19.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional surveys of (1) adults residing in senior living facilities and attending&#xD;
      outpatient healthcare facilities, and (2) the general population in each selected research&#xD;
      site community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adults residing in senior living facilities (nursing homes, assisted or independent&#xD;
           living facilities) and attending outpatient healthcare facilities in neighborhoods of&#xD;
           selected research sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adults and children (&gt; 2 months of age) in neighborhoods of selected research sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each research site, up to 3,920 individuals will be enrolled from one, two, or all three&#xD;
      of the following populations (must include at least community venues):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. senior living facilities (nursing homes, assisted or independent living facilities; n =&#xD;
           500)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. outpatient healthcare facilities (n = 500)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. community venues distributed across four age categories (0-17, 18-39, 40-59, 60+ years)&#xD;
           (n = 730 per stratum or 2920)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total sample size = 3,920 x up to 20 clinical research sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately sixteen (16) months for overall project. Two (2) months for protocol&#xD;
      development and institutional review board (IRB) approval, followed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Facility-based surveys: 12 months (3 months for site preparation and initiation, 3&#xD;
           months for enrollment/sample collection, 4 months for shipping and laboratory testing*,&#xD;
           2 months for close-out), concurrent with&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time-location sampling (TLS) surveys: 14 months (3 months for site preparation and&#xD;
           initiation, 6 months for enrollment/sample collection, 6 months for shipping and&#xD;
           laboratory testing*, 2 months for close-out)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Some activities will be concurrent with enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Location:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catchment areas surrounding US-based Clinical Research Sites (CRSs) of the: HIV Prevention&#xD;
      Trials Network (HPTN), HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), Infectious Diseases Clinical&#xD;
      Research Consortium (IDCRC), International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials&#xD;
      Group (IMPAACT), and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG); to be specified in the Site&#xD;
      Announcement Memo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and characterization of the serologic&#xD;
      response to SARS-CoV-2 infection; nasal mid-turbinate swab collection for SARS-CoV-2 RNA&#xD;
      testing; collection of saliva in a subset of participants to evaluate the performance of&#xD;
      diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 assays using these matrices; administration of tablet-based survey.&#xD;
      Medical records abstraction for senior living facility participants who are unable to respond&#xD;
      to the study survey.&#xD;
