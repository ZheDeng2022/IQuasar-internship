      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fat and calcium can build up as plaque in artery walls. The Agatston score measures plaque&#xD;
      using computed tomography (CT) that does not use an injected contrast agent. Plaque in the&#xD;
      arteries of the pelvis and abdomen is linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. It&#xD;
      also may affect cancer. But abdominal CTs use a contrast agent (CECT). Therefore, the&#xD;
      Agatston score cannot be used. Researchers want to find a way to measure plaque in CECTs.&#xD;
      This will help them use abdominal CTs to measure plaque without extra radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure atherosclerotic plaques on CECT in a group of males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men ages 30-90 with prostate cancer (proven with biopsies) who have abdomen CT studies in the&#xD;
      PACS (picture archiving system) in the Clinical Center. Also, men or women of all ages who&#xD;
      have multiphase abdomen and pelvic CT studies that are in the PACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use data gathered since 1/1/2013. Data will also be taken from protocol&#xD;
      03-CC-0128 and clinical trials 15-C-0124, 16-C-0048, 14-C-0112, and 04-C-0274. Participants&#xD;
      from these studies have allowed their samples to be used in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be found via keyword searches on NIH databases. Their CT and MRI scans will&#xD;
      be used. Data such as age, race, disease, and treatment will be used. Results of other tests&#xD;
      may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plaque in participants abdomen and iliac arteries will be measured. It will be compared&#xD;
      with biomarkers related to CVD and prostate cancer, such as weight, age, and race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place at one site. Data will be stored on secure computers. Printouts&#xD;
      will be kept in locked rooms.&#xD;

      Evaluation of Atherosclerotic Plaques in Prostate Cancer Patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study measures atherosclerotic plaques in the vessels of prostate cancer patients in&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), then finds correlation between the plaque and&#xD;
      clinical biomarkers. These biomarkers include laboratory tests, pathologic findings,&#xD;
      underlying risk factors, demographic information, and outcomes of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: Measure atherosclerotic plaques on contrast-enhanced computed tomography&#xD;
      (CECT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: Find correlation between plaque measurement and clinical biomarkers of&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 1,000 NIH Clinical Center patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

        Two separate study populations were recruited. The &quot;Prostate cancer dataset&quot; consisted of&#xD;
        biopsy-proven prostate cancer patients who have abdomen CT studies that were available in&#xD;
        the clinical PACS (picture archiving system) in the Clinical Center. Men of all ages and&#xD;
        races are included. The &quot;Multiphase CT dataset&quot; consisted of men or women of all age and&#xD;
