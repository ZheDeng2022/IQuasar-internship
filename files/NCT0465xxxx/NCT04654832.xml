      Introduction The world health organization defines dehydration as condition that result from&#xD;
      excessive loss of body water .the most common cause of dehydration in children are vomiting&#xD;
      and diarrhea. Dehydration is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infant and young&#xD;
      children world wide .most cases due to consequence of acute gastroenteritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiology. Dehydration cause decrease in total body water in both intracellular and&#xD;
      extracellular fluid volume. Volume depletion closely correlate with sign and symptom of&#xD;
      dehydration .the total body water is higher in infant and children compared to adult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In infant, it is 70% of total body weight, whereas it is 65%and 60% respectively in children&#xD;
      and adult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization recommends assessing dehydration in children based on four&#xD;
      clinical features: general appearance , eyes (whether they appear sunken), history of thirst&#xD;
      , and skin pinch to assess turgor. However, these clinical signs may be subtle or non&#xD;
      specific and thus have important limitations if used as independent predictors of&#xD;
      dehydration. A more objective way to assess for dehydration using urine analysis has been&#xD;
      implicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, studies on dehydration have shown urine analysis do not show sufficient&#xD;
      sensitivity, Specificity or reliability [3, 4] and are typically only useful in children with&#xD;
      moderate to severe hypovolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Bedside ultrasonography is a noninvasive method that can serve as a more objective tool for&#xD;
      assessing dehydration in both adults and children. Point-of-care ultrasound has the potential&#xD;
      to reduce unnecessary use of resources such as IV fluids or hospital access, while&#xD;
      identifying children who are severely dehydrated and need immediate medical attention.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that intravascular volume correlates to the diameters of the&#xD;
      inferior vena cava.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The normal IVC diameter is 15_ 17mm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  small IVC (usually &lt; 12mm) with spontaneous collapse is often seen in the presence of&#xD;
           intravascular volume depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bedside emergency ultrasonography (EUS) is a relatively new imaging modality in&#xD;
      pediatrics.(8,9) EUS is fast, painless, and noninvasive. In recent years, many new pediatric&#xD;
      indications for EUS have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography (US) assessment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) has been used as a&#xD;
      noninvasive diagnostic tool for the assessment of intravascular volume and right heart&#xD;
      function. Specifically, IVC diameter and collapsibility have been used as methods of&#xD;
      assessing fluid status in dehydrated patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these studies, contraction of the intravascular volume resulted in measurable decreases in&#xD;
      IVC diameters. Conversely, research has shown that the diameter of the descending aorta (Ao)&#xD;
      remains mostly constant, despite intravascular volume depletion.&#xD;
