  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and establish the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ION537 when administered by intravenous infusion&#xD;
      in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label, non-randomized, Phase 1, two-part study of ION537 in up&#xD;
      to 102 participants. Part 1 of the study consists of sequential cohort, dose escalation in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors. Part 2 is dose expansion in patients with molecularly&#xD;
      selected advanced solid tumors. In total, the study includes up to 102 participants. The&#xD;
      study will consist of a 30-day screening period, a treatment period consisting of sequential&#xD;
      consecutive treatment cycles (each cycle will be of 28 days) and a post-treatment follow-up&#xD;
      period of at least 28 days following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
