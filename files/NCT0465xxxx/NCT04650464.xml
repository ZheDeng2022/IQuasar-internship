  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children worldwide. Asthma is characterised by a&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways,episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest&#xD;
      tightness and coughing. There is a large variability of asthma prevalence between countries&#xD;
      from 11 to 15% for children in developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma may limit the patient's ability to be physically active and can lead to a sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle and affect patients' quality of life. Indeed, long-term goal of asthma management&#xD;
      as any chronic disease is to control symptoms in order to ensure a normal quality of life to&#xD;
      children with asthma In 1980, the World Health Organization stated that functional capacity&#xD;
      explorations best reflect the impact of a chronic disease on the quality of life. Indeed,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) has become the &quot;gold standard&quot; in functional evaluation&#xD;
      of cardiorespiratory diseases in adults gradually extended to children. Physical fitness is&#xD;
      evaluated by maximal oxygen uptake &quot;VO2 max&quot; during a CPET. CPET also allows to determine&#xD;
      possible limiting factors (cardiac limitation, ventilatory limitation, muscular&#xD;
      deconditioning) responsible for a lower VO2max.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is actually contradictory evidence regarding the aerobic fitness levels of asthmatic&#xD;
      children and it remains unclear whether significant differences exist between asthmatic&#xD;
      children and their non-asthmatic counterparts. Few studies suggest ventilatory exercise&#xD;
      limitations linked to the severity of bronchial obstruction whether others put in light the&#xD;
      impact of muscular deconditioning in the asthmatic population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the investigators aimed to compare the cardiopulmonary fitness of children&#xD;
      with asthma with that of age-adjusted and gender-adjusted controls. The investigators also&#xD;
      intended to identify clinical characteristics associated with VO2max in this population.&#xD;

      This retrospective study was carried out from November 2010 to September 2015 for control&#xD;
      children (already published PMID: 29170358) : and January 2015 to December 2019 for asthmatic&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPET were realised in 2 paediatric CPET laboratories (centre 1: Montpellier University&#xD;
      Hospital, France; centre 2: Paediatric Cardiology and Rehabilitation Centre,&#xD;
      Institut-Saint-Pierre, Palavas-Les-Flots, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 5 to 18 years old were recruited in one of the 2 CPET laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups were identified: children with asthma and the control children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The asthma group consisted of children followed for asthma by any pediatrician or&#xD;
           pulmonologist and referred to one of the 2 CPET laboratories. The following clinical&#xD;
           data were collected : gender, weight, height, treatments to deduce treatment level (GINA&#xD;
           step), associated pathologies, activity level, symptoms during exercice&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The control group consisted of children referred for a non-severe functional symptom&#xD;
           linked to exercise (murmur, palpitation, or dyspnoea) or for a medical sports&#xD;
           certificate. These children were classified in the control group only after a completely&#xD;
           normal check-up, including physical examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiography,&#xD;
           and spirometry. Children with any chronic disease, medical condition (cardiac,&#xD;
           neurologic, respiratory, muscular, or renal), or medical treatment and those requiring&#xD;
           any further specialized medical consultation were not eligible. The clinical data&#xD;
           collected concerned gender, weight, height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPET procedures in both centres were harmonized before the study started. Spirometry was&#xD;
      systematically performed before the exercise test with a flow volume curve and measurement of&#xD;
      forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and the FEV1/FVC&#xD;
      ratio (FEV1/FVC), with normalization to GLI 2012 Z scores. The same investigator coordinator&#xD;
      manually calculated the VO2max and the ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) using Beaver's&#xD;
      method. VO2max and VAT values were normalized in a percentage of the predicted VO2max using&#xD;
      normal values from Wasserman and Cooper. The investigators considered VO2max below 80% of&#xD;
      predicted value as pathologic value and a VAT value below 55 % of predicted VO2max was in&#xD;
      favor of muscular deconditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All informations from CPET were recorded : heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), estimated&#xD;
      VO2/HR, VAT, breathing reserves (BR), respiratory rate (RR), VE/VCO2 slope, Tidal Volume (VT)&#xD;
