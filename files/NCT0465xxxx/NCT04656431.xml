      This phase I trial evaluates the feasibility of using hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing patients with primary central nervous system&#xD;
      lymphoma. This trial aims to see whether MRI using hyperpolarized carbon-13 pyruvate is safe&#xD;
      and useful for detecting central nervous system lymphoma and evaluating response to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the safety and tolerability of hyperpolarized 13C MR metabolic imaging as a&#xD;
           new and unique tool in the evaluation of tumor burden and detecting early response to&#xD;
           standard therapy in participants with PCNSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the feasibility of hyperpolarized 13C as a new and unique tool in the&#xD;
           evaluation of tumor burden and detecting early response to standard therapy in PCNSL&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To define the most appropriate imaging parameters for obtaining 13C data from PCNSL&#xD;
           participants (Cohort 1, n=5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate changes in Cohort 2 in imaging pre- and post- high-dose methotrexate,&#xD;
           temozolomide plus rituximab (MTX-R) based therapy using the parameters found in Cohort 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the hypothesis that genetic markers of nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer&#xD;
           of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation in PCNSL diagnostic specimens correlate with&#xD;
           high lactate signal on metabolic imaging and with high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate&#xD;
           concentration on baseline pre-treatment CSF evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the hypothesis that genetic markers of NF-kB activation correlate with a smaller&#xD;
           decrease in lactate on repeat metabolic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and in repeat&#xD;
           CSF evaluation after standard induction methotrexate-based therapy and that genetic&#xD;
           markers of NF-kB activation and high lactate signals correlate with lower rate of&#xD;
           complete radiographic response on conventional MRI and shorter progression-free survival&#xD;
           (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate intravenously (IV) and undergo&#xD;
      MRI at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate IV and undergo MRI at&#xD;
      baseline, up to 2 weeks after finishing 3 cycles of standard high-dose methotrexate,&#xD;
      temozolomide plus rituximab therapy, and at disease progression (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are followed for 48 hours after injection for adverse events. After completion&#xD;
      of study, patients in Cohort 2 are followed up every 3 months for 2 years after completion of&#xD;
      therapy, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and then annually for the next 5 years.&#xD;
