  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) suffer from high morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
      cardiovascular and infectious disease and increased risk of all-cause mortality which is&#xD;
      mainly attributed to the disturbed immune response. More and more evident indicated that T&#xD;
      cell dysfunction was universal in ESRD. However, few studies clarified the association of T&#xD;
      cell dysfunction and clinical outcomes. This study is aim to explore valuable markers of T&#xD;
      cell dysfunction predicting bad clinical outcomes including death, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      infection and tumor. Hopefully, these finding will provide foundation for further mechanism&#xD;
      research and better therapeutic options for ESRD patients in the future.&#xD;

      Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) suffer from high morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
      cardiovascular and infectious disease and increased risk of all-cause mortality which is&#xD;
      mainly attributed to the disturbed immune response. More and more evident indicated that T&#xD;
      cell dysfunction was universal in ESRD. Recent evidence suggests uremia-related immune&#xD;
      changes resemble to aging immune system, increasing immunological age of T cells by 20-30&#xD;
      years. As compared to an age-matched healthy control, ESRD patients present a lower thymic&#xD;
      output of na√Øve T cells, a decline in the T-cell telomere length and an increase in the&#xD;
      differentiation status towards the terminal differentiated memory phenotype with a large&#xD;
      number of CD28-negative T cells. More importantly, these changes are strongly associated with&#xD;
      a history of cardiovascular diseases and the occurrence of severe infectious episodes in this&#xD;
      population, supporting the idea that T cell dysfunction is a critical feature in this&#xD;
      population and will impact clinical outcomes profoundly. This study prospectively researched&#xD;
      the predictive value of T cell dysfunction for all-cause mortality and clinical complication&#xD;
      in hemodialysis (HD) patients.&#xD;
