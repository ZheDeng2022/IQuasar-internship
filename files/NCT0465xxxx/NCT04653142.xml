  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to Japanese adults with advanced cancer (solid tumors). This is a study in&#xD;
      people for whom previous treatment was not successful and for whom no standard therapy&#xD;
      exists. The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of BI 765063 that people can&#xD;
      tolerate when taken alone or together with a medicine called BI 754091. BI 765063 and BI&#xD;
      754091 are antibodies that may help the immune system fight cancer (checkpoint inhibitors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants get BI 765063 alone or together with BI 754091 as infusion every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate&#xD;
      it. The doctors check the health of the participants and note any health problems that could&#xD;
      have been caused by BI 765063 or BI 754091.&#xD;
