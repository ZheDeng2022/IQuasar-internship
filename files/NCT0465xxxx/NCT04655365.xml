      This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL (PyL) PET/CT in&#xD;
      subjects presenting not previously treated for castration resistant prostate cancer and&#xD;
      showing negative or equivocal findings per institutional standard of care conventional&#xD;
      imaging&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common solid organ cancer in North American men and is&#xD;
      initially androgen sensitive. Therefore, castration and/or androgen receptor blockade remains&#xD;
      the central palliative treatment once PCa has metastasized or failed to locoregional&#xD;
      therapies. Because androgen deprivation therapy is not curative, all patients will eventually&#xD;
      progress to the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer state. About 5% of prostate&#xD;
      cancers will be metastatic by conventional imaging techniques at diagnosis while most&#xD;
      patients achieving CRPC state will first be localized and then progress to metastatic state&#xD;
      later in the disease course. Therefore, a significant proportion of patients will progress&#xD;
      through an intermediary state of disease defined as the non-metastatic CRPC state (M0CRPC).&#xD;
      Over the last year and a half, M0CRPC treatment landscape has completely changed with&#xD;
      demonstrating the benefits of second-generation antiandrogens (darolutamide, enzalutamide and&#xD;
      apalutamide) to prevent progression of M0CRPC patients. Enzalutamide have then been approved&#xD;
      by the Federal Drug Administration and Health Canada for the treatment of M0CRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, conventional imaging techniques based on bone turnover (bone scan (BS)) or&#xD;
      anatomical features (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT)) have&#xD;
      important limitations and poor accuracy. Bone scans (BS) is the commonest imaging technique&#xD;
      used to detect bone metastases in the clinics. BS does not image directly cancer cells, but&#xD;
      the effect of cancer on the bone. Other pathologies such as fractures, degenerative arthritis&#xD;
      and other benign bone lesions can also cause focal uptake on BS and lead to false-positive&#xD;
      results. Another drawback of BS is its poor sensitivity to image small metastases confined to&#xD;
      bone marrow. These limitations stress the importance to improve PCa imaging by using new&#xD;
      imaging modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because novel agents targeting the androgen synthesis and receptor axis (e.g. enzalutamide),&#xD;
      bone metastasis (radium-223) and microtubules assembly (docetaxel, cabazitaxel) have been&#xD;
      shown to increase metastatic CRPC patients overall survival, a burning question is to&#xD;
      determine if the non-metastatic CRPC status is real. There is growing evidence that newer&#xD;
      imaging techniques using positron emission tomography can improve metastasis detection&#xD;
      accuracy and may refine PCa patient prognostic stratification and treatment eligibility.&#xD;
