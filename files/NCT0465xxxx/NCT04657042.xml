      The purpose of this study is to develop new ways to make medical images of the lungs and&#xD;
      liver of adults using a technique called four-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (4D-MRI). This technique produces three-dimensional movies of the inside of the chest and&#xD;
      abdomen while the patient is breathing. (The fourth dimension is time!)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new way of medical imaging is being developed to help cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is used to treat cancerous tumors. For radiation therapy&#xD;
      to be effective, the precise size, shape, and location of the tumor within the body must be&#xD;
      known. A particular difficulty for radiation treatment of lung and liver cancer is that the&#xD;
      tumor moves during treatment because the patient is breathing. Therefore, tumor motion must&#xD;
      also be incorporated into the treatment plan. This study aims to improve radiation treatment&#xD;
      planning through better targeting and dose estimation based on 4D-MRI. Before this new&#xD;
      imaging method can be used for radiation treatment planning, it must be tested in living,&#xD;
      breathing volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy for cancer has been a forerunner of personalized medicine, developing&#xD;
      individualized treatments based on patient-specific anatomical information. Despite many&#xD;
      advances in radiotherapy over the past decade, which have effectively enhanced local or&#xD;
      loco-regional tumor control for many patients, there remains substantial room for&#xD;
      improvement. The challenges for radiotherapy to further widen the therapeutic window in the&#xD;
      era of precision medicine are mainly two-fold: (a) further improve radiation dose conformity&#xD;
      to the defined target volume, and (b) adapt novel biological strategies for personalized&#xD;
      treatment. Four-dimensional (4D) imaging and deformable image registration (DIR) are key&#xD;
      tools in modern radiotherapy, playing critical roles in many recent advances, including 4D&#xD;
      radiotherapy, adaptive radiotherapy, and treatment assessment. However, current 4D imaging&#xD;
      and DIR technologies are facing significant challenges as the requirement for precision&#xD;
      increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of 4D imaging in radiotherapy is 4D-CT. However, it has two major&#xD;
      limitations preventing it from precision radiotherapy applications: (a) low soft-tissue&#xD;
      contrast. 4D-CT is therefore not ideal for abdominal applications; (b) motion artifacts&#xD;
      caused by irregular breathing. 4D-CT motion artifacts have been shown to cause errors in&#xD;
      various radiotherapy applications, including motion measurement, target volume delineation,&#xD;
      dose calculation, DIR, and lung ventilation calculation. 4D-MRI is an emerging 4D imaging&#xD;
      technology for radiotherapy. It has superior soft-tissue contrast to 4D-CT and is therefore&#xD;
      superb for abdominal imaging. Despite many recent advances in 4D-MRI, current 4D-MRI&#xD;
      implementations have inadequate image quality for precision radiotherapy application due to&#xD;
      at least one of the following deficiencies: low temporal and/or spatial resolutions, long&#xD;
      image acquisition time, and suboptimal contrast in the lungs. Resulting 4D-MRI images lack&#xD;
      sufficient anatomical details for clinical applications, which can adversely affect the&#xD;
      performance of DIR. Current DIR techniques focus on morphological similarity but not on the&#xD;
      physiological plausibility of the deformation. Studies have shown that an increased&#xD;
      morphological similarity of the aligned data does not always imply increased registration&#xD;
      accuracy. Therefore, more sophisticated approaches are desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will take a systematic approach to address the aforementioned limitations&#xD;
      of 4D imaging and deformable image registration (DIR) based on the development and&#xD;
      cross-fertilization of two major techniques: ultra-quality 4D-MRI and physiological-based&#xD;
      hybrid DIR. There are two parts of this research, comprising three main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1. Technical development in healthy subjects: The investigators will extend their&#xD;
      existing pulse sequence strategy for ultra-quality 3D MRI to enable ultra-quality 4D-MRI.&#xD;
      Compared to 4D-CT and current 4D-MRI techniques, the proposed ultra-quality 4D-MRI technique&#xD;
      offers the following advantages: (a) high spatial resolution (1.5 mm isotropic) with rich&#xD;
      image features (e.g. vessel trees) in the whole torso; (b) high temporal pseudo-resolution&#xD;
      (&gt;20 phases/cycle); and (c) (nearly) free of motion artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Objective 1: Develop an MRI pulse sequence and image reconstruction pipeline that generates&#xD;
      images meeting these three design goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2. Evaluation of 4D-MRI in a patient study: 4D-MRI will be compared with existing DIR&#xD;
      and 4D-CT methods. There will be two classes of comparisons, each formulated as a separate&#xD;
      objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 2: Compare motion modelling based on 4D-MRI with deformable image registration&#xD;
           (DIR) in healthy volunteers and cancer patients. An improved motion modeling method will&#xD;
           be developed that is tailored for the ultra-quality 4D-MRI applications. The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize that a new motion modeling method based on 4D-MRI will&#xD;
           outperform current DIR algorithms for respiratory motion estimation. This hypothesis&#xD;
           will be tested by comparing the new method to five DIR algorithms which include a mix of&#xD;
           commercial software and publicly available algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 3: Compare 4D-MRI with 4D-CT in lung and liver cancer patients. The overall&#xD;
           hypothesis of this objective is that the ultra-quality 4D-MRI provides better image&#xD;
           quality than 4D-CT for motion management of radiotherapy in the lungs and the liver,&#xD;
           especially in patients with irregular breathing.&#xD;
