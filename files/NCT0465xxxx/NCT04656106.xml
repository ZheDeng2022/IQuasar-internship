    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional (observational), retrospective medical record review study&#xD;
      collecting data reported in medical records of patients with T2D (Type 2 Diabetes ) who were&#xD;
      treated with any basal-insulin or premix-insulin (plus/minus OAD (Oral Antidiabetic Drug))&#xD;
      for at least 26 weeks prior to switching to Ryzodeg® and treated for at least 26 weeks after&#xD;
      switching to Ryzodeg® (plus/minus OAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have been treated at the discretion of the treating physician in accordance with&#xD;
      the Ryzodeg® label in South Korea.&#xD;
