  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 portion of this study is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized&#xD;
      interventional study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction, safety, and efficacy&#xD;
      of ASTX727 when given in combination with venetoclax for the treatment of newly diagnosed&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults who are age 75 years or older, or who have&#xD;
      comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy. The primary purpose of&#xD;
      the study is to rule out drug-drug interactions between ASTX727 and venetoclax combination&#xD;
      therapy by evaluating area under the curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 portion of the study is to assess the efficacy of ASTX727 and venetoclax when&#xD;
      given in combination and to evaluate potential PK interactions. Phase 2 will follow the same&#xD;
      overall study design as Phase 1.&#xD;
