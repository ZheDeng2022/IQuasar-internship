      Pain mechanisms in chronic pancreatitis (CP) are heterogeneous and includes nociception,&#xD;
      pancreatic neuropathy and central neuropathy/neuroplasty. These mechanisms could occur&#xD;
      simultaneously in variable proportions and could explain why several patients develop&#xD;
      recurrence of pain even after being treated by all the currently available modalities, such&#xD;
      as antioxidants, endoscopic therapies and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the studies by the investigators over the past 2 years, they observed that persistent pain&#xD;
      in these patients was associated with varying grades of depression and poor quality of life.&#xD;
      This was accompanied by alteration in the metabolites in the brain (anterior cingulate&#xD;
      cortex, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia) as evidenced in magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain. These areas in the brain are responsible for pain&#xD;
      modulation, long-term pain memory and emotional responses to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the investigators counselled these patients and explained their disease and possible&#xD;
      outcomes based on their own clinical course, imaging and treatment response (personalized&#xD;
      education/counselling), they reported significant improvement in depression, quality of life&#xD;
      parameters and, interestingly, also in pain. Further, there were changes in the metabolite&#xD;
      parameters in the brain on MRS after personalized counselling/education that was more similar&#xD;
      to that of healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This led to our hypothesis that better understanding of the disease and its outcomes by the&#xD;
      patients could improve their coping capabilities and increase their pain thresholds. This&#xD;
      could augment the pain responses of these patients to the other therapeutic modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct this single blinded, placebo controlled, randomized controlled trial on&#xD;
      patients with documented CP of over 3 years duration, who had at least 5 episodes of&#xD;
      abdominal pain of over the past 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is characterised by pain, exocrine insufficiency and endocrine&#xD;
      dysfunction. Of all symptoms, intractable abdominal pain is the most debilitating that&#xD;
      mandates a multidisciplinary treatment approaches. Long term treatment of pain begins with&#xD;
      antioxidants. If the pancreatic duct contains stones in a limited area (head, neck and&#xD;
      proximal body), the patient is subjected to endoscopic treatment, which includes&#xD;
      extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for large stones (&gt;5mm) with or without&#xD;
      pancreatic duct stenting. For smaller stones, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography&#xD;
      (ERCP) alone suffices. ERCP with pancreatic ductal stenting is also the first line treatment&#xD;
      for a solitary symptomatic pancreatic ductal stricture. If symptomatic stones are located all&#xD;
      along the pancreatic duct, or if there are multiple strictures, surgical drainage of the&#xD;
      pancreatic duct becomes the treatment of choice. If there are any mass lesion in the pancreas&#xD;
      on the background of CP, then resection procedures such as Whipple's operation or distal&#xD;
      pancreatectomy with/without splenectomy is resorted to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the above mentioned modalities are directed to relief the patient of pain, a&#xD;
      substantial proportion of patients return with recurrence of pain. This explains the&#xD;
      complexity in the pain mechanisms in CP. Pain mechanisms in chronic pancreatitis (CP) are&#xD;
      heterogeneous and includes nociception, pancreatic neuropathy and central&#xD;
      neuropathy/neuroplasticity. These mechanisms could occur simultaneously in variable&#xD;
      proportions and could explain why several patients develop recurrence of pain even after&#xD;
      being treated by all the currently available modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One aspect that is often overlooked in studies involving pain mechanisms and management.&#xD;
      Since CP is a chronic disease with systemic effects, several additional factors could impact&#xD;
      the evolution and response to pain. These could include the patient's personality traits,&#xD;
      educational background, family history of CP, previous experience of the disease, background&#xD;
      knowledge of CP, coping capability, to name a few. The investigators have been working on&#xD;
      these aspects for the past couple of years, wherein they looked into the mental status&#xD;
      (depression/anxiety), quality of life and the impact of pain in these aspects. Since pain&#xD;
      memory and emotional responses to pain is mediated by the basal ganglia, hippocampus,&#xD;
      anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex of the brain, the investigators also looked&#xD;
      at the metabolites in these areas using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The investigators&#xD;
      observed that persistent pain in these patients will be associated with varying grades of&#xD;
      depression and poor quality of life. This was accompanied by alteration in the metabolites&#xD;
      myoinositol, creatine, glycine/glutamate in the hippocampus, and basal ganglia Following&#xD;
      this, when the investigators counselled these patients and explained their disease and&#xD;
      possible outcomes based on their own clinical course, imaging and treatment response&#xD;
      (personalized education/counselling), they reported significant improvement in depression,&#xD;
      quality of life parameters and, interestingly, also in pain. Further, there were changes in&#xD;
      the metabolite parameters in the brain on MRS after personalized counselling/education that&#xD;
      were more closer to that of healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This led to the hypothesis that better understanding of the disease and its outcomes by the&#xD;
      patients could improve their coping capabilities and increase their pain thresholds. This&#xD;
      could augment the pain responses of these patients to the other therapeutic modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct this single blinded, placebo controlled, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial on patients with documented CP of over 3 years duration, who had at least 5 episodes of&#xD;
      abdominal pain of over the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will provide detailed education regarding the disease to the patients&#xD;
      (based on their disease characteristics) in the study arm and evaluate the changes in pain&#xD;
      scores, pain episodes, QOL, mental status and metabolomic status in the brain (hippocampus,&#xD;
      basal ganglia, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex).&#xD;
