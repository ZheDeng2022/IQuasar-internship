    <textblock>
      For nearly half a century, supraglottic airway devices (SGA) have been used in pediatric&#xD;
      patients, which are more practical than face masks, facilitate oxygenation and ventilation&#xD;
      without the need for endotracheal intubation, and less invasive than endotracheal tubes.&#xD;
      I-Gel is a supraglottic airway management device introduced in 2007, made of a medical grade&#xD;
      thermoplastic elastomer, designed to create a non-inflatable, anatomical seal in the&#xD;
      pharyngeal, laryngeal and perilaryngeal structures that prevents compression trauma.&#xD;
      Recently, the use of I-Gel has become popular in children undergoing surgery that does not&#xD;
      require muscle relaxation. It is important to place an I-Gel in the most appropriate position&#xD;
      in order to provide adequate ventilation and prevent complications such as mucosal injury,&#xD;
      glottic ptosis, and gastric insufflation with potential aspiration. Successful placement is&#xD;
      usually clinically assessed by a capnogram with endtidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) value, visual&#xD;
      examination and auscultation with appropriate chest elevation, absence of oropharyngeal&#xD;
      leakage at 20 cm H2O peak inspiratory pressure. Although Fiberoptic Bronchoscope (FOB) is&#xD;
      accepted as the preferred verification tool for direct visualization, some studies on I-Gel&#xD;
      position using FOB reported that I-Gel placement should be repositioned in some children&#xD;
      (12.8-49%). Ultrasonography (USG), which has recently entered the practice of upper airway&#xD;
      examination, has become a valuable, non-invasive, simple and portable technology for&#xD;
      evaluating airway management even in upper airway anatomy impaired by pathology or trauma.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the use of USG with the FOB to evaluate I-Gel placement&#xD;
      in pediatric patients. The primary endpoint is to compare the incidence of for I-Gel&#xD;
      malposition between USG and FOB. Secondary endpoints are to find the correlation between&#xD;
      I-Gel's USG and FOB-detected malposition and to determine the diagnostic performance of the&#xD;
      USG.&#xD;

      The population of the study was created from the parents of pediatric patients who were&#xD;
      scheduled for elective pediatric surgery under general anesthesia between December 2020 and&#xD;
      February 2021 at Selcuk University Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation. All patients&#xD;
      were monitored with standard monitoring (ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, SpO2, ETCO2,&#xD;
      Ppeak), after a minimum of 2 minutes of preoxygenation, mask ventilation was performed with&#xD;
      6-7% sevoflurane at the beginning of general anesthesia induction. Intravenous vein access&#xD;
      was provided, and according to standard procedures; propofol 3.5 mg.kg 1, fentanyl 1 mg.kg 1&#xD;
      iv and remifentanil 0.1 mcg kg min 1 infusion was administered, but neuromuscular blocker was&#xD;
      not used. The choice of the size of the I-Gel was selected according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations (size 1: 2-5 kg, size 1.5: 5 to 12 kg, size 2: 10 to 25 kg). Adequate&#xD;
      anesthesia depth was confirmed by loss of eyelash reflex, symmetrical small pupils and&#xD;
      absence of swallowing, and was guided gently along the hard palate by the 1st&#xD;
      anesthesiologist until resistance was felt, with the I-Gel opening facing the applicator. If&#xD;
      the patient did not tolerate the insertion of the I-Gel, an extra dose of fentanyl up to a&#xD;
      maximum of 0.5 mcg / kg in total was administered. However, if the insertion attempt was&#xD;
      still not tolerated, or if the capnography curve was not obtained and there was an audible&#xD;
      leak, the technique was considered to be unsuccessful, and another SGA was then placed in the&#xD;
      airway. If this change was not tolerated, endotracheal intubation was initiated by applying&#xD;
      neuromuscular blocker and these were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      USG examination of the neck was performed by the second anesthesiologist using an 8-18 MHz&#xD;
      linear probe Esaote Imaging was done in three planes (Transverse plane between hyoid bone and&#xD;
      thyroid bone, Transverse plane of the lateral suprasternal notch and Parasagittal plane of&#xD;
      pharynx and larynx) the USG score was assigned to the deployment view using a modification of&#xD;
      the criteria proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fiberoptic bronchoscope was passed through I-Gel until the glottis image was&#xD;
      obtained.Optimal placement was defined as the end of the I-Gel behind the arytenoids, with a&#xD;
      visible epiglottis, with or without folding to the airway, and the vocal cords are visible&#xD;
      when the FOB is advanced under the epiglottis.&#xD;
