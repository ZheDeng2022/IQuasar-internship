    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, pivotal clinical study&#xD;
      evaluating the adult dose (1 x10E4 TCID50 per 0.5 mL) of VLA1553 in comparison to a placebo&#xD;
      control. VLA1553 and control will be administered as single immunization on Day 1. Overall,&#xD;
      750 male and female subjects aged 12 years to &lt;18 years will be enrolled (i.e. ICF signed) in&#xD;
      the study, stratified by baseline serostatus: 20% seropositive and 80% seronegative for&#xD;
      CHIKV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to VLA1553 (n= 500) or control group (n= 250).&#xD;
      Approximately 385 subjects will be randomized to the immunogenicity subset. Thereof,&#xD;
      approximately 75 subjects will constitute the viremia subset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will return to the study site at Day 8 (Visit 2), Day 29 (Visit 3), Month 3 (Day&#xD;
      85, Visit 4) and Month 6 (Day 180, Visit 5) for safety evaluations and immunogenicity&#xD;
      sampling. However, immunogenicity analysis and evaluations will only be done in the&#xD;
      immunogenicity subset. Subjects in the viremia subset will have viremia samples collected at&#xD;
      Visits 1, 2 and 3. Samples from Visit 1 and 2 will be analyzed. The collected viremia sample&#xD;
      of Visit 3 will only be analysed if sample of Visit 2 is positive. In addition, for&#xD;
      clinically indicated retrospective analysis viremia samples will be collected throughout the&#xD;
      study from ALL subjects. Safety data collection will capture all AEs up to Month 6 (Visit 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Day 180 (Visit 5), AE collection will be limited to SAEs. Subjects from the&#xD;
      immunogenicity subset will also return to the study site at Month 12 (Day 365, Visit 6) for&#xD;
      collection and assessment of immunogenicity samples. In addition, a clinical sample for&#xD;
      safety laboratory evaluations will be obtained at all study visits from the immunogenicity&#xD;
      subset only.&#xD;

             previous 3 years; topical and inhaled steroids are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has a history of any vaccine related contraindicating event (e.g.,&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Subject has a rash, dermatological condition or tattoos that would, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator, interfere with injection site reaction rating;&#xD;

             the Investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject has any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may compromise the&#xD;
             subjects well-being, might interfere with evaluation of study endpoints, or would&#xD;
             limit the subject's ability to complete the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject is committed to an institution (by virtue of an order issued either by the&#xD;
             judicial or the administrative authorities);&#xD;
&#xD;

             axillary temperature greater than or equal 37.8°C on the day of vaccination (subject&#xD;
             may be rescheduled within the screening visit window until subject has completed 72&#xD;
             hours without fever).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has received antipyretics within 4 hours prior to the scheduled time of&#xD;
