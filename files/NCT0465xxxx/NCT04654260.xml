  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial of a novel intervention, Behavioral Therapy for Irritability and&#xD;
      Aggression (BTIA), for adolescents on the autism spectrum. The main goals of BTIA are to help&#xD;
      adolescents develop emotion regulation skills to handle frustration and to strengthen skills&#xD;
      for navigating the challenging and diverse experiences associated with the transition to&#xD;
      adulthood. The study will test whether BTIA can be helpful to adolescents on the autism&#xD;
      spectrum and to their families.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study of BTIA versus a supportive therapy control condition&#xD;
      in 126 adolescents (ages 12 to 18 years) with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and&#xD;
      significant levels of disruptive behaviors such as aggression, anger outbursts, and&#xD;
      oppositional behavior. BTIA consists of 15 ninety-minute weekly sessions that will be&#xD;
      conducted with the teens and their parents by therapists using a structured, detailed manual.&#xD;
      The effects of BTIA on the reduction of behavioral problems will be rated by an experienced&#xD;
      clinician who does not know which treatment each participant is receiving (a &quot;blinded&quot;&#xD;
      evaluator). Study participants will receive a thorough diagnostic assessment of autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorder and other forms of psychopathology that may co-occur with ASD. In addition&#xD;
      to testing the effects of BTIA on disruptive behavior, the changes in adaptive functioning,&#xD;
      or children's ability to function competently in their everyday environment, will be examined&#xD;
      before and after treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Score assigned by an independent evaluator (IE) who will be blind to treatment assignment is the categorical primary outcome measure of aggressive behavior. The CGI-I reflects the IE's assessment of overall change from baseline rated on a scale from 1 to 7 where 1 is very much improved, 2 is much improved, 3 is minimally improved, 4 is no change, 5 is minimally worse, 6 is much worth, and 7 is very much worse. Higher scores reflect worse outcome. By convention, ratings of very much improved (1) or much improved (2) define positive response; all other scores are classified as a negative response.</description>

    <description>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vineland-3) is a measure of competence in communication, daily living skills, and socialization which is administered in a semi-structured parent interview format. Items assess the individual's behavior in these domains and are rated according to the frequency with which behaviors are performed without help or prompting (i.e., &quot;Never,&quot; &quot;Sometimes&quot; or &quot;Usually&quot;). The raw scores are converted to standard scores (mean = 100, SD = 15; range 40 to 160), and higher scores indicate better adaptive functioning.</description>

    <description>The child-focused components of BTIA are organized in modules dedicated to emotion regulation, problem solving and practice of planned steps to prevent or resolve conflicts. Each session contains a set of six to seven goals, and each goal contains a menu of techniques and activities that can be used to attain this goal. In order to administer the treatment in a flexible yet reliable manner, the therapist works collaboratively with the child and his or her parents to select activities that are perceived as relevant for attaining the session's goal. The parent-focused components of BTIA include include education about the effects of antecedents and consequences on disruptive behavior, developing strategies for reducing or altering antecedent events that may lead to disruptive reactions and helping parents to use reinforcement of competent and calm responses in potentially frustrating situations.</description>

    <ipd_description>Research data from this study will be shared via the National Database for Autism Research and NIH Data Repositories (https://nda.nih.gov/) consistent with the Yale University Policy. The data management for this study will be conducted using the OnCore system at YCCI (https://medicine.yale.edu/ycci/oncore/), which enables translation of data to de-identified data sets that can be placed online using GUID technology as specified in Federal guidelines. At the time of permission/consent/assent, participants and their parents will be informed of the data-sharing plan. Raw data generated by the project will be quality-certified by our research team (including fidelity to research procedures, proper file format, artifact removal, and de-identifying, resulting in artifact-free raw data) prior to submission to NDAR for usability. Consistent with the NDAR data sharing policy, data will be submitted, at the individual level, on all enrolled subjects.</ipd_description>
