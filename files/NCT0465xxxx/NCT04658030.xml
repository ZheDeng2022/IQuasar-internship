  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: This study is part of the larger Immersive Care project which (in short) seeks the&#xD;
      connection between technology and care by conducting feasibility studies with promising&#xD;
      technological interventions tailored to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is one of the case studies from the larger project titled: 360 ° video VR surgery&#xD;
      preparation: feasibility, acceptability, tolerability and initial effectiveness of virtual&#xD;
      reality for children in a Flemish hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Domain: This scientific study will take place in 1 hospital on the pediatric ward. The target&#xD;
      group consists of children between 6 and 12 years of age who will undergo an operation, the&#xD;
      parents and the care providers involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the acceptability, feasibility and tolerability of the 360 ° video VR surgery&#xD;
           preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the effectiveness of the 360 ° video VR surgery preparation on preoperative&#xD;
           procedural anxiety in children, comparing the intervention with care as usual (CAU *).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CAU in this study is a picture book which is a kind of animated video with text to&#xD;
                explain what will happen on the day of the operation.&#xD;

    <description>Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology tests the acceptance of the staff towards the intervention in this study.&#xD;
Assess change in patient attitude towards the intervention with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) questionnaire survey. The UTAUT questionnaire survey for end-users consists of 20 items with five response options ranging from &quot;Totally disagree&quot; to &quot;Totally agree&quot;. The questionnaire survey consists of 7 subscales, for most of which higher scores indicate a more positive attitude towards the intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of physical side effects after exposure to VR by the Pediatric Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (Peds SSQ).&#xD;
The Peds SSQ contains queries that probe 4 symptom categories: (1) eye strain (queries 1-4); (2) head and neck discomfort (queries 5 and 6); (3) sleepiness (solipsism) or fatigue (queries 7 and 8); and dizziness or nausea (visually induced motion sickness, queries 9-13). The scale that is used is a likert scale (with additional faces) ranging from 0 to 6 per query (0 = no of the above &quot;complaints&quot;; 6 = a lot of the above &quot;complaints&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Usability of the intervention: System Usability Scale (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of ease of use of the intervention with the System Usability Scale (SUS). The SUS is a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. A higher SUS score indicates better usability.</description>

    <measure>Patient satisfaction: Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of client satisfaction with the VR application with the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). The CSQ-8 consists of 8 items with four response options. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction.</description>
