      This study examines uptake and attrition for internet based treatments for panic disorder and&#xD;
      depression in Israel The primary benefits of this work will be a) in providing better&#xD;
      understanding of ICBT for panic disorder and depression outcomes. Both panic and depression&#xD;
      are heavy public health burdens, associated with a significant market potential for both&#xD;
      therapeutic and diagnostic uses. b) In providing compatible scale to measure the working&#xD;
      alliance during internet-based treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study examines ICBT for panic and depression in Israel. Compelling evidence&#xD;
      regarding the efficacy of ICBT has been reported for the treatment of depression and various&#xD;
      anxiety disorders (Mayo-Wilson &amp; Montgomery; 2013). This the first study to examine ICBT for&#xD;
      panic and depression in Israel. The primary focus will be on treatment outcomes (symptom&#xD;
      reduction and improved functioning), attrition, and acceptability and comparing outcomes to&#xD;
      previous studies of face to face and internet treatments, including on the main proposed&#xD;
      mechanism of change; interpretation of bodily sensations via the BBSIQ. The efficacy of ICBT&#xD;
      has been established in many studies, but is insufficient for implementation without&#xD;
      adaptation to local cultural needs and language. We will also examine changes in healthcare&#xD;
      utilization and costs according to the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the full programs of the current study see: https://www.iterapi.se/sites/icbt_israel and&#xD;
      https://www.iterapi.se/sites/depression_israel/&#xD;
&#xD;
      The limited role of the therapist in ICBT is mainly to allow greater scaling. a second goal&#xD;
      of the current study is to fill this gap by examining different aspects of the alliance with&#xD;
      treatment outcomes and attrition using a newly developed self-report measure, the Internet&#xD;
      Patient Experiences and Attunement Responsiveness (I-PEAR). We propose that the I-PEAR and&#xD;
      its subscales (I-PEAR program; hereafter I-PEARp, I-PEAR therapist; hereafter I-PEARt; and&#xD;
      Therapist-rated I-PEAR; hereafter thI-PEAR) will explain more variance of the outcome and&#xD;
      dropouts than traditional scales (i.e., WAI-6, WAI-T). In the current study we examined the&#xD;
      relationship between the alliance measures to treatment outcomes and attrition. Alll&#xD;
      secondary measures will be examined in terms of change and how their change is related to&#xD;
      change in symptoms (PDSS, ASI, MI in panic, PHQ, HAM-D in depression). These analyses include&#xD;
      changes in attachment, insight, and emotions. Research is limited about the role of insight&#xD;
      in panic disorder, therefore another secondary aim of this study is to examine the role of&#xD;
      clinical (i.e., SAIQ and SAI) and cognitive insight (i.e., BCIS and BABS) in panic disorder,&#xD;
      if they change and their relationship to symptom severity (i.e., PDSS, ASI, MI), symptom&#xD;
      change, and correlates (e.g., cognitive flexibility, metacognition, jumping to conclusions,&#xD;
      and implicit theories). Secondary studies will examine changes in self-criticism, emotion&#xD;
      preferences and goals, sexual functioning, and curiosity and their relationship to outcomes.&#xD;
