    <textblock>
      Patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma high-risk patients will be&#xD;
      given 450 mg orally (PO) daily (QD) plus binimetinib 45 mg PO twice daily (BID) together with&#xD;
      nivolumab administered intravenously (IV) at 3mg/kg and ipilimumab administered IV at 1 mg/kg&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab administered IV at 480mg every 4 weeks until&#xD;
      progression or discontinuation due to toxicity. Concurrently, a triple therapy arm will be&#xD;
      explored with encorafenib 300 mg PO QD together with ipilimumab administered IV at 1mg/kg and&#xD;
      nivolumab 3mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab administered at 480mg&#xD;
      every 4 weeks until progression or discontinuation due to toxicity. Tolerability of the two&#xD;
      arms will be compared, and a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined. After&#xD;
      determination of treatment schedule, expansion cohorts will further explore the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy and further describe the toxicity profile of the triplet or quadruplet regimen in&#xD;
      high-risk cohorts including symptomatic brain metastases or liver metastases with elevated&#xD;
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or bulky systemic disease burden.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Study participants will consist of metastatic melanoma patients harboring BRAFV600E/K&#xD;
      mutation without previous frontline therapy or recently started treatment with up to 6 weeks&#xD;
      of targeted therapy (or &gt; 6 months from adjuvant therapy). Toxicity from prior treatment must&#xD;
      have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 and not included previous Grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events&#xD;
      (irAEs) that required treatment discontinuation or previous Grade 2 immune-related uveitis or&#xD;
      pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I, Cohort 1: Twelve patients will be treated with 300mg encorafenib and 3mg/kg&#xD;
      nivolumab and 1 mg/kg ipilimumab. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) for cohort 1 will be&#xD;
      evaluated between weeks 1-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I, Cohort 2: Upfront quadruple therapy with 450mg encorafenib, 45mg binimetinib, 3mg/kg&#xD;
      nivolumab and 1mg/kg ipilimumab will be investigated with 12 participants. DLT window for&#xD;
      phase I, cohort 2 will be evaluated at weeks 1-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon establishment of RP2R schedule, only participants with advanced melanoma who are&#xD;
      treatment naïve in metastatic setting or have had up to 6 weeks of targeted therapy or who&#xD;
      have progressed on adjuvant therapy for more than 6 months following completion of adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy (either BRAF-MEK or PD1 Ab) will be eligible for participation in high risk disease&#xD;
      cohort expansion (Groups 1 or 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will employ the RP2D schedule from Phase I and investigate the early efficacy in&#xD;
      participants with high risk features who are less likely to derive benefit from standard&#xD;
      treatment approaches and who may benefit from quadruple therapy despite the potential for&#xD;
      increased toxicity. These will include: Group 1) symptomatic brain metastases [up to 30&#xD;
      patients] and Group 2) Elevated LDH &gt;1x upper limit of normal (ULN) with: a) liver metastases&#xD;
      OR b) bulky visceral disease (sum of longest diameter (SLD) &gt; 44mm) [combined with Group 1 up&#xD;
      to 60 total patients].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following initiation of triple or quadruple therapy, participants will be followed for safety&#xD;
      and response. Safety assessments will be a high priority with on-going Bayesian toxicity&#xD;
      monitoring and efficacy assessments every 12 weeks. Based on prior targeted, immune, and&#xD;
      triplet therapy studies, we anticipate up to 30-50% DLT and will consider temporary&#xD;
      suspension of trial enrollment with a DLT &gt; 75% as determined by CTCAEv5. Treatment efficacy&#xD;
      will be documented using RECIST 1.1 and RANO-BM criteria, recorded every 4-12 weeks, and&#xD;
      immune-RECIST (iRECIST) and immune-RANO (iRANO) criteria.&#xD;
