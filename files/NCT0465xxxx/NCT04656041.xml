    <textblock>
      In this research study, is studying how Liposomal Irinotecan in combination with the standard&#xD;
      of care interventions FOLFOX, carboplatin paclitaxel, and radiation therapy affect&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction or esophagogastric cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves the following study intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Liposomal irinotecan&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves the following standard of care interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FOLFOX (leucovorin calcium, 5-Fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carboplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves the following study intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Liposomal irinotecan&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 40 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved liposomal irinotecan&#xD;
      for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA has approved&#xD;
      FOLFOX, carboplatin, and paclitaxel as treatment options for this disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet all the following criteria in order to be eligible to&#xD;

                  biliary stenting, total bilirubin of ≤ 2.0 x upper limit of normal OR two down&#xD;
                  trending values.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of both radiation therapy and the chemotherapy agents used in this trial&#xD;
             are known to be teratogenic. Therefore, women of child-bearing potential and men must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation plus 30&#xD;
             days from the last date of study drug administration. Should a woman become pregnant&#xD;
             or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG). If the urine&#xD;
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who fulfill any of the following criteria will be excluded from the&#xD;
             study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of metastatic disease as determined by chest CT scan, abdomen/pelvis CT scan&#xD;
             (or MRI with gadolinium and/or manganese) within six weeks of study entry. Distant&#xD;
             nodal disease is allowed if it is in the radiation port.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior chemotherapy, targeted/biologic therapy, or radiation for treatment of the&#xD;
             participant's esophagogastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment of other invasive carcinomas within the last five years with greater than 5%&#xD;
             risk of recurrence at time of eligibility screening. Carcinoma in-situ and basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma/ squamous cell carcinoma of the skin are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any other investigational agents within 4 weeks preceding the start of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious concomitant systemic disorders incompatible with the study (at the discretion&#xD;
             of the investigator), such as significant cardiac or pulmonary morbidity&#xD;
             (e.g.congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and/or cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmias not well controlled with medication) or myocardial infarction within the&#xD;
             last 12 months, or ongoing infection as manifested by fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric&#xD;
             disability judged by the investigator to be clinically significant, precluding&#xD;
             informed consent, or interfering with compliance or drug intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiation therapy and the&#xD;
             chemotherapy agents to be used have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued while the mother is receiving protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery, excluding laparoscopy, within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment,&#xD;
             without complete recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No concurrent administration of cimetidine (as it can decrease the clearance of 5-FU).&#xD;
             Another H2-blocker or proton pump inhibitor may be substituted before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known, existing uncontrolled coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic fluoropyrimidine therapy (unless given in an adjuvant setting and at&#xD;
             least six months earlier). Prior topical fluoropyrimidine use is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to 5-fluorouracil or known DPD deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reaction(s) attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, or oxaliplatin.&#xD;
