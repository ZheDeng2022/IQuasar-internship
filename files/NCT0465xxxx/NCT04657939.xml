    <textblock>
      The majority of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are overweight, and while weight gain is a&#xD;
      major contributor to diabetes, a minority of patients with T2D are not overweight or obese.&#xD;
      The reasons why lean or normal body weight individuals develop T2D (lean-T2D) are not yet&#xD;
      understood. T2D occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin, or becomes less&#xD;
      sensitive to its effects. Insulin acts like a key to allow sugar into cells and if someone is&#xD;
      overweight that key works less well. Recent research suggests that T2D in lean people should&#xD;
      be considered a different disease from the diabetes associated with obesity and the main&#xD;
      problem in lean-T2D patients may be a reduced capacity of insulin secretion. However, some&#xD;
      researchers argue that many seemingly thin people carry more fat than muscle, making them&#xD;
      trim on the outside, but fat on the inside, and they are in fact not truly lean. This implies&#xD;
      that just like overweight diabetics, lean diabetics also have high resistance to insulin. The&#xD;
      main aim of this research is to better understand the main driver of T2D in lean individuals,&#xD;
      as this will determine how best to treat these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many different types of drugs for treating T2D. Liraglutide improves insulin&#xD;
      secretion capacity of the pancreas. Pioglitazone reduces resistance to insulin action. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare the actions of these diabetes drugs on the blood supply and the&#xD;
      heart's energy levels in lean-T2D and obese-T2D patients. This will allow the investigators&#xD;
      to determine the ideal treatment strategies for improving cardiovascular health in lean-T2D&#xD;
      patients, and better understand the role of impaired insulin secretory capacity, insulin&#xD;
      resistance and excess fat deposition specifically in this group.&#xD;

      This is a single centre, open-label, randomized, cross-over study. Participants will attend 4&#xD;
      visits in total over the course of approximately 40 weeks. Two cohorts of patients will be&#xD;
      recruited: 28 lean-T2D patients and 28 obese-T2D patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be invited to the research centre for a screening/ baseline visit&#xD;
      (Visit 1). At this visit, the participants will be given the Participant Information Sheet&#xD;
      (PIS) to read through, and given the opportunity to ask questions. If they are interested in&#xD;
      participating, their consent will be taken in written form. Each participant will then have a&#xD;
      series of non-invasive tests. At this baseline visit, the following assessments will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medical history and concomitant medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of history of diabetes and complications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of demographic data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and weight;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venepuncture (fasting sample): 20mls;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiparametric MRI;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EndoPAT testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 minute walk test;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-lead ECG;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dispense study medication and issue patient diary; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this visit, participants will be randomized to receive either liraglutide or pioglitazone&#xD;
      first. Participants that are already taking certain classes of glucose-lowering medications&#xD;
      may be excluded from the study (see exclusion criteria for more detail). Participants will&#xD;
      continue to take their previously prescribed medications throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 16 weeks of treatment (Visit 2), participants will return to the research centre and&#xD;
      have the following assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venepuncture (fasting sample): 20mls;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-lead ECG;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiparametric MRI;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EndoPAT testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 minute walk test;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check current medication list and patient clinical status;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check study medication compliance (diary review); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then have an 8 week washout period, in which they will take no study drug.&#xD;
      After these 8 weeks, they will return to the research centre (Visit 3) and have the same&#xD;
      assessments as listed above for Visit 2. They will start taking the second study drug for 16&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 16 weeks, participants will attend the research centre for a final time (Visit 4) and&#xD;
      have the same assessments as listed above for Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiparametric MRI assessments will consists of 2 parts: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy&#xD;
      (MRS): The relative concentration of phosphocreatine to ATP (PCr/ATP) by 31P-MRS and cardiac&#xD;
      and hepatic triglyceride content by 1H-MRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected blood will be tested for triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, haemoglobin,&#xD;
      haematocrit, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, N-terminal pro-B-type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide, insulin, free fatty acids, adiponectin, glucose and lipid profiles,&#xD;
      glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, and Zinc transporter 8 antibodies. Urine will be&#xD;
      spot-tested for albumin/ creatinine ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous clinical studies have found an association between diabetes and impaired function of&#xD;
      the endothelium of blood vessels. The EndoPAT 2000 is a machine that measures endothelium&#xD;
      function via 2 thimble-sized sensors placed on the index fingers. This is a safe and&#xD;
      non-invasive way of testing the condition of the participant's blood vessels, and testing&#xD;
      takes about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6 minute walk test is an exercise test that requires patients to walk along a long flat&#xD;
      corridor for 6 minutes to see how far they can walk at their own pace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liraglutide will be administered at 0.6mg once daily to start, then titrated up to 1.2mg&#xD;
      after 2 weeks if the participant's glucose levels permit. Participants will be trained how to&#xD;
      administer the injection themselves. Glucose assessments will be done after 2 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with Liraglutide. Pioglitazone is taken orally. Participants will be started on&#xD;
      15mg once daily; this will be titrated up to 30mg after 2 weeks then to 45mg after another 2&#xD;
      weeks if glucose levels permit. Glucose assessments will be done 2 weeks after starting&#xD;
      treatment, then 4 weeks after starting treatment. Participants will be told to continue their&#xD;
      usual schedule of glucose monitoring at home while on the study drugs (no additional&#xD;
      monitoring at home will be necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given diaries to complete while they are on both drugs.&#xD;
