  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An intervention study on the effect of dietary guidance with focus on implementing&#xD;
      recommended food texture, at the department of Eating and Swallowing difficulties, Region&#xD;
      Midtjylland, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy- and protein intake, Weightloss, Bodymass composition, Fluid balance and Activities of&#xD;
      Daily Living (ADL), will be measured by Bioimpedance spectroscopy, interviews and a&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is know that people with eating- and swallowing difficulties(known as dysphagia), is prone&#xD;
      to weightloss due to insufficient energy- and protein intake, and a reduction in ADL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADL will in this project have its focus on the eating situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The projects research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will dietary guidance with texture implementation increase energy intake in patients&#xD;
           being examined on an outpatient basis for dysphagia, based on the Fiberoptic Endoscopic&#xD;
           Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) recommendation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can a dietetic guidance with texture implementation increase quality of life and ADL in&#xD;
           patients with dysphagia?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and data collection will take place at Hammel Neurocenter, DK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be included for eight weeks, after their first FEES examination. The&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to control or intervention, and strata into three groups&#xD;
      based on Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale (FEDSS) 1, 2-3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the eight weeks, participants have to show up three times to measurements, interviews&#xD;
      and questionnaire, in addition to this, the intervention groups will have three follow-up&#xD;
      phone meetings.&#xD;
