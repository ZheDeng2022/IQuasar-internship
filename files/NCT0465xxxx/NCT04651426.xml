    <textblock>
      The investigator assessed 54 patients with chronic lumbar back pain treated with FIT Therapy&#xD;
      (far infrared technology) patch. The criteria for inclusion were chronic lumbar back pain due&#xD;
      to overstress or to contracture and patients over 30 years old. Patients with tumors,&#xD;
      infections, neurological and metabolic diseases were excluded. Three different types of FIT&#xD;
      Therapy patches (F4, F3 and the placebo) were used according to the different power of&#xD;
      action. The patches were self-removed after 5 days. At day 8 new ones were applied for other&#xD;
      five days and at day 14 patients were dismissed. Every single patient was assessed during the&#xD;
      study using the VAS pain scale, the Roland Morris questionnaire for quality of life and the&#xD;
      range of motion (ROM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First and foremost, the investigators obtained the ethical committee approval, then 54&#xD;
      patients were enrolled since May 2019 to November 2019, at the AOUI (Azienda Ospedaliera&#xD;
      Universitaria Integrata) Verona. Prospective analysis in a 3-arm, randomized double-blind and&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the effect of FIT Therapy patches on the&#xD;
      chronic lumbar spine pain and on the ROM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FIT Therapy patch (D. FENSTEC s.r.l. Altavilla Vicentina, Italy) is a medical device&#xD;
      class 1 which mechanism of action is through the ability of biominerals to reflect the far&#xD;
      infrared radiation (FIR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally the human body temperature would dissipate regular far infrared radiations but,&#xD;
      thanks to the FIT Therapy (Far Infrared Technology), these waves are reflected and allowed to&#xD;
      reach deeper areas in the human body (wavelength spectrum is 4-21 µm with a denser&#xD;
      concentration around 11 µm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every FIT device act as a mirror and they are able to induce an antalgic effect simply thanks&#xD;
      to this biophysical process, therefore without releasing any active ingredient or creating a&#xD;
      thermic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasters are made of 100% polypropylene non-woven fabric, an acrylic adhesive mass and a&#xD;
      mix of titanium dioxide printed on. This particular mix in powder form is characterized by&#xD;
      particles sizes above 100 nm. The intrinsic properties of the FIT technology are due to the&#xD;
      mix of titanium dioxides that reflect the FIR emitted by the human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different plasters were used: a placebo (without any biomineral, therefore with no&#xD;
      reflectance ability); an &quot;F3&quot; patch and an &quot;F4&quot; one, characterized by different power of&#xD;
      action (F4 has a broader spectrum of refrigency than F3). The 3 plasters presented no&#xD;
      difference in size, color and shape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were subdivided in 3 randomized groups.The Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) and the&#xD;
      Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) were used. The Range of Motion (ROM) evaluation&#xD;
      consisted of flexion and extension, lateral bending and rotation of the lumbar spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consisted of a total of 14 days for each patient. At day 0, during the first&#xD;
      clinical encounter, patients were enrolled by signing an informed consent. Still during the&#xD;
      encounter, the lumbar spine ROM was measured, the VAS and the RMDQ administered. Only after&#xD;
      all these necessary steps the first patch was applied. Every patient was given a RMDQ and a&#xD;
      journal, which had to be updated daily, and at the same time every day, with the pain level&#xD;
      experienced and any adverse effect to the FIT Therapy patch. At day 5 the patch was&#xD;
      self-removed and the RMDQ given during the first encounter filled. The second clinical&#xD;
      encounter was at day 8. The patients' ROM and VAS were tested for the second time and a new&#xD;
      FIT Therapy patch was applied. At day 13 the FIT Therapy patch was dismissed and a second&#xD;
      RMDQ filled at home. The last clinical encounter was held at day 14 and once again all 54&#xD;
      patients' ROM and VAS were assessed. Finally, the daily journal was collected, and patients&#xD;
      were asked if any other pain medication was self-administered during the entirety of the&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
