  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have&#xD;
      recurrent small cell lung cancer. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate, time to progression, and overall survival of patients with&#xD;
      recurrent small cell lung cancer treated with imatinib mesylate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlate the presence of c-Kit mutations in tumor tissue with treatment response in&#xD;
      patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlate individual patient variation in clinical (toxicity and/or activity),&#xD;
      pharmacologic (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters), and/or biologic (correlative&#xD;
      laboratory study results) responses to this drug with genetic differences in proteins&#xD;
      involved in drug response (transport, metabolism, and/or mechanism of action).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to length of prior&#xD;
      therapy (less than 3 months vs at least 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily for 28 days. Courses continue in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for&#xD;
      up to 3 years after registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients who develop CNS metastasis as the only site of disease progression receive&#xD;
      therapeutic whole-brain radiotherapy and then resume study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41 patients for stratum I will be accrued within 21 months and&#xD;
      50 patients for stratum II will be accrued within 25 months for this study.&#xD;
