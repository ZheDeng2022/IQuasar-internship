      This study will explore the clinical and hereditary (genetic) features of inherited&#xD;
      cataracts. A cataract is a clouding of the eye lens, which focuses light on the back of the&#xD;
      eye. When the lens becomes cloudy and does not let light through, vision is impaired.&#xD;
      Cataracts may be associated with vision problems alone, or with other problems, such as&#xD;
      changes in facial appearance or skin problems. A better understanding of these genetic&#xD;
      conditions may help in the development of better diagnostic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with inherited cataracts and their family members may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Participants will be drawn from patients enrolled in other studies of inherited cataracts at&#xD;
      the NEI and collaborating clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and surgical history;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verification of diagnosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Construction of a family tree regarding familial vision problems;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete eye examination, including dilation of the pupils and photography of the lens,&#xD;
           tests of color vision and field of vision, and of the ability to see in the dark;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collection (20 ml, or 4 teaspoons) for genetic studies of hereditary&#xD;
           cataracts.&#xD;

      Objective: This project, Clinical and Molecular Studies in Families with Congenital or&#xD;
      Hereditary Cataracts will study the inheritance of genetic cataracts, both Mendelian and&#xD;
      complex age related cataracts, in families of many nationalities and ethnic backgrounds in&#xD;
      order to identify the genes that, when mutated, cause cataracts and the pathophysiology&#xD;
      through which they act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Families of many nationalities and ethnic backgrounds. We will study a&#xD;
      maximum or 5,000 patients and family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study consists of ascertaining individuals, and especially families with multiple&#xD;
      individuals, affected by both congenital and age related cataracts. These patients and their&#xD;
      families will undergo detailed ophthalmological examinations to characterize their cataracts&#xD;
      and determine their affectation status. A blood sample will be collected from each individual&#xD;
      for isolation of DNA and in some individuals for lymphoblastoid transformation to establish a&#xD;
      renewable source of DNA. Linkage analysis, physical mapping, and mutational screening will be&#xD;
      carried out to identify the specific the gene and the mutations in it that are associated&#xD;
      with cataracts in this family. If necessary, the gene product will be characterized&#xD;
      biochemically. The study will enroll subjects at NEI and collaborating institutions, the&#xD;
      Centre for Excellence in Molecular Biology, Lahore, Pakistan, the Zhongshan Ophthalmic&#xD;
      Center, Guangzhou, China, the Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, India, and the University of&#xD;
      Parma, Italy and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Linkage will be determined using the lod score method and mutations in&#xD;
      specific genes will be assessed using a combination of residue conservation, blosum score,&#xD;
      and molecular modeling. Biochemical, metabolic, and physiological effects will be&#xD;
      individualized to the specific assay.&#xD;
