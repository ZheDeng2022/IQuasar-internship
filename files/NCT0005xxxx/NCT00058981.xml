  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate safety and efficacy of multiple&#xD;
      subcutaneous doses of DiaPep277 in patients with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA).&#xD;
      Study medication will be administered at time 0, 1 and 3 months, and then every 3 months for&#xD;
      a total of 8 administrations. The total duration of the trial is 24 months (treatment for 18&#xD;
      months and follow-up for an additional 6 months). Patients will be male or female between the&#xD;
      ages of 30 and 65 years, inclusive, within 2 to 60 months of the diagnosis of diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. Subjects must be positive for glutamic acid decarboxylate (GAD) autoantibodies. At&#xD;
      the Screen Visit (Visit 2), all subjects will be asked to discontinue their use of all oral&#xD;
      antidiabetic medications with the exception of metformin. The subjects will be placed on a&#xD;
      stable regimen of insulin and diet (plus metformin if needed). Prior to the Baseline Visit&#xD;
      (Visit 3), diabetic control must be achieved by diet and insulin (plus metformin if needed).&#xD;

             more than 2 months and less than 5 years before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject's diabetes has been controlled by diet and insulin (plus metformin if&#xD;
             needed) for 2 or more weeks (14 days) prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is a male or female aged 30 to 65 years. If female and not postmenopausal,&#xD;

             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is positive for GAD autoantibodies, defined as a level greater than the&#xD;
             99th percentile of the GAD antibody index of a normal control population for the&#xD;
             laboratory (e.g., GAD antibody index equal to 0.085).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a fasting C-peptide level 0.30 nmol/L or greater or 0.9 ng/mL at the&#xD;
             time of the Screen Visit (Visit 1 or 2).&#xD;
