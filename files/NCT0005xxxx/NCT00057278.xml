      This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug gabapentin in reducing pain&#xD;
      associated with primary fibromyalgia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia, a chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder of unknown etiology, is characterized&#xD;
      by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and multiple tender points; the disease affects&#xD;
      3 to 6 million Americans. A person is considered to have fibromyalgia if he or she has&#xD;
      widespread pain in combination with tenderness in at least 11 of 18 specific tender point&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of fibromyalgia requires a comprehensive approach and includes aerobic exercise,&#xD;
      heat and massage, antidepressant medications, and relaxation. Gabapentin, a medication used&#xD;
      to treat seizures, has been shown to work on pain transmission pathways and may relieve the&#xD;
      pain associated with fibromyalgia. This study will assess the efficacy of gabapentin in&#xD;
      reducing pain severity in fibromyalgia as measured by the average pain item of the Brief Pain&#xD;
      Inventory (BPI) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive gabapentin or placebo. The gabapentin dose will be&#xD;
      titrated for persisting symptoms and as tolerated during the first 6 weeks of the study,&#xD;
      reaching final doses between 1800 mg/day and 2400 mg/day. Patients will then continue on the&#xD;
      final dose for the remaining 6 weeks of the study. Following completion of the 12 week&#xD;
      treatment phase, patients will be tapered off of the medication over 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of gabapentin will be assessed using the BPI. The BPI is a&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire that measures the severity of pain and the interference of&#xD;
      pain on function over the past 24 hours. Other assessments will include the total&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) score; six 11-point Likert-type scales in the FIQ&#xD;
      that measure pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression; the mean&#xD;
      tender point pain threshold; Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-Severity); Patient&#xD;
      Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-Improvement); the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire&#xD;
      (SF-MPQ); the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36); the Montgomery Asberg Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale (MADRS); and the Medical Outcomes Sleep Scale (MOS-Sleep).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and cooperate with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
