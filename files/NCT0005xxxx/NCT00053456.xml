      This study will look at the effect of a cardiac rehabilitation exercise program on release of&#xD;
      stem cells from the bone marrow and on heart function. Stem cells are primitive cells&#xD;
      produced and released by the bone marrow, circulate in the bloodstream and develop into white&#xD;
      blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. Some stem cells may also develop into other kinds&#xD;
      of cells, including those that make up heart muscle, especially if the heart has been damaged&#xD;
      or is not getting sufficient blood. Stem cells called endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are&#xD;
      thought to form new blood vessels that can carry blood to areas of the heart muscle that are&#xD;
      oxygen-deprived because of clogged arteries. Previous experiments have shown that some EPCs&#xD;
      can be forced out of the bone marrow by exercise. This study will examine whether repeated&#xD;
      exercise and lifestyle changes increase the number of EPCs released into the bloodstream and&#xD;
      if these cells improve heart and blood vessel function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 21 years of age and older with coronary artery disease may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, including&#xD;
      a cardiovascular evaluation, and blood tests. The participants will be enrolled in a 2- to&#xD;
      3-month cardiac rehabilitation program that includes 24 to 36 60-minute sessions of exercise,&#xD;
      plus instruction on lifestyle changes related to diet, stress management, and relaxation&#xD;
      techniques. In addition, participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brachial reactivity study: This test measures how well the arteries widen. The patients&#xD;
           rest for 30 minutes, and then an ultrasound device is placed over the artery just above&#xD;
           the elbow. The device measures the size of the artery and blood flow through it before&#xD;
           and after the patient is given a spray of nitroglycerin under the tongue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for EPC levels and genetic testing: These measure EPCs and determine whether&#xD;
           certain genes that may regulate EPC function are turned on or off. Genes are made up of&#xD;
           DNA, the molecules that lead to the production of proteins by cells. Some of these&#xD;
           proteins may be important in releasing EPCs from the bone marrow to travel in the&#xD;
           bloodstream to the heart and repair blood vessels and muscle cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treadmill exercise testing: Patients exercise on a treadmill with continuous monitoring&#xD;
           of the heartbeat and frequent measurements of oxygen saturation, using a finger clip&#xD;
           device. The patient continues to exercise until moderate chest pain, shortness of&#xD;
           breath, or fatigue develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire: Patients fill out a 15-minute questionnaire about their general physical&#xD;
           and mental health status at the first and last visits to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart: Patients who are eligible to undergo MRI&#xD;
           have this test twice during the study, once before beginning the rehabilitation program&#xD;
           and again after completing the program. The MRI shows heart function and blood flow in&#xD;
           the heart. For this test, the patient lies on a stretcher inside a long narrow cylinder&#xD;
           (the scanner). During the scan, the drug dipyridamole, which increases blood flow to the&#xD;
           heart, is infused into a vein of the hand or arm. Another drug, gadolinium, is also&#xD;
           infused to brighten the images produced.&#xD;

      Exercise training has long been recommended as a means of improving cardiac function and&#xD;
      reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). One&#xD;
      mechanism of benefit may be through improved endothelial function and enhanced nitric oxide&#xD;
      bioactivity. Such an effect may augment blood flow to exercising skeletal muscle and to the&#xD;
      myocardium. In this regard, studies in both animals and humans have shown that frequent&#xD;
      exercise improves endothelial function as well as blood flow to ischemic myocardium.&#xD;
      Exercise-induced improvement in endothelial function is believed to result from up-regulation&#xD;
      of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) transcription due to repetitive shear stress&#xD;
      associated with exercise. However, not all patients show improved endothelial function or&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion despite compliant participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that endothelial function before and following structured exercise programs may&#xD;
      be determined by the presence and function of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) that are&#xD;
      released from the bone marrow and circulate in the blood stream. Thus, patients who have low&#xD;
      baseline or post-exercise EPC levels or function may have limited capacity to improve&#xD;
      endothelial function, exercise duration, and myocardial perfusion and function following&#xD;
      participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs with repetitive exercise. On the other hand,&#xD;
      patients with higher levels of EPCs at baseline or following repetitive exercise, with&#xD;
      preserved capacity of EPCs to form endothelial cells, may show improved endothelial function,&#xD;
      exercise duration, and myocardial perfusion and function as a result of repetitive exercise.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study will be improvement in endothelial function as determined&#xD;
      by flow-mediated dilator responsiveness of the brachial artery at 2-3 months of repetitive&#xD;
      exercise in the program compared with baseline measurements. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      treadmill exercise duration and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-determined regional cardiac&#xD;
      perfusion by gadolinium distribution during pharmacologic stress at 2-3 months compared with&#xD;
      baseline measurements. EPCs will be identified by characteristic cell surface markers and by&#xD;
      colony-forming ability at specific time-points of the study, with correlations determined&#xD;
      between EPCs at baseline or the increase in EPCs following repetitive exercise, and the&#xD;
      primary and secondary endpoints. We propose that patients most likely, and least likely, to&#xD;
      benefit from a cardiac rehabilitation program may be identified on the basis of circulating&#xD;
      EPCs.&#xD;
