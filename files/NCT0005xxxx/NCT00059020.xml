  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine tissue from gliomas (a type of brain tumor) removed during surgery&#xD;
      for gene mutations, or changes, thought to be involved in tumor formation and growth. One&#xD;
      common gene mutation causes the receptor for a protein called epidermal growth factor (EGF)&#xD;
      to be in an active state all of the time, allowing uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to&#xD;
      tumor formation. This study will analyze blood and tumor tissue samples from patients with&#xD;
      gliomas for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the EGF gene in the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in other genes, such as that for the EGF receptor (EGFR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in levels of EGF and EGFR, and in other proteins and genes that respond to&#xD;
           changes in the levels of these proteins in the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the EGF gene and protein in the blood&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also determine if production of EGF and EGFR obtained from glioma and from&#xD;
      blood cells derived from the tumor can be altered in the laboratory to grow indefinitely in&#xD;
      culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with a brain tumor that requires surgical treatment&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for about 3 to 10 days. They will&#xD;
      have a physical and neurological examination, blood and urine tests, other tests, if&#xD;
      medically necessary, and will be evaluated and prepared for surgery. During surgery, as much&#xD;
      of the tumor as possible will be removed. A small amount of the tumor tissue will be&#xD;
      collected for this study. No tissue will be removed for this study that would not otherwise&#xD;
      have been removed. Some of the tissue will be used to culture glioma cells and the rest will&#xD;
      be frozen and stored for examination, as described above. If any normal-appearing brain&#xD;
      tissue is removed during surgery in order to enhance safety in removing the tumor, the normal&#xD;
      tissue will be studied as well. Brain tissue that appears normal will not be removed strictly&#xD;
      for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery and the day after surgery, a blood sample will be drawn from a catheter&#xD;
      (plastic tube) that was placed in an artery or vein for surgery. If catheters are no longer&#xD;
      in place, blood will be drawn through a needle in a vein.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an important biological mediator of normal growth and&#xD;
      repair and is critical to epithelial tissue development and maturation of the central nervous&#xD;
      system, among other functions. EGF is a natural focus of interest in cancer research because&#xD;
      of its influence over mitogenesis, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. In addition, unregulated&#xD;
      expression of its receptor, EGFR, has been identified as a common event in neoplastic&#xD;
      transformation. In patients with the most malignant primary tumor of the brain, the&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), alterations in the EGFR or in its expression levels have been&#xD;
      identified in approximately 50% of patients. We postulate that EGF-EGFR interactions may be&#xD;
      important for the development, progression, and prognosis of human gliomas and that&#xD;
      alterations of the EGF gene may predict the potential for glioma progression and the severity&#xD;
      of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suspected of having, or with prior biopsy proof of, a WHO grade II-IV central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) glial tumor(s) seen in the Surgical Neurology Branch, NINDS, will be&#xD;
      considered for entry into this study. Tissue samples of tumor resected as part of standard&#xD;
      care will be collected at surgery and preserved for research. Blood samples will also be&#xD;
      collected. Blood will also be collected from anonymous normal volunteers who donate blood at&#xD;
      the NIH Blood Bank; these anonymous donors will serve as controls.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Radiographic evidence of a primary glial neoplasm of the CNS (WHO grade II-IV) or any&#xD;
        patient with known primary neoplasms of the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medically indicated diagnostic and/or therapeutic tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Informed consent from patient, age 18 or older to 75 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females of child-bearing capacity: Pregnant women will be entered into the study for tumor&#xD;
        collection, but blood will not be drawn at the time of surgery. Six weeks or more after the&#xD;
        completion of pregnancy, these women will be contacted and 10cc (2 tsp) of blood will be&#xD;
        collected for genotyping.&#xD;

        Inability to provide informed consent prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical conditions that cannot be corrected prior to surgery that would be standard&#xD;
        contraindications for neurosurgery.&#xD;
