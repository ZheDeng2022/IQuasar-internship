      The purposes of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test the safety of DN-101 in patients with advanced malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understand how fast the body absorbs, processes, and eliminates DN-101&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the highest dose of DN-101 that is well tolerated by cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn how fast the body absorbs, processes, and eliminates DN-101 compared to the&#xD;
           approved product&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Calcitriol, at low doses, is approved by the FDA for use in patients with chronic renal&#xD;
      failure. However, much higher doses of calcitriol are needed for any possible anti-cancer&#xD;
      effect. DN-101 is a new capsule that contains 30 times the amount of calcitriol found in the&#xD;
      currently available calcitriol capsule. In order to take an amount of calcitriol equivalent&#xD;
      to 1 capsule of DN-101, cancer patients would need to swallow 30 pills of the approved, low&#xD;
      dose formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DN-101 is a pill containing calcitriol, a chemical related to vitamin D that is immediately&#xD;
      active in your body. The natural vitamin D found in dairy products or in typical vitamin&#xD;
      pills, must be chemically changed by your liver and kidney into calcitriol before it is&#xD;
      active. High doses of calcitriol had anti-cancer effects when tested in animals. DN-101 may&#xD;
      have anticancer effects in your kind of cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prostate cancer are eligible 1) if they have had a prostatectomy or&#xD;
             radiation therapy and have a rising PSA, 2) if they have androgen sensitive prostate&#xD;
             cancer and are on hormone therapy, or 3) if they have androgen independent prostate&#xD;
             cancer and have failed hormone therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other types of malignancies will be required to have failed at least one&#xD;
             potentially effective therapy prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following laboratory results:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate hematologic function&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate renal function&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Negative urine pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to use effective contraception by both males and females throughout the&#xD;

        Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant active medical illness (other than current cancer) which in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator would preclude protocol treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cancer-related hypercalcemia, known hypercalcemia, or vitamin D toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled heart failure&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior investigational therapy within the past 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior use of calcitriol within the past 3 months or known hypersensitivity to&#xD;
             calcitriol&#xD;
