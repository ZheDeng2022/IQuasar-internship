    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how tumors in patients with colorectal carcinoma&#xD;
      respond to treatment with VELCADE alone versus VELCADE given with irinotecan, and also to see&#xD;
      what effects (good and bad) it has on you and your cancer.&#xD;

      In this study, patients with colorectal cancer that is no longer responding to standard&#xD;
      medical treatment with irinotecan or an irinotecan containing treatment will be randomized to&#xD;
      treatment with VELCADE alone or to treatment with VELCADE in combination with irinotecan.&#xD;
