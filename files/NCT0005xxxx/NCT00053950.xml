      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of pyrazoloacridine given&#xD;
      together with peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplantation in treating young patients&#xD;
      with high-risk neuroblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor&#xD;
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem&#xD;
      cell or bone marrow transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy&#xD;
      drugs and kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PZA given as a single prolonged infusion&#xD;
      (&gt;= 6 hours) with autologous hematopoietic stem cell (aHSC) support to children with high&#xD;
      risk neuroblastoma with recurrent or refractory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of PZA given on this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of PZA given on this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary data on the antitumor activity of PZA within the confines of a Phase&#xD;
      I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the TP53 mutation status of tumor cells in bone marrow if &gt; 10% are present;&#xD;
      to evaluate expression of p53 and MDM2 proteins by flow cytometry if &gt;= 0.1% to &lt; 10% are&#xD;
      present at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a two-stage, dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients without adequate cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cells undergo peripheral blood&#xD;
      stem cell harvest or bone marrow harvest for autologous stem cells at least 2 weeks before&#xD;
      study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive high-dose pyrazoloacridine (PZA) IV on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Groups of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PZA at a fixed infusion time&#xD;
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Groups of 3-6 patients receive PZA at the dose/hour established in cohort I at&#xD;
      escalating infusion times until another MTD is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both cohorts the MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously beginning on day 4 and continuing&#xD;
      until blood counts recover. Patients also undergo reinfusion of stem cells over 15-30 minutes&#xD;
      on day 4 as needed per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at days 28-35, every 3 months for 3 years, and then every 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
