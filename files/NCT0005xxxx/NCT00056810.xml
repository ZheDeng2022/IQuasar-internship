  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In developed countries, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is the most common cause of acute&#xD;
      neuromuscular paralysis, afflicting about 5,000 persons annually in the United States. Over&#xD;
      20% of GBS patients have permanent residual motor deficits that affect their activities of&#xD;
      daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to assess the potential usefulness and safety of 4-aminopyridine&#xD;
      (4-AP) in those patients who suffer chronic functional deficits from GBS.This medication is a&#xD;
      potassium channel blocker that has the potential to improve nerve conduction, particularly&#xD;
      across partially demyelinated axons. It is felt that by increasing nerve conduction there&#xD;
      will be improved motor performance for walking and activities of daily living, as well as&#xD;
      decreased fatiguability. This medication has demonstrated potential usefulness in central&#xD;
      demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.Because the peripheral nervous system is&#xD;
      much more accessible to systemic medication delivery it is felt that this medication may&#xD;
      improve the functional status of those patients who are suffering from the residual side&#xD;
      effects of this medication.&#xD;

      Objective.- To determine the safety and efficacy of orally delivered 4-aminopyridine for&#xD;
      motor weakness due to Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) under a FDA approved protocol (IND No:&#xD;
      58,029).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting.- Tertiary care outpatient rehabilitation center directly attached to a university&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects.- Subjects who are unable to ambulate more than 200 feet without assistive devices&#xD;
      and have residual nonprogressive motor weakness due to GBS more than one year out from the&#xD;
      initial episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design.- Subjects will be randomized to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over&#xD;
      design, which had two eight-week treatment arms with a three-week washout. The average dosage&#xD;
      at 4 weeks will be 30 milligrams (mg) per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who demonstrate improvement will be continued on the medication for an additional&#xD;
      three months. Assessments will be performed every two weeks during the randomized trial and&#xD;
      every month for those continued for up to three months on the medication.&#xD;
