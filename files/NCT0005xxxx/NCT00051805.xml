  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the main causes of treatment failure in HIV infected individuals is lack of adherence&#xD;
      to complicated drug regimens. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      behavioral intervention program designed to improve adherence to anti-HIV drug regimens.&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be recruited from the University of Alabama at Birmingham&#xD;
      (UAB) Outpatient HIV Clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor adherence to complicated antiretroviral (ARV) drug regimens is one of the most pressing&#xD;
      behavioral problems in the clinical management of HIV infected persons. Recent medical&#xD;
      advances have made it possible to maintain tighter control of viral replication, allowing&#xD;
      people with HIV to live longer, healthier lives. However, the complexity of ARV drug regimens&#xD;
      and drug side effects make medication adherence problematic. Deviations from the prescribed&#xD;
      regimen may allow the virus to resume rapid replication and develop drug resistant mutations&#xD;
      that could render the prescribed drugs useless. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a&#xD;
      6-month, theory-based behavioral intervention to enhance adherence to antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment regimens. HIV-related attitudes, depressive symptoms, coping strategies, and social&#xD;
      support will also be assessed to examine theoretical assumptions regarding the causal&#xD;
      relationship between psychosocial constructs and medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be recruited from UAB Outpatient HIV Clinic patients who are&#xD;
      taking ARV medication. Participants will be randomized to a Standard Adherence Promotion&#xD;
      Group or an Enhanced Adherence Promotion Group. The Enhanced Adherence Promotion will&#xD;
      systematically address specific psychosocial issues associated with medication adherence.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 6 months, and adherence will be evaluated at monthly study&#xD;
      visits. Pill counts, viral loads, self-reported adherence to ARV medication, CD4 count, and&#xD;
      genotypic viral resistance will be assessed.&#xD;
