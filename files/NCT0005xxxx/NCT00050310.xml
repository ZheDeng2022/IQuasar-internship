    <textblock>
      This study will examine pathophysiology and immune response of anthrax in infected or exposed&#xD;
      individuals to learn more about the disease symptoms, prevention and response to treatment.&#xD;
      In addition, it will evaluate immune response to the anthrax vaccine AVA (Anthrax Vaccine&#xD;
      Adsorbed) in healthy, non-infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following individuals may be eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. People with confirmed or suspected anthrax (inhalational, cutaneous or gastrointestinal,&#xD;
           either acute or recovering);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. People exposed to anthrax who have no clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Healthy people who have not been exposed to anthrax and have been vaccinated with AVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those enrolled in the study will undergo the following tests and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infected and exposed individuals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptomatic participants will have the following clinical procedures if medically&#xD;
           necessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a) blood tests for cell counts, chemistries and evidence of anthrax bacteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  b) nasal swab to test for evidence of anthrax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  c) chest X-ray;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  d) computed tomography (CT) scan (special X-rays to examine the lungs or abdomen);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  e) echocardiogram to examine the heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  f) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a special imaging test using a magnetic field and&#xD;
           radio waves to examine the infected area of skin and soft tissue for patients with&#xD;
           cutaneous anthrax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects (with or without symptoms) will have the following research procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a) blood tests to examine immune response to anthrax;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  b) throat swab to test for evidence of anthrax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  c) nasopharyngeal wash to test for anthrax. Water is sprayed into the nostrils and then&#xD;
           allowed to drain for collection in a cup;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  d) induced sputum to test for presence of and immune response to anthrax. A mask with a&#xD;
           saline mist is placed over the subject s mouth and nose, causing the subject to cough&#xD;
           and produce sputum from the lungs. The sputum is collected in a cup this is for&#xD;
           individuals 18 and older who do not undergo bronchoscopy, described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants 18 years of age and older may have the following optional research&#xD;
           procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a) leukapheresis or plasmapheresis (see description under non-infected, vaccinated&#xD;
           individuals above);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  b) lymph node biopsy. A sample of lymph node tissue is surgically removed under local&#xD;
           anesthetic;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  c) bronchoalveolar lavage. This 15- to 30-minute procedure is done in the intensive care&#xD;
           unit. The mouth, nasal passages, throat and airways are numbed with lidocaine and a thin&#xD;
           flexible tube is passed through the nose into the lung airways. Samples of cells and&#xD;
           secretions are obtained by rinsing (lavage) the airways with salt water. The fluid is&#xD;
           analyzed for infection, inflammatory cells and inflammatory chemicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infected and exposed individuals will have periodic medical history and physical exam&#xD;
      evaluations and be offered treatment or prophylaxis (treatment to prevent infection) with&#xD;
      antibiotics, according to the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      (CDC). Patients will be monitored for at least 24 months after antibiotic treatment, or&#xD;
      longer if circumstances warrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-infected, vaccinated individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. blood tests-- between 10 and 50 ml (2-10 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn at a time,&#xD;
           and not more than 450 ml will be taken in a 6-week period. Based on the blood test&#xD;
           results, other optional research procedures may be requested&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. leukapheresis to collect white blood cells and plasmapheresis to collect plasma (the&#xD;
           liquid part of the blood). For both of these procedures, blood is collected through a&#xD;
           needle placed in an arm vein. The blood flows into a special machine that separates it&#xD;
           into its components by spinning. The desired components (white cells or plasma) are&#xD;
           removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through the same needle or a&#xD;
           second needle in the other arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intentional use of Bacillus anthracis in 2001 as a bioterrorism weapon with fatal&#xD;
      consequences renewed interest in past epidemiologic and animal research about pathogenesis&#xD;
      and posed new dilemmas about diagnosis and treatment. Cases in the October 2001 US outbreak&#xD;
      were theoretically exposed via one dispersal method: aerosolization of Ames strain spores.&#xD;
      While some developed the cutaneous anthrax form, others sustained the more serious&#xD;
      inhalational disease. Inhaled spores are known to travel to alveolar macrophages and then&#xD;
      onto the mediastinal lymph nodes where germination to the bacterium form and toxin release&#xD;
      are thought to occur. Infective dose, significance of dormant spores after long-term&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy, spectrum of disease and even precise cause of death remain unknown. This&#xD;
      observational, prospective natural history study was developed during the 2001 outbreak and&#xD;
      is set up to follow participants from the time of exposure through post-recovery (greater&#xD;
      than ten years). Healthy vaccinated participants have been included to evaluate serum titers&#xD;
      and cell markers in relation to dose and frequency of AVA vaccine.&#xD;
