      This trial is a study of Remodulin in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension who have&#xD;
      been transitioned from Flolan therapy. The study consists of Screening, Baseline and&#xD;
      Treatment Phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria during the Screening Phase will enter the&#xD;
      Baseline Phase, during which baseline exercise capacity, vital signs, and clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of the disease will be assessed. After confirmation of all inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, patients will be assigned to study drug (Remodulin or placebo) and will enter the&#xD;
      Treatment Phase. The Treatment Phase begins with a Dose Transition Period, during which&#xD;
      patients will begin receiving subcutaneous study drug at a low dose determined by the&#xD;
      patient's current dose of Flolan. The study drug dose will be increased gradually while the&#xD;
      Flolan dose is decreased gradually over a period of up to 14 days. The dose changes will&#xD;
      continue until Flolan therapy has been discontinued and the patient is stable on study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are transitioned off Flolan, who are stable on study drug will be discharged&#xD;
      from the clinic, and will continue to receive study drug on an outpatient basis. The patient&#xD;
      will return to the clinic at Weeks 4 and 8 for assessments. Patients will remain on study&#xD;
      drug for 8 weeks from the first dose of study drug. At Week 8, final assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted and the patient will be dismissed from the study. Patients who successfully&#xD;
      complete Week 8 assessments may be offered Remodulin therapy or other therapy, at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion.&#xD;

      This trial is a multicenter, randomized, parallel placebo-controlled study of Remodulin in&#xD;
      patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension with WHO Functional Class II or III clinical&#xD;
      status who have been transitioned from Flolan therapy. The study consists of Screening,&#xD;
      Baseline and Treatment Phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria during the Screening Phase will enter the&#xD;
      Baseline Phase, during which baseline exercise capacity, vital signs, and clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of the disease will be assessed. After confirmation of all inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, patients will be randomized to study drug (1:1 Remodulin:placebo) and will enter&#xD;
      the Treatment Phase. The Treatment Phase begins with a Dose Transition Period, during which&#xD;
      patients will begin receiving subcutaneous study drug at a low dose determined by the&#xD;
      patient's current dose of Flolan. The study drug dose will be increased gradually while the&#xD;
      Flolan dose is decreased gradually over a period of up to 14 days. The dose changes will be&#xD;
      done according to a recommended schedule, which may be modified if necessary according to the&#xD;
      patient's clinical status. The dose changes will continue until Flolan therapy has been&#xD;
      discontinued and the patient is stable on study drug, or until the patient has met the&#xD;
      primary endpoint criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are transitioned off Flolan, who are stable on study drug, and who have&#xD;
      demonstrated the ability to properly self-administer study drug will be discharged from the&#xD;
      clinic, and will continue to receive study drug on an outpatient basis. The patient will&#xD;
      return to the clinic at Weeks 4 and 8 for assessments. At weeks other than Weeks 1, 4, and 8,&#xD;
      the site staff will contact the patient to assess progress and adjust the study drug dose if&#xD;
      necessary. Patients will remain on study drug for 8 weeks from the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
      At Week 8, final assessments will be conducted and the patient will be dismissed from the&#xD;
      study. Patients who successfully complete Week 8 assessments may be offered Remodulin therapy&#xD;
      or other therapy, at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
