  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of Reiki in the treatment of&#xD;
      fibromyalgia (FM), a condition characterized by widespread muscle pain and stiffness, often&#xD;
      accompanied by sleep disturbance, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, and psychological&#xD;
      distress. Reiki is a form of energy medicine in which practitioners reportedly access&#xD;
      universal life energy to heal patients, either by direct contact at specific hand positions&#xD;
      or from a distance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is one of the most common rheumatologic diagnoses. Treatment is generally&#xD;
      unsatisfactory and most randomized, controlled treatment trials have been unable to&#xD;
      demonstrate a sustained effective intervention. A vast body of anecdotal literature as well&#xD;
      as two randomized controlled trials suggest that Reiki may be an effective treatment for FM,&#xD;
      appearing to relieve pain and improve psychological well being. Reiki appears to have no&#xD;
      adverse effects and can eventually be self-administered, making it a low-risk, low-cost,&#xD;
      potentially patient-empowering intervention. This study will investigate the efficacy of&#xD;
      Reiki in the treatment of FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred Reiki-naive FM patients will be recruited from a chronic fatigue referral clinic&#xD;
      and will participate in an 8-week trial. Patients will be randomized into one of two Reiki&#xD;
      groups (direct-contact and distant Reiki) or one of two control groups (sham and placebo).&#xD;
      Patients will receive either Reiki or placebo 16 times during the course of the study.&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed at study entry, at Weeks 4 and 8, and 12 weeks post-treatment.&#xD;
