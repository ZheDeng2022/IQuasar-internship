  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety of injections prepared from&#xD;
      donor blood cells fused to a patient's own tumor cells which are then used to treat advanced&#xD;
      (Stage IV) kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma or RCC). The study will also explore the&#xD;
      effect the injections have on the size of the tumor and the response in the patient's immune&#xD;
      system following administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30,000 new cases of kidney cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2002, with&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma (RCC) being the most commonly diagnosed type. For patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic disease, the treatment options are extremely limited and additional&#xD;
      options are warranted. Although RCC is generally considered resistant to chemotherapy,&#xD;
      spontaneous regressions in patients with metastatic disease have led to research involving&#xD;
      immune-mediated therapeutic approaches. Clinical responses have been observed and additional&#xD;
      immune-modulating therapeutics are being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several such approaches have used dendritic cells (DCs), which are known to be potent antigen&#xD;
      presenting cells. An antigen is a protein that, when shown to the immune system in the right&#xD;
      way, can trigger the cells of the immune system to recognize, remember and eliminate other&#xD;
      cells that also display that specific antigen. The cancerous cells in tumors present antigens&#xD;
      in such a way that the body's immune system often fails to recognize and eliminate them. It&#xD;
      is theorized that when DCs are fused to tumor cells the resulting fused cells will be capable&#xD;
      of presenting tumor antigens in an enhanced manner, thus allowing the body's immune system to&#xD;
      recognize the tumor antigens on the cancer itself. If this occurs, the patient's immune&#xD;
      system may be specifically stimulated, producing a clinically meaningful immune response&#xD;
      against the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study DCs produced from healthy volunteer donors (allogeneic DCs) will be fused to&#xD;
      the patient's own tumor cells (autologous tumor cells), using an electrical current. The&#xD;
      fused dendritic/tumor cells will be returned to the patient in a series of vaccines, six&#xD;
      weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether fusing autologous tumor with allogeneic DCs&#xD;
      will, with limited associated toxicity, present tumor antigen in such a way as to stimulate&#xD;
      an immune response and also show evidence of tumor response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be diagnosed with AJCC Stage IV (primary or relapsed) Renal Cell&#xD;
             Carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have a Screening Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Clinical&#xD;
             Performance Status of 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have accessible tumor (minimum of 2.5 cm in diameter in aggregate and&#xD;
             accessible as defined in the clinical protocol) for vaccine production.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have measurable tumor lesions (using Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
             Solid Tumors [RECIST]) following resection of tumor lesion(s) used for vaccine&#xD;
             production. If the patient has received previous radiation or intra-tumoral&#xD;
             investigational treatments, the measurable disease must be outside the previous&#xD;
             radiation port or treatment area unless there is documented tumor progression&#xD;
             following the completion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function parameters at&#xD;
             Screening: White blood cell (WBC) count greater than or equal to 3,000 cells/mm3;&#xD;
             Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000 platelets /mm3; Creatinine (serum)&#xD;
