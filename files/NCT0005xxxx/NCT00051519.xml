      This screening study will evaluate potential study volunteers with HIV infection to see if&#xD;
      they are suitable candidates for trials of experimental vaccines against HIV (therapeutic),&#xD;
      and against other infections (preventive).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preventive vaccines against other infections. Preventive vaccines prevent a person from&#xD;
           getting a disease. Preventive vaccines have been developed for many diseases, including,&#xD;
           for example, whooping cough, measles, mumps, influenza, and hepatitis B. Some preventive&#xD;
           vaccines may also prevent a disease from taking hold if given immediately after&#xD;
           infection, such as vaccines for rabies, smallpox and hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapeutic vaccines against HIV. Therapeutic vaccines are intended to treat someone who&#xD;
           has already been infected, with the goal of controlling the disease or preventing it&#xD;
           from causing severe illness. As yet, there are no therapeutic vaccines for any diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccines against other infections. Vaccines to prevent other infections besides HIV may&#xD;
           need to be tested separately in people with HIV infection because the immune system&#xD;
           works differently when HIV infection is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this screening study.&#xD;
      Women who are pregnant or breast feeding may not participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A health history, including questions about sexual activity and drug use;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, including blood and urine tests;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV testing to confirm HIV infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for premenopausal women;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PPD test for tuberculosis for those who have not been tested in the previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates who meet the requirements for investigational vaccine studies will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in a study. Those who do not begin a study within 1 month of the screening tests&#xD;
      may need to repeat some tests for continued consideration. In addition, some studies require&#xD;
      repeated measures of CD4 counts and viral load over a period of a few months.&#xD;

      Study Design: The purpose of this protocol is to screen potential study volunteers with HIV&#xD;
      infection to determine if they are suitable candidates for vaccine trials. Screening will be&#xD;
      primarily for HIV vaccine trials, but may also be for screening HIV-infected adults to&#xD;
      participate in trials of other kinds of vaccine studies that will be enrolling HIV-infected&#xD;
      subjects. All work will be conducted at the National Institutes of Health. HIV-infected&#xD;
      volunteers will be recruited and screened. This protocol will be used to determine if the&#xD;
      volunteers meet eligibility requirements for participation in trials of vaccines in&#xD;
      HIV-infected subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Approximately 1,000 adults with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: Subjects are evaluated for eligibility to participate in a vaccine trial and&#xD;
      receive counseling on HIV-related issues. Women receive counseling on avoidance of pregnancy&#xD;
      during a clinical trial. If it is determined that the volunteer might be eligible for a&#xD;
      vaccine trial, additional information about trial options will be provided by telephone, mail&#xD;
      and/or visits with a study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Approximately six months for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Evaluations: Evaluations usually include history and physical examinations and CBC,&#xD;
      differential, platelets, PT/PTT, chemistry panel, urinalysis, pregnancy test for women of&#xD;
      reproductive potential, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, RPR, ELISA and&#xD;
      Western blot for HIV, anti-dsDNA, quantitative immunoglobulins, adenovirus serology and T&#xD;
      cell subsets (CD4/CD8). However, only those evaluations needed to determine eligibility for a&#xD;
      particular vaccine study will be completed. Blood will also be collected for storage. If&#xD;
      needed for eligibility in a particular vaccine study, a PPD will be administered unless&#xD;
      subject has documentation of a negative PPD within six months prior to enrollment. In&#xD;
      addition, other standard clinical evaluations may be done if needed to determine eligibility&#xD;
      for a particular vaccine study.&#xD;
