  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of PS-341 that can&#xD;
      be given with carboplatin chemotherapy as a treatment for patients with ovarian, abdominal,&#xD;
      or fallopian tube cancer. Researchers also hope to find out if giving these drugs together&#xD;
      will help shrink or slow the growth of tumors in patients who are considered resistant to&#xD;
      platinum drugs. The safety of these drugs will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib is a drug that turns off certain genes and proteins inside the cancer cell that&#xD;
      are responsible for cell growth. Researchers believe that when certain genes and proteins are&#xD;
      turned off, the ability of the cancer cell to survive is decreased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment starts, participants will have a complete checkup, blood tests, a urine&#xD;
      test, a heart test, a chest x-ray, and either a CT scan or MRI scan. Women able to have&#xD;
      children must have a negative blood pregnancy test within 14 days of beginning treatment.&#xD;
      Blood tests and a complete checkup will also be done before each course of therapy and a&#xD;
      month after treatment ends. Approximately 2-3 teaspoons of blood will be obtained for routine&#xD;
      blood tests each time blood is drawn during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will receive Bortezomib and carboplatin through a catheter (tube)&#xD;
      placed in a vein. This is Day 1 of therapy. Bortezomib is given first (over 5 to 10 seconds)&#xD;
      followed by carboplatin (over one hour). Bortezomib is then given alone on Days 4, 8, and 11.&#xD;
      There is no treatment given on Days 12-28. One course of therapy is 28 days long and includes&#xD;
      one dose of carboplatin and 4 doses of Bortezomib. All treatment is given on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 4 different dose levels of Bortezomib being studied. The dose of Bortezomib that&#xD;
      participants receive will depend on when they are enrolled. It will also depend on whether or&#xD;
      not other participants had side effects from their treatment. Up to 6 patients could be&#xD;
      treated at each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each course of therapy, participants will have a physical exam and blood tests. A CT&#xD;
      scan or MRI scan is repeated after Cycles 2 and 4 and at the end of treatment. Participants&#xD;
      who have a partial or complete response (the tumor shrinks by more than 50% or disappears&#xD;
      completely) will have a repeat CT or MRI 4 weeks later to confirm the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may receive up to 8 courses of treatment. If the disease gets worse or if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, participants will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Bortezomib is approved for use by the FDA, in patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. Carboplatin is approved by the FDA, though its use with Bortezomib is&#xD;
      experimental. A total of 24 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.&#xD;
      D. Anderson.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically-confirmed ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer,&#xD;
             or fallopian tube cancer with advanced and/or metastatic disease. All patients must be&#xD;
             considered platinum- and taxane- resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platinum resistance is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Progression of disease during platinum or taxane chemotherapy, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Progression of disease within 6 months of completing platinum or taxane&#xD;
                  chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Failure to achieve a complete response, with persistent macroscopic disease,&#xD;
                  after 6 cycles of chemotherapy, if the last two cycles had no measurable change&#xD;
                  in disease status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had any number of prior chemotherapy regimens, except high dose&#xD;

             the standard doses of chemotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zubrod performance status of &lt; 2.&#xD;
&#xD;

             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver, renal and bone marrow function, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt; 100 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.7 umol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt; 1.5 x Upper Limits&#xD;
                  of Normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy within four weeks of first course of PS-341. (Patients may have been on&#xD;
             hormonal therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who previously received high-dose chemotherapy (higher than the standard&#xD;
             doses of chemotherapy) and/or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy within four weeks of enrollment (excepting palliative XRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients not recovered from toxic effects of previous chemotherapy, radiation therapy,&#xD;
             or antibody therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with &gt; Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery within four weeks of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to carboplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or new conduction system&#xD;
             abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction within six months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain metastases or central nervous system disease as evidenced by&#xD;
             clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of other malignancy, except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ of&#xD;
             the cervix, unless in complete remission and off all therapy for that disease for a&#xD;
             minimum of 5 years. Chemotherapy given for prior cancers will not exclude patients&#xD;
             from participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previously documented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.&#xD;
             HIV-positive patients are excluded from the study based on theoretical concerns&#xD;
             regarding the effect of PS-341 on certain aspects of immune function. NF-KB is a&#xD;
             critical T cell activation protein (including through CD40L/CD 154 stimulation) and&#xD;
             also is involved in cytokine production. Because PS 341 effectively blocks NF-KB and&#xD;
             therefore could reduce or block the ability of T lymphocytes and other immune cells to&#xD;
             fight HIV, PS-341 should not be administered to HIV-positive patients. Additional&#xD;
             experiments in animal models are being conducted to better elucidate the effects of&#xD;
             PS-341 on HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant, suspected to be pregnant, or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to PS-341, boron, or mannitol.&#xD;
