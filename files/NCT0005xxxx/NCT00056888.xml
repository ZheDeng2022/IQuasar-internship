      This study will use three neurophysiological tests (see below) to determine what areas of the&#xD;
      brain are responsible for paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders. Patients with these&#xD;
      disorders have sudden, brief attacks of movement, similar to epileptic seizures, but without&#xD;
      loss of consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers and patients with two subtypes of paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement&#xD;
      disorder, paroxysmal dyskinesia and psychogenic variant, that can be induced by a specific&#xD;
      trigger, such as a sudden movement or prolonged exercise, will be included in this study.&#xD;
      Candidates must be 12 years of age or older. Women of childbearing potential will be screened&#xD;
      with a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo one or more of the procedures detailed below. Patients' test&#xD;
      results will be compared with those of normal volunteers. Before each test, participants will&#xD;
      provide a medical history and undergo a brief physical examination. During each procedure,&#xD;
      the subject will have surface electromyography (EMG) to measure the electrical activity of&#xD;
      muscles. For EMG, electrodes (metal discs) filled with a conductive gel are taped to the skin&#xD;
      over the muscle to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI uses a strong magnetic field, radio waves, and computer technology to provide detailed&#xD;
      images of the brain. For this test, the subject lies in a narrow cylinder (the scanner),&#xD;
      while pictures of the brain are taken. Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises caused by&#xD;
      electrical switching of radio frequency circuits used in the scanning process. For functional&#xD;
      MRI (fMRI), the subject is asked to mimic a movement that occurs during an attack, such as&#xD;
      stiffening the hand to make a fist or flexing and rotating the arm inward, to detect changes&#xD;
      in the brain regions involved in the movement. During the procedure, involuntary movements&#xD;
      and voluntary movements will be monitored by surface EMG and by video camera. The test will&#xD;
      last about 1-1/2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain (brain waves) with electrodes placed on the&#xD;
      scalp. During the procedure, muscle activity will be recorded with EMG. The subject will&#xD;
      first relax and then will be asked to mimic a movement attack. The test will last from 1-1/2&#xD;
      to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Startle Reflex&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will put on a headphone and hear loud noises in a random fashion. During the&#xD;
      test, muscle activity will be recorded with EMG and with a video c...&#xD;

      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine the brain regions responsible&#xD;
      during attacks for psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders using functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The secondary objective is to determine the&#xD;
      neurophysiology during attacks for the same subjects compared to normal controls using&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) and Startle Reflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder patients and a&#xD;
      control group of healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI: Anatomical MRI and fMRI sequences are performed to obtain blood-oxygenation&#xD;
      level-dependent (BOLD) imaging of brain activation during (1) triggered or provoked&#xD;
      involuntary hyperkinetic movements and voluntary imitated movements in subjects with&#xD;
      psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders and (2) voluntary imitated movements&#xD;
      and rest states in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG: EEG will be recorded for jerk-locked back-averaging analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Startle Reflex: Electromyography (EMG) will be recorded during exposure to auditory stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI: BOLD will be obtained using baseline correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Startle Reflex: The latency, mean amplitude, and habituation of EMG amplitude will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Established diagnosis of psychogenic hyperkinetic movement disorders. The diagnosis will&#xD;
        be established by the preliminary screening in the NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient&#xD;
        Clinic, based on review of medical record, history, clinical evaluation, and videotapes of&#xD;
        an attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Patients with clear onset stereotyped and defined hyperkinetic attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Patients only with paroxysmal attacks of hyperkinetic movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. Age 8 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E. A reproducible trigger of paroxysmal hyperkinetic attacks, such as sudden movement,&#xD;
        startle or prolonged exercise, which will produce attacks at least with 50% consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        F. Patients whose attacks can be precipitated easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        G. Patients with typical attack involving unilateral extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        H. Patients taking medication that may influence the central nervous system, such as&#xD;
        phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and antidepressants (but not limited&#xD;
        to these) will be asked to hold the medication prior to the study. A sufficient drug&#xD;
        washout period will be established dependant upon the individual drug. Subjects may be&#xD;
        admitted to the NIH if necessary. They will be asked to abstain from alcohol and caffeine&#xD;
        24 hours prior to the study as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Normal volunteers ranging from 8 to 65 will be included. Normal volunteers would be&#xD;
        recruited from people who are registered as HMCS Normal Volunteers. All subjects should&#xD;
        have a valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Alcohol abstention is required for all subjects for both fMRI and EEG for 24 hours&#xD;
        before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Age younger than 8 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Patients with attacks that involve head and neck movements, axial movements, bilateral&#xD;
        limb involvement, or violent attacks that typically make patients fall to the ground. With&#xD;
        respect to children, violent attacks are defined as any attack that can potentially result&#xD;
        in injury (hitting the head, falls, violent flailing, hitting furniture or walls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Previous history of or MRI findings consistent with brain tumors, strokes, trauma or&#xD;
        arterial venous malformations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. Contraindication to MRI such as having devices not compatible with MRI (pacemaker, an&#xD;
        implanted medical pump, brain stimulators, etc.), metallic prostheses in their body (metal&#xD;
        pins and rods, heart valves, cochlear implants, etc.), and history of working with metals&#xD;
        in the past, since such persons may potentially have small metal fragments in the eye&#xD;
        without being aware of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E. Any diagnosis of progressive neurological disorders other than psychogenic paroxysmal&#xD;
        hyperkinetic movement disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        F. Any history of significant medical disorders requiring chronic treatment with other&#xD;
        drugs that affects the CNS, which cannot be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        G. Women who are pregnant or nursing. Female subjects of childbearing potential (including&#xD;
        all girls after menarche) will have specific interview and a pregnancy test prior to the&#xD;
        study (before each imaging procedure if required) to ensure that they are not pregnant or&#xD;
        nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        H. Any subject who is not capable of giving an informed consent. This will be determined at&#xD;
        the initial evaluation at NINDS clinic. Patients with Mini Mental Score less than 25 or&#xD;
        significant psychiatric history will be further evaluated by detailed neuropsychiatric&#xD;
        testing, or consultation with a psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal Volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Normal subjects younger than 8 years and older than 65 will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Normal subjects with MRI findings consistent with organic brain lesions such as brain&#xD;
        tumors, stroke, trauma or AVMs will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Normal subjects with a history of significant medical disorders such as cancers, or&#xD;
        requiring continuous treatment with drugs will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. Subjects with mental disorders will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E. We will not scan pregnant women because safety of high magnetic field to fetus is not&#xD;
        established. Therefore, we will administer a urine pregnancy test for any female subjects&#xD;
        of childbearing potential 24 hours prior to functional MRI scan.&#xD;
