      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is 1. To comprehensively evaluate patients with autoinflammatory&#xD;
      diseases clinically, genetically and immunologically at the autoinflammatory disease clinic&#xD;
      at the NIH. 2. To follow patients with autoinflammatory Diseases that are genetically defined&#xD;
      including Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), the most severe clinical&#xD;
      phenotype of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), Deficiency of IL-1 Receptor&#xD;
      Antagonist (DIRA), Chronic Atypical Neutrophilic Dermatosis with Lipodystrophy and Elevated&#xD;
      temperatures (CANDLE), and STING-Associated Vasculopathy with onset in Infancy (SAVI), and&#xD;
      those with genetically undefined autoinflammatory disorders to determine long-term disease&#xD;
      outcomes. 3. To develop biomarkers that help us assess disease activity and response to&#xD;
      treatment. 4. To assess the eligibility of affected patients for inclusion in ongoing and&#xD;
      planned treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: The goals of our studies are to understand the underlying immune dysregulation, to&#xD;
      identify the genetic cause and to translate our findings into novel treatments that improve&#xD;
      patients disease outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with known NOMID/CAPS, DIRA, CANDLE, SAVI, CRMO, Still's Disease, and with&#xD;
           other yet undifferentiated autoinflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy adult and pediatric relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated at the NIH for 2-5 days. All participants will have a detailed&#xD;
      medical history, physical exam, blood tests and other evaluations depending on the extend of&#xD;
      their autoinflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also expect the following assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical test that help assess organ damage and functional impact such as hearing&#xD;
           vision, memory and learning tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Imaging studies to characterize the organ involvement of the inflammatory disease&#xD;
           including: X-rays, CT scans, special MRIs, bone scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Laboratory evaluations including clinical markers of disease activity, research samples&#xD;
           for genetic studies, and blood samples for cytokine/biomarker assessment, and gene&#xD;
           expression profiling.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Completion of questionnaires to assess disease activity and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If indicated, other procedures may be administered that include: a lumbar puncture if&#xD;
           CNS inflammation is suspected and a skin biopsy if skin inflammation is present. other&#xD;
           gastrointestinal procedures as they are clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients my have a research skin biopsy taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may return for a single follow-up visits or for long term-follow up depending on&#xD;
      their disease and willingness to be followed long-term.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autoinflammatory multisystem diseases are a group of diseases that are characterized by&#xD;
      recurrent episodes of systemic inflammation as well as organ specific inflammation that can&#xD;
      involve the skin, eyes, joints, bones, serosal surfaces, inner ear, and brain. The prominent&#xD;
      role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of these disorders has first become evident through the&#xD;
      discovery of mutations in CIAS1 causing the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS)&#xD;
      including the most severe presentation Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease&#xD;
      (NOMID). Over the years we identified additional autoinflammatory diseases including DIRA&#xD;
      (Deficiency of IL-1 Receptor Antagonist), a disease that is caused by mutations in IL1RN.&#xD;
      Therapy with anakinra, the IL-1 receptor antagonist, can be life-saving. We also study&#xD;
      additional rare diseases not IL-1 mediated including CANDLE (chronic atypical neutrophilic&#xD;
      dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperatures) caused by mutations in proteasome&#xD;
      components, and recently SAVI (STING associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy) caused by&#xD;
      mutations in TMEM173, and juvenile dematomyositis (JDM) which shares some phenotypic features&#xD;
      as well as an interferon (IFN) signature with SAVI and CANDLE. Many additional&#xD;
      autoinflammatory phenotypes have no genetic causes, including autoinflammatory disorders that&#xD;
      are not even clinically defined. Clinical conditions including the spectrum CRMO (Chronic&#xD;
      Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis), Still s disease, and Beh(SqrRoot)(Beta)et s disease (BD)&#xD;
      with possible involvement of IL-1 dysregulation are also of interest.. In this research&#xD;
      protocol we seek to comprehensively evaluate affected patients clinically, genetically,&#xD;
      immunologically, and endocrinologically. In addition we intend to evaluate longterm outcomes&#xD;
      and biomarkers over the time of observations. Eligibility for ongoing and planned treatment&#xD;
      protocols will be determined by screening patients in this protocol. We plan to evaluate&#xD;
      patients on a consultative basis for other autoinflammatory diseases for possible enrollment&#xD;
      into this study.&#xD;
