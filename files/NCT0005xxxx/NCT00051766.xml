  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a computer-assisted,&#xD;
      self-administered adherence program for patients on complicated anti-HIV drug regimens.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV produces dramatic reductions in&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality for many patients who maintain a high level of adherence to their&#xD;
      medications. However, 20% to 33% of HIV infected patients will miss at least one of their&#xD;
      medication doses over a one to three day period. Patient self-report is the most practical&#xD;
      method for assessing adherence, but it may produce unreliable and invalid results unless&#xD;
      optimally performed. A computer-assisted, self-administered adherence program could improve&#xD;
      HIV infected patients' adherence behaviors by accurately and efficiently assessing their&#xD;
      medication adherence, delivering an adherence intervention to patients, and producing&#xD;
      adherence reports for providers. By providing a neutral and seemingly private interview,&#xD;
      computer programs may increase patient disclosure of non-adherence. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of a computer-assisted, self-administered adherence program in reducing regimen&#xD;
      misunderstandings and enhancing patient adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be recruited from within the Positive Health Program at San&#xD;
      Francisco General Hospital. Patients will be randomly assigned to a Control or Intervention&#xD;
      Group. Control Group participants will complete an audio computer-assisted self-interview&#xD;
      (A-CASI) assessing their understanding of their medication regimen and adherence.&#xD;
      Intervention Group participants will complete the adherence A-CASI and will receive a brief&#xD;
      computer-delivered intervention consisting of a graphical depiction of their correct regimen&#xD;
      and strategies for improving adherence. Study investigators will forward a computer-generated&#xD;
      adherence report, which summarizes their adherence and suggests appropriate interventions, to&#xD;
      the Intervention Group's health care providers. All participants will be assessed at least&#xD;
      three times over a 6-month period: study entry, Month 3, and Month 6.&#xD;
