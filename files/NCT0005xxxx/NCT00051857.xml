    <textblock>
      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound images to study how&#xD;
      muscles, tendons, and bones work together to cause motion. The procedure is one of several&#xD;
      tools being developed to characterize normal and impaired musculoskeletal function, with the&#xD;
      goal of developing improved methods of diagnosis and treatment of movement disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers must be age 5 to unlimited, with or without joint impairment, may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Volunteers with joint impairment may not have serious injury to&#xD;
      the joint being studied, previous surgery on the joint being studied, or extreme pain at the&#xD;
      joint being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI uses a strong magnet and radio waves to create images of the inside of the body. The&#xD;
      subject lies on a long narrow couch inside a metal cylinder (the scanner) for up to 3 hours&#xD;
      while the scanner gathers data. Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises caused by electrical&#xD;
      switching of radiofrequency circuits used in the scanning process. A special pad or tube may&#xD;
      be placed over or around the region being scanned to improve the quality of the data. The&#xD;
      subject will be asked to repeatedly move a specific joint, such as the knee, for brief&#xD;
      periods, usually less than 5 minutes. The subject can communicate via intercom with the&#xD;
      person performing the study at all times during the procedure, and may request to stop the&#xD;
      study at any time.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this technology development initiative is to greatly advance the clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal impairments as they relate to joint function. The&#xD;
      primary focus of this protocol is to initially develop and ultimately validate a combined set&#xD;
      of tools (virtual functional anatomy - VFA) that will enable the accurate and precise&#xD;
      measurement, analysis and visualization of three-dimensional (3D) static and dynamic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal anatomy (i.e., bone shape, skeletal kinematics, tendon and ligament strain,&#xD;
      muscle force, and joint space) from imaging data. We plan to merge and extend our existing MR&#xD;
      imaging and analysis capabilities with ultrasound imaging and analysis for the development&#xD;
      and implementation of a highly accurate, imaging-based measurement and analysis technique for&#xD;
      the non-invasive quantification of complete joint anatomy and tissue dynamics during&#xD;
      functional movements. In short, we plan to develop a method for creating 3D digital images of&#xD;
      loaded and moving joint tissues (bone, cartilage, and connective tissues) that reveal joint&#xD;
      contact patterns and tissue loads. In conjunction with building this tool, we will evaluate&#xD;
      the variability of bone shape across subjects, the sensitivity of defined joint posture&#xD;
      (translation and rotation of one bone relative to another) to osteo-based coordinate system&#xD;
      definition, and the ability to ultimately use these tools to document and evaluate the&#xD;
      function of normal and impaired joint structures (e.g., ACL rupture, patella tracking&#xD;
      syndrome...) under simulated conditions experienced during activities of daily living. The&#xD;
      principal investigator has previously developed and tested the primary component in the VFA&#xD;
      package, cine-phase contrast and fast-phase contrast (fast-PC) MRI, demonstrating both to be&#xD;
      highly accurate and precise in the measurement of normal 3D knee joint kinematics and biceps&#xD;
      femoris strain. Additional investigators have previously developed techniques for imaging&#xD;
      musculoskeletal structures using ultrasonography, demonstrating these techniques to be,&#xD;
      likewise, highly accurate and precise in the measurement of biomechanical properties of the&#xD;
      soft tissues surrounding the knee and the tendons of the quadriceps femoris. Under this&#xD;
      protocol we propose to develop additional numerical reconstruction, image analysis, and&#xD;
      display methods and test the applicability of fast-PC MRI and ultrasound to the study of&#xD;
      various normal and impaired joints (e.g., ankle, wrist, and knee). This development process&#xD;
      will require data from human subjects obtained from both static and dynamic MR and ultrasound&#xD;
      images. This development is being guided by our philosophy that impaired joint function&#xD;
      likely occurs due to abnormal bone shape, abnormal musculoskeletal movements and forces, or&#xD;
      both abnormal bone shape and musculoskeletal movements and forces. Thus, our long-term vision&#xD;
      is to non-invasively quantify the in vivo 3D joint kinematics, bone shapes and tissue loads&#xD;
      for both the impaired and normal volunteer populations, translate the methods and findings&#xD;
      into interventional research and ultimately into common clinical practice.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All individuals must be between ages of 5 to 95. For subjects under 18 years of age,&#xD;
             they must be capable of giving assent with a parent or legal guardian providing&#xD;
             parental/guardian permission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects ages 18 and above, they must be able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
             Subjects will either be healthy controls or affected individuals with a specific&#xD;
             musculoskeletal impairment, pathology, or variant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any relevant medical problems (connective tissue problems, active arthritis, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinical signs of an impairment in the joint being studied, such as mechanical&#xD;
             joint abnormalities including abnormal range of motion, muscle weakness, malalignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious injury to the joint being studied, previous surgery on the joint being&#xD;
             studied or extreme pain at the joint being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - ALL VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All potentials volunteers for the MR portion of this study must complete the NIH Diagnostic&#xD;
        Radiology screening questionnaire. If any potential contraindication is found, either the&#xD;
        volunteer's doctor (with knowledge of the potential contraindication) or the radiology&#xD;
        department at the NIH will be contacted to determine if the potential contraindication&#xD;
        would exclude you from the specific MR scans being proposed. Volunteers will be excluded if&#xD;
        it is deemed that they have a condition, which would preclude them from participating in an&#xD;
        MRI study (e.g. paralyzed hemidiaphragm, morbid obesity, claustrophobia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lastly, females who are pregnant will be excluded from participating in this study in order&#xD;
        to prevent any possible damage to the fetus.&#xD;
