    <textblock>
      This study will explore the causes and eye problems of X-linked juvenile retinoschisis&#xD;
      (XLRS), an inherited disease that causes vision loss primarily in young males. The vision&#xD;
      loss, which worsens over time, is a result of schisis, or splitting, of the layers of the&#xD;
      retina (tissue that lines the back of the eye). A better understanding of why and how XLRS&#xD;
      develops might lead to improved treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 9 months of age and older with XLRS and females who are suspected carriers of the&#xD;
      gene responsible for the disease (such as the mother of the patient) may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Other family members of patients also may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal and family medical history to review past and current medical conditions and&#xD;
           treatments, particularly regarding eye disease, and to construct a family tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and examine pupils, lens,&#xD;
           retina, and eye movements. The pupils will be dilated with drops for this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photography of the retina to help evaluate the status of the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specialized eye tests to evaluate color vision, field of vision, and ability to see in&#xD;
           the dark.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinogram (ERG) to examine what happens to the eyes after a flash of bright&#xD;
           light. For this test, the patient sits in a dark room for 30 minutes with his or her&#xD;
           eyes patched. Then, a small silver disk electrode is taped to the forehead, the eye&#xD;
           patches are removed, the surface of the eye is numbed with eye drops and contact lenses&#xD;
           are placed on the eyes. The patient looks inside a large empty bowl and then a light&#xD;
           flashes, first in the dark and then with a light turned on inside the bowl. The contact&#xD;
           lenses sense small electrical signals generated by the retina when the light flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test to examine DNA for genetic study of XLRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members will provide a blood sample for genetic study.&#xD;

      Objectives: The overall goal of this protocol is to better understand the etiology of XLRS&#xD;
      disease to facilitate further research to identify a potential treatment for the disease. The&#xD;
      specific primary objectives of this study are to: 1. Investigate the relationship between&#xD;
      genotype and phenotype in X-Linked Retinoschisis by correlating four phenotype severity&#xD;
      classes with two classes of genotypes (refer to Section 7. for definitions). This is the&#xD;
      first step in developing a comprehensive genotype-phenotype correlation. 2. Characterize the&#xD;
      anatomical and functional characteristics of retinoschisis to refine the phenotype scale and&#xD;
      investigate and characterize specific XLRS1 mutations to generate a well-documented&#xD;
      genotype-phenotype correlation map. With the opportunity to study the genotypes and&#xD;
      phenotypes of many affected males and the genotype of family members, a secondary objective&#xD;
      of this study will be to develop a detailed pedigree for affected families. This information&#xD;
      may be used to develop preliminary risk estimates for potential carrier females. Study&#xD;
      Population: Up to 500 participants may enroll in this study. A minimum of 150 of participants&#xD;
      are expected to be males diagnosed with X-Linked Retinoschisis. Participants may be recruited&#xD;
      from the NIH and also from participating off-site locations. The quality of the genetic&#xD;
      observation is directly proportional to the number of affected individuals and&#xD;
      genetically-different families enrolled. Design: This natural history, multi-center, registry&#xD;
      study to enroll males diagnosed with X-Linked Retinoschisis and the family members of&#xD;
      affected individuals. Onsite affected males will undergo clinical examination and have their&#xD;
      blood drawn for genotyping. Onsite unaffected participants will undergo eye examinations.&#xD;
      Blood may also be drawn from the onsite unaffected participants but this is not required.&#xD;
      Sites outside of NIH are participating as referral centers to accumulate the cohort. Offsite&#xD;
      affected male participants will forward a blood sample and records from previous eye&#xD;
      examinations to the NEI for review and analysis. Offsite unaffected participants will forward&#xD;
      records from previous eye examinations and may provide a blood sample although this is not&#xD;
      required. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the categorization of the proband's&#xD;
      genotype and phenotype and determination of the relationship between the two.&#xD;
