  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out the highest safe dose of&#xD;
      DOTAP:Chol-fus1 that can be given to participants in the treatment of non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This study is an attempt to transfer a gene&#xD;
      (fus1) into cancer cells, using the drug DOTAP:Cholesterol-fus1. Researchers will also study&#xD;
      the side effects of this experimental gene transfer at different doses, and will conduct&#xD;
      tests to see if there are any effects on tumor size at different doses. Experimental transfer&#xD;
      of the fus1 gene into humans has never been tried before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the toxicity of DOTAP:Cholesterol-fus1 Liposome Complex (DOTAP:Chol-fus1)&#xD;
           administered intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximal tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of DOTAP:Chol-fus1&#xD;
           administered intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the expression of fus1 following intravenous delivery of DOTAP:Chol-fus1 in tumor&#xD;
           and normal bronchial epithelial cell biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess any anti-cancer activity for DOTAP:Chol-fus1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DOTAP:Chol-fus1 is a drug that helps transfer the fus1 gene into cancer cells. It is thought&#xD;
      that the absence of the fus1 gene may be involved in the development of lung cancer tumors.&#xD;
      The idea is to try to replace this gene in lung cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study must have advanced lung cancer that has worsened after receiving&#xD;
      prior chemotherapy. Before treatment begins, participants will have a physical exam. Blood&#xD;
      (about 2 tablespoons) and urine tests will be performed. Women able to have children will&#xD;
      have a blood pregnancy test. Please note that it is possible that the tumor could cause a&#xD;
      &quot;positive&quot; pregnancy test result, when you are not pregnant. If a pregnancy test comes back&#xD;
      positive, and for any reason you and/or the research staff believes that this may be an&#xD;
      error, additional tests may be done to confirm or rule out pregnancy. The participant's tumor&#xD;
      will be measured using CT, PET/CT or MRI scans. Participants will also have an EKG (heart&#xD;
      function test) and a MUGA scan or echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A treatment cycle on this study is 3 weeks. Participants will receive pre-medications of&#xD;
      dexamethasone and diphenhydramine prior to the infusion of DOTAP:Chol-fus1 to try to lessen&#xD;
      the potential reactions to the infusion. The participant will receive a short infusion of&#xD;
      DOTAP:Chol-fus1 by vein once every 3 weeks. Participants will be examined by their doctor&#xD;
      before each treatment. In addition, participants will return to the clinic on days 2, 3, and&#xD;
      8 after the first dose to have blood tests done, their vital signs checked, and to look for&#xD;
      side effects. After every two treatment cycles or 6 weeks, the participant's tumor will be&#xD;
      measured using a CT or MRI scan. Participants can continue to receive treatments until the&#xD;
      tumor gets worse, side effects become too severe, or a maximum of 6 treatments have been&#xD;
      given. Treatment may continue for participants who continue to benefit from the treatment at&#xD;
      the end of the planned 6 treatments if the treating physician, the principle investigator,&#xD;
      and an advisor from the FDA all agree. Participants will return to the clinic 3 weeks after&#xD;
      their last dose of DOTAP:Chol-fus1 to have their vital signs checked and to look for side&#xD;
      effects. After all treatments are finished, participants will be contacted every 3 months for&#xD;
      an update on their health and to gather information about any other treatment(s) they have&#xD;
      received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants entered at a given dose level will not be able to receive a higher dose while on&#xD;
      study. A group of 3 participants will receive DOTAP:Chol-fus1 by vein at each dose level.&#xD;
      After treating 3 participants at a given dose level, the participants will be observed for 2&#xD;
      weeks to evaluate the toxicity. The information showing if the participants develop severe&#xD;
      side effects, referred to as dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), will be recorded for computing the&#xD;
      chance of toxicity. This information will be used to help select the dose level for the next&#xD;
      group of participants. The goal is to find the dose level where 10% of participants develop&#xD;
      severe side effects (dose-limiting toxicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will be treated in a dose-escalation fashion starting from the lowest&#xD;
      level. The next dose level can be moved up if calculation of the side effects shows that a&#xD;
      higher dose is needed. However, no skipping of doses is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 51 individuals will receive study drug on this study.&#xD;
      All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

             serial beta-HCG levels two weeks apart that are inconsistent with pregnancy and a&#xD;
             Gynecology consult to ensure that the beta- HCG level was at a value high enough to&#xD;
             see pregnancy with TVUS. Subjects must agree to practice effective birth control&#xD;
             during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Negative serology for Human Immunodeficiency Virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be &gt;/= 4 weeks beyond major surgical procedures such as thoracotomy,&#xD;
