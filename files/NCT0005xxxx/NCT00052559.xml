  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bevacizumab when given&#xD;
      together with fluorouracil and external-beam radiation therapy in treating patients with&#xD;
      stage II or stage III rectal cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block&#xD;
      cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them.&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they&#xD;
      stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.&#xD;
      Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) neutralizing antibody, bevacizumab, when administered concurrently with 5-fluorouracil&#xD;
      (5-FU) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in patients with clinical stage T3 or T4&#xD;
      rectal cancer prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain preliminary data of the pathological response rate after preoperative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To obtain preliminary data regarding progression free survival, local control, and&#xD;
      overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To obtain preliminary data of the changes in the angiogenic profile of rectal cancer&#xD;
      induced by this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 (courses 1-4). Beginning with&#xD;
      course 2, patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-14 and undergo&#xD;
      external beam radiotherapy on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo surgery 7 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of bevacizumab until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 20 additional&#xD;
      patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then&#xD;
      annually for 2 years.&#xD;

             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with bevacizumab; these potential risks may also apply to other&#xD;
