  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of benzydamine&#xD;
      hydrochloride 0.15% oral rinse to a vehicle oral rinse in the treatment of radiation-induced&#xD;
      oral mucositis, and to compare the care normally used for radiation-induced oral mucositis to&#xD;
      vehicle oral rinse to ensure that the vehicle does not have detrimental effects on the oral&#xD;
      mucosa&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study including an&#xD;
      open-label standard of care arm, to determine the effectiveness and safety of benezydamine&#xD;
      hydrochloride 0.15% oral rinse as compared with vehicle oral rinse, and vehicle oral rinse as&#xD;
      compared to the care normally used in the treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis. The&#xD;
      hypotheses are that benzydamine hydrochloride 0.15% oral rinse is better than vehicle oral&#xD;
      rinse as measured by the proportion of patients reaching a WHO mucositis score of 3 by 5500&#xD;
      cGy and vehicle is no worse than the standard of care as measured by the proportion of&#xD;
      patients reaching a WHO mucositis score of 3 by 5500 cGy. Patients receiving benzydamine&#xD;
      hydrochloride 0.15% or vehicle double-blind oral rinses will place 15 mL in the mouth for 2&#xD;
      minutes, gargling for a few seconds at the beginning and end of the rinse, and then&#xD;
      expectorate the entire dose. Dosing with oral rinses will be every 2 - 3 hours while awake&#xD;
      for a minimum of 4 times daily to a maximum of 8 times per day. Double-blind oral rinses will&#xD;
      continue daily throughout the duration of the subjects radiation treatment regimen plus 2&#xD;
      additional weeks&#xD;
