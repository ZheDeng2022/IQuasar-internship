      This study evaluates the relationship between mood changes and hormones in women with&#xD;
      postpartum depression (PPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study; volunteers who participate will not receive any new or&#xD;
      experimental therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPD is similar to major depression, but develops around the time a woman gives birth. Women&#xD;
      with PPD often suffer serious physical and emotional impairments. Controversy exists&#xD;
      regarding the role of hormone changes in postpartum depression. This study will examine the&#xD;
      role of hormone changes in three groups of women: those who recently gave birth and have mild&#xD;
      to moderately severe PDD (Group 1), women who recently gave birth and do not have PDD (Group&#xD;
      2), and those who are currently pregnant and experienced an episode of PDD with a previous&#xD;
      birth (Group 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and&#xD;
      urine tests. Upon study entry, they will be interviewed about their moods, behaviors, and&#xD;
      medical status during and immediately following their last pregnancy. Some women will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in interviews, psychological tests, and blood tests. They will also&#xD;
      complete self-rating scales and may be asked to collect samples of their urine. Women in&#xD;
      Group 3 will complete self-rating scales for 6 months postpartum. Participants will&#xD;
      participate in genetic studies that involve completing a questionnaire and providing a blood&#xD;
      sample. If the participant allows, sisters and parents may be asked to provide a blood sample&#xD;
      and undergo a psychiatric interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet the criteria for minor depression or major depression that is no&#xD;
      greater than moderate severity will be asked to participate in a companion study that will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of estradiol in reducing depression symptoms.&#xD;

      Controversy exists regarding the relevance of changes in gonadal steroids for&#xD;
      postpartum-onset depressions. The purpose of this protocol is to allow for the careful&#xD;
      screening of patients and healthy volunteers for participation in research protocols that&#xD;
      examine the role of gonadal steroids in postpartum-onset depressions (PPD) and for the&#xD;
      collection of natural history data. Women in this protocol will undergo an evaluation which&#xD;
      may include: a psychiatric interview; a diagnostic interview; rating scales; a medical&#xD;
      history; a physical exam; blood and urine laboratory evaluation; and a request for medical&#xD;
      records. The data collected may also be linked with data from other PPD protocols (e.g., DNA,&#xD;
      psychophysiology tests, treatment studies, etc.) for the purposes of better understanding the&#xD;
      diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment response of women with PPD. Upon conclusion of the&#xD;
      screening process, subjects will either be offered participation in a research protocol and&#xD;
      will sign the appropriate informed consent, or will be considered not appropriate for&#xD;
      participation in research and will be referred back into the community. The second purpose of&#xD;
      this protocol is to permit the identification of pregnant women who are at risk for&#xD;
      developing postpartum depression (PPD), and who are followed longitudinally through the&#xD;
      postpartum in an effort to confirm the association of depression onset with change in&#xD;
      reproductive endocrine function. This protocol, then, serves as a screening and evaluation&#xD;
      protocol to recruit subjects who are characterized with standard measures in this protocol&#xD;
      and then offered participation in related studies.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cross-sectional Screening: The postpartum subjects of this protocol will be women who meet&#xD;
        the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of at least two weeks with postpartum-related mood or behavioral disturbances&#xD;
             of at least moderate severity - that is, disturbances that are distinct in appearance&#xD;
             and associated with a mild to moderate degree of functional impairment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The onset of mood symptoms occurred within three months of delivery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 20-45; The selection of the lower limit of this age window is intended to reduce&#xD;
             the potential confound that the psychosocial stress of a teenage pregnancy could&#xD;
             complicate the relationship between postpartum hormonal events and mood. The upper age&#xD;
             limit was selected since pregnancy and childbirth in a woman over this age range could&#xD;
             lead to spontaneous menopause and, therefore, our ability to discern the effects of&#xD;
             estrogen therapy on mood could be complicated by estrogen s effects on menopausal&#xD;
             symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of normal delivery (vaginal or caesarean) within last six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior estrogen replacement therapy for treatment of postpartum physical or&#xD;
             emotional symptoms within the last six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In good medical health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be competent to comprehend the purpose of the screening process and to&#xD;
             provide written informed consent and be willing to participate in NIMH IRB approved&#xD;
             research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A control group of age-matched postpartum women who meet patient selection criteria&#xD;
             with the exception of the presence of mood or behavioral disorders will also be&#xD;
             sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current antidepressant therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should have no general medical illness that is primary (i.e., appears to be&#xD;
             causing the mood disorder);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current alcohol or substance use or dependence (excluding nicotine) of sufficient&#xD;
             magnitude to require independent, concurrent treatment intervention (e.g., antabuse or&#xD;
             opiate treatment, but not including self-help groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This protocol is a screening protocol for an estradiol treatment study (03-M-0161) for&#xD;
             which the exclusion criteria include the current use of antidepressant medications.&#xD;
             However, antidepressants will not be withheld from subjects who need or want them.&#xD;
             Immediately after screening subjects will either be enrolled in the estrogen treatment&#xD;
             study or in traditional therapy until care can be transitioned to the community. There&#xD;
             are few exclusion criteria for the evaluation component of this protocol; however, all&#xD;
             women will undergo a structured diagnostic interview Those women who will be asked to&#xD;
             participate in the companion protocol evaluating the efficacy of estradiol&#xD;
             administration in PPD will meet either research diagnostic criteria for minor&#xD;
             depression with at least three core symptoms (SADS-L (90) or major depression&#xD;
             (SCID-IV) (91) of not greater than moderate severity on the Global Assessment of&#xD;
             Functioning Scale (GAF) (91)) and will not meet DSM-IV criteria # 9 (suicide) or&#xD;
             require immediate treatment. Subjects meeting major depression with greater than&#xD;
             moderate severity may participate in the evaluation phase of this study but will be&#xD;
             offered a referral to an outside facility for standard antidepressant treatment (i.e.,&#xD;
             they are not candidates for participation in the IRB approved treatment protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
        LONGITUDINAL SCREENING:&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE AT RISK PREGNANT WOMEN:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of current mood or behavioral disturbance as determined by a structured&#xD;
             diagnostic interview;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past history of postpartum depression;&#xD;

          -  In good medical health,&#xD;

        in this protocol.&#xD;
