  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a preliminary study to evaluate the possible use of transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS), together with exercise, for rehabilitation of chronic stroke patients. It will&#xD;
      identify the optimum stimulation settings (within the limits of current safety guidelines) to&#xD;
      be used in a later rehabilitation study and confirm the safety of the procedure at these&#xD;
      settings. Some previous studies using TMS to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease have shown improvement in motor function; others have not. The results of this study&#xD;
      may provide information to help researchers design better rehabilitation treatments after&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke patients with residual arm function and no history of seizures may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. The stroke must have occurred at least 6 months before entry into the study and&#xD;
      must have affected only one side of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the TMS procedure, subjects are seated in a comfortable chair with their hands placed on&#xD;
      a pillow on their lap. An insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp. A brief electrical&#xD;
      current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the outer part&#xD;
      of the brain, called the cortex. This may cause muscle, hand or arm twitching if the coil is&#xD;
      near the part of the brain that controls movement, or it may affect movements or reflexes.&#xD;
      Subjects are asked to make movements, do simple tasks, or tense muscles. Metal electrodes are&#xD;
      taped to the skin over the muscle for computer recording of the electrical activity of the&#xD;
      hand and arm muscles activated by the stimulation. The testing lasts 2-3 hours.&#xD;

      Stroke survivors are often left with permanent physical and mental disabilities that create a&#xD;
      major social and economic burden. Many of these patients receive different therapies in an&#xD;
      attempt to improve their independence and quality of life. However, most of the current&#xD;
      strategies are focused on the acute stage after stroke and are of limited influence in&#xD;
      improving stroke outcome. One of the main problems of patients who have suffered a stroke is&#xD;
      the difficulty in appropriately using the hand contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere; to&#xD;
      date we have no successful means to improve the hand function in chronic stages of stroke.&#xD;
      This protocol attempts to address this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising technique is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) that, so far,&#xD;
      has produced some effects on motor function on other movement disorders like Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD). We hypothesize that rTMS will have a beneficial effect on motor function in&#xD;
      chronic stroke patients. Specifically, we propose to look at the effect of 20 and 25 Hz&#xD;
      stimulation since these types of stimulation have been shown to increase the excitability of&#xD;
      the cerebral cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to investigate the effect of repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) on the motor cortex of chronic stroke patients and motor function. Four&#xD;
      different stimulation parameters within the limits of current safety guidelines will be used.&#xD;
      We plan to determine; 1) which rTMS stimulation parameters induce more cortex excitability,&#xD;
      2) whether there is any improvement of hand motor function after rTMS, and 3) if the applied&#xD;
      stimulation parameters are safe in chronic stroke patients. The optimal parameters will be&#xD;
      subsequently proposed for use in an experimental protocol for rehabilitation.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Fifteen adult and impaired patients (right or left) with residual arm function who have had&#xD;
        a single monohemispheric ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (documented by CT or MRI) at least&#xD;
        6 months before, without severe proprioceptive deficits, independent of previous physical&#xD;
        therapy will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        They should be able to perform the pinch task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Their gender or ethnic origin will not provide bias for inclusion to the study.&#xD;
