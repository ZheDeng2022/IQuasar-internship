  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and immune response to a two-part HIV vaccine. Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers who are at low risk of HIV infection will receive either active vaccine or a&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and immunogenicity of a candidate vaccine&#xD;
      strategy for HIV prophylaxis using a DNA-prime plus recombinant fowlpox boost. The DNA&#xD;
      plasmid and fowlpox vector contain HIV genes. However, these vaccines contain only some HIV&#xD;
      genes and cannot themselves cause HIV or AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible volunteers at low risk of HIV infection will be randomized to receive either active&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo injections at Day 0, Week 4, and Week 8. Intensive immunologic and safety&#xD;
      monitoring will be done during the first 16 weeks of the study. Follow-up will continue to&#xD;
      Week 52.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identifiable risk behavior for HIV infection, including: sexual partners of HIV&#xD;
             positive people, sexual intercourse with a partner of unknown HIV status if that&#xD;
             partner is reported to be at higher risk for HIV infection, gay men reporting any&#xD;
             unprotected anal intercourse with partners of unknown status in the 12 months&#xD;
             preceding study entry, individuals diagnosed with a sexually transmissible infection&#xD;
             (STI) in the 12 months preceding entry that may have been acquired through anal or&#xD;
             vaginal intercourse, individuals reporting sharing of injecting equipment in the last&#xD;
             12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV candidate vaccines in a previous HIV vaccine trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Live attenuated vaccines within 60 days prior to entering the study. Whole killed,&#xD;
             toxoid, or sub-unit vaccines (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal, tetanus, and hepatitis B)&#xD;
             are not exclusionary within 4 weeks prior to the scheduled experimental HIV vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to egg products or a known history of anaphylaxis or any other&#xD;
             serious adverse reactions to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of serious allergic reaction requiring hospitalization or emergency medical&#xD;
             care (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bronchospasm, or hypotension) to any substance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant illness requiring immunomodulatory or cytotoxic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cancer unless there is evidence of surgical excision followed by a&#xD;
             sufficient observation period to give a reasonable assurance of cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood products or immunoglobulins within 6 months prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Experimental or investigational agents within 30 days prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recreational and/or therapeutic drug use that might compromise the study participant's&#xD;
             safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical or psychiatric condition or occupational responsibilities that preclude&#xD;
             compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
