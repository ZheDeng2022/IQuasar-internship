  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will identify changes that occur in the nervous system of healthy normal&#xD;
      volunteers while they are learning a cycling task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects 18 years of age and older who can cycle for 16 minutes may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates will be screened with a brief medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complex training: Cycling for 16 minutes at a constant speed of 60 rpm with frequent&#xD;
           changes in pedal resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simple training: Cycling for 16 minutes at a constant speed of 60 rpm with no changes in&#xD;
           pedal resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No training: Remaining seated on the bike for 16 minutes performing no exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will cycle for 16 minutes for the training task, plus 4 minutes before and after&#xD;
      the training. Reflexes will be measured with nerve conduction studies and somatosensory&#xD;
      evoked potential (SSEP) recordings before and after training. Nerve conduction studies&#xD;
      measure the speed with which nerves conduct electrical impulses and the strength of the&#xD;
      connection between the nerve and the muscle. For these studies, a probe is placed on the skin&#xD;
      over the calf muscles and the knee to deliver a small electrical stimulus, and wires are&#xD;
      taped to the skin to record the impulses. SSEP recordings, which measure of the excitability&#xD;
      of the brain to sensory stimuli, are collected from electrodes placed on the scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the training period, multiple train stimulation (MTS) is applied for 10 minutes. For&#xD;
      MTS, weak electrical currents are delivered for 10 seconds every 10 seconds. These stimuli&#xD;
      produce a buzzing sensation without pain, discomfort, or muscle twitching. The MTS is&#xD;
      followed by another 4 minutes of cycling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants also undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For this procedure, an&#xD;
      insulated wire coil is held over the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the&#xD;
      coil, creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small&#xD;
      electrical currents in the brain cortex (outer part of the brain). The stimulation may cause&#xD;
      twitching in the muscles of the face, arm, or leg. The electrical activity of the muscles is&#xD;
      recorded with a computer or other recording device, using electrodes attached to the skin&#xD;
      with tape.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In a previous study, we have shown that locomotor training with frequent changes in pedal&#xD;
      resistances (complex training) elicits significant improvement in locomotor performance&#xD;
      compared to training consisting of constant pedal resistance (simple training). Behavior&#xD;
      gains associated with complex training correlate with down-regulation in the excitability of&#xD;
      the alpha-motoneurone pools controlling muscles involved in the training task, as measured by&#xD;
      changes in the soleus H-reflex, raising the hypothesis of a cause-effect link between&#xD;
      performance improvements and modulation of spinal cord function. The purpose of this protocol&#xD;
      is to determine if down-regulation in the excitability of the alpha-motoneuron pool is&#xD;
      required for the improvement in locomotor performance. To address this issue, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that up-regulation of alpha-motoneuron excitability will cancel improvements in locomotor&#xD;
      performance elicited by complex training more than in subjects undergoing a period of simple&#xD;
      training. The results of this study would provide novel information on the spinal substrates&#xD;
      underlying learning of a locomotor task in intact humans and could be relevant to the design&#xD;
      of rehabilitative strategies in patients with locomotor disorders.&#xD;
