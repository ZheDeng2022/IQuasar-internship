  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to examine the effect of the&#xD;
      hormone hydrocortisone on the brain's response to various facial expressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucocorticoids can influence emotional behavior and cognition; when given long-term, the&#xD;
      hormones may lead to mania or depression. One way glucocorticoids may influence emotional&#xD;
      behavior is by affecting the activity of certain parts of the brain that participate in&#xD;
      emotional processing. Brain imaging studies indicate that the amygdala, ventral medial&#xD;
      prefrontal, and other prefrontal cortical areas of the brain are activated during tasks that&#xD;
      require processing of emotional stimuli. These brain structures contain dense concentrations&#xD;
      of glucocorticoid receptors. This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      to study the brain activity of participants as they view faces that express different&#xD;
      emotions. Participants will perform this task under a dose of either the glucocorticoid&#xD;
      hydrocortisone or placebo (an inactive solution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be screened with a medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
      blood tests, and an interview about their mood, degree of nervousness, and behavior. On Visit&#xD;
      1, participants will undergo screening and neuropsychological testing. For 3 days prior to&#xD;
      Visit 2, participants will collect their saliva. During Visit 2, participants will undergo&#xD;
      MRI scans of the brain after infusion with either a high or low dose of hydrocortisone or&#xD;
      placebo. Participants will also undergo functional MRI (fMRI). Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected every 15 minutes during the scan. Following the MRI, participants will take&#xD;
      attention and memory tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoids influence performance on declarative memory tasks and tasks of memory for&#xD;
      emotional information. The cognitive effects of exogenous glucocorticoids depend on dose, the&#xD;
      time period between administration and testing, and the time of testing within the diurnal&#xD;
      pattern of cortisol secretion. Additionally, glucocorticoid administration can influence&#xD;
      mood, and with chronic administration glucocorticoids may lead to development of mania or&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential mechanism by which glucocorticoids may influence emotional behavior is via their&#xD;
      effects on the neurophysiological activity of the amygdala and prefrontal cortical structures&#xD;
      known to participate in emotional processing. Human imaging studies indicate that amygdala,&#xD;
      ventral medial prefrontal, and other prefrontal cortical areas are activated during tasks&#xD;
      requiring processing of affective stimuli. These data converge with lesion analysis and&#xD;
      electrophysiological studies performed in humans or experimental animals to indicate that&#xD;
      these structures participate in brain circuits that process emotional information. These&#xD;
      brain structures contain dense concentrations of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid&#xD;
      receptor mRNA, glucocorticoid receptors and mineralocorticoid receptors. Increased&#xD;
      glucocorticoids appear to potentiate activation of the amygdala and affect processing of&#xD;
      emotionally laden stimuli based on both experimental animal studies and correlational human&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study investigates the influence of glucocorticoids on the hemodynamic response&#xD;
      that occurs while processing emotionally-valenced visual stimuli known to activate the&#xD;
      amygdala and anatomically-related areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in healthy humans.&#xD;
      Functional magnetic resonance images will be acquired during the performance of tasks that&#xD;
      involve viewing emotionally expressive faces both before and following either hydrocortisone&#xD;
      (synthetic cortisol) (0.15 mg/kg or 0.45 mg/kg bolus) or placebo administration. The change&#xD;
      in the BOLD signal in structures of interest will be compared across high dose cortisol, low&#xD;
      dose cortisol and placebo conditions. In addition, the effects of hydrocortisone on relative&#xD;
      blood flow in the amygdala and PFC will be assessed using an arterial spin labeling (ASL)&#xD;
      technique to measure perfusion. The findings of this study will guide future research into&#xD;
      the effects of glucocorticoids on emotional perception in subjects with mood disorders.&#xD;
