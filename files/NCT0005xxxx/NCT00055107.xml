  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) is a parasite that can cause chronic diarrhea and is a&#xD;
      significant problem for HIV infected children in developing countries. C. parvum infection&#xD;
      can be treated with the drug nitazoxanide (NTZ). However, NTZ has not been tested in HIV&#xD;
      infected children. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of NTZ in HIV infected&#xD;
      children who have chronic diarrhea caused by C. parvum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: Twice-daily NTZ is safe and well tolerated in HIV infected infants,&#xD;
      children, and adolescents with chronic diarrhea caused by C. parvum infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      C. parvum is a significant opportunistic infection in much of the developing world, where&#xD;
      children may not have access to highly active antiretroviral therapy. There is currently no&#xD;
      established therapy for chronic cryptosporidiosis in HIV infected children. The FDA has&#xD;
      approved NTZ for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis diarrhea; however, there are no data on&#xD;
      the safety and effectiveness of NTZ in HIV infected children. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of different doses of NTZ in HIV infected children with chronic diarrhea&#xD;
      caused by C. parvum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Step 1, participants will receive one of four different doses of NTZ. Participants will&#xD;
      take NTZ twice a day for 56 days in either a liquid or pill form. All participants will be&#xD;
      closely monitored for drug toxicity. There will be seven study visits; they will occur at&#xD;
      study entry, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8, and Day 70. Study visits will include a physical exam&#xD;
      and blood, urine, and stool collection. Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling will be performed&#xD;
      during four of the study visits. PK sampling requires the participants to take their morning&#xD;
      NTZ doses while in the clinic; participants will undergo additional blood collection either&#xD;
      before or after taking NTZ. At the end of the 56-day study period, participants who are&#xD;
      experiencing a positive clinical benefit from NTZ and who have had no harmful side effects&#xD;
      may choose to continue taking NTZ for an additional 24 weeks and enter Step 2. Participants&#xD;
      who do not continue taking NTZ after Day 56 will be followed for 2 additional weeks.&#xD;
