  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-HIV drugs are usually given to patients at fixed, standardized doses. This study will&#xD;
      investigate alternative ways of dosing anti-HIV drugs to improve viral control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: The optimal dosage regimen required to obtain the maximum benefit from&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy is achieved with strategies that control for pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic variability among patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While optimism for the benefits of antiretroviral therapy remain justified, the response to&#xD;
      therapy varies widely. This variability arises because of differences among patients in&#xD;
      virologic, immunologic, behavioral, and pharmacologic factors, all of which impact&#xD;
      therapeutic success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiretroviral agents are presently administered to adults in standard fixed doses. However,&#xD;
      the same dose does not produce the same systemic and intracellular concentrations in all&#xD;
      patients. Recent research has shown that adjusting the doses of antiretroviral agents to&#xD;
      achieve target concentrations in plasma is associated with an improved anti-HIV response&#xD;
      compared with standard dose therapy. This study will extend the paradigm of&#xD;
      concentration-controlled therapy to develop intensified pharmacologic regimens for patients&#xD;
      experiencing persistent viremia while receiving antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two approaches will be investigated: 1) a regimen that targets concentrations of each&#xD;
      antiretroviral drug between the 50th and 75th percentile of expected concentrations in&#xD;
      adults; and 2) a novel regimen in which the target concentrations are based upon a desired&#xD;
      ratio between phenotypic drug susceptibility (IC90) and the concentrations of&#xD;
      pharmacologically active moieties, specifically intracellular nucleoside triphosphates and&#xD;
      unbound protease and nonnucleoside inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either one of the investigational approaches (Cohort II)&#xD;
      or to a control group receiving standard dose therapy (Cohort I). There are two study visits&#xD;
      in the first month; after the first month, study visits are scheduled monthly for five&#xD;
      additional months. Study visits include laboratory tests of virologic and immunologic&#xD;
      parameters, pharmacokinetic sampling, and adherence counseling and monitoring.&#xD;
