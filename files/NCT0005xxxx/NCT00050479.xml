      This study will compare the side effects of two laser treatments for diabetic macular edema,&#xD;
      a common condition in patients with diabetes. In macular edema, blood vessels in the retina,&#xD;
      a thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye become leaky and the retina swells. The&#xD;
      macula, the center part of the retina that is responsible for fine vision may also swell,&#xD;
      causing vision loss. Traditional laser treatment (argon blue or green or yellow) for macular&#xD;
      swelling, or edema, causes scarring that can expand and possibly lead to more loss of vision.&#xD;
      Studies with a different type of laser (diode) may be less damaging. The results of this&#xD;
      study on side effects of the treatments will be used to design a larger study of&#xD;
      effectiveness. This study will also examine whether celecoxib (CelebrexÂ® (Registered&#xD;
      Trademark)), an anti-arthritis drug that reduces inflammation and swelling, can reduce&#xD;
      inflammation and swelling of the retina. Patients with elevated cholesterol levels will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in a cholesterol reduction part of the study to compare normal-pace&#xD;
      cholesterol reduction with accelerated reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and macular edema that&#xD;
      requires laser treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history: to review past medical conditions and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination: to measure vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature,&#xD;
           breathing rate) and examine the head and neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, arms and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination: to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and examine pupils, lens,&#xD;
           retina, and eye movements. The pupils will be dilated with drops for this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: to measure cholesterol, blood clotting time, hemoglobin A1C (a measure of&#xD;
           diabetes control), and to evaluate liver and kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye photography: to help evaluate the status of the retina and changes that may occur in&#xD;
           the future. Special photographs of the inside of the eye are taken using a camera that&#xD;
           flashes a bright light into the eye. From 2 to 20 pictures may be taken, depending on&#xD;
           the eye condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography: to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected&#xD;
           into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina&#xD;
           are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if&#xD;
           any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel&#xD;
           abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to take celecoxib or placebo (an inactive, look-alike&#xD;
      pill). Participants who have elevated cholesterol levels may return for a brief visit after 1&#xD;
      month. All patients will return for follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients who&#xD;
      require laser treatment will be randomly assigned to one of the two laser treatments. For&#xD;
      these procedures, eye drops are put in the eye to numb the surface and a contact lens is&#xD;
      placed on the eye during the laser beam application. Several visits may be required for&#xD;
      additional laser treatments. The maximum number of treatments depends on how well the&#xD;
      treatment is working. Patients who respond well to the study medication may receive no laser&#xD;
      treatments. After the first year, patients will be followed every 6 months until either the&#xD;
      patient returns for a 3-year visit, the last enrolled patient returns for the 1-year visit,&#xD;
      or the patient requests to leave the study. During the follow-up visits, patients' response&#xD;
      to treatment will be evaluated with repeat tests of several of the screening exams.&#xD;

      This randomized pilot study is an important first step in planning a large multi-center&#xD;
      clinical trial to evaluate medical and laser approaches that could improve the visual outcome&#xD;
      for patients with diabetic retinopathy. This study will provide preliminary safety data on&#xD;
      these therapies as well as allow for assessment of the performance of ocular outcomes and&#xD;
      study design for use in subsequent trials. If there are no safety concerns, the results of&#xD;
      this pilot will be helpful in the design of a large multicenter clinical trial by providing&#xD;
      data on estimates of expected treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a factorial design, this study will compare (1) diode (micropulse) laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation to mild ETDRS style focal photocoagulation and, (2) treatment with a COX-2&#xD;
      inhibitor (celecoxib), or placebo prior to and following laser photocoagulation. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes are a visual acuity drop or increase of 15 letters or more from baseline to year 3.&#xD;
      The secondary outcome is a significant reduction in macular edema, defined as a 50% reduction&#xD;
      in thickening as measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a two step reduction in&#xD;
      macular thickness compared to standard stereoscopic fundus photographs, and a 50% reduction&#xD;
      in the area of leakage as measured by fluorescein angiography. The University of Wisconsin&#xD;
      Fundus Photography Reading Center will grade OCT, photographs, and angiograms and will be&#xD;
      masked to treatment assignment. Other secondary outcomes will include the timing of the first&#xD;
      required laser treatment, changes in visual acuity throughout the study, and the number of&#xD;
      laser treatments required during the course of the study. In addition, all adverse events and&#xD;
      abnormal laboratory values will be collected and tabulated. Specific objectives regarding&#xD;
      safety and efficacy follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is the risk of visual loss in patients with clinically significant diabetic macular edema&#xD;
      potentially different across treatment groups?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Assessment of Potential Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there evidence that any treatment combinations could be effective in reducing retinal&#xD;
      thickening?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there evidence that celecoxib may inhibit or induce retinal thickening?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the estimated treatment effects on vision?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is the number of laser treatments required to achieve a reduction in retinal thickening&#xD;
      similar across treatment groups?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary objective of this study will be to examine the effects of dramatically reducing&#xD;
      low-density lipoproteins cholesterol in patients with diabetic macular edema and elevated&#xD;
      serum lipid levels. Change vision and retinal thickness will be compared across three groups;&#xD;
      (1) patients without elevated serum lipids at baseline, (2) patients with elevated lipid&#xD;
      levels at baseline and receive standard of care treatment, and (3) patients with elevated&#xD;
      lipid levels at baseline and are aggressively treated pharmacologically.&#xD;
