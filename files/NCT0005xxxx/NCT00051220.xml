      This study will compare the effectiveness of three treatments in reducing symptoms of phobia&#xD;
      in children and adolescents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with specific phobias may experience academic, social, and personal distress, as&#xD;
      well as interference in day-to-day activities. One-Session Treatment has been found a rapid&#xD;
      and effective treatment for adults with phobic disorders. However, its utility in the&#xD;
      treatment of childhood phobia has not been examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: a one-session treatment group, an&#xD;
      education/support group, and a waitlist control group. The one-session treatment group is&#xD;
      directly exposed to a phobia object or situation during a 3-hour treatment session. In the&#xD;
      education/support group, children are given information about fear and phobias and are taught&#xD;
      how to deal with them through workbook activities. Children who participate in the&#xD;
      one-session treatment group or the education/support group are assessed 1 week post-treatment&#xD;
      and again after 6 months. Participants with improved symptoms have a 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
      Participants with phobias that persist at 6 months are encouraged to participate in&#xD;
      alternative treatment. Waitlist control participants are assessed pre-treatment and 1 month&#xD;
      post-treatment. Those who continue to have phobias at the 1-month assessment are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of the 2 active treatments.&#xD;
