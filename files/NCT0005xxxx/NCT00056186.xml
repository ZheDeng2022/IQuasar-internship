  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to learn about significant life changes for people with&#xD;
      Friedreich's ataxia and about patients' experiences with health care providers. Friedreich's&#xD;
      ataxia is a rare genetic disorder in which patients experience progressive muscle weakness&#xD;
      and loss of coordination in the arms and legs. They may have other complications, such as&#xD;
      vision and hearing impairment, dysarthria, scoliosis, diabetes, and heart disease. The study&#xD;
      will explore the impact of this chronic progressive illness on transitional life events, such&#xD;
      as career choice and marriage, and the role of family members and health care&#xD;
      providers-particularly genetic counselors-in helping patients progress through these events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Friedreich's ataxia who are 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Those enrolled will participate in a 45- to 60-minute interview by phone or in person,&#xD;
      in which they will be asked questions about important changes in their lives and their past&#xD;
      experiences with health care providers. The interview will be audiotaped.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human development across the lifespan is a process of continual change, adaptation and&#xD;
      growth. Throughout this process, key transitional events, such as career choice and marriage,&#xD;
      mark important points in time when an individual's life course is significantly altered.&#xD;
      These transitional events may be instigated by age, historical or idiosyncratic factors. Of&#xD;
      particular interest in the present study are patients' perceptions of transitional events&#xD;
      brought about or altered by chronic illness and disability. Additionally, factors (i.e.&#xD;
      social support, communication, family) that help facilitate progression through these events&#xD;
      will be investigated. The actual or potential role of health care providers during&#xD;
      transitional events will also be explored with a specific emphasis on genetic counseling.&#xD;
      These themes will be examined through the administration of a one-time, semi-structured,&#xD;
      in-person or telephone interview of patients with Friedreich's ataxia: a progressive,&#xD;
      debilitating, neurodegenerative condition. The interviews will be approximately 45-60 minutes&#xD;
      in length and will include open-ended questions to elicit qualitative data. Approximately 40&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited from Friedreich's ataxia support groups, a research organization&#xD;
      and a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that data elicited from the study will lead to recommendations regarding&#xD;
      the process and content of genetic counseling for individuals with Friedreich's ataxia. These&#xD;
      considerations, coupled with qualitative data obtained from participants, may also have&#xD;
      implications for the evolving role of the genetic counselor. Specifically, consideration of&#xD;
      developmental counseling approaches, which emphasize key transitional events, may be&#xD;
      particularly useful as genetic counselors become increasingly involved in subspecialties&#xD;
      (i.e. cardiology, pediatrics, neurology) that provide continuing follow-up care to patients.&#xD;
