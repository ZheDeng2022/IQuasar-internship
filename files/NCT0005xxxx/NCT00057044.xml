      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this project is to improve the clinical outcomes of veterans with&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease (IHD) through implementation of evidence-based lipid management, with&#xD;
      a particular focus on veterans whose primary lipid abnormality is a low level of&#xD;
      HDL-cholesterol (the �good� cholesterol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major objectives are 1. to determine whether a multifaceted intervention results in&#xD;
      improved guideline-concordant lipid management for patients with low HDL-cholesterol; and 2.&#xD;
      to test the relative effectiveness of three different reminder systems on physician&#xD;
      prescribing behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary care clinic at each of the six VISN 13 facilities will serve as intervention&#xD;
      sites. Within those sites we will randomize providers to one of three reminder systems.&#xD;
      Control sites will consist of twelve other facilities matched to the intervention sites on&#xD;
      the basis of facility characteristics. We will use a modified �pre-post� nested cohort design&#xD;
      that allows us to evaluate the effect of the intervention controlling for secular trends.&#xD;
      Target patients will be identified based on the following: 1. an IHD diagnosis within the&#xD;
      past 5 years; 2. regular follow-up in a primary care clinic; 3. most recent LDL-cholesterol &lt;&#xD;
      130 mg/dl and HDL-cholesterol &lt; 40 mg/dl; 4. No lipid therapy within prior 6 months. The&#xD;
      intervention will consist of: a. an on-site interactive educational workshop for providers;&#xD;
      b. reminders (either patient-directed mailed reminders, computer-chart reminders at the time&#xD;
      of visit, or automatic consults); c. opinion leader recruitment and �activation�. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is proportion of target patients receiving guideline-concordant therapy. For&#xD;
      objective 1, the outcome will be compared between intervention and control sites. For&#xD;
      objective 2, the outcome will be compared between the three groups randomized to the&#xD;
      different reminder systems. In addition, providers will be surveyed with a written&#xD;
      questionnaire to determine their reaction to the educational workshop and the different&#xD;
      reminder systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and data collection are completed. Data analysis is being undertaken, final&#xD;
      report will soon follow.&#xD;
