      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a program designed to prevent early sexual&#xD;
      behavior in middle school-aged African American girls.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 34 million adolescents between the ages of 11 and 17 years old in the United&#xD;
      States. Approximately 12% of them are African American. These youths experience earlier&#xD;
      pubertal onset and face earlier challenges to participate in sexual activity, and therefore&#xD;
      have earlier potential for pregnancy and contraction of sexually transmitted diseases.&#xD;
      Experts in adolescent research have recommended developing and implementing new interventions&#xD;
      to reduce early sexual activity; these interventions should target middle school-aged youths.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the NIA intervention on intention to&#xD;
      engage in early sexual behavior and actual involvement in early sexual behavior in a&#xD;
      convenience sample of sixth and seventh grade African American girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIA is a Swahili word that means &quot;having a sense of purpose.&quot; It is one of the seven&#xD;
      principles of Kwanzaa, a holiday that celebrates African Americans' cultural roots in Africa.&#xD;
      The intervention was named after a self-development program for African American girls to&#xD;
      highlight the intervention's cultural basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will provide 12 weekly and 5 booster after school didactic sessions; these sessions&#xD;
      will teach health promotion and decision making skills to help girls successfully avoid&#xD;
      situations where sexual activity is invited. Mothers and daughters will collaborate on&#xD;
      homework assignments on puberty, heterosexual relationships, and sexual issues. The study&#xD;
      will provide an evening mother-daughter workshop on sexual responsibility and a&#xD;
      &quot;Baby-Think-It-Over&quot; weekend experience for girls using a computerized doll. Finally, the&#xD;
      study will provide five &quot;Hey Baby!&quot; role-play vignettes to teach girls how to avoid&#xD;
      heterosexual relationships that may lead to sexual activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NIA intervention will be compared against a usual after-school activity control group of&#xD;
      sixth and seventh grade African American girls in two public middle schools in the Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Public School system. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the NIA intervention&#xD;
      group or the control group. Each participant will be in the study for 1 year. There will be a&#xD;
      12-week main intervention in the fall, a 5-week booster in the spring, and final testing 1&#xD;
      year after study entry. Assessments will be primarily paper and pencil tests of the study's&#xD;
      main outcome variables: attitude toward early sexual behavior (ESB); subjective norms&#xD;
      (mother, father, peer) toward ESB; intention to engage in ESB; and self-reported ESB.&#xD;
      Additionally, there will be knowledge content quizzes after each main intervention or booster&#xD;
      session and a written evaluation of the &quot;Baby-Think-It-Over&quot; weekend.&#xD;
