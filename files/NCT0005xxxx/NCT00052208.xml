    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of gefitinib when given together&#xD;
      with radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme. Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving&#xD;
      gefitinib together with radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose of ZD 1839 (gefitinib) when given concurrently with&#xD;
      cranial radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if ZD 1839, given orally on a daily basis starting at the time of&#xD;
      conventional radiation therapy (RT), may improve the overall survival of adults with&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme, compared with historical controls,&#xD;
      stratifying by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine, in a multi-institutional setting, the feasibility and toxicity of&#xD;
      prescribing ZD 1839.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Whether ZD 1839 also improves progression-free survival in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of gefitinib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gefitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7 weeks. Beginning 1 week after&#xD;
      initiation of gefitinib, patients undergo radiation therapy QD 5 days a week for 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Treatment with gefitinib continues for up to 18 months in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 2 years, and annually thereafter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The patient must sign a study-specific informed consent prior to study entry; if the&#xD;
             patient's mental status precludes his/her giving informed consent, written informed&#xD;
             consent may be given by the responsible family member&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent or multifocal malignant gliomas&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastases detected below the tentorium or beyond the cranial vault&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments which, in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, will prevent administration or completion of protocol therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiotherapy to the head or neck (except for T1 glottic cancer), resulting in&#xD;
             overlap of radiation fields&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active connective tissue disorders, such as lupus or scleroderma which, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the treating physician, may put the patient at high risk for radiation toxicity&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known acquired immune deficiency (AIDS); patients with AIDS require&#xD;
             complex therapeutic regimens; the pharmacokinetic interactions of these regimens with&#xD;
             ZD 1839 are unknown and therefore, pose a safety risk related to excess toxicity or&#xD;
             interference with anti-viral effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known multiple sclerosis, as these patients may have decreased tolerance&#xD;
