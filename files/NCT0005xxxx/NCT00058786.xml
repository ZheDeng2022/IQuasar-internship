  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to determine the safety and dosage of special cells that may make&#xD;
      the patients own immune system fight the cancer. To do this, we will put a special gene into&#xD;
      cancer cells that have been taken from the patient. This will be done in the laboratory. This&#xD;
      gene will make the cells produce interleukin 2 (IL-2), which is a natural substance that may&#xD;
      help the immune system kill cancer cells. Additionally, we will stimulate the cancer cells&#xD;
      with another natural protein called CD40 ligand (CD40L), which preclinical human and animal&#xD;
      studies suggest will help IL-2 perform better. Some of these cells will then be put back into&#xD;
      the body. The cells are grown with normal embryonic fibroblasts. Studies of cancers in&#xD;
      animals and in cancer cells that are grown in laboratories suggest that combining substances&#xD;
      like IL-2 and CD40L helps the body kill cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn the side effects and the safest effective dose of these&#xD;
      special cells on the disease&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before starting treatment some of the cancer cells will be taken from the patient and&#xD;
      separated in the laboratory. A specially produced human virus (adenovirus) that carries the&#xD;
      IL-2 gene will be put into the cells. The rest of the cancer cells will be stimulated to&#xD;
      express on their surface a substance called the human CD40 ligand. These substances (IL-2 and&#xD;
      CD40L), already naturally present in the body, are meant to help the immune system fight the&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the modified cancer cells will be injected under the skin. There will be up to&#xD;
      six shots. We do not know the best amount of special cells to use, so different patients will&#xD;
      get different numbers of cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first three shots (if more modified cancer cells are available), patients may be&#xD;
      able to have three additional shots. After they have received six shots, they may be able to&#xD;
      have additional shots if the cancer has gotten smaller and more of the cells are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete history and physical examination is necessary before a patient can be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. A physical examination will also be performed weekly for ten weeks after the&#xD;
      injection, then on week twelve, then monthly for one year. Patients will then have yearly&#xD;
      checkups for the next fifteen years. After the first and second shots, we will remove some of&#xD;
      the modified cells that have been injected under the skin, to study them. We will do this by&#xD;
      removing a section of skin (referred to as a skin biopsy) at the place where the cells were&#xD;
      injected. These tests will help us to see whether or not the modified cells are killing&#xD;
      cancer cells and whether or not the cancer cells are growing. If we suspect the cancer cells&#xD;
      are growing, we may repeat this procedure after the third and fourth shots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how the immunity is working in the patients system, we will take blood samples&#xD;
      before the first injection, then weekly for 10 weeks, on week 12, once a month for a year,&#xD;
      and then eventually once a year for fifteen years. These blood samples must be taken at The&#xD;
      Methodist Hospital. The total amount of blood that will be obtained is approximately two to&#xD;
      three tablespoonfuls, which is considered a safe amount. If the patient has additional&#xD;
      injections, blood will be drawn prior to each injection. Additional office visits may be&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient decides to withdraw at any time during the study both samples and data&#xD;
      collected during the study will be maintained with identifiers for safety reasons.&#xD;

    <description>Patients may be treated with a minimum of three up to six injections of their IL-2-secreting and CD40L-expressing autologous B-CLL cells, separated by one to two weeks in an immunological treatment window, i.e. in the absence of concurrent cytotoxic therapy. Any patient whose disease regresses after the administration of 6 injections may be offered further injections (i.e. more than 6 injections) of tumor vaccine at the dose level previously administered, if enough vaccines are available. Patients will receive a fixed dose of IL-2 secreting B-CLL cells throughout the entire treatment protocol (see Section 5.8), determined by previous studies in acute leukemia and in neuroblastoma, in which this level of IL-2 production has been safe. The dose escalation of CD40L-expressing cells is designed to reach the IL2/CD40L ratio shown to be effective in our preclinical models of neuroblastoma and lymphoma.</description>
