      This study will examine the effects of certain investigational anti-cancer drugs on the&#xD;
      genetic and protein makeup of cells. The findings will be entered into a database that may be&#xD;
      used to: 1) determine the optimal dose of drug that will provide the most benefit with the&#xD;
      least harmful side effects; and 2) predict which patients will have a greater chance of&#xD;
      developing side effects or a greater chance of benefiting from the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who are receiving the anti-cancer drugs flavopiridol or&#xD;
      perifosine in an NIH clinical trial may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures both before starting treatment and during&#xD;
      the first treatment cycle to look for genetic or chemical changes produced in response to the&#xD;
      study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Buccal cell brushings: Collection of buccal cells (cells lining the inside of the&#xD;
           cheeks) from the inside of the cheeks using a soft bristle brush for a few seconds&#xD;
           several times. The patient then rinses the mouth with salt water for 1 minute and then&#xD;
           spits into a cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Buccal cell biopsies (on both sides of the mouth): For this procedure, a local&#xD;
           anesthetic is given to numb the biopsy area. Then, a small piece of tissue from the&#xD;
           inner lining of the mouth is removed with a small sharp cookie-cutter instrument. The&#xD;
           biopsy findings will be compared with those of the cheek brushings to see if the&#xD;
           information is similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsies: In patients whose tumor is easily accessible, such as the skin abdominal&#xD;
           fluid, tissue biopsies will be requested. Depending on the type and location of the&#xD;
           tumor, the biopsy may be done with a forceps, a large needle (needle biopsy), a&#xD;
           cookie-cutter instrument (punch biopsy), or a small knife (excisional biopsy). All of&#xD;
           these procedures are done with a local anesthetic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A significant problem in drug development of novel small molecules is the lack of available&#xD;
      tissues (surrogate tissues) that allow for the assessment of the molecular and biochemical&#xD;
      effects of (targeted-therapies) drug action. The information obtained from surrogate tissues&#xD;
      might help us validate previous preclinical studies with those agents and also dose them in a&#xD;
      more rational way. Oral keratinocytes, which are accessible by non-invasive means, might be&#xD;
      useful to assess drug action. The proposed study seeks to investigate the genetic, molecular,&#xD;
      and biochemical effects of novel agents in oral buccal mucosal cells. Patients already&#xD;
      enrolled in Phase I and II clinical trials for neoplastic diseases at the Clinical Center&#xD;
      will undergo oral cytobrushing before and during therapy to determine the molecular and&#xD;
      biochemical effects of novel agents in the oral mucosa cells. Similar studies will be&#xD;
      performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In order to validate to compare and compare&#xD;
      the oral cytobrush methodology, some of these subjects will undergo oral punch biopsy&#xD;
      studies. Some of these subjects will also undergo tumor biopsy, if accessible or available.&#xD;
