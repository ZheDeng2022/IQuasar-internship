      The purpose of this study is to determine if zonisamide is effective as a preventative&#xD;
      medication for individuals with migraine headache.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacologic treatment of migraine may be acute (abortive, symptomatic) or preventive&#xD;
      (prophylactic). Preventive medication is usually given daily for months or years; however,&#xD;
      treatment may also be given in an intermittent regimen. Most migraine prophylactic&#xD;
      medications were designed to treat other disorders, and they can be divided into three&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serotonergic or monoaminergic agents such as methysergide, which have demonstrated high&#xD;
           degrees of effectiveness;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Non-serotonergic drugs such as beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, valproate; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Drugs with lesser demonstrated effectiveness, such as selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
           inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of treatment must be individualized, and is influenced by contraindications,&#xD;
      potential side effects, the need to treat associated symptoms like tension-type headache and&#xD;
      insomnia, and drug cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticonvulsants, such as valproate, have shown significant degrees of efficacy in migraine&#xD;
      prophylaxis when used in low doses. Considering the differences in proposed mechanisms of&#xD;
      action of these agents, it is likely that a novel anticonvulsant such as zonisamide may also&#xD;
      be an effective prophylactic treatment for migraine.&#xD;

        INCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet all the following criteria will be eligible to participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are men or women, between the ages of 18 and 65, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Satisfy diagnostic criteria for migraine headache, consistent with criteria described&#xD;
             in Headache Classification Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have at least 4 migraine attacks per 28 days [each attack separated by at least 48&#xD;
             hours] prior to the Screening Visit and experience at least 4 migraine attacks during&#xD;
             the Screen/Baseline Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to not become pregnant during the study and agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             birth control during the study such as an adequate barrier method, hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptive, or surgical sterilization. All women of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             have a negative pregnancy test before entering the study and during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are able to swallow the capsules whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are willing and able to follow Investigator instructions and study procedures,&#xD;
             complete the daily diary, and report adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will not be eligible to participate in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;

          -  Have required more than 3 different rescue medications for control of a single attack&#xD;
             anytime within 3 months prior to the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
