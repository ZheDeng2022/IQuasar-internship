      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral vasculopathy and stroke are among the most serious complications of sickle cell&#xD;
      disease. Not every patient will develop central nervous system disease but most children have&#xD;
      some evidence of cognitive impairment and about 10% will have overt stroke if this is not&#xD;
      forestalled by transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening, identification of individuals at&#xD;
      greatest risk by estimating maximal cerebral blood flow and commencing prophylactic&#xD;
      transfusion. The basis of these recommendations is studies in children over age 2-years where&#xD;
      stroke is most prevalent. Transfusion is not without its own serious and considerable risks&#xD;
      so that other measures for delaying or preventing cerebral vasculopathy would be valuable.&#xD;
      Hydroxyurea (HU) can reduce both morbidity and mortality of sickle cell anemia in adults;&#xD;
      most likely the same pertains in children. Unknown are the effects of HU in infants and the&#xD;
      youngest children and whether its successful use can reduce the risks of sickle&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease. If HU is associated with reduced TCD velocity, and if it is safe in&#xD;
      infants, the medical implications would be high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baby TCD is an ancillary study to the initial phase of BABY HUG, a multicenter clinical trial&#xD;
      funded by the NHLBI. In BABY HUG, infants (12-17 months old) with sickle cell disease (SCD)&#xD;
      will be randomized to either hydroxyurea (HU) or placebo and followed for 24 months. There is&#xD;
      broad interest in the effect of hydroxyurea on the central nervous system in the children&#xD;
      being studied. Stroke occurs after age 1 year and there is evidence that the process of&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease starts very early in some patients. The Cooperative Study of Sickle&#xD;
      Cell Disease documented a high risk of incident stroke in the 2-6 year age group. The study&#xD;
      is in response to an initiative on Ancillary Studies in Heart, Lung, and Blood Disease Trials&#xD;
      released in June, 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will perform TCD on the 40 children in BABY HUG at baseline and at the end of&#xD;
      study. TCD has proven very useful in estimation of stroke risk in children with SCD ages 2-16&#xD;
      years, and is at the center of a paradigm of primary stroke prevention recommended by the&#xD;
      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute based on the STOP study. If stroke risk could be&#xD;
      detected at an earlier stage (i.e., younger than the 2-16 year-old subjects in STOP), then&#xD;
      physicians would be able to provide preventive treatment at an earlier stage of the disease.&#xD;
      TCD will be performed before and after 24 months of treatment. TCD performance and reading&#xD;
      will be centrally controlled and STOP-consistent. The investigators have experience in TCD of&#xD;
      infants, the age targeted by the parent study. TCD will be compared between HU and control&#xD;
      groups, before and after treatment. In addition, the investigators have access to data from&#xD;
      over 400 children in the 2-4 year age range from the STOP screening program performed in the&#xD;
      mid- to late 1990s. Since these patients were not on HU or transfusion this dataset will be&#xD;
      used to give an estimate of the prevalence of high stroke risk without HU treatment, and can&#xD;
      be compared to the HU group in Baby HUG, adding another important comparative dimension to&#xD;
      the analyses. Although the sample size is purposely small as designed by the parent study,&#xD;
      large differences in the prevalence of high-risk patients at the end of treatment could be&#xD;
      detected by Baby TCD.&#xD;

        The BABY HUG Follow-up Study I was an observational study to provide structured monitoring&#xD;
        of the subjects enrolled in the BABY HUG Treatment Study, to initiate characterization of&#xD;
        the long-term toxicities and unexpected risks (if any) associated with treatment with&#xD;
        hydroxyurea at an early age, and any potential benefits of therapy.&#xD;
