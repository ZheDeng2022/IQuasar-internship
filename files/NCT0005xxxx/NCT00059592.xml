  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shingles is an infection commonly seen in children with a weakened immune system&#xD;
      (immunocompromised children). The immune system can be weakened as a result of medications&#xD;
      that patients receive for cancer or other serious illness or as a result of a bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation. Shingles in children with a weakened immune system may spread throughout the&#xD;
      body and in some instances may be life-threatening. Acyclovir is a medication that is&#xD;
      routinely used to treat immunocompromised children with shingles in order to prevent further&#xD;
      spread of their shingles and to help them heal faster. Acyclovir is also given to bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant patients to prevent reactivation of HSV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valacyclovir is a new drug that is metabolized (broken down in the body) to acyclovir.&#xD;
      Valacyclovir is given by mouth and studies done in adults have shown it to be more effective&#xD;
      than acyclovir given by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  study the pharmacology of this drug (how the body handles this drug),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine if oral Valacyclovir can be safely given to children with shingles, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine the type of side effects that occur when oral Valacyclovir is given to&#xD;
           immunocompromised children.&#xD;

      Patients with shingles:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with shingles will receive oral Valacyclovir three times a day for 5 to 10 days. For&#xD;
      the first 24 hours of treatment, patients will be admitted to the hospital for close&#xD;
      monitoring. If there are no problems after the first 24 hours then the patient may be&#xD;
      discharged to take the medicine at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge patients will be seen and examined in clinic daily for the first 5 days, then&#xD;
      on day 7 and after that every other day until the shingles show evidence of healing. A final&#xD;
      physical exam and blood tests occur on day 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small amount of fluid will be taken from one of the shingles lesions using a very fine&#xD;
      needle to verify the presence of the virus that causes shingles. This will be done before the&#xD;
      first dose of Valacyclovir and 3 days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests (no more than 2 teaspoons) will be performed twice a week to monitor for toxic&#xD;
      effects of the drug. Blood samples will be drawn to evaluate the pharmacology of this&#xD;
      drug(how the body handles the drug). Nine blood samples (less than one teaspoon each) will be&#xD;
      obtained over 24 hours during the first day of treatment. The total amount of blood to be&#xD;
      drawn is 9 teaspoons (3 tablespoons).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children that are toilet trained, urine will be collected for 12 hours at the start of&#xD;
      the study. This urine will be used to evaluate kidney function, and the pharmacology of&#xD;
      valacyclovir. If there are unacceptable side effects or if there is evidence that the disease&#xD;
      is spreading, despite being on Valacyclovir for more than 48 hours, then you will be taken&#xD;
      off the study and started on acyclovir by vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing a bone marrow transplant will receive a single dose of valacyclovir in&#xD;
      place of their first scheduled dose of acyclovir. They will then receive acyclovir as&#xD;
      outlined by their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn to evaluate the pharmacology (how the body handles the drug) of&#xD;
      the study drug. Fifteen blood samples (less than one teaspoon each) will be obtained over 24&#xD;
      hours during the first day of treatment. The total amount of blood to be drawn is 9 teaspoons&#xD;
      (3 tablespoons. The total amount of blood drawn for all blood work including routine blood&#xD;
      tests as well as pharmacokinetics will not be greater than 5% of the patients total blood&#xD;
      volume. This amount of blood loss is a safe amount even for small children&#xD;
