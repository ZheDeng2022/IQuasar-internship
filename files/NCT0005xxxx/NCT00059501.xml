      This study will examine loss of balance in the elderly. Falls due to balance problems are a&#xD;
      major health issue in older people, often resulting in bone fractures and other bodily&#xD;
      injuries, and functional decline. In addition, the fear of falling leads some elderly people&#xD;
      to restrict their movements and social activities, causing depressed moods and decreased&#xD;
      enjoyment of life. Risk factors for falling in the elderly include some standing positions in&#xD;
      which older people usually experience balance problems, such as leaning forward or backward.&#xD;
      This study will examine these unstable positions and the brain mechanisms associated with&#xD;
      loss of balance in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers between 20 and 90 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      must be in good health, with no difficulties in performing activities of daily living, and&#xD;
      must be able to walk for at least 400 meters (1/4 mile). They will be screened with a medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following three experiments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Movement task: The subject stands on a platform with markers placed at different parts&#xD;
           of the body to record body movements. A cap with electrodes (metal disks) is placed on&#xD;
           the head for electrocardiographic (EEG) recording of the electrical activity of the&#xD;
           brain (brain waves) during the experiment. The positions of the feet on the platform are&#xD;
           measured. While standing on the platform, the subject leans forward and backward as far&#xD;
           as possible without losing balance. (Subjects are secured in a safety harness to prevent&#xD;
           actual falls.) The task is repeated 5 times. The experiment lasts up to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postural response task: This study is identical to the first, except that the subject&#xD;
           does not voluntarily lean forward and backward, but is pushed with a device to cause&#xD;
           forward and backward movements. The experiment lasts 1 to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceptual task: The subject sits in front of a computer screen and watches the postural&#xD;
           movements of a human body model in forward and backward directions. When the subject&#xD;
           recognizes an unstable position in the movements, he or she presses a computer mouse. An&#xD;
           EEG records brain activity during the task, which lasts up to 2 hours.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A number of studies have explored the role of visual, vestibular and somatosensory systems in&#xD;
      the control of upright posture. However, the cortical control of postural stability, in&#xD;
      general, and the role of higher cognitive function in assessment of postural stability, in&#xD;
      specific, has been less studied. It is well established that certain features of postural&#xD;
      control change during the advancing years of life so that the stability of posture can be a&#xD;
      problem in the elderly. However, neural mechanisms of postural stability that decline with&#xD;
      age and make older adults more prone to falling have not been identified specifically. To&#xD;
      characterize specific causes of falling in the elderly in problematic, because human posture&#xD;
      is a product of an extremely complex dynamical system and like any other physical activity&#xD;
      undergoes dramatic changes in organization throughout the life-span. In our previous research&#xD;
      we showed the existence of specialized neural detectors that are embodied in spatiotemporal&#xD;
      patterns of brain activiation (Slobounov et al., 200) capable of discrimination the unstable&#xD;
      postures in dynamic situations. We propose that these neural detectors may deteriorate with&#xD;
      aging, which result in difficulty to (a) initiate compensatory postural adjustments when&#xD;
      balance is in danger, and (b) to discriminate relevant from irrelevant information in control&#xD;
      of upright posture. This can be documented via changes in behavioral correlates of postural&#xD;
      control and spatiotemporal patterns of the brain activation as a function of advanced age.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to investigate the age-related cortical control of&#xD;
      postural stability combining electroencephalography and postural control measures. This will&#xD;
      be done when a subject physically approaches the postural stability boundary and when a&#xD;
      subject solves a cognitive task identifying unstable postures in dynamic situations.&#xD;
