      This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG)&#xD;
      to test the safety of an experimental anti-epileptic drug called Talampanel and learn how it&#xD;
      affects brain activity. Talampanel blocks a type of brain receptor called AMPA; inhibiting&#xD;
      this receptor may result in anti-seizure activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS stimulates the outer part of the brain, called the cortex. For this procedure, an&#xD;
      insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed&#xD;
      through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. This may cause a&#xD;
      pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and muscle twitching in the face, arm, or leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG records the electrical activity of the brain, in the form of brain waves. For this&#xD;
      procedure, electrodes (metal discs with a conductive gel) attached to wires are affixed to&#xD;
      the scalp with a paste and the brain activity is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age may participate in this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a physical and neurological examination, electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (EKG), blood tests, and blood pressure measurement. Women who are pregnant or nursing are&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center for three testing sessions, at least 1 week&#xD;
      apart, and a final follow-up visit. The procedure for each test session is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 AM - Blood pressure is measured, EKG and EEC leads are placed, a heparin lock is inserted,&#xD;
      and a blood sample is drawn. The heparin lock is a thin needle enclosed in a thin plastic&#xD;
      tube. The needle guides the tube into a vein and is then removed, leaving the tube in place.&#xD;
      The indwelling tube allows multiple blood samples to be drawn without repeated needle sticks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 - 9 AM - TMS followed by EEG recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 AM - Administration of Talampanel or placebo (pill with no active ingredient) by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 AM - Blood sample #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 AM -11 AM - TMS, followed by EEG recording every 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11 AM - Blood sample #3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 PM - Blood sample #4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11 AM - 1 PM - EEG recording every 5 minutes/&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 PM - Blood sample #5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 PM - Discharge from Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the final follow-up visit, the participant will talk with the doctor and have one final&#xD;
      blood draw.&#xD;

      Objectives. The purpose of this pilot study is to identify human neurophysiological&#xD;
      parameters that are sensitive to talampanel, as assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG). Talampanel is a highly selective, orally active&#xD;
      antagonist of the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor.&#xD;
      The study will test two hypotheses: (1) talampanel will, in a dose-dependent fashion,&#xD;
      suppress the motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and intracortical facilitation as&#xD;
      determined by TMS, and (2) talampanel will, in a dose-dependent fashion, cause alterations in&#xD;
      EEG power within specific frequency bands. We plan to administer a low (25 mg) and high (50&#xD;
      mg) dose of talampanel and placebo to normal volunteers and measure various TMS and EEG&#xD;
      parameters that we hypothesize may be influenced by AMPA receptor blockade. We will&#xD;
      simultaneously assay serum levels of talampanel. We will use statistical tests to correlate&#xD;
      changes in the TMS and EEG measures with drug concentration. The results of this study will&#xD;
      allow us to undertake a follow-up study in which we will determine the effects of AMPA&#xD;
      receptor blockade by talampanel on human motor and cognitive function. Our ultimate goal is&#xD;
      to determine whether drug-induced blockade of AMPA receptors can be achieved without&#xD;
      unacceptable neurological impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. This will be a blinded and placebo-controlled pilot study using 12 normal&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. Normal volunteers accepted into the study will be subjected to the following exams:&#xD;
      (a) TMS determination of MEP amplitude and paired-pulse testing at baseline and at peak serum&#xD;
      levels after drug or placebo administration, (b) digital EEG recording for 1 h at baseline&#xD;
      before administration of drug or placebo and during a period of 3 h after administration.&#xD;
      Samples for serum chemistry, liver function tests, hematology, and urinalysis will be&#xD;
      obtained at admission, at discharge, and in every clinic visit during the study. Blood&#xD;
      samples for determining serum talampanel levels will be obtained at 1, 2, 3, and 8 h after&#xD;
      drug administration. MEPs at interstimulus intervals of 2 to 20 ms will be compared among&#xD;
      subjects before and after drug administration, by a repeated measures analysis of variance.&#xD;
      Talampanel levels will be correlated with MEP amplitudes by regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical endpoint. This pilot study will identify information on the best TMS interstimulus&#xD;
      interval or intervals for measuring changes in cortical excitability after AMPA blockade, as&#xD;
      well as the EEG frequency band most sensitive to AMPA blockade with talampanel. Because&#xD;
      talampanel is a highly selective AMPA receptor antagonist, we will be able to infer that the&#xD;
      parameters that are sensitive to talampanel can be used as empirical assays of AMPA receptor&#xD;
      function in humans.&#xD;
