  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate what causes hereditary leiomyomatosis renal (kidney) cell cancer,&#xD;
      or HLRCC, and how the disease is related to the development of kidney tumors. Leiomyomas are&#xD;
      benign (non-cancerous) tumors arising from smooth muscle. HLRCC can cause various health&#xD;
      problems. Some people develop red bumps on their skin that can be painful at times. Some&#xD;
      women with HLRCC can develop leiomyomas of the uterus. In some families, people with HLRCC&#xD;
      develop kidney tumors. This study will try to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What gene changes (mutations) cause HLRCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What kind of kidney tumors develop in HLRCC and how they grow&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What the chance is that a person with HLRCC will develop a kidney tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with known or suspected HLRCC (and their family members of any age) may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. This includes people in families in which one or more members has skin&#xD;
      leiomyoma and kidney cancer; skin leiomyoma and uterine leiomyoma; multiple skin leiomyomas;&#xD;
      kidney cancer and uterine leiomyomas, or kidney cancer consistent with HLRCC, including, but&#xD;
      not limited to, collecting duct or papillary, type II. Candidates will be screened with a&#xD;
      physical examination, family history, and, for affected family members, a review of medical&#xD;
      records, including pathology slides and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo tests and procedures that may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medical records, x-rays, and tissue slides&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gynecological examination for women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews with a cancer doctor, cancer nurses, kidney surgeon, and genetic counselor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Genetic research to identify the gene responsible for HLRCC&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Evaluation of liver, kidney, heart, pancreas, and thyroid function&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Complete blood count and clotting profile&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Pregnancy test for pre-menopausal women&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. PSA test for prostate cancer in men over age 40&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT or MRI scans (for participants 15 years of age and older only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy (surgical removal of a small sample of skin tissue)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cheek swab or mouth rinse to collect cells for genetic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical photographs of lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the tests are completed, participants will discuss the results with a doctor and&#xD;
      possibly a genetic nurse or genetic counselor. The genetic findings will not be revealed to&#xD;
      participants because their meaning and implications may not yet be understood. Participants&#xD;
      may be asked to return to NIH from every 3 months to every 3 years, depending on their&#xD;
      condition, for follow-up examinations and tests.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer (HLRCC) is a rare autosomal dominantly&#xD;
           inherited disorder which confers susceptibility to develop cutaneous and uterine&#xD;
           leiomyomas and renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HLRCC is caused by mutations in the Krebs cycle enzyme, fumarate hydratase localized on&#xD;
           chromosome 1q42.3-q43.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the risk of developing renal cancer, cutaneous leiomyoma and uterine leiomyoma in&#xD;
           this hereditary cancer syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the types and characteristics (including patterns of growth) of renal cancer&#xD;
           associated with HLRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence and characteristics of HLRCC-associated fumarate hydratase gene&#xD;
           mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine genotype/phenotype correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if other genes caused HLRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -An individual from a family in which one or more biological family members have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cutaneous leiomyoma and kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cutaneous leiomyoma and uterine leiomyoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple cutaneous leiomyoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney cancer and uterine leiomyomata.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal tumor histology consistent with HLRCC including, but not limited to: Collecting&#xD;
           Duct and/or Papillary, Type II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These rare biological families will be recruited to genetically confirm diagnosis,&#xD;
           determine size and location of renal tumors, size at presentation, growth rate and&#xD;
           metastatic potential of renal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic testing will be offered to gain appreciation of the effect of mutations on the&#xD;
           relative activity of various germline and somatic mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will determine if there is a relationship between mutation and disease phenotype.&#xD;
