  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to examine how&#xD;
      the brain generates tics and controls voluntary movement in patients with Tourette's syndrome&#xD;
      and chronic motor tic disorder. EEG records the electrical activity of the brain. For this&#xD;
      test, a cap with built-in electrodes is placed on the subject's head, and the electrodes are&#xD;
      connected to a monitor that records the brain activity. EMG records muscle activity using&#xD;
      electrodes placed on the skin over muscles on the fingers or above the outer corner of the&#xD;
      eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with Tourette's syndrome and chronic motor tic&#xD;
      disorder between 21 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this 2- to 3-hour study. Each&#xD;
      candidate will be screened with a medical history, physical and neurological examinations,&#xD;
      and a questionnaire that screens for psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During EEG and EMG recordings, participants undergo the following tasks while seated&#xD;
      comfortably in a sound-shielded room:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finger task: Patients raise their index finger once every 10 seconds for about 25&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tic evaluation and mimicking: Patients allow their tics to occur as they do naturally.&#xD;
           After each tic, they report whether the tic was voluntary and whether it was preceded by&#xD;
           a sensation of urge. They then mimic tics that they normally have, at a rate of about&#xD;
           once every 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tic suppression task: Patients suppress tics they normally have for several minutes.&#xD;
           They then allow the tics to occur naturally, without attempting to suppress them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal Volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finger task: Volunteers raise their index finger once every 10 seconds for about 25&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open eye task: Volunteers keep their eyes open for a minute or so, and then resume&#xD;
           blinking as often as feels comfortable. The process is repeated several times.&#xD;

      This study examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical functional interconnectivity&#xD;
      involved tics and voluntary movement in patients with Tourette's syndrome or chronic motor&#xD;
      tic disorder. By employing a combination of EEG methods that utilize analyses in the domains&#xD;
      of both frequency (e.g., event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS),&#xD;
      event-related partial coherence, phase coherence) and time (e.g., event-related partial&#xD;
      correlation), we intend to determine&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether the cortical neurocircuitry involved in the performance of a simple, voluntary&#xD;
           motor task differs in patients with tic disorders from that of healthy volunteers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether the network involved in the generation of unwanted tics differs from that of&#xD;
           normal voluntary movement (i.e., mimicked tics); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What role, if any, premonitory urge and/or tic suppression plays in the modulation of&#xD;
           this neurocircuitry.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy volunteers are between the ages of 21 and 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will have clinically documented Tourette's syndrome or chronic motor tic disorder&#xD;
        as defined by DSM-IV-TR and evaluation of tic severity using the Yale Tic Scale. This&#xD;
        criterion will be established by preliminary screening in the NINDS Movement Disorders&#xD;
        Outpatient Clinic. Regarding co-morbid disorders such as ADHD and OCD, we will accept a&#xD;
        mild degree of ADHD and mild to moderate degree of OCD. These disorders will be established&#xD;
        by a psychiatrist using below listed scales and criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Structure Clinical Interview for (DSMIV SCID) will be administered to all subjects to&#xD;
        ensure that strict DSM-IV criteria for Tourette Syndrome have been met and to assess for&#xD;
        possible comorbid psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Given the high rate of comorbidity of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Attention&#xD;
        Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Tourette's syndrome, it may not be possible to&#xD;
        exclude persons with these disorders. Hence, only those with no more than mild to moderate&#xD;
        severity of symptoms will be accepted into the study. This will be ascertained using the&#xD;
        following instruments and their respective cut-off scores:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Y-BOCS (Goodman et al, 1989) a 10 item scale with a range of 0 - 4 and maximum possible&#xD;
        score of 40 (0-7: subclinical; 8 - 15: mild; 16 -23: moderate; 24 - 31 severe; 32 - 40:&#xD;
        extreme). Inclusion criteria: 23 or below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ADHD Behavior Checklist for Adults (Barkley, 1995, Murphy and Barkley, 1995): An 18 Item&#xD;
        checklist with 9 Inattention items and 9 Hyperactive/impulsive items ranging 0 - 3 (0:&#xD;
        never or rarely 1: sometimes 2: often and 3: very often ). Items answered often or very&#xD;
        often are scored as present. With age, the threshold criterion for presence of ADHD become&#xD;
        lower and is currently accepted as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age Range; Inattention Items; Hyperactive and Impulsive Items respectively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        21-29 years; 4 of 9; 5 of 9&#xD;
&#xD;
        30-49; 4 of 9; 4 of 9&#xD;
&#xD;
        50 and over; 3 of 9; 3 of 9&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age Range; Inattention Items; Hyperactive and Impulsive Items respectively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        21-29 years; 3 or below; 4 or below&#xD;
&#xD;
        30-49; 3 or below; 3 or below&#xD;
&#xD;
        50 and over; 2 or below; 2 or below&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS AND PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following subjects will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects younger than 21 or older than 65 years, as EEG studies have shown findings to&#xD;
             vary with neurodevelopment and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with 1) major depression, 2) bipolar disorder, or 3) psychotic disorder. Such&#xD;
             coexisting neuropsychiatric disorders may lead to unnecessary confounds of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects taking benzodiazepines, anti-depressant or neuroleptic medications (such&#xD;
             medications are known to affect EEG and may thus confound data)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with major acute or chronic illness (experimental setting may be&#xD;
             unnecessarily uncomfortable or unpleasant)&#xD;
