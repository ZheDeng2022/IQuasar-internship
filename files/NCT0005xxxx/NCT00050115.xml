  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect samples of blood, stool, bone marrow, or other tissues from patients&#xD;
      with hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia to investigate a possible association between&#xD;
      exposure to viruses and the development of aplastic anemia in these patients. Cells from the&#xD;
      samples obtained may be grown in the laboratory for future studies. Patients samples may be&#xD;
      used to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study abnormalities that occur in hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test for various viruses;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test immune function;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure factors related to the patients disease or diseases they may be at risk for;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effectiveness of current therapies, refine treatment approaches, and&#xD;
           identify potential new therapies;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify possible measures for disease prevention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify possible genetic factors associated with hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 2 years of age and older with severe aplastic anemia that developed within 6 months&#xD;
      of an episode of hepatitis may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete questionnaires and provide tissue samples as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients (or another respondent for the patient) will fill out a questionnaire including&#xD;
      demographic information (age, gender, race, ethnic group, education level, state of&#xD;
      residence), current symptoms, medications, medical history, and history of possible exposures&#xD;
      to toxins or viruses. A second questionnaire, which includes questions related to mental&#xD;
      health, sexual behavior, alcohol and drug use, is optional for participants age 21 and older.&#xD;
      These questionnaires are designed to uncover features of hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia&#xD;
      and possibly reveal a common cause of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Collections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood- will be collected at the time of the patient s initial evaluation or upon&#xD;
           enrollment into the study and possibly periodically during the study. Blood will be&#xD;
           drawn through a needle in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow- may be collected as part of the patient s standard medical care or&#xD;
           specifically for research purposes of this study. For this procedure, the skin over the&#xD;
           hipbone and the outer surface of the bone itself are numbed with an injection of a local&#xD;
           anesthesia. Then, a larger needle is inserted into the hipbone and marrow is drawn into&#xD;
           a syringe. Marrow cells are suctioned two to six times during the 15-minute procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool- will be provided by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver- tissue may be biopsied as part of the patient s general medical care or for NIH&#xD;
      patients, as part of their enrollment in a treatment protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our laboratory has a long-standing interest in viruses that affect the bone marrow,&#xD;
      especially those causing bone marrow failure. One specific syndrome, hepatitis-associated&#xD;
      aplastic anemia, suggests that the same agent is responsible for the severe and sometimes&#xD;
      fulminate hepatitis as well as the profound bone marrow failure. This study is designed to&#xD;
      collect clinical data, and samples from patients with hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia,&#xD;
      in order to learn more about the clinical features of the disease, as well as to collect&#xD;
      blood, liver, bone marrow and stool samples where possible for ongoing virological studies.&#xD;
      For liver and bone marrow samples, material will only be obtained when the liver or bone&#xD;
      marrow are biopsied for other medical indications, or during the removal of the liver at the&#xD;
      time of transplantation. No additional risk to the patient should result from either&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
