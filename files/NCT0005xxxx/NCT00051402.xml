  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether soy-derived phytoestrogens taken as&#xD;
      dietary supplements improve memory function in postmenopausal women who have experienced&#xD;
      early memory decline.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating data has indicated that estrogens mediate enhancing effects on cognition and&#xD;
      mood and may play a prophylactic role against age- and disease-related cognitive-cerebral&#xD;
      decline. Phytoestrogens are plant-derived substances that have demonstrated estrogenic&#xD;
      activity, but there is little prospective research regarding their effects on mental&#xD;
      function. Mental health practitioners generally do not prescribe phytoestrogens. However,&#xD;
      many women experiencing peri- and post-menopausal symptoms use marketed phytoestrogens under&#xD;
      the perception of general health benefits, including presumably enhanced mental function. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to develop preliminary data regarding the efficacy of isoflavone&#xD;
      phytoestrogens in improving cognitive function in late middle-aged and elderly postmenopausal&#xD;
      women with symptoms of memory impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomized to receive either isoflavone supplementation or&#xD;
      placebo. The study will last for 16 weeks, during which participants will take the supplement&#xD;
      pill or placebo three times a day. Participants will be assessed at study entry and at Week&#xD;
      16 for changes in basal cortisol levels, mood, and neuropsychological measures of executive&#xD;
      function ability and episodic memory.&#xD;
