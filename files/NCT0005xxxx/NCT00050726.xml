  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is a sub-study of the 6-year multinational ESPRIT (Evaluation of&#xD;
      Subcutaneous Proleukin in a Randomized International Trial) protocol. It will compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the influenza (FLUVAC) and tetanus-pneumococcal (TEPVAC) vaccines in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients receiving interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus anti-HIV drugs with those receiving&#xD;
      only anti-HIV drugs. IL-2 is a protein naturally produced by immune cells called lymphocytes.&#xD;
      Lymphocytes from patients with HIV do not produce IL-2 normally. The ESPRIT trial is&#xD;
      evaluating whether HIV-infected patients treated with antiretroviral drugs plus IL-2 have&#xD;
      fewer serious infections and improved survival than those receiving only anti-HIV drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this sub-study will be drawn from patients enrolled in ESPRIT. They must be&#xD;
      18 years of age or older, have HIV infection with no symptoms of significant HIV illness.&#xD;
      They will be vaccinated against either influenza or tetanus and pneumococcus, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FLUVAC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible patients will be screened for the FLUVAC study during an ESPRIT&#xD;
      follow-up visit. Those who are eligible and agree to participate will have 10 ml (1&#xD;
      tablespoon) of blood drawn to assess baseline antibody levels and then receive the&#xD;
      vaccination. They will be vaccinated annually for 3 years. A blood sample (10 ml) will be&#xD;
      drawn 1 month after each vaccination to measure the immune response. Some of the blood drawn&#xD;
      for this study will be stored and used for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEPVAC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 10 ml of blood drawn to assess their baseline antibody levels. They&#xD;
      will receive two vaccinations (tetanus and pneumococcus) 12 months after enrolling in ESPRIT&#xD;
      and another two vaccinations 24 months after enrollment. A blood sample (10 ml) will be drawn&#xD;
      1 month after each vaccination to measure the immune response. Some of the blood drawn for&#xD;
      this study will be stored and used for research purposes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of Subcutaneous Proleukin in a Randomized International Trial (ESPRIT) is a 4,000&#xD;
      patient, 6-year study investigating the clinical effect of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients&#xD;
      with HIV infection. Because of the size and duration of this study, substudies to the parent&#xD;
      trial are being performed in order to improve the knowledge regarding the use of IL-2 in&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals and to enhance the overall scientific output of this international&#xD;
      effort. This protocol will serve as the umbrella under which the ESPRIT substudies will be&#xD;
      performed at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.&#xD;
