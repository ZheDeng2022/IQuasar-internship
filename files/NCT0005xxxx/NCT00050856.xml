  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and tolerability of Fuzeon (enfuvirtide) used together&#xD;
      with other treatments for HIV infection in patients with advanced HIV disease. Fuzeon is an&#xD;
      antiretroviral drug. Unlike other antiretrovirals, however, which work against the virus once&#xD;
      it is already in the cell, Fuzeon prevents the virus from getting into healthy cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with advanced HIV-1 infection, who do not respond to&#xD;
      approved antiretroviral therapy, may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have a CD4&#xD;
      lymphocyte count less than 100 cells/mm3 and a viral load greater than 10,000 copies/mL. They&#xD;
      will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests, and may also&#xD;
      have an electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray and urine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will be re-examined and have additional blood tests before&#xD;
      beginning treatment with Fuzeon. They will then be taught how to self-inject the medicine&#xD;
      under the skin and will take two doses daily (less than 1/4 teaspoon each), 12 hours apart.&#xD;
      After the first treatment, participants will have follow-up visits at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12,&#xD;
      24, 36, 48, and every 12 weeks after that, if necessary, until 12 weeks after the drug&#xD;
      becomes commercially available. Visits may be scheduled more often if a problem arises.&#xD;
      During the follow-up visits, patients will have blood drawn, and their blood pressure, pulse&#xD;
      rate and temperature will be checked. They will also report any drug side effects they have&#xD;
      experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue to take Fuzeon as long as they benefit from therapy and do not&#xD;
      experience severe side effects from the treatment. The drug will be provided to participants&#xD;
      until 12 weeks after it is sold in the United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last few years, an unprecedented decrease in the mortality and morbidity associated&#xD;
      with AIDS has been achieved attributed to the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (HAART) which consists of three different classes of drugs: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitors (NRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitors (NNRTIs). However, the durability of viral suppression is often limited by&#xD;
      treatment with combinations of non-fully suppressive antiretroviral agents. Heavily&#xD;
      pretreated patients often possess multiple mutations of the reverse transcriptase and&#xD;
      protease genes resulting in multi-drug resistance. Thus, a pharmacological agent effective at&#xD;
      an alternate point in the virus replication cycle would make a valuable addition to the&#xD;
      anti-HIV armamentarium. T-20, enfuvirtide, is the first drug to be developed which&#xD;
      specifically inhibits the function of the gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein of HIV-1. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of Fuzeon (Enfuvirtide) in&#xD;
      patients who are limited by the current commercially available antiretroviral agents or&#xD;
      agents available via early access or compassionate use programs as per the judgment of the&#xD;
      investigator or patients with advanced disease and most in need of therapy. This study is a&#xD;
      multicenter, open-label, single-arm, safety study. Each patient will receive enfuvirtide 90&#xD;
      mg (deliverable dose) via subcutaneous injection twice daily with food, in combination&#xD;
      additional antiretroviral agents. Subjects will continue to receive enfuvirtide until 12&#xD;
      weeks after commercial availability of enfuvirtide in the United States. Laboratory testing,&#xD;
      CD4+lymphocyte counts, HIV-1 viral loads will be monitored on a regular and continual basis.&#xD;
      The main outcome measures are ones of safety and tolerability: serious adverse events&#xD;
      (including all deaths, serious AIDS defining events, and discontinuations for any reason),&#xD;
      injection reconstitution fatigue.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for this trial, patients must fulfill all inclusion criteria listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female HIV-1 infected adults or adolescents (greater than or equal to 16&#xD;
             years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. CD4 lymphocyte count less than or equal to 100 cells/mm(3) and HIV-1 RNA viral load&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 10,000 copies/mL while on HAART (latest available measurement&#xD;
             must be within the last 90 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be limited by the current commercially available antiretroviral agents&#xD;
             or agents available via Early Access or Compassionate Use Programs as per the judgment&#xD;
             of the investigator OR patients with advanced disease and most in need defined as&#xD;
             prior documented drug resistance or have documented evidence of greater than 6 months&#xD;
             prior experience to each of the three classes of ARV's.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent (for patients&#xD;
             less than 18 years of age, a parent or legal guardian must also sign the Informed&#xD;
             Consent Form).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women of childbearing potential must have a documented negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             baseline and ensure that two reliable forms of contraception are being used, including&#xD;
             a barrier method, for the duration of the study, and for 90 days after the last dose&#xD;
             of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible for&#xD;
        participation in this trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female patients who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or who plan to become pregnant or&#xD;
             breast-feed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any current clinical or laboratory parameter of ACTG grade 4. Asymptomatic grade 4&#xD;
             abnormalities will be permitted, at the discretion of the investigator, if the&#xD;
             potential benefit of treatment outweighs the potential risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of ongoing alcohol and/or drug or substance abuse that, in the judgment of&#xD;
             the investigator, would result in the patient being unreliable in fulfilling the&#xD;
             conditions of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior non-adherence to antiretroviral treatment regimens that, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, resulted in the patient's failing prior regimens and which would likely&#xD;
             result in the patient being unreliable in fulfilling the conditions of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Inability to self-inject Fuzeon (enfuvirtide) as indicated in the protocol, unless a&#xD;
             reliable caregiver is willing, able, and available to provide this service on a&#xD;
             continuous basis for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Evidence of active, untreated opportunistic infection, intercurrent illness, drug&#xD;
             toxicity or any other condition such that, in the judgment of the investigator, the&#xD;
             patient would not be able to continue or take a prescribed antiretroviral regimen.&#xD;
