    <textblock>
      This study will examine families in which one sibling of a sibling pair, or twin pair, has&#xD;
      developed a systemic rheumatic disease and one has not, to see if and how the two differ in&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood cell metabolism;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Types of cells in the blood;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Environmental exposures or genetic factors that might explain why one developed disease&#xD;
           and the other did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families in which one sibling has developed a systemic rheumatic disease, rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, dermatomyositis, or myositis, and the&#xD;
      other has not, are eligible for this study. The siblings may or may not be twins, but must be&#xD;
      of the same gender and be within a 5-year age difference. Biological parents, or, in some&#xD;
      cases, children, will also be included in the study. Normal, healthy volunteers will serve as&#xD;
      control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo some or all of the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination. Participants will also be asked permission to&#xD;
           obtain medical records for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires about environmental exposures at work, at home, and elsewhere. Probands&#xD;
           (participants with rheumatic disease) and their healthy siblings will also answer&#xD;
           questions about infections, vaccinations, medications or dietary supplements, sun&#xD;
           exposure, and stressful events during the year before disease diagnosis in the affected&#xD;
           sibling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine collection for the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood chemistries and other studies to rule out certain diseases or medical&#xD;
           problems;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence of past toxic exposures and certain infections;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of cells from the mother in the child s blood and vice versa. (Recent studies&#xD;
           suggest that during pregnancy or delivery, cells from the mother and baby may be&#xD;
           exchanged and circulate in the body for many years, possibly causing problems);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In twin or sibling pairs, presence of certain genes that may be more common in patients&#xD;
           with systematic rheumatic diseases as compared with their unaffected siblings and normal&#xD;
           volunteers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In identical twins, comparison of their blood cell metabolism to see if and how the&#xD;
           metabolism differs in people with rheumatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked for permission to have some of their blood and urine samples stored&#xD;
      and to obtain previously collected blood or tissue biopsy specimens that are no longer needed&#xD;
      for clinical care, for research purposes. They may also be asked to give additional blood or&#xD;
      urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed every year for 5 years (either in person or by questionnaire)&#xD;
      to evaluate any changes in their condition. The final 5-year evaluation will repeat some of&#xD;
      the questionnaires and procedures described above.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Most autoimmune diseases are thought to develop as a result of chronic immune activation and&#xD;
      dysregulation after selected environmental exposures in genetically susceptible individuals.&#xD;
      Current evidence suggests that the adult and juvenile forms of systemic rheumatic disorders&#xD;
      -- defined here as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic&#xD;
      sclerosis (SSc), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) -- share many common clinical&#xD;
      manifestations, immune responses, genetic, hormonal and environmental risk factors, and&#xD;
      possible pathogeneses. Conversely, other studies imply that each rheumatic disease, as&#xD;
      currently defined, may be composed of more homogeneous subgroups, known as elemental&#xD;
      disorders, with different pathogeneses. This protocol will explore pathogenic mechanisms for&#xD;
      systemic rheumatic disorders and possible elemental disorders through the evaluation of&#xD;
      families with monozygotic or dizygotic twins or other siblings discordant for systemic&#xD;
      rheumatic disorders (twin-sib pairs). Parents, normal volunteers and offspring of&#xD;
      microchimeric female twin-sibs will also be evaluated as needed for the experimental designs&#xD;
      of each portion of the protocol. A clinical evaluation, using standardized physician and&#xD;
      patient clinical and environmental exposure questionnaires, and specimen collections from 400&#xD;
      twin-sib pairs discordant for systemic rheumatic disorders will be performed to confirm&#xD;
      diagnoses, document medical histories and assess possible risk factors implicated in the&#xD;
      development of autoimmunity. This study will evaluate children, who will make up 25-50% of&#xD;
      the twin-sib pairs, and adults in similar ways to attempt to understand possible similarities&#xD;
      and differences in pathogeneses of systemic rheumatic disorders based upon age of onset.&#xD;
      Hypothesis-testing studies will assess differences in peripheral blood cell gene&#xD;
      activation/suppression, levels and types of microchimerism between affected and unaffected&#xD;
      individuals, selected genetic risk factors for these disorders and occupational and hormonal&#xD;
      exposures hypothesized to be potential risk factors for these diseases. Exploratory studies&#xD;
      will be conducted to begin to assess other environmental risk factors for systemic rheumatic&#xD;
      disorders and to better understand associations among phenotypes and genotypes. Biologic&#xD;
      specimens -- including blood, urine, and other clinical specimens or biopsies no longer&#xD;
      necessary for clinical care -- will be collected for directed biomarker assays and the&#xD;
      development of repositories for future research.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The minimum inclusion criteria needed for enrollment are a twin pair or sibling pair, as&#xD;
        defined by an eligible proband and his/her eligible twin or sibling, willing and able to&#xD;
        give informed consent, to enroll in the study, to complete the questionnaires and to donate&#xD;
        blood and urine samples (in case of children, parent/legal guardian must also be willing&#xD;
        and able to provide informed consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Proband inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Children (&lt; 18 years of age) or adults (18 or more years of age) require a diagnosis of a&#xD;
        systemic rheumatic disorder (by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) or other criteria&#xD;
        for the adult or juvenile forms of RA, SLE, SSc, or IIM (per (92;93)). Regarding the&#xD;
        childhood-onset diseases: JRA will be defined by age of onset &lt;17 years of age; for other&#xD;
        diseases age of onset will be &lt; 18 years. Probands will be diagnosed within 5 years of&#xD;
        enrollment in the study, with at least one twin or other sibling of the same gender within&#xD;
        5 years of age and without a recognized systemic rheumatic disorder or other autoimmune&#xD;
        disease available for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Twin-sibling inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Children or adults who are twins or other siblings of a proband sharing the same&#xD;
        biological parents, but without a recognized systemic rheumatic or autoimmune disorder, of&#xD;
        the same gender and within 5 years of age of the proband. If monozygotic twins are enrolled&#xD;
        from a family, another unaffected non-twin sibling sharing the same biological parents will&#xD;
        be enrolled for each proband if available to allow for log-linear genetic analyses. All&#xD;
        probands and unaffected siblings need to be at least one year of age at the time of&#xD;
        autoimmune disease diagnosis. In the case of triplets or greater multiples, all such&#xD;
        siblings are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Parent inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Individuals who are the genetic father and mother of the proband and twin-sib. Both&#xD;
        parents will be enrolled whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy volunteer inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy controls, recruited in part via the NIH Healthy Volunteers program, and as&#xD;
        reasonably as possible, matched to a subset of probands based on age (within 5 years),&#xD;
        gender, and race (when feasible). Healthy volunteers should be in good health, without&#xD;
&#xD;
        a recognized systemic rheumatic disorder or other autoimmune disease, and should not be&#xD;
        taking antiinflammatory medicines, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
        or corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For all subjects: ability of the subject or parents/legal guardians to provide informed&#xD;
        consent to all aspects of the study after full protocol information is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Should a participant enroll at a time when his/her twin/sibling is willing and able to give&#xD;
        informed consent, but his/her twin/sibling never enrolls (eg. Due to no longer being&#xD;
        willing or able to give informed consent), the enrolled participant will remain in the&#xD;
        study and his/her data will be used in the analyses not pertinent to his/her twin/sibling.&#xD;
        Data analysis will also occur in this manner should the enrolled participant s sibling&#xD;
        enroll, but never send in blood samples and/or questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for all protocol subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. severe trauma or vaccinations within 8 weeks of enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Still s disease/systemic-onset or pauciarticular JRA;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. medical illness that in the judgment of the investigators does not allow safe blood&#xD;
             draws or other clinical evaluations needed for study participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. cognitive impairment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. inability to give informed assent or consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for twin-sibs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Not sharing the same biological parents (being half-brothers or half-sisters). Known&#xD;
        criteria for systemic rheumatic disease or autoimmune disease (for example: RA/JRA,&#xD;
        SLE/JSLE, SSc/JSSc, IIM/JIIM, Type 1 diabetes, Psoriasis, Still s disease/systemic-onset or&#xD;
        pauciarticular JRA, Celiac sprue, Autoimmune thyroid disease, Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia&#xD;
        Purpura, Multiple sclerosis, Myasthenia gravis, Systemic vasculitis or Vitiligo).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for healthy volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recognized systemic rheumatic disorder or other autoimmune disease, history of cancer or&#xD;
