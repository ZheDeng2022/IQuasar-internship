  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of the drugs rofecoxib and bupivacaine to prevent pain&#xD;
      following third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction. Rofecoxib is approved to treat pain of&#xD;
      arthritis and menstrual cramps. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic similar to lidocaine, but&#xD;
      longer acting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 16 and 35 years of age who are in general good health and&#xD;
      require extraction of their two lower wisdom teeth may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their two lower wisdom teeth extracted, and a biopsy (removal of a&#xD;
      small piece of tissue) will be taken from the inside of the cheek around the area behind one&#xD;
      of the extraction sites. Ninety minutes before surgery, patients will take a dose of either&#xD;
      rofecoxib, or a placebo (a pill with no active ingredient) by mouth. Just before surgery,&#xD;
      they will receive an injection of either lidocaine or bupivacaine to numb the mouth and a&#xD;
      sedative called midazolam (VersedÂ® (Registered Trademark)) through an arm vein to cause&#xD;
      drowsiness. After surgery, a small piece of tubing will be placed into one of the two&#xD;
      extraction sites. Samples will be collected from the tubing to measure chemicals involved in&#xD;
      pain and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will remain in the clinic for up to 4 hours after surgery to monitor pain and drug&#xD;
      side effects while the anesthetic wears off. During this time, they will complete pain&#xD;
      questionnaires every 20 minutes. (Patients whose pain is unrelieved an hour after surgery may&#xD;
      request and receive acetaminophen (Tylenol) and codeine.) The tubing then will be removed and&#xD;
      they will be discharged with pain medicines (Tylenol, codeine and the study drug) and forms&#xD;
      to record pain ratings. They will be given detailed instructions on how and when to take the&#xD;
      medicines and how to record information in the pain diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to the clinic 48 hours after surgery with the pain diary and pain&#xD;
      relievers. At this visit, another biopsy will be taken under local anesthetic (lidocaine).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Central sensitization refers to persistent post-injury changes in the central nervous system&#xD;
      resulting in greater pain sensitivity. The concept of preemptive analgesia is defined as a&#xD;
      treatment that prevents establishment of central sensitization by providing analgesic&#xD;
      coverage during the perioperative period of surgery. Previous acute pain studies using the&#xD;
      oral surgery model have shown that suppression of postoperative pain, not intra-operative&#xD;
      nociceptive barrage, diminishes the development of sensitization at 24 to 48 hours&#xD;
      post-surgery. During the intermediate postoperative period, the nociceptive input from both&#xD;
      surgical insult and inflammation leads to central sensitization, yet their relative&#xD;
      contributions have not been clearly evaluated. The proposed study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      relative impact of surgical insult and the subsequent inflammation on postoperative pain. The&#xD;
      relative contribution of each of these nociceptive processes provides a basis for&#xD;
      postoperative pain management and the development of preemptive strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects (N = 136) will be healthy volunteers scheduled for third molar extractions.&#xD;
      Using a double-blinded, randomized, parallel study design, subjects will be randomized into&#xD;
      four groups. All patients will receive local anesthesia injections preoperatively (either 2%&#xD;
      lidocaine or 0.5% bupivacaine) to manage surgical pain in conjunction with a preemptive&#xD;
      medication (either 50 mg of rofecoxib or placebo) to control postoperative inflammation. The&#xD;
      first dose of preemptive medication will be taken by mouth 90 minutes prior to conscious&#xD;
      sedation and extractions, and later self-administered once a day for the next 48 hours. The&#xD;
      analgesic effect of the drugs will be assessed in the clinic every 20 minutes for the first&#xD;
      four hours after extractions, and then self-assessed at 24, and 48 hours after surgery using&#xD;
      two pain intensity assessment instruments: category scale and visual analog scale (VAS).&#xD;
      Microdialysis will be performed with sample collection concurrent with pain report over the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period of four hours. Two biopsies will be performed: preoperatively,&#xD;
      and postoperatively at 48 hours. The combination regimen with bupivacaine and rofecoxib is&#xD;
      predicted to maximally suppress the onset and intensity of postoperative dental pain to a&#xD;
      greater extent than all other groups through a blockade of the nociceptive input from both&#xD;
      surgery and inflammation. It is hypothesized that this preemptive treatment will maximally&#xD;
      inhibit the development of central sensitization following tissue injury which manifests as&#xD;
      hyperalgesia at later time points. It is also hypothesized that the administration of&#xD;
      rofecoxib (a cyclooxygenase-2 selective anti-inflammatory medication) will reduce&#xD;
      post-surgical pain experienced at later time points to a greater extent than suppression of&#xD;
      the intra-operative nociceptive barrage alone (by bupivacaine), suggesting that suppression&#xD;
      of inflammation plays a more pivotal role than attenuating nociception due to tissue injury&#xD;
      in diminishing central sensitization.&#xD;
