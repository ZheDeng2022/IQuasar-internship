  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the effect of the medication gabapentin to treat itching secondary to liver&#xD;
      disease is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some funds to cover travel expenses for patients who are not from New York (NY).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gabapentin is approved to treat seizures in human beings. In this study, patients with liver&#xD;
      disease who meet inclusion criteria are admitted to the research hospital of the New York&#xD;
      Presbyterian Hospital to record scratching behavior by the use of a machine designed for that&#xD;
      purpose. Blood work will be obtained. After completion of recording, patients are assigned by&#xD;
      chance to receive active medication or placebo (a capsule that does not contain active&#xD;
      medication). The patients will come to the outpatient office of the research hospital 2 weeks&#xD;
      into the study for an interview and blood work. After 4 weeks, patients are readmitted to the&#xD;
      hospital to record scratching behavior. After data are collected, the code is broken, if&#xD;
      patient had been on inactive drug, active drug will be supplied as per protocol for 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Blood work will be obtained. If patient had been randomized to active medication, the study&#xD;
      will provide one week supply of drug. After that, the referring physician, with whom the&#xD;
      study was previously discussed, could prescribe the medication as it is available.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of gabapentin for the pruritus of&#xD;
      cholestasis. Duration: 4 weeks. Some travel funds available for patients from out of the NY&#xD;
      area for all the visits. Hospitalization at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. One&#xD;
      outpatient department visit at week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have to be referred by their physician, who will receive a summary of the&#xD;
      results at the end of the patient's study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are randomized to active drug and respond to it with decrease in pruritus, a one&#xD;
      week supply of medication is given. The referring physician could prescribe the drug for long&#xD;
      term use. If the patient is randomized to placebo they can be treated with active medication&#xD;
      provided by the study for 4 weeks, at end of which, the drug could be prescribed by referring&#xD;
      physician if the patient responds to the drug with decrease in the pruritus.&#xD;
