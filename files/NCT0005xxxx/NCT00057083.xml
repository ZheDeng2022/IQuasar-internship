      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the physical separation between patient and&#xD;
      physician required during telemedicine has an affect on physician-patient communication and&#xD;
      related outcomes, including patient and physician satisfaction, patient compliance, and&#xD;
      patient understanding of medical care.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND/RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Veterans Administration system supports telemedicine (TM) to provide medical&#xD;
      consultations between patients and physicians via videoconference. At present, little is&#xD;
      known about the impact of such TM consultations on patient-physician communication and&#xD;
      related health outcomes. Analyses of in-person (IP) medical encounters have shown that&#xD;
      effective patient-physician communication is associated with improved health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE(S):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the physical separation between patient and physician required during TM&#xD;
      has an affect on patient-physician communication and related outcomes, including patient and&#xD;
      physician satisfaction, patient compliance, and patient understanding of medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial, 238 patients were randomized to receive either consultative care at&#xD;
      the remote site via TM with a consultant physician located the Milwaukee VA (intervention) OR&#xD;
      by an IP consultation with a consultant physician at the Milwaukee VA (control). The same&#xD;
      group of consultant physicians provided both IP and TM consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both study arms had their medical encounter video recorded. We compared patterns&#xD;
      and quality of patient-physician communication for the TM and IP encounters, using the Roter&#xD;
      Interaction Analysis System. Data on patient and physician satisfaction with the encounter&#xD;
      and patients' understanding of their medical problems were collected at the end of each&#xD;
      medical encounter. Patient compliance (medication refill behavior) was assessed at 90 days&#xD;
      post visit. The frequency of communication behaviors during the TM and IP encounters was&#xD;
      compared using the analysis of a Linear Mixed Model. Comparison of patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      physician satisfaction, patient compliance, and patient knowledge measures between TM and IP&#xD;
      groups were conducted with similar Linear Mixed Models.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only adult (age&gt;18) patients referred from the Appleton Clinic are eligible. All Appleton&#xD;
        patients who are considered new patient referrals (ie, have never been seen in the&#xD;
        pulmonary, rheumatology, and endocrine clinics at the Milwaukee VA) will be eligible.&#xD;
        Appleton patients who have previously been seen by any of the nine participating endocrine,&#xD;
        pulmonary, and rheumatology physicians at the Milwaukee VA will be eligible. These&#xD;
        follow-up patients will be scheduled with the previously seen participating physician, so&#xD;
        there is no disruption of the ongoing patient-provider relationship. Patients that have&#xD;
        established care with a non-participating provider will not be eligible. Patients that have&#xD;
        been referred to the specialist for an outpatient procedure (eg, request to perform&#xD;
        pulmonary function testing or bronchoscopy) will not be eligible. Repeat visits to the same&#xD;
        or any other participating physician will not be eligible. Adult patients who have a&#xD;
        significant communication disability (severe speech and hearing impairment, severe&#xD;
        dementia, or mental health condition resulting in a non-communicative patient) and are&#xD;
        considered mentally competent to provide informed written consent will not be eligible.&#xD;
        Patients with disabilities other than those mentioned will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients that have established care with a non-participating provider will not be eligible&#xD;
        to participate. Patients that have been referred to the specialist for an outpatient&#xD;
        procedure (e.g. request to perform pulmonary function testing or bronchoscopy) will not be&#xD;
        eligible. Repeat visits to the same or any other participating physician will not be&#xD;
        eligible. Adult patients who have a significant communication disability (severe speech and&#xD;
        hearing impairment, severe dementia, or mental health condition resulting in a&#xD;
        non-communicative patient) and are considered mentally competent to provide informed&#xD;
        written consent will not be eligible to participate.&#xD;
