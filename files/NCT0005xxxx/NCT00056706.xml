      This study will determine whether impaired hand function due to stroke can be improved by&#xD;
      blocking nerve impulses to the unaffected arm. Following a stroke, the unaffected side of the&#xD;
      brain might negatively influence the affected side. Studies in healthy volunteers show that&#xD;
      function in one hand improves when ischemic nerve block (inflating a pressure cuff to block&#xD;
      nerve impulses) is applied to the forearm of the other hand. This study will examine whether&#xD;
      similar improvement also occurs in the affected hand of patients with chronic impairment&#xD;
      after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke patients with sensory (numbness) or motor impairment (weakness) in the hand that has&#xD;
      persisted at least 12 months after the stroke may be eligible for this study. Patients who&#xD;
      have had more than one stroke, whose stroke affected both sides of the body, who have a&#xD;
      history of deep vein thrombosis (blood clotting), or who are receiving anticoagulant&#xD;
      (blood-thinning) treatment at the time of the study will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have physical and neurological examinations and will undergo the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (if one has not been done within the previous 6 months): MRI&#xD;
           uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. For&#xD;
           this procedure, the patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow&#xD;
           cylinder) and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur&#xD;
           during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 45 to 90 minutes, during which&#xD;
           the patient lies still up to a few minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini Mental State Examination - Patients will take a short test to assess cognitive&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 2 (and possibly 3 and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor task practice: Patients practice a motor task several times to achieve optimal&#xD;
           performance. The task is a rhythmic, repetitive pinch grip at maximal strength at a&#xD;
           frequency of one grip every 10 seconds. If technical difficulties arise during the&#xD;
           session, the procedure will be repeated in sessions 3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 5 (and possibly 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pinch grip and ischemic nerve block (INB): Patients perform the pinch grip task several&#xD;
           times and then INB is applied. For INB, a blood pressure cuff is inflated around the arm&#xD;
           at the level of the elbow for 35 to 50 minutes. The procedure causes temporary numbness,&#xD;
           tingling, loss of muscle strength, and discoloration or the forearm and hand. Patients&#xD;
           repeat the pinch grip task during the INB and again 20 minutes after the INB is&#xD;
           released. If technical difficulties arise during the session, the procedure will be&#xD;
           repeated in session 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 7&#xD;
&#xD;
      This session is identical to session 5, except the INB is applied immediately above the ankle&#xD;
      instead of on the forearm.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There are very few therapeutic options for the treatment of disability resulting from chronic&#xD;
      stroke. We recently found that transient deafferentation of one hand in healthy subjects&#xD;
      enhanced performance in corticomotor excitability and a tactile discriminative task,&#xD;
      targeting muscles in the opposite non-deafferented hand. The purpose of this protocol is to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that transient deafferentation of the intact hand in chronic stroke&#xD;
      patients will improve functions in the paretic hand. We plan to study patients with chronic&#xD;
      strokes dating back at least one year, and either predominantly motor or somatosensory&#xD;
      deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures are (a) in patients with predominantly somatosensory deficit,&#xD;
      deafferentation-induced improvement in a tactile discrimination task (grating orientation&#xD;
      task GOT and (b) in patients with predominantly motor deficit, deafferentation-induced&#xD;
      improvement in pinch muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified primary outcome measure will be the decrease in interhemispheric inhibition&#xD;
      targeting the paretic hand during deafferentation of the healthy hand (chronic stroke&#xD;
      patients, motor deficit group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measure will be the decrease in interhemispheric inhibition targeting the&#xD;
      non-deafferented hand in healthy control subjects.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will include patients with thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions and with&#xD;
        hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions (subcortical in the corticospinal tract, or cortical in&#xD;
        motor or somatosensory representations, as documented by CT or MRI) at least 12 months&#xD;
        after the stroke. In addition, for the TMS measurements we will include 17 age- and&#xD;
        gender-matched control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the GOT task, we will choose subjects who initially had a severe sensory paresis&#xD;
        (sensory NIH-SS below 1), which subsequently recovered to the point that they have a&#xD;
        residual somatosensory deficit but can perform the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the motor performance, we will choose subjects who initially had a severe motor paresis&#xD;
        (below MRC grade 2), which subsequently recovered to the point that they have a residual&#xD;
        motor deficit but can perform the required tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;

        deteriorated condition due to age, uncontrolled epilepsy or others).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or subjects with increased intracranial pressure as evaluated by clinical means.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or subjects with unstable cardiac arrhythmia.&#xD;
