  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if injections of rhuFab V2 into the eye in&#xD;
      combination with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a safe and efficacious treatment&#xD;
      for patients with age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;

             drugs (pegaptanib, rhuFab V2, anecortave acetate, protein kinase C inhibitors, etc.)&#xD;
             Previous intravitreal drug delivery (e.g., intravitreal corticosteroid injection or&#xD;
             device implantation) in the study eye&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Laser photocoagulation (juxtafoveal or extrafoveal) in the study eye within 1 month&#xD;

             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation&#xD;
