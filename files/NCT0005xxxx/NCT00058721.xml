      This study will use single photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT (see below), to&#xD;
      examine brain nicotine receptors in evaluating the role of a chemical called acetylcholine in&#xD;
      memory and other problems in Parkinson's disease (PD). Acetylcholine acts by binding to these&#xD;
      nicotine receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with Parkinson's disease 40 years of age and older,&#xD;
      with or without dementia, may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with&#xD;
      physical and neurological examinations, a pen and paper test of memory and other mental&#xD;
      functions, blood tests, and, for women of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test. Patients&#xD;
      with cognition problems will have more intensive mental function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves&#xD;
           to show structural and chemical changes in the brain. During the scan, the subject lies&#xD;
           on a table in a narrow cylinder (the scanner). The time required in the scanner is about&#xD;
           1 hour, during which the subject is asked to lie very still for 10 to 15 minutes at a&#xD;
           time. He or she can speak with a staff member via an intercom system at all times during&#xD;
           the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SPECT: This nuclear medicine test produces a picture of the receptors in the brain. On&#xD;
           the night before the scan, the day of the scan, and for 4 days after the scan, subjects&#xD;
           take an oral dose of potassium iodide to protect the thyroid gland from the radioactive&#xD;
           tracer used in the SPECT procedure. (People allergic to potassium iodide will take&#xD;
           potassium perchlorate instead.) Before the scan, small radioactive markers containing&#xD;
           99Tc are glued to the subject's head. Two catheters (thin, flexible tubes) are placed in&#xD;
           veins in the arms to inject the radioactive tracer [123I]5-I-A-85380 and to draw blood&#xD;
           samples. Another catheter is placed in an artery in the wrist to draw arterial blood&#xD;
           samples. During the scan, the subject lies on a bed with his or her head held still with&#xD;
           a head holder. The scans are taken over a 6-hour period after injection of&#xD;
           [123I]5-I-A-85380. An electrocardiogram, respiration, and blood pressure measures are&#xD;
           taken before the tracer is injected, then 5 minutes after the injection, and again 30 to&#xD;
           60 minutes after the injection. Blood and urine samples are collected 5 to 6 hours after&#xD;
           starting the scan. Participants are asked to urinate at least every 2 hours for 12 hours&#xD;
           after injection of [123I]5-I-A-85380 to decrease radiation exposure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. PD is&#xD;
      characterized primarily by motor impairment, but cognitive impairment is common and dementia&#xD;
      may occur in up to 50% of patients. Cholinergic deficits have been widely demonstrated in PD&#xD;
      patients with and without dementia. Cholinergic deficits are more profound in the setting of&#xD;
      PD with dementia. The cholinergic system mediates aspects of learning and memory and deficits&#xD;
      in cholinergic function are correlated with the degree of dementia in PD. Additionally, the&#xD;
      cholinergic system may mediate certain aspects of motor function in PD. Data on cholinergic&#xD;
      function, particularly relating to nicotinic cholinergic receptors, are limited to post&#xD;
      mortem studies, and little is known about the role of the cholinergic system in vivo and how&#xD;
      it relates to clinical phenomena. The aim of the current study is to assess the feasibility&#xD;
      and usefulness of imaging of the high affinity alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic cholinergic receptor&#xD;
      in vivo, using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging in patients with&#xD;
      PD. The long-term goal of the present study is to further understanding of the role of the&#xD;
      cholinergic system in the pathogenesis of PD and to elucidate potential diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic targets.&#xD;
