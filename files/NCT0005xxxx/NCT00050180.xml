  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether a particular type of gene (MDR1) in the body can affect blood&#xD;
      levels of two protease inhibitors, indinavir and saquinavir, which are used to treat people&#xD;
      with HIV. If blood levels of these drugs are too low or too high, they may not work well or&#xD;
      may cause side effects in patients. This study will determine how MDR1 genes might affect&#xD;
      absorption of these medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history and blood and urine tests. The blood will&#xD;
      be tested for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine laboratory values for assessing general health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MDR1 gene type&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount of P-glycoprotein (a protein made by the MDR1 gene) on T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood drawn three more times, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After one dose of the sedative midazolam (Versed(Registered Trademark)): Participants&#xD;
           will take an 8-milligram dose of midazolam syrup by mouth. Four hours later, a single&#xD;
           blood sample will be drawn through a needle in an arm vein. This part of the study will&#xD;
           assess the efficiency of a certain enzyme involved in metabolizing (breaking down)&#xD;
           indinavir and saquinavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After four doses of indinavir: About a week after taking the midazolam, participants&#xD;
           will take 800 mg of indinavir (two capsules) 3 times a day (every 8 hours) for 1 day.&#xD;
           The following morning they will come to the clinic, where a catheter (flexible plastic&#xD;
           tube) will be placed in an arm vein for repeated blood draws. A blood sample will be&#xD;
           drawn, and a fourth and final dose of indinavir will be given. Seven blood samples of&#xD;
           about a teaspoon each will then be collected through the catheter over an 8-hour period&#xD;
           to measure blood levels of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 10 doses of saquinavir: About a week after the last dose of indinavir,&#xD;
           participants will start taking 1,200 mg (6 capsules) of saquinavir soft-gelatin capsules&#xD;
           3 times a day for 3 days. On the fourth day, participants will come to the clinic. A&#xD;
           catheter will be inserted into an arm vein and about 4 teaspoons of blood will be&#xD;
           collected for routine laboratory tests and to measure saquinavir levels. A urine sample&#xD;
           will also be collected for routine tests. Participants will then receive the tenth and&#xD;
           final dose of saquinavir, and eight blood samples of about a teaspoon each will be&#xD;
           collected through the catheter over an 8-hour period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The expression of P-glycoprotein, a transporter protein present in enterocytes as well as&#xD;
      other cells involved in the absorption and distribution of HIV protease inhibitors, has been&#xD;
      linked to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 26 of the MDR1 gene, C3435T.&#xD;
      Individuals homozygous for the T allele have reduced P-gp expression compared to CC&#xD;
      individuals. Preliminary studies by other investigators to determine the influence of MDR1&#xD;
      genotype on HIV protease inhibitor pharmacokinetics have yielded inconclusive results. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of this study is to determine the relationship, if any, between MDR1&#xD;
      genotypes and plasma concentrations of the HIV protease inhibitors indinavir and saquinavir.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this investigation will (1) assess the relationship between CYP3A4&#xD;
      activity and indinavir and saquinavir exposure and (2) characterize the relationship, if any,&#xD;
      between P-gp expression on lymphocyte surfaces and MDR1 genotype. Up to 150 subjects will be&#xD;
      screened to enroll a total of 63 healthy volunteers (21 subjects each in the CC, TT, and CT&#xD;
      groups). Each subject will have blood drawn for P-gp expression analysis and MDR1 genotyping&#xD;
      at screening. Next, subjects will receive oral midazolam 8 mg for CYP3A4 phenotyping; a&#xD;
      single blood sample will be collected 4 hours after midazolam administration for&#xD;
      determination of midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam. Between 7 and 28 days after midazolam&#xD;
      administration, subjects will receive indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours for one day and a single&#xD;
      800 mg dose the next morning (dose #4). Between 7 and 28 days after indinavir administration,&#xD;
      subjects will receive saquinavir soft-gel capsules 1200 mg three times daily for 3 days and a&#xD;
      single dose on the morning of day 4 (dose # 10). Post-dose blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      over 8 hours following dose #4 of indinavir and dose #10 of saquinavir. Indinavir and&#xD;
      saquinavir pharmacokinetic parameters (primarily AUC and Cmax) will be compared across MDR1&#xD;
      genotype groups using ANOVA with post-hoc testing. 1-hydroxymidazolam: midazolam ratios will&#xD;
      be correlated to indinavir and saquinavir AUCs as well as compared across MDR1 genotype&#xD;
      groups. P-gp expression on lymphocyte surfaces will be determined by flow cytometry,&#xD;
      quantified, and compared across MDR1 genotype groups. Data from this investigation will&#xD;
      determine whether MDR1 genotype influences protease inhibitor plasma concentrations.&#xD;
