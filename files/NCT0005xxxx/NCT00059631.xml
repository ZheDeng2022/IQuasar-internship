      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Establish the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of weekly&#xD;
      mitoxantrone in combination with weekly PS-341 in patients with advanced AI-PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of bortezomib and mitoxantrone in combination on PSA levels among&#xD;
           patients with baseline PSA levels &gt;/=5 ng/mL who are treated near the maximum tolerated&#xD;
           dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitor the effect of escalating doses of bortezomib combined with mitoxantrone on&#xD;
           selected parameters of clinical benefit (i.e. performance status, tumor-related&#xD;
           symptoms, measurable disease response).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitoxantrone is used to treat bone pain in advanced prostate cancer and inhibits many&#xD;
      proteins that the cancer cells need to multiply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib is a member of a new class of drugs that possess powerful and broad-spectrum&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity and inhibit many proteins that the cancer cells need to survive and&#xD;
      multiply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-study testing will include brief physical examination, vital signs (weight, height,&#xD;
      temperature, pulse, respiratory and blood pressure), chest x-ray, EKG (test to measure the&#xD;
      electrical activity of the heart), echocardiogram, blood test, urine tests, and depending on&#xD;
      the stage of the disease, a CT scan and/or bone scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, the participants will receive one dose of Mitoxantrone combined with one&#xD;
      dose of Bortezomib every week for 4 weeks in a row followed by 2 weeks of rest; this is&#xD;
      called a course. If side effects are not too severe, Mitoxantrone and Bortezomib will be&#xD;
      infused rapidly into a vein while participants will be receiving normal saline (&quot;salt in&#xD;
      water solution&quot;) at a rate of 100ml/hour. They will receive the salt solution the entire time&#xD;
      they are in the treatment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their vital signs (temperature, pulse, breathing, blood pressure)&#xD;
      taken before and one hour after treatment. All side effects during course one will be&#xD;
      reviewed and, if no serious side effects took place, the participant may have additional&#xD;
      courses. A pill may be given by mouth every day to decrease the risk of clot formation or a&#xD;
      pill for diarrhea, nausea, and/or vomiting if the doctor believes that participants may need&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also during treatment, participants will have a complete physical examination by a physician&#xD;
      or their designated representative (such as a nurse or physician assistant) each week of&#xD;
      treatment. Bone Scan and/or CT Scan will be done if necessary. Participants will have blood&#xD;
      tests done every week during study. A special blood test, called the 20S proteosome, will be&#xD;
      done weekly during Cycles 1 and 2 to evaluate the activity of the drugs. Blood will be&#xD;
      collected before you receive treatment and then at 1-2 hours afterward. About 2 teaspoons of&#xD;
      blood will be collected each time for this. Bone scan, chest x-ray and/or CT scans will be&#xD;
      repeated during the study every other course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects&#xD;
      occur. Side effects that are thought to be related to the study drug are renal failure&#xD;
      resulting in death, and a grade 3 rash requiring treatment with steroids that recurred with&#xD;
      subsequent treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum amount of time that participants can remain on the study is 8 courses of&#xD;
      treatment. Long term follow-up of participants will include a phone call every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Bortezomib has been approved by the FDA for investigational&#xD;
      use only. Mitoxantrone has been approved by the FDA for treatment of symptoms in advanced&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Only Mitoxantrone is commercially available. About 42 participants will take&#xD;
      part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson .&#xD;
