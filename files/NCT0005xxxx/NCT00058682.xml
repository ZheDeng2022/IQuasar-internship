  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluconazole is an FDA-approved drug that is widely used to treat fungal infections due to&#xD;
      candida. The experimental drug anidulafungin has been found to be active in treating&#xD;
      life-threatening fungal infections. The purpose of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      anidulafungin is as effective as fluconazole in treating candidemia, an invasive form of&#xD;
      candidiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hundred patients 16 years of age or older will participate in this study. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one-half will receive anidulafungin; the&#xD;
      other half will receive fluconazole. They will receive the drug for as few as 10 days or for&#xD;
      up to 42 days, depending on the seriousness of the infection. The drug will be given over a&#xD;
      four-hour period on the first day, and over two hours on the remaining days. While taking the&#xD;
      study medication, participants will be required to give blood samples every week until the&#xD;
      end of treatment. At two weeks and six weeks following the end of therapy, participants will&#xD;
      return for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to their participation in this study, patients will undergo the following evaluations:&#xD;
      a physical exam, an eye exam, an electrocardiogram, and possibly blood work.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority,&#xD;
      multi-center trial of the safety and efficacy of anidulafungin versus fluconazole in patients&#xD;
      with candidemia or other forms of invasive candidiasis. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if anidulafungin is at least as effective as fluconazole in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of candidemia and/or other forms of invasive candidiasis. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to compare the safety of the two study drugs and determine the&#xD;
      efficacy for the prevention of late Candida infections in patients treated with anidulafungin&#xD;
      versus fluconazole. Assuming 25% of patients will be unevaluable at the end of intravenous&#xD;
      therapy, 248 patients will be enrolled to obtain a total of 222 evaluable patients. Patients&#xD;
      older than 16 years of age with candidemia or invasive candidiasis will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either anidulafungin or fluconazole. Patients randomized to anidulafungin will&#xD;
      receive an IV loading dose on day one of 200mg followed by 100mg once daily. Patients&#xD;
      randomized to fluconazole will receive an IV loading dose on day one of 800mg followed by an&#xD;
      IV daily dose of 400mg. Patients will be maintained on IV therapy for a minimum of 10 days to&#xD;
      a maximum of 42 days. After 10 days of therapy, patients on either study drug may be treated&#xD;
      on an ambulatory basis with oral fluconazole therapy.&#xD;
