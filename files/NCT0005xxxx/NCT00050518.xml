  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to define, with precision, the safety and efficacy of APSV, two dose&#xD;
      potencies of one lot in vaccinia-naive adults. The ability of this vaccine to induce a&#xD;
      classic �take� as defined by formation of a lesion at the injection site consistent with the&#xD;
      �Jennerian� process (see Appendix A) and vaccine specific immune responses will be assessed.&#xD;
      The local cutaneous lesion is considered to be a surrogate for clinical effectiveness of&#xD;
      live, replicating smallpox vaccines. Neutralizing antibody formation has been correlated with&#xD;
      takes for the Dryvax vaccine and is considered to be cross-protective for other&#xD;
      orthopoxviruses, including variola. The study also seeks to characterize preliminarily the&#xD;
      cell mediated immune (CMI) response to APSV (as compared to Dryvax).&#xD;

      A Multicenter, double blind, randomized trial in which each volunteer will receive one of 2&#xD;
      dose concentrations of one of two lots of Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine as a single&#xD;
      vaccination (undiluted, 1:5 dilution). Volunteers without a take at day 7 - 9 will be offered&#xD;
      a vaccination with Dryvax at the end of the study.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function defined as a serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL; urine protein &lt;&#xD;
             100mg/ dL or trace or negative proteinuria (by dipstick), and a calculated creatinine&#xD;
             clearance &gt;55 mL/min. Formula for calculations is contained within the Manual of&#xD;
             Procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (Note: Renal function is measured to ensure that subjects could meet criteria for use of&#xD;
        cidofovir if needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-32 (children are excluded due to concerns of safety, including&#xD;
             autoinoculation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability for follow-up for planned duration of the study (56 days following the&#xD;
             last vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable medical history by screen evaluation form and brief assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of a typical vaccinia scar and negative history of smallpox vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative urine or serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the volunteer is female and of childbearing potential, she agrees to use acceptable&#xD;
             contraception, and not become pregnant for the duration of the study. (Acceptable&#xD;
             contraception includes implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, effective&#xD;
             intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative ELISA for HIV or negative Western blot for subjects who have a positive ELISA&#xD;
             and have participated in an HIV vaccine trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative hepatitis B surface antigen and negative antibody to hepatitis C virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative urine glucose by dipstick.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT &lt; 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Allergies to any component of the vaccines (e.g., polymyxin B sulfate,&#xD;
