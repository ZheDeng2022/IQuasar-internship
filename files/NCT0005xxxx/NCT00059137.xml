  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a flexible belt device in guiding patient&#xD;
      breathing during computed tomography (CT)-guided needle biopsy. When patients undergo CT&#xD;
      scanning to help guide the physician during a tissue biopsy, they are usually asked to hold&#xD;
      their breath while the scan is taken of certain parts of the body. When the first scan is&#xD;
      completed, the patients are allowed to breathe, and are then asked to hold their breath again&#xD;
      while the needle is advanced towards the tissue to be biopsied. Since body organs and tissues&#xD;
      move with breathing, this study will try to stop the patient's breathing at the same place in&#xD;
      the breathing cycle to ensure that the biopsy target stays still and in the same place. This&#xD;
      study will see if the flexible belt, used with a computer screen that charts the patient's&#xD;
      breathing, will improve the patient's ability to stop breathing at the same place in the&#xD;
      breathing cycle before and during the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have a lesion requiring a needle biopsy in the chest&#xD;
      or abdominal area may be eligible for this study. The biopsy procedure must require CT scan&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breathing exercise: A flexible, loose-fitting belt is placed around the patient's&#xD;
           abdomen and the patient is asked to stop breathing in the following ways: 1) take a deep&#xD;
           breath in and hold; 2) breathe deeply out and hold; and 3) breathe regularly and hold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Needle biopsy: The patient is positioned in a CT scanner and is asked to hold his or her&#xD;
           breath while an initial scan is taken. Then the patient is taken out of the scanner and&#xD;
           the place the needle entry site for the biopsy is marked on the skin. A local anesthetic&#xD;
           is applied to the site and the patient is asked to hold his or her breath the same way&#xD;
           as before. During this breath hold, the patient may or may not be shown a computer&#xD;
           screen displaying a graph of the patient's breathing and the point in the cycle of the&#xD;
           previous breath hold. The biopsy is then performed with CT guidance. While the CT&#xD;
           pictures are being taken, the patient is again asked to breathe and hold his or her&#xD;
           breath as before. When the biopsy is completed, the belt device is removed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will examine the use of a flexible belt placed across the patient's abdomen to&#xD;
      sense and plot the patient's respiratory cycle. The point in the respiratory cycle at which&#xD;
      the patient holds his/her breath will be recorded at different levels and correlated with CT&#xD;
      scans and prior patient breathing levels. Our hypothesis is that a graphical representation&#xD;
      of the respiratory cycle may make it easier for the patient to hold his or her breath at the&#xD;
      same level each time a CT scan is obtained, or a needle is inserted. If this is true, then&#xD;
      this should translate into faster safer procedures, with potentially less ionizing radiation,&#xD;
      although this endpoint is not defined in this particular study.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must fulfill all of the following criteria to be eligible for study admission:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All patients must have a lesion needing biopsy in the chest or abdominal areas in&#xD;
             special procedures requiring CT scan guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. age greater than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No serious concurrent medical illness that would preclude the patient from making a&#xD;
             rational informed decision on participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent form, and&#xD;
             to comply with the protocol. If in question, an ethics consult will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any of the following will be excluded from study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with an altered mental status that precludes understanding or consenting for&#xD;
             the biopsy procedure will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. patients unable to hold breath for more than 5 seconds.&#xD;
