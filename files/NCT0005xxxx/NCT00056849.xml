      This study will explore how genes-units of heredity-may influence the severity of ankylosing&#xD;
      spondylitis. It will examine whether some genes may cause people with ankylosing spondylitis&#xD;
      to have more rapid fusion of the bones of the spine, more difficulty performing daily&#xD;
      activities, or be more likely to need joint surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who developed ankylosing spondylitis after age 16 and have had the disease for 20&#xD;
      years or more may be eligible for this study. The onset of disease is dated to the first&#xD;
      appearance of symptoms of inflammatory low back pain or restricted spinal motion. Patients&#xD;
      with a spondyloarthropathy other than AS may not enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a brief medical history and physical exam. They will fill out a&#xD;
      30-minute questionnaire that includes questions on demographics (such as age, ethnicity,&#xD;
      marital status, etc.), medication history, work history, hip surgeries, and assessment of&#xD;
      functional disability. Fifty milliliters (about 3-1/3 tablespoons) of blood will be drawn for&#xD;
      gene testing, and X-rays will be taken of the pelvis, lower back, and neck, if recent X-rays&#xD;
      (within 1 year) are not available. Women of childbearing age will have a urine pregnancy test&#xD;
      before having X-rays.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is largely genetically determined. Recent&#xD;
      studies suggest that the severity of AS is also influenced to a large extent by genetic&#xD;
      factors. The goal of this study is to identify genes that influence the severity of AS. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that genetic markers of susceptibility, including human leukocyte antigen (HLA)&#xD;
      polymorphisms, are among the genes that also influence the severity of AS. Other genes that&#xD;
      could potentially influence the severity of AS include those that affect the severity of&#xD;
      joint inflammation and those that influence bone formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cross-sectional study, we will test the association of HLA markers and polymorphisms&#xD;
      in several genes involved in the regulation of inflammation and bone formation with the&#xD;
      severity of AS. Approximately 500 patients will be enrolled. Each patient will have had AS&#xD;
      for at least 20 years. Measures of AS severity will be the extent of spinal fusion as&#xD;
      measured radiographically, functional disability, time to permanent work disability, and need&#xD;
      for total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying genetic markers that are associated with differences in the severity of AS will&#xD;
      greatly enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease by suggesting&#xD;
      mechanisms and pathways involved in the development of long-term damage. In a separate but&#xD;
      related protocol, we will assess genetic markers associated with persistent active&#xD;
      inflammation in patients with AS.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. have been diagnosed with AS by the modified New York criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. have had AS for 20 years or more. The duration of AS will be dated from the time of&#xD;
             onset of symptoms of inflammatory low back pain or restricted spinal motion&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. be able to read English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential participants will be excluded if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. onset of AS was at age 16 or younger&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. have a spondyloarthropathy other than AS&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. are unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study of patients with AS for 20 years or more will provide a sample with a greater&#xD;
        proportion of patients who will have developed the outcomes of interest. All participants&#xD;
        will necessarily be age 37 or older. Study entry is not limited by sex or ethnic origin.&#xD;
        English literacy is required because the functional status questionnaires used in the study&#xD;
        have not been developed and validated in many languages other than English. In particular,&#xD;
        the HAQ-S has been validated in only English, Dutch, and Finnish. The BASFI has been&#xD;
        validated in English, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, German, and French. Each of these validation&#xD;
        studies consists of a single report. Monolingual speakers of these languages are likely to&#xD;
        be rare in our area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential participants will be recruited by physician referral and self-referral.&#xD;
        Information about the study will be mailed to local rheumatologists and posted on the NIH&#xD;
        website. Notices will also be sent to local chapters of the Arthritis Foundation and the&#xD;
        Spondylitis Association of America.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study of first-degree relatives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Parent, sibling, or child (age 18 or older) of an enrolled subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Family members may by asymptomatic or have signs or symptoms of AS or a condition in the&#xD;
        spondyloarthropathy family. There is no requirement for a minimum number of members per&#xD;
        family to be eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The recruitment ceiling will be unlimited. Approximately 500 subjects will be recruited&#xD;
        from all study sites. The target sample for the primary analyses will be 400 eligible&#xD;
        subjects. Approximately 150 subjects will be recruited at the NIH.&#xD;
