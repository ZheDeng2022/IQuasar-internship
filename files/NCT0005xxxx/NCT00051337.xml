  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to determine what&#xD;
      areas of the brain are responsible for paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders. Patients&#xD;
      with these disorders have sudden, brief attacks of movement, similar to epileptic seizures,&#xD;
      but without loss of consciousness. SPECT is a nuclear medicine test that produces&#xD;
      three-dimensional images of the brain, showing blood flow and function in different brain&#xD;
      regions. This test, which can detect the focus of epileptic seizures, will be used in this&#xD;
      study to scan patients while they are experiencing a hyperkinetic movement attack, while they&#xD;
      are not having and attack, and while they are simulating an attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have paroxysmal movement attacks that can be easily&#xD;
      induced by a specific trigger, such as a sudden movement or prolonged exercise, may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and review of&#xD;
      their medical records, physical examination, videotape of attacks, and, for women, a&#xD;
      pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have three SPECT scans, separated from each other by at least 48 hours.&#xD;
      Before each scan, the subject will perform an activity that ordinarily precipitates a&#xD;
      movement attack, such as standing up from a chair, assuming a certain posture, or doing&#xD;
      something strenuous. Each scan will try to record one of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject performs the trigger activity, but does not have an attack;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject performs the trigger activity and has an involuntary attack as a result;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject performs the trigger activity and does not have an attack, but then mimics&#xD;
           an attack voluntarily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the condition is recorded, the subject will be given an injection of a radioactive&#xD;
      agent called 99m Technetium and will then relax quietly for 40 to 60 minutes before the SPECT&#xD;
      scan. For the scan, the subject lies on an examination table and the SPECT camera is moved&#xD;
      near and around the head to image the brain. The scan takes about 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also undergo one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. For this test, the&#xD;
      subject lies in a narrow cylinder (the scanner), while pictures of the brain are taken.&#xD;
      Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises caused by electrical switching of radio frequency&#xD;
      circuits used in the scanning process. The procedure takes about 30 minutes.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine the areas of the brain responsible for paroxysmal&#xD;
      hyperkinetic movement disorders. Paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders have been&#xD;
      clinically recognized for a long time, although the exact neurophysiological mechanism&#xD;
      leading to paroxysms of hyperkinetic movement attacks is not well understood. Paroxysmal&#xD;
      hyperkinetic movement disorders are heterogenous, and the exact mechanism may differ in each&#xD;
      subcategory. In paroxysmal dyskinesias, the idiopathic forms of paroxysmal hyperkinetic&#xD;
      movement disorders, it is speculated that transient functional abnormality at the cellular&#xD;
      level occurs in the basal ganglia without organic irreversible damage. Ion channel&#xD;
      dysfunction is an attractive hypothesis to explain such transient dysfunction. Some patients&#xD;
      with paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders have a psychogenic etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising technique to evaluate physiological changes in the brain during an attack is&#xD;
      ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning. Ictal SPECT is a reliable&#xD;
      method to detect a seizure focus during an epileptic seizure. We will utilize ictal SPECT&#xD;
      scanning techniques during, and between attacks, and while they are simulating such attacks.&#xD;
      The differential activation between the attacks of hyperkinetic movements and the voluntary&#xD;
      movements may shed light on the regions of the brain and neurophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for generation of paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - Paroxysmal Dyskinesia Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Established diagnosis of paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders. The diagnosis will be&#xD;
        established by the preliminary screening in the NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic,&#xD;
        based on review of medical record, history, clinical evaluation, and video tapes of an&#xD;
        attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A reproducible trigger of paroxysmal hyperkinetic attacks, such as sudden movement, or&#xD;
        prolonged exercise, which will produce attacks at least with 50% consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients only with paroxysmal attacks of hyperkinetic movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients whose attacks can be precipitated easily.&#xD;

        phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and antidepressants (but not limited&#xD;
        to these) for their paroxysmal dyskinesias (not seizures) will be asked to hold the&#xD;
        medication prior to the study. A sufficient drug washout period will be established&#xD;

        established by the preliminary screening in the NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic,&#xD;
        based on review of medical record, history, clinical evaluation, and video tapes of an&#xD;
        attack.&#xD;

        washout period will be established dependant upon the individual drug. Subjects may be&#xD;
        admitted to the NIH if necessary. They will be asked to abstain from alcohol and caffeine&#xD;
        24 hours prior to the study as well.&#xD;

        Women who are pregnant or nursing. Female subjects of child bearing potential will have&#xD;
        specific interview and a pregnancy test prior to the study (before each imaging procedure&#xD;
        if required) to ensure that they are not pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any subject who is not capable of giving an informed consent. This will be determined at&#xD;
