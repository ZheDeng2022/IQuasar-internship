  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality among AIDS patients in the developing world. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of tuberculosis in HIV infected children is complicated by inefficient and&#xD;
      expensive tuberculosis tests and vague diagnostic criteria. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      accuracy and efficiency of several different tuberculosis tests that could be used in&#xD;
      developing countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection has been shown to increase mortality from tuberculosis (TB) fivefold in parts&#xD;
      of Subsaharan Africa. Increasingly, HIV infected children in developing countries are&#xD;
      becoming infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and dying at an early age. This&#xD;
      project will evaluate novel approaches to the diagnosis of AIDS-related pediatric TB in a&#xD;
      hyperendemic setting using rapid, cost-effective Mtb culture and susceptibility methods based&#xD;
      on direct microscopic observation techniques. This study will utilize alternative noninvasive&#xD;
      Mtb tests that are performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and stool. An optional&#xD;
      component will assess improved rapid detection of Mtb by a semi-nested polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction assay (N2 PCR), a technique appropriate for regional reference laboratories in&#xD;
      developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred-sixty children with clinically diagnosed pulmonary TB (including at least 100 HIV&#xD;
      infected children) from the Hospital del Nino, Lima, Peru, and 260 age-matched controls will&#xD;
      be enrolled in this study. Mtb will be detected in NPAs and stool by new and traditional&#xD;
      culture methods and by N2 PCR. Gastric aspirates from children with a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      TB will also be tested. Children with a positive N2 PCR but without clinical evidence of TB&#xD;
      requiring antituberculous therapy will be followed longitudinally.&#xD;
