    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who have&#xD;
      unresectable, recurrent or metastatic liver cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different&#xD;
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess response rate and progression free survival in patients with hepatocellular&#xD;
      cancer treated with oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the toxicity and tolerance of oxaliplatin in patient with hepatocellular&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the mRNA expression of enzymes in tumors of the patients entered on this&#xD;
      study which may be important to the cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin (ERCC1, mismatch repair,&#xD;
      ribonucleotide reductase, bcl-2, bax, p53). An attempt will be made to obtain tumor biopsies&#xD;
      from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presence of the&#xD;
      fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular cancer (yes vs no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed HCC which is recurrent, metastatic or&#xD;
             unresectable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have up to two prior chemotherapy regimes; in addition, they may have had&#xD;
             previous radiation, chemoembolization, and/or alcohol injections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as lesions that can be accurately&#xD;
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 20 mm with&#xD;
             conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm with spiral CT scan, and which has clearly&#xD;
             progressed during the observation interval prior to participation in this study;&#xD;
             pleural effusions and ascites will not be considered measurable, but may be present in&#xD;
             addition to the measurable lesion(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 70%; patients should have an expected survival of at&#xD;
             least 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/μl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/μl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/μl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 g/dl&#xD;

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 OR measured creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min for patients with&#xD;
             creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain metastasis is not an exclusion, however, patients are only eligible if they have&#xD;
             had successful control of the brain tumor(s) by surgery or stereotactic RT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with no evidence of clinically significant neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All prior therapy must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to the patient's&#xD;
             entry on this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of oxaliplatin on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason and because DNA alkylating agents are&#xD;
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because the risk of toxicity in nursing infants secondary to oxaliplatin treatment of&#xD;
             the mother is unknown but may be harmful, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with oxaliplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has prior oxaliplatin treatment or undergoing therapy with other&#xD;
             investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to platinum compounds or to antiemetics appropriate for&#xD;
             administration in conjunction with protocol-directed chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or unstable angina pectoris, or&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) are excluded from the&#xD;
             study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions&#xD;
