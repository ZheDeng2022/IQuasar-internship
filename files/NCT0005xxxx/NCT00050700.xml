  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to examine the role of certain&#xD;
      brain receptors and the nervous system chemical acetylcholine in major depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cholinergic system involves the regulation of neurotransmitters and the brain receptors&#xD;
      to which they bind. Evidence suggests that the cholinergic system may play a role in the&#xD;
      development of depression. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that binds to certain brain&#xD;
      receptors called muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Cholinomimetic drugs (drugs that stimulate&#xD;
      the cholinergic system) often exacerbate depressive symptoms in people with mood disorders&#xD;
      and in healthy individuals. This increase in depressive symptoms may be caused by stimulation&#xD;
      of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), but further study is needed to confirm this.&#xD;
      This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      to study the function of mAChRs in individuals with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will undergo a physical examination, psychiatric interviews,&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests, PET and MRI scans, and rating scales of depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      negative thinking symptoms. Questions about behavior and functioning will be asked and blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected for genetic analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Several paths of evidence converge in implicating a role for the cholinergic system in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of affective illness. In both unipolar depressed and euthymic bipolar&#xD;
      subjects, cholinomimetic drugs (i.e., muscarinic agonists, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors)&#xD;
      exacerbate depressive signs and symptoms such as dysphoria, psychomotor retardation,&#xD;
      impairment of attention and memory, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis hyperactivity and&#xD;
      sleep EEG abnormalities. In healthy subjects, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor&#xD;
      physostigmine elicits a range of depressive symptoms including dysphoria, anergia,&#xD;
      psychomotor slowing, emotional lability, sleep disturbances, memory and concentration&#xD;
      impairment, and with higher doses, tearfulness and depression. These effects have been shown&#xD;
      to reflect stimulation of muscarinic receptors. Cholinomimetics also exacerbate behavioral&#xD;
      despair in putative animal models of depression. Conversely, the anticholinergic agent&#xD;
      biperidine improved symptoms of depression in a placebo controlled study. Moreover,&#xD;
      muscarinic cholinomimetics and a choline rich nutrient, lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) exert&#xD;
      antimanic effects in bipolar subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially consistent with these observations, depressed subjects exhibit hypersensitivity&#xD;
      to cholinomimetic agents. Administration of muscarinic cholinergic agonists, ACh releasing&#xD;
      agents or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors induce exaggerated effects on REM density and&#xD;
      latency in depressed subjects than in healthy controls. In addition, both manic and depressed&#xD;
      bipolar subjects show increased pupillary sensitivity to the muscarinic cholinergic agonist&#xD;
      pilocarpine relative to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the data implicating the mAChR receptor system in mood disorders, no direct in vivo&#xD;
      investigations of the central mAChR have been performed in depressed subjects. A novel PET&#xD;
      radioligand, [(18)F]FP-TZTP was recently developed by Eckelman as a selective agonist of M(2)&#xD;
      receptors. Because the M(2) receptor functions predominately as a presynaptic&#xD;
      release-controlling autoreceptor, decreased distribution volume (V) of this receptor could&#xD;
      conceivably give rise to increased postsynaptic muscarinic receptor sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application proposes a pilot PET study of M(2) receptor distribution volume in currently&#xD;
      depressed subjects with major depressive disorder (n=30), currently depressed subjects with&#xD;
      bipolar disorder (n=30), and psychiatrically healthy controls (n=30). The proposed pilot&#xD;
      study will test the central hypothesis that M(2) receptor V is decreased in regions where&#xD;
      they are primarily located presynaptically in depressed subjects relative to healthy&#xD;
      controls. The proposed study will advance knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - MDD Depressed Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Thirty subjects (ages 18-45) male and female will be selected, with primary MDD currently&#xD;
        depressed as defined by DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MDD and current HDRS score in the&#xD;
        moderately-to-severely depressed range (greater than 18) and who have a first degree&#xD;
        relative with MDD but no first degree relatives with mania, alcoholism, or antisocial&#xD;
        personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - Bipolar Depressed Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Thirty subjects (ages 18-45) male and female will be selected who meet DSM-IV criteria for&#xD;
        bipolar I or II disorder and are currently depressed, with HDRS score in the&#xD;
        moderately-to-severely depressed range (greater than 18). Subjects may be inpatients or&#xD;
        outpatients. Because effective treatment will not be discontinued for the purposes of this&#xD;
        protocol, subjects will be identified who have never been treated or who have discontinued&#xD;
        medication due to lack of efficacy, noncompliance, physician order, or other reasons prior&#xD;
        to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - Healthy, Control Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Thirty subjects (ages 18-45) male and female who have not met criteria for any major&#xD;
        psychiatric disorder will be selected. From this large sample a control subject will be&#xD;
        matched to each depressed subject for age, gender, handedness and stage of menstrual cycle.&#xD;
        The control subjects will have no known first degree relatives with mood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have taken antidepressant or other medications likely to alter monoamine&#xD;
        neurochemistry or cerebrovascular function for at least 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine and&#xD;
        for any drug with known anticholinergic effects) prior to scanning. Because effective&#xD;
        medications will not be discontinued for the purposes of this study, subjects will be&#xD;
        identified who have never been treated or who have discontinued medication due to lack of&#xD;
        efficacy, noncompliance, physician order or other reasons prior to study entry. Subjects&#xD;
        will also be excluded if they: a) serious suidical ideation or behavior - 1) thoughts of&#xD;
        suicide within the past three months which are accompanied by intet to harm oneself,&#xD;
        serious consideration of means or plan to attempt suicide, evidence of arranging for a&#xD;
        suicide attemp (e.g. giving away prized possessions, updating a will) or clear desire to&#xD;
        commit suicide; 2) suicide attempts within the previous one year; or 3) a current plan to&#xD;
        inflict self harm or physical evidence suspicious for having engaged in a suicide attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will also be excluded if they had any significant comorbid condition in the last&#xD;
        year, c) psychosis to the extent that the ability to provide informed consent is in doubt,&#xD;
        d) history of any major psychiatric disorder (other than the target mood disorder) arising&#xD;
        temporally before the initial mood episode, e) medical or neurological illnesses (i.e.&#xD;
        seizure disorder, a coma in past) likely to affect physiology or anatomy, f) a history of&#xD;
        drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year or a lifetime history of alcohol or drug dependence&#xD;
        (DSM IV criteria), g) are HIV positive or have AIDS, h) current pregnancy (documented by&#xD;
        history and pregnancy testing prior to scanning), i) current breast feeding, j) general MRI&#xD;
        exclusion criteria which include the subject having a pacemaker or significant&#xD;
        claustrophobia and k) if they are smokers.&#xD;
