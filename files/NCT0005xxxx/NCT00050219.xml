      This study will examine the role of the brain chemical dopamine in people's response to&#xD;
      alcohol consumption. Dopamine is thought to influence whether people have a strong or weak&#xD;
      response to alcohol and how pleasurable that response is. The findings of this study may shed&#xD;
      light on why some people are at higher risk of developing problem drinking behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 25 years of age who have never had a serious problem&#xD;
      with alcohol abuse or drug abuse may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened&#xD;
      with a medical history and physical examination, and will be interviewed about their smoking&#xD;
      and drinking behaviors. Participants will undergo test procedures on two separate days, as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival at the Clinical Center, participants will take a breathalyzer test for alcohol&#xD;
      and provide a urine sample for a drug screen. Women will also have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
      They will then lie on a hospital bed and two intravenous catheters (IV lines) will be placed,&#xD;
      one into each arm. One line will be used to collect blood samples during the test session;&#xD;
      the other will be used to infuse alcohol into the bloodstream. The alcohol will rapidly&#xD;
      increase the blood alcohol level to between 0.06 and 0.08 grams per deciliter. (0.08 g/dL is&#xD;
      the level at which a person is charge with driving under the influence of alcohol in all&#xD;
      States.) Before, during, and after the infusion, subjects will be asked about their feelings&#xD;
      in response to the alcohol, such as confusion, elation, level of discomfort or dizziness,&#xD;
      ability to concentrate, and so forth. At 35 and 60 minutes after the infusion begins,&#xD;
      subjects will take a body sway test. This involves standing on a machine to determine how the&#xD;
      alcohol has affected the sense of balance. Subjects will then relax in the clinic for a few&#xD;
      hours. During this time, a blood sample will be collected and a questionnaire will be given&#xD;
      hourly until the blood alcohol level has gone down to 0.02 g/dL. When the alcohol level has&#xD;
      declined to 0.02 g/dL (usually 3 to 4 hours after the infusion), the subject will be sent&#xD;
      home in a taxi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will again take a breathalyzer test for alcohol and provide a urine sample for&#xD;
      drug screen and, for women, a pregnancy test. Subjects will lie on a hospital bed and three&#xD;
      IV lines will be inserted, one to draw blood samples, one to infuse alcohol, and one to give&#xD;
      raclopride, a radioactive substance used for positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. For&#xD;
      PET, the subject lies on a table in the scanner with a mask placed over his or her head to&#xD;
      help hold the head still during the scan. After a brief scan to adjust the machine, a small&#xD;
      amount of radioactive water (O-15 water) is injected through the IV line and a series of&#xD;
      pictures is taken over a period of about 1 minute. These images show how the radioactive&#xD;
      water distributes in the brain, indicating blood flow. After the water scan, raclopride is&#xD;
      given through the IV line and more pictures of the brain are taken over the next 2 hours.&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected during and after the raclopride scan. During this procedure,&#xD;
      subjects are asked the same questions about their feelings in response to the alcohol as they&#xD;
      did during the earlier session. After he scans, they will be monitored in the clinic with&#xD;
      hourly blood tests and questionnaires until the blood alcohol concentration decreases to 0.02&#xD;
      g/dL and will then be sent home in a taxi.&#xD;

      Some persons are more likely to develop alcoholism than others. Understanding the difference&#xD;
      between persons at high vs. low risk of developing alcoholism could be important for both&#xD;
      prevention and treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerance for the sedative effects of alcohol has been shown in young adults to predict&#xD;
      development of alcoholism later in life. The basis for this increased risk is unclear. It may&#xD;
      be that persons who tolerate alcohol well as young adults experience more of the rewarding&#xD;
      effects of alcohol (e.g., euphoria), or that they experience less of the negative effects of&#xD;
      alcohol (e.g., sedation), or some combination of the two. Fortunately, brain-imaging tools&#xD;
      can shed light on the brain's reward response mechanisms to alcohol. Differences in the&#xD;
      reward circuits of persons who experience a euphoric response to alcohol may help explain why&#xD;
      some people go on to develop alcoholism while others do not. Both human and animal research&#xD;
      point toward a difference in the density of dopamine receptors in the striatum of&#xD;
      alcohol-preferring and non alcohol-preferring subjects. The following experiment is designed&#xD;
      to examine the relationship between response to alcohol, dopamine receptor density in the&#xD;
      striatum, and dopamine release in response to alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose classification of subjects as 'low response' or 'high response' on the basis of&#xD;
      their level of response to a controlled alcohol challenge in the laboratory, using the&#xD;
      established methods of Schuckit et al to gather systematic data on subjects' response to&#xD;
      alcohol. Next, baseline levels of dopamine D2 receptor density in mesolimbic reward circuits&#xD;
      of subjects in each group would be assessed in the PET scanner by using the radioactive&#xD;
      dopamine antagonist C-11 raclopride. C-11 raclopride binds to D2 receptors, which will&#xD;
      provide a signal proportional to the number of D2 receptors present. This will allow us to&#xD;
      measure and compare the baseline D2 receptor density in high and low response groups.&#xD;
      Directly after obtaining this baseline D2 receptor measurement, we propose administration of&#xD;
      a controlled alcohol challenge. Acute alcohol administration causes release of dopamine in&#xD;
      the striatum, and can dislodge a portion of the C-11 raclopride that was bound to D2&#xD;
      receptors. This will allow us to compare high and low response groups for differences in the&#xD;
      displacement of C-11 raclopride induced by dopamine release, thereby providing a measure of&#xD;
      dopamine release in response to alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained will allow us to compare the response to alcohol of young adults who are&#xD;
      high vs. low responders. It will also permit comparison of these groups in terms of baseline&#xD;
      striatal dopamine receptor density and striatal dopamine release in response to alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this experiment may identify a physiological basis for the increased risk in some&#xD;
      young adults for development of alcoholism. It may also provide a model for further studies&#xD;
      of the relationship between response to alcohol, risk for developing alcoholism, and brain&#xD;
      reward mechanisms.&#xD;
