      This study will collect information on (tricks) patients with focal dystonia use to relieve&#xD;
      their symptoms. Dystonia is a movement disorder caused by sustained muscle contractions often&#xD;
      causing twisting and abnormal posturing. Dystonia may be generalized, affecting at least one&#xD;
      leg and the trunk of the body, segmental, affecting adjacent body parts, or focal, affecting&#xD;
      a single body part, such as the hand or eyelid. It may be task-specific, such as writer's,&#xD;
      musician's or sportsman's cramps. Some patients with focal dystonia use (tricks), such as&#xD;
      touching the face or hand, to stop or alleviate the abnormal movement. This study will survey&#xD;
      the types of tricks people with focal dystonia use in order to learn more about the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with focal dystonia may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened for eligibility with a medical history, clinical evaluation, and&#xD;
      review of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one 30- to 45-minute clinic visit, participants will be interviewed about their dystonia&#xD;
      symptoms and the tricks they use to relieve the symptoms. They may be asked to show the&#xD;
      investigators how the tricks work&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to collect and organize information concerning a phenomenon&#xD;
      known as 'sensory tricks' or Geste antagoniste in focal dystonia. Sensory tricks, which we&#xD;
      will refer to as 'tricks' since some involve motor as well as sensory input, are various&#xD;
      stimuli used by dystonic patients to transiently diminish their spasms (Jankovic and Fahn&#xD;
      1993). The phenomenon of tricks is evidence for the abnormality of sensorimotor integration&#xD;
      in focal dystonia, yet it is little studied or understood. A survey of the history and&#xD;
      characteristics of tricks will lead to a better understanding of this puzzling phenomenon,&#xD;
      and a step toward the understanding of the mechanism of focal dystonia.&#xD;
