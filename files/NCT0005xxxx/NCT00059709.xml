  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the language, reasoning, and social skills used by preschool and&#xD;
      elementary school children when they and their parents attempt to understand, conduct, and&#xD;
      resolve disputes in everyday family interaction. Families will be given conflict resolution&#xD;
      training designed to promote listening and speaking skills that result in more accurate&#xD;
      interpersonal and emotional understanding. The training may lower the emotional volatility of&#xD;
      family interaction, lower the rate of arguing and fighting between parents and children,&#xD;
      increase the rate and frequency of verbal negotiation, and encourage the adoption of conflict&#xD;
      strategies that focus on future-oriented behavior and positive outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 324 working class families, representative of the primary ethnic populations in&#xD;
      Chicago (African American, Caucasian, and Mexican American), will be selected for&#xD;
      participation. Both parents, one 4- to 6-year-old child, and one 6- to 8-year-old sibling&#xD;
      will participate. Single parent families will also be included; the parent will be asked to&#xD;
      nominate a second adult or an additional older sibling in place of the second parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each family proceeds through three phases. The initial phase allows assessment of conflict&#xD;
      histories, good times, self-appraisals of psychological well-being, affective and social&#xD;
      variables that operate within the family, and the family members' ability to discuss and&#xD;
      negotiate ongoing problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase, families are randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions.&#xD;
      One group is given conflict resolution training and then participates in a series of tasks&#xD;
      that focus on child-parent narration, negotiation, and negotiation assessments. A second&#xD;
      group participates in the same tasks without training. A third group undergoes only the&#xD;
      negotiation assessments. The effectiveness of the training will be evaluated by&#xD;
      experimentally assessing conflict resolution skills before and after training in both home&#xD;
      and school contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third phase is a six-month follow-up visit, during which parents and children are again&#xD;
      observed negotiating problems. Psychological well-being and affective feelings are once again&#xD;
      assessed. The study ends with a debriefing interview for the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 14 study visits. Each member in the family will also have four training&#xD;
      sessions. Visits are scheduled 3 to 4 times a month, depending on the family's availability.&#xD;
