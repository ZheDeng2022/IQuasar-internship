  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no proven effective treatment for chronic diarrhea caused by the parasite&#xD;
      Cryptosporidium in advanced AIDS. This trial will test the safety of interleukin-12 (IL-12)&#xD;
      as part of a combination therapy for this parasite.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cryptosporidium parvum can cause chronic diarrhea and biliary disease in people with AIDS,&#xD;
      resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Highly effective antiparasitic treatment&#xD;
      for this infection is not currently available. Paromomycin and azithromycin have some&#xD;
      efficacy and have been used in combination in a small number of patients. However, in&#xD;
      clinical trials of this drug combination, patients remained infected with the parasite&#xD;
      despite improvement of their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving the immune system with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been the&#xD;
      most effective therapy described for cryptosporidiosis (chronic infection with&#xD;
      Cryptosporidium parvum), with over 80% of patients showing improvement. However, immune&#xD;
      reconstitution is not possible in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interferon gamma expression is strongly associated with control of cryptosporidiosis. IL-12&#xD;
      stimulates interferon gamma, and IL-12 treatment has been shown to prevent cryptosporidiosis&#xD;
      in mice. This study will evaluate IL-12 in combination with standard therapy for&#xD;
      cryptosporidiosis in patients with AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose-escalation study. All patients will be treated with paromomycin and&#xD;
      azithromycin. The initial group will be treated with either 110 ng/kg IL-12 (6 patients) or&#xD;
      placebo injections (2 patients) twice a week for 4 weeks. If the initial dose is ineffective&#xD;
      and the combination of drugs is tolerated, a second group of patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      either 300 ng/kg IL-12 (6 patients) or placebo injections (2 patients) twice a week for 4&#xD;
      weeks. Patients will be evaluated for eradication of the parasite (as measured by&#xD;
      immunofluorescence and intestinal biopsy), decreases in stool frequency, decreases in 24 hour&#xD;
      stool volume, stimulation of intestinal Th1 cytokine production, increases in body weight,&#xD;
      improvements in Karnofsky score, and improvements in serum alkaline phosphatase levels and&#xD;
      transaminases (if elevated at baseline).&#xD;
