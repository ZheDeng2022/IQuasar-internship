    <textblock>
      This research study is to determine the safety and dosage of special cells that may make the&#xD;
      patients own immune system fight the leukemia. To do this we will put special genes into&#xD;
      cells called fibroblasts that we have grown in the laboratory from a skin sample. The genes&#xD;
      we put in these fibroblasts make them produce substances called CD40 Ligand (CD40L) and&#xD;
      interleukin-2 (IL-2). These are natural substances that may help the immune system kill&#xD;
      leukemia cells. Some of these fibroblasts producing CD40L and IL-2 mixed with a small&#xD;
      quantity of the leukemic cells will then be put back into the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of cancers in animals and in cell lines suggest that substances like CD40L and IL-2&#xD;
      when mixed with cancer cells do help the body to recognize and kill these cancer cells. A&#xD;
      treatment using IL-2 has been previously used in more than 40 children with neuroblastoma and&#xD;
      similar treatments are being used in adults with other cancers. Some of the patients have&#xD;
      shown significant tumor responses. However, we do not know if this treatment will work and we&#xD;
      do not know the right amount of each of the special cells to use, so different patients will&#xD;
      get different combination and numbers of cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn the side effects and safe dosage of these special&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Before starting in the treatment part of this study, leukemia cells and skin fibroblasts will&#xD;
      be collected from the patient - called &quot;procurement&quot; - to allow us to make the vaccine. These&#xD;
      leukemia cells are taken from either peripheral blood, leukopheresis product or bone marrow.&#xD;
      The fibroblasts will be prepared in the laboratory with specially produced human viruses&#xD;
      (adenoviruses) that carry the IL-2 or the CD40L gene. The viruses will &quot;drop off&quot; the genes&#xD;
      inside the fibroblasts. The CD40L and IL-2 genes are meant to help stimulate the immune&#xD;
      system to fight the leukemia. The modified fibroblasts will be injected with a number of&#xD;
      leukemic cells under the skin. All the cells will be irradiated before injection to stop them&#xD;
      growing. Patients will receive three shots. Depending on the response, patients may be able&#xD;
      to have three additional shots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to collect the skin fibroblasts at the very beginning of the study, and then during&#xD;
      the study, we will perform small skin biopsies. In particular before the second shot, and&#xD;
      then again about 1 week later, we will look for both the modified and leukemia cells that&#xD;
      have been re-injected under the skin. We will do this by taking a skin biopsy from the place&#xD;
      where the cells were injected. The area where the skin biopsy will be obtained will be&#xD;
      sterilized and then numbed with a local acting agent. The skin will be removed with a &quot;tissue&#xD;
      punch&quot; which will cut a circle of approximately 1/4th of an inch into the skin. The site&#xD;
      where the skin was removed will be closed with suture, tape or stitches. The area will be&#xD;
      covered with dry gauze and adhesive tape. These tests are to see whether the shots are&#xD;
      killing leukemia cells and to make sure leukemia cells are not growing at the injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how the immunity is working in the system, we will take blood samples before first&#xD;
      injection, then weekly for 10 weeks, on week 12, once a month for a year, and then eventually&#xD;
      once a year for fifteen years. These samples will be approximately 1 tablespoons of blood,&#xD;
      which is considered a safe amount. If the patient has additional injections, blood will be&#xD;
      drawn prior to each injection. Additional office visits may be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, patients will need to have a bone marrow test before enrolling on the study and at week&#xD;
      12. If the patient is not responding, they may have treatment with other chemotherapy or&#xD;
      radiation. Patients will need to come to the clinic on the days of blood drawing and to be&#xD;
      seen at Texas Children's Cancer Center/The Methodist Hospital at weekly intervals for 10&#xD;
      weeks, then every other week for 6 weeks, and then monthly for a year. Thereafter, patients&#xD;
      will either be seen in the clinic or contacted by one of the research staff working on this&#xD;
      study once a year for 15 years. Additional visits may be necessary.&#xD;
