      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy and either&#xD;
      capecitabine or fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin and comparing them to see how well&#xD;
      they work when given before surgery in treating patients with resectable rectal cancer. It is&#xD;
      not yet known whether radiation therapy and either capecitabine or fluorouracil is more&#xD;
      effective with or without oxaliplatin in treating rectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the rate of local-regional relapse in patients with resectable rectal cancer&#xD;
           treated with chemoradiotherapy comprising radiation therapy and either capecitabine or&#xD;
           fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the rate of clinical complete response in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the rate of pathologic complete response in patients treated with these&#xD;
           regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the increase in the number of patients who are able to undergo&#xD;
           sphincter-saving surgery after treatment with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate genetic patterns and the presence or absence of specific tissue biomarkers&#xD;
           with response and prognosis in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare preoperative quality of life (QOL) of patients treated with oral capecitabine&#xD;
           versus continuous infusion with fluorouracil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the impact of oxaliplatin on neurotoxicity in patients treated with these&#xD;
           regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the convenience of care in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the impact of the type of surgical management on QOL at 1 and 5 years&#xD;
           postoperatively in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the long-term impact of cancer treatment on symptoms (e.g., vitality and&#xD;
           neurotoxicity) and QOL at 5 years after randomization (5-year follow-up visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      participating center, gender, clinical tumor stage (stage II vs stage III), and surgical&#xD;
      intent (sphincter saving vs non-sphincter saving). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously and undergo radiotherapy once daily&#xD;
           5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: Patients receive fluorouracil and undergo radiotherapy as in arm 1. Patients also&#xD;
           receive oxaliplatin IV over 1 hour once weekly for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo radiotherapy once&#xD;
           daily 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 4: Patients receive capecitabine and undergo radiotherapy as in arm 3. Patients also&#xD;
           receive oxaliplatin as in arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 6-8 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients with responding or&#xD;
      stable disease undergo surgery. Patients with progressive disease are treated at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator and continue to be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at completion of chemoradiotherapy, and at 1 and 5&#xD;
      years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,606 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.&#xD;
