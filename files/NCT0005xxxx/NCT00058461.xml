  <brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy and Rituximab in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase II Study of Rituximab (IND #7028) and Ifosfamide, Carboplatin and Etoposide (ICE) Chemotherapy in Children With Recurrent/Refractory B-cell (CD20+) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well rituximab together with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and&#xD;
      etoposide works in treating young patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs, such as ifosfamide,&#xD;
      carboplatin, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they&#xD;
      stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and&#xD;
      either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.&#xD;
      Combining ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with ifosfamide, carboplatin,&#xD;
      and etoposide combined with rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the relapse-free survival rate of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients, specifically the&#xD;
      frequency of therapy delays between courses due to prolonged grade IV hematologic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether this regimen plus filgrastim (G-CSF) will result in mobilization of&#xD;
      greater than 2 X 10^6/kg peripheral blood stem cells (CD34+ cells, PBSC) in at least 80% of&#xD;
      patients for whom peripheral stem cell collection is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the time course of engraftment for patients who undergo peripheral stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation after collection of stem cells using this mobilization regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by disease (B-cell large cell&#xD;
      lymphoma or atypical precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma vs small non-cleaved cell&#xD;
      lymphoma or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 2 hours and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 3-5,&#xD;
      rituximab IV on days 1 and 3, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 3. Patients receive&#xD;
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood&#xD;
      counts recover. Patients also receive intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy comprising methotrexate&#xD;
      and cytarabine. Patients with B-cell large cell lymphoma and negative CSF cytology receive IT&#xD;
      chemotherapy on day 3 of the first course only. Patients with small non-cleaved cell lymphoma&#xD;
      or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and negative CSF cytology receive IT chemotherapy on&#xD;
      day 3. All patients with positive CSF cytology receive IT chemotherapy on days 3, 10, and 17&#xD;
      of the first and second courses. Treatment repeats every 23 days for up to 3 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42-82 patients (21-41 per disease stratum) will be accrued for&#xD;
      this study within 2-4 years.&#xD;
