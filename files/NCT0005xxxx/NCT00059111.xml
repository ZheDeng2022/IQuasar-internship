      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important clinical disorder occurring in men, women, and&#xD;
      children with a prevalence of 4 percent, 2 percent and 1-3 percent, respectively. OSA is&#xD;
      under active study in adults and is definitely linked with increased cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity, even in its mild to moderate clinical forms. In contrast, OSA has not been well&#xD;
      studied in children and the potential deleterious consequences on cardiovascular function&#xD;
      have received little or no attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will examine in children 1) The interaction between OSA and baroreflex dysfunction,&#xD;
      2) The relation of OSA severity and baroreflex dysfunction to abnormalities in blood pressure&#xD;
      control during wakefulness and sleep, 3) The association of the diminished baroreflex gain&#xD;
      and impaired blood pressure control with an index of end organ damage, the left ventricular&#xD;
      mass index, and 4) Whether effective treatment of OSA results in significant improvement in&#xD;
      baroreceptor function, blood pressure control and a decrease in left ventricular mass index.&#xD;
      A cross-sectional study will be conducted in 8-12 year old children with OSA and a matched&#xD;
      group of normal children. Studies include baroreceptor function, 24-hour ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure and left ventricular mass index. Baroreceptor function will be measured by&#xD;
      non-invasive techniques based on combined computer analysis of heart rate and blood pressure&#xD;
      measured by portapres. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure will be measured by a Spacelab&#xD;
      monitor and left ventricular mass index will be measured by direct M-mode echocardiogram. A&#xD;
      longitudinal study will be conducted on the effect of adequate treatment of OSA on&#xD;
      baroreceptor function, daytime and nocturnal blood pressure and left ventricular mass index.&#xD;
      A cohort of children with OSA and a matched group of normal controls will be followed for a&#xD;
      period of 12 months after treatment of the disorder. Results are expected to show that&#xD;
      children with OSA have decreased baroreceptor sensitivity, elevated nocturnal blood pressure&#xD;
      and increased left ventricular mass index and that effective therapy for OSA, as determined&#xD;
      by polysomnography, will improve or normalize baroreceptor sensitivity as well as nocturnal&#xD;
      blood pressures and will lead to a decrease in left ventricular mass index.&#xD;
