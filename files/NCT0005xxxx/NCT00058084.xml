  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying ixabepilone to see how well it works compared to&#xD;
      mitoxantrone and prednisone in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer that has not&#xD;
      responded to paclitaxel, docetaxel, or hormone therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Some tumors&#xD;
      become resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Ixabepilone may reduce resistance to the drugs and&#xD;
      allow the tumor cells to be killed. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more&#xD;
      effective in treating metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the efficacy of ixabepilone (BMS-247550) vs mitoxantrone and prednisone, in&#xD;
      terms of decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, in patients with&#xD;
      taxane-resistant, hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety of these regimens in these patients. II. Determine the objective&#xD;
      response rate in patients with measurable disease who are treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the clinical activity of each of these regimens after crossover in patients&#xD;
      who experience disease progression on their originally assigned treatment arm and switch to&#xD;
      the other treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, crossover, multicenter study. Patients are stratified&#xD;
      according to ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 or 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive ixabepilone (BMS-247550) IV over 3 hours on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive mitoxantrone IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and oral prednisone twice&#xD;
      daily on days 1-21.In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who progress while on treatment after at least 2 courses or discontinue treatment&#xD;
      for any other reason may cross over to the other arm and receive treatment as above,&#xD;
      beginning within 12 weeks of last study treatment on original arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
