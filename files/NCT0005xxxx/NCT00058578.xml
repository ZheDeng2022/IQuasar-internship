  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Sclerosis is a disease that may be caused by the immune system reacting against skin&#xD;
      and certain organs. It is possible, that by changing the immune system we can modify the&#xD;
      progression of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cells are created in the bone marrow. They mature into different types of blood cells&#xD;
      that are needed including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. In this study,&#xD;
      we will stimulate the bone marrow to make extra stem cells. Next we will collect the stem&#xD;
      cells, select specific cells, and store them. We will then give high dose chemotherapy that&#xD;
      will destroy the patients immune system. We will then give back the selected stem cells we&#xD;
      collected. We believe that these selected stem cells may be able to &quot;re-create&quot; the immune&#xD;
      system without the portion that causes Systemic Sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to try to discover if stem cell transplantation can help&#xD;
      patients with Systemic Sclerosis. We will also try to learn what the side effects are of this&#xD;
      treatment in patients with Systemic Sclerosis. We hope that this treatment will help to&#xD;
      relieve the symptoms patients are experiencing, although we do not know if it will.&#xD;

      Before the transplant the research participant will receive daily G-CSF (Neupogen) for 5-6&#xD;
      days. This medication will help to stimulate the production of white blood cells (WBC) that&#xD;
      will be used for the stem cell transplant. The G-CSF will be given as an injection into the&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If G-CSF does not stimulate the stem cells sufficiently, the patient will receive a single&#xD;
      dose of drug called cyclophosphamide (chemotherapy) intravenously (into a vein). This drug&#xD;
      will cause the blood cell counts to fall. A drug called MESNA will also be given to help&#xD;
      protect the bladder from the Cyclophosphamide. After completing chemotherapy, patients will&#xD;
      be started on G-CSF again until blood cell counts reach a certain level, at which time the&#xD;
      patient will undergo leukopheresis. Leukopheresis is a procedure where blood is removed from&#xD;
      one arm, pumped into a machine where the white blood cells are separated from most of the&#xD;
      other cells and then returned through the same needle or through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
      This procedure usually takes 3 to 4 hours a day for up to 4 days in a row, depending on how&#xD;
      many cells are collected each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collection of the white blood cells, special agents (called monoclonal antibodies) will&#xD;
      be used in the laboratory to select out certain types of white blood cells (CD34+ cells). The&#xD;
      blood cells will be separated on a machine which picks out stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After leukopheresis, patients will receive drugs called cyclophosphamide and Mesna. They will&#xD;
      also receive a drug called Atgam and radiation treatment to the entire body. This treatment&#xD;
      will kill most of the blood forming cells in the bone marrow. We will then give the CD34+&#xD;
      cells that were collected during leukopheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the transplant patients will be followed closely, the same as any patient who receives&#xD;
      a stem cell transplant. This follow-up will involve blood tests to see how the body is&#xD;
      recovering after the chemotherapy and radiation, and a bone marrow aspiration once a year for&#xD;
      2 years.&#xD;
