      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure (HF) is designated as an emerging epidemic. Yet, it is not fully characterized.&#xD;
      Most data, derived from hospital discharges, cannot measure incidence, have uncertain&#xD;
      validity and cannot capture the full burden of heart failure because of the shift towards&#xD;
      outpatient care. Regarding its etiology, the respective role of hypertension and coronary&#xD;
      heart disease (CHD) is controversial. Moreover, the prevalence of obesity and diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus is increasing, both conditions linked to heart failure via several mechanisms such&#xD;
      that their contribution to heart failure could conceivably be increasing but remains to be&#xD;
      examined. Finally, while the existence of diastolic heart failure is recognized, its&#xD;
      diagnosis is exclusionary based on symptoms of heart failure in the absence of left&#xD;
      ventricular systolic dysfunction. This approach is unsatisfactory, thus the contribution of&#xD;
      diastolic heart failure to heart failure remains contentious. These striking gaps in&#xD;
      knowledge underscore the necessity of a rigorous investigation of the heart failure epidemic.&#xD;
      Through surveillance of the Olmsted County community, previous studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      postponement of coronary heart disease towards older ages and the decline over time in the&#xD;
      severity of hospitalized myocardial infarction and the incidence of heart failure after&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. This implies that, if coronary heart disease is the main cause of&#xD;
      heart failure, heart failure should be postponed towards older ages and its incidence rate&#xD;
      relatively stable. During the same period, preliminary findings on heart failure surveillance&#xD;
      suggest that the incidence of first clinical diagnosis of heart failure may not be increasing&#xD;
      as much as implied by hospital discharges and that adverse trends may be occurring&#xD;
      preferentially among younger ages. These data from the same community are challenging to&#xD;
      reconcile with the concept of an ongoing major contribution of coronary heart disease to an&#xD;
      epidemic of heart failure, thereby underscoring the need to rigorously study the epidemiology&#xD;
      of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has three specific aims and uses a community surveillance approach which is&#xD;
      integrated with ongoing work on coronary heart disease surveillance to investigate the heart&#xD;
      failure epidemic in Olmsted County by characterizing its magnitude and determinants and&#xD;
      studying prospectively the contribution of diastolic heart failure. Aim 1 will estimate the&#xD;
      secular trends in the incidence and in the outcome of validated heart failure to test the&#xD;
      hypotheses that there has been an increase in the incidence of heart failure, which differs&#xD;
      by age and sex and that the survival of heart failure improved while hospitalization for&#xD;
      heart failure has increased. Aim 2 will use a case-control approach to characterize the&#xD;
      etiology of heart failure and its changes over time and to test the hypotheses that coronary&#xD;
      heart disease and hypertension confer an excess risk of heart failure, the magnitude of which&#xD;
      is declining over time, that obesity and diabetes mellitus confer an excess risk of heart&#xD;
      failure the magnitude of which is increasing and that the population attributable risk of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease and hypertension for heart failure is declining, while that of obesity&#xD;
      and diabetes mellitus is increasing over time. Aim 3 will prospectively characterize the&#xD;
      contribution of diastolic heart failure to heart failure using brain natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      (BNP) among persons with heart failure and define the prognostic value of BNP in all cases of&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;
