    <textblock>
      This study will explore how babies become able to use their experience with objects to plan&#xD;
      to manipulate them appropriately. For example, an adult knows that picking up a grocery bag&#xD;
      full of canned food requires different actions than are needed for lifting an empty bag. This&#xD;
      study will examine when and how infants first begin to adapt their actions to manipulate&#xD;
      specific objects that weigh different amounts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include normal healthy babies within 2 weeks of their first birthday. If&#xD;
      the expected results are obtained from testing, 9-month-old children will then be studied to&#xD;
      identify a lower age boundary in task performance. If the expected results are not obtained&#xD;
      at the 12-month test age, older children will be recruited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves one 30-minute session with the baby and his or her mother or father. The&#xD;
      parent will answer some questions about the family, such as its size and ethnic make-up. The&#xD;
      infant will then have small magnetic sensors taped to the underside of each arm and to the&#xD;
      back. While sitting on the parent s lap, the infant will be presented with plastic toys, and&#xD;
      his or her actions will be measured by the sensors as he or she reaches for and picks up the&#xD;
      toys. The sensors will be connected to a computer that will track and record the motion of&#xD;
      the infant s arms.&#xD;

      The major objective of this research is to better understand the functional significance of&#xD;
      object categorization in early development. The proposed work is designed to examine the&#xD;
      emergence of infants ability to access internal categorical representations in service of&#xD;
      planning actions on the external environment. Representation, in this capacity, refers simply&#xD;
      to stored information that can influence later behavior. Categorization refers to the&#xD;
      treatment of discriminable objects as equivalent in some way. Even very young infants appear&#xD;
      able to visually categorize diverse sets of discriminable patterns or objects, and can form&#xD;
      internal representations of such bounded collections. Much less is known, however, about&#xD;
      infants ability to actually utilize such representations in the guidance of goal directed&#xD;
      action. The present research is designed to characterize the functional and behavioral&#xD;
      significance of object representations in infancy, focusing particularly on categorically&#xD;
      organized representations. The primary research strategy to be used consists of analyzing&#xD;
      infants examination and manipulation of novel objects that vary both in visual (i.e., shape&#xD;
      and color) as well as nonvisual dimensions (i.e., weight). In a laboratory procedure,&#xD;
      twelve-month old infants will explore novel objects of different weights, and their&#xD;
      subsequent handling of modified test objects will be measured with an electronic motion&#xD;
      analysis system. Kinematic analyses of infants actions on the test objects will reveal how&#xD;
      these actions were prepared in relation to their previous experience with similar objects.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Infants will be selected for inclusion in each study on the basis of age, gestational&#xD;
        status (i.e., full-term vs. pre-term birth), visual normality, and general health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The initial group will be recruited to participate within two weeks on either side of their&#xD;
        first birthday (12 months of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Equal numbers of males and females will be recruited to participate. If the sample&#xD;
        participating in either experiment fails to perform in the manner expected, additional&#xD;
        participants will be recruited at older test ages to identify when in the course of&#xD;
        development such behavioral guidance emerges. As successive test ages will be separated by&#xD;
        6 month intervals, independent samples of 18-, then 24-month-old children will be recruited&#xD;
        until the expected pattern of adaptive actions is observed (cf. Fossberg, et al., 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Infants with a gestational age of less than 36 weeks, and/or those with histories of severe&#xD;
        perinatal complications, visual abnormalities, or congenital developmental disorders will&#xD;
        not be recruited for participation.&#xD;
