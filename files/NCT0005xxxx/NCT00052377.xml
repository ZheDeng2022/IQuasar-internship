    <textblock>
      Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining interleukin-12 with interleukin-2 in&#xD;
      treating patients who have mycosis fungoides. Biological therapies, such as interleukin-12&#xD;
      and interleukin-2, use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells&#xD;
      from growing. Combining more than one biological therapy may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate (complete and partial) in patients with mycosis fungoides&#xD;
      treated with interleukin-12 (IL-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the frequency of refractory disease in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the&#xD;
      feasibility and dose-limiting toxic effects (DLT) of interleukin-2 (IL-2) when administered&#xD;
      with IL-12 in patients who have not shown disease progression after 12 weeks of IL-12 and in&#xD;
      those who have shown disease progression after 12 weeks of IL-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose of IL-2 when administered with&#xD;
      IL-12 in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine immune and cytokine response over time in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Determine the frequency of improved clinical response in patients treated with this&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Determine the biologic correlates of response, including levels of interferon gamma&#xD;
      production, natural killer cell activity, infiltration of skin lesions by CD8-positive cells,&#xD;
      lymphocyte IL-12 receptor expression, signal transducers and activators of transcription&#xD;
      protein levels and IL-12 signal transduction, and induction of apoptosis in tumor cells in&#xD;
      the skin of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of interleukin-2 (IL-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) subcutaneously (SC) twice weekly for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease is assessed at 13 weeks. Patients who do not have progressive disease also receive&#xD;
      IL-2 SC 3 consecutive days a week during weeks 13-24. Patients with progressive disease at&#xD;
      week 13 receive IL-2 SC at a fixed dose during weeks 13-24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with responding disease after week 24 may continue to receive IL-2 and IL-12 for&#xD;
      another 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-2 until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The recommended dose (RD) is the dose preceding&#xD;
      the MTD. Additional patients are treated at the RD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 28 months.&#xD;
