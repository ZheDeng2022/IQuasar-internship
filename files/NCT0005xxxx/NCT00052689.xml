  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of bortezomib with or without&#xD;
      gemcitabine in treating patients who have metastatic pancreatic cancer. Bortezomib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or&#xD;
      die. Combining bortezomib with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the objective response rate in previously untreated patients with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with bortezomib with or without gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. III. Compare the&#xD;
      progression-free, 6-month, and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Compare the change in overall quality of life (QOL) and in subcomponents of QOL of&#xD;
      patients after treatment with 2 consecutive courses of these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Patients with&#xD;
      progressive disease crossover to arm II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive bortezomib as in arm I and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1&#xD;
      and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Courses in both arms repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life (QOL) is assessed at baseline and before courses 2 and 4. Patients who&#xD;
      crossover to arm II from arm I complete QOL questionnaires before the first 2 courses of arm&#xD;
      II therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.&#xD;
