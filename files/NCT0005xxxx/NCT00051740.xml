      This study will compare Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) to minimal schizophrenia&#xD;
      treatment. This study will also determine whether the intensity of CAT can be reduced and&#xD;
      still provide benefits to patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many schizophrenia patients have serious difficulties that affect their quality of life.&#xD;
      Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) may improve adaptive functioning, quality of life, and&#xD;
      rates of relapse in schizophrenia patients. CAT, which involves compensatory strategies or&#xD;
      environmental supports, is tailored to each individual and is based on executive functioning&#xD;
      levels and other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to CAT, Minimal Environmental Supports (MES), or treatment&#xD;
      as usual for 2 years. Participants receiving CAT will have a trained therapist make weekly&#xD;
      visits to their home for 9 months. Over the following 3 months, the frequency of CAT visits&#xD;
      will be slowly reduced to once a month. For the remaining 12 months of treatment, patients&#xD;
      receive CAT only once a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the MES group receive a generic set of supplies and equipment&#xD;
      (calendar, alarm clock, watch, bus passes, etc.) at the beginning of the 2-year period. Each&#xD;
      month, the supplies are replenished as necessary during the patient's scheduled clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all groups, assessments of adaptive function and quality of life occur at study start and&#xD;
      at 3, 6, 9, 18, and 24 months.&#xD;
