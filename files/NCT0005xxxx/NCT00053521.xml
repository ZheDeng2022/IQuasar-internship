      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the genetic basis of common multifactorial diseases such as cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD) remains an elusive goal, but the great advances in molecular genetic&#xD;
      technology, statistical genetic methods, and phenotypic assessment of CVD risk factors in&#xD;
      recent years have facilitated more sophisticated genetic studies of risks for heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a follow-up to one conducted in the 1970's and 1980's. The availability of 5&#xD;
      large kindreds first identified and recruited as part of the &quot;High Blood Pressure in the&#xD;
      Young&quot; program is an important resource. The investigators have an extensive array of&#xD;
      baseline data that was collected in the late 1970s and early 1980s on 750 participants&#xD;
      stemming from that project, although some data are available only on a subset of&#xD;
      participants. The present study population centers on 764 individuals in five large,&#xD;
      multigenerational, extended families (four white and one African-American) originally&#xD;
      examined 25 years ago. Data collected from the original participants include hundreds of&#xD;
      biochemical, medical, physiological, behavioral, physical, psychological, genetic and&#xD;
      demographic traits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of four specific aims: 1) Collect 25-year follow-up data from&#xD;
      approximately 500 of the original participants, and new data from approximately 500 of their&#xD;
      relatives not examined in the original study. The cardiovascular disease risk factor&#xD;
      phenotypes to be collected include hemodynamic measures, carotid intima-media thickness, and&#xD;
      measures of cardiopulmonary function. 2) Obtain DNA samples from these 1,000 individuals and&#xD;
      use modern high-throughput molecular genotyping methods to create a 10 cM genetic marker map.&#xD;
      3) Quantify and characterize the nature of genetic influences on CVD risk factors using&#xD;
      quantitative genetic methods suited for cross-sectional and serial (follow-up) data from&#xD;
      relatives in large extended families. 4) Conduct linkage analyses to identify chromosomal&#xD;
      regions (QTLs) harboring genes that influence individual variation in cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      risk factors. Following these linkage analyses, the investigators will examine more closely&#xD;
      the strongest linkage signals with fine mapping linkage analysis in order to narrow&#xD;
      chromosomal regions of interest. The study is a collaboration between Wright State University&#xD;
      and the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research.&#xD;
