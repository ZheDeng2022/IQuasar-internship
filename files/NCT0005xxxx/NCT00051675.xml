      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and tolerability of a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody administered subcutaneously in the treatment of advanced cancers of the&#xD;
      ovary, breast, lung, prostate, colon or rectum that are either refractory to standard&#xD;
      therapies or for which therapies that may potentially be of major benefit do not exist.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has adenocarcinomas of the ovary, breast, lung, prostate, colon or rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has an advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma that is either refractory to&#xD;
             standard therapies or for which therapies that may potentially be of major benefit do&#xD;
             not exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has measurable lesions. Subjects with prostate cancer can have non-measurable&#xD;
             lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject may have prior radiation therapy if completed at least four weeks prior to&#xD;
             study entry, the subject has recovered from the acute toxicities of that therapy, and&#xD;
             measurable lesions are in a non-irradiated area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject may have prior chemotherapy, cytokine therapy or immunotherapy if completed at&#xD;
             least four weeks prior to study entry and the subject has recovered from the acute&#xD;
             toxicities of that therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with tumors responsive to hormone therapy may have prior hormonal therapy if&#xD;
             completed at least four weeks prior to study entry. Hormonal therapy for prostate&#xD;
             cancer may be continued but must not have been changed less than four weeks prior to&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has a performance status of 0 to 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
             (ECOG) scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has an estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject is at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has adequate organ function defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hematologic:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Platelets 100 × 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Total WBC count 3.5 × 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  PT/INR and PTT are within institutional limits in subjects who are not&#xD;
                       receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or low dose anticoagulants to maintain&#xD;
                       venous catheter patency (subjects on anti-coagulant therapy are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Bilirubin 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) 3 times the&#xD;
                       upper limit of normal (AST and ALT 5 times the upper limit of normal is&#xD;
                       acceptable if liver has tumor involvement and the elevation is due to tumor&#xD;
                       involvement)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal: Serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pancreatic: Amylase and lipase upper limit of the normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Signed informed consent form.&#xD;

             contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Subject is known to be HIV+ or to have any other recognized immunodeficiency disease.&#xD;
             (Note: As the mechanism of action of ING-1(heMAb) is ADCC, subjects need to be&#xD;
             immunocompetent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has a history of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies or antibody fragments. (Note: For subjects who have received prior&#xD;
             ING-1(heMAb), the HAHA titer should be negative.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has concurrent or prior malignancy, except for adequately-treated basal cell&#xD;
             or squamous cell skin cancer, adequately-treated non-invasive carcinomas or other&#xD;
             cancer from which the subject has been disease-free for at least two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has an active auto-immune disease requiring chronic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject is using or has used immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine, ACTH or&#xD;
             corticosteroids within four weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Subject has a history of alcoholism or chronic pancreatitis or a family history of&#xD;
             acute or chronic pancreatitis.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Subject has a history of gall bladder disease or gallstones (post-cholecystectomy&#xD;
             subjects are allowed).&#xD;
