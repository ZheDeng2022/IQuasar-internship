  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind placebo controlled clinical study designed to determine the effects of&#xD;
      leptin on the changes that occur in the body during weight loss achieved by a very low&#xD;
      calorie diet.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leptin is a hormone that is produced by the fat tissue and acts on the brain. Leptin plays a&#xD;
      key role in regulating energy balance and body weight in animals and in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a person loses weight, leptin concentration in the blood is reduced. Reduction in blood&#xD;
      leptin levels has been found to be related to a decreased metabolic rate (the rate in which&#xD;
      the body burns its calories), an increased appetite, and to many other physiological and&#xD;
      hormonal changes that may lead to failure in dieting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed to test if maintaining leptin in the pre-diet level range will ameliorate&#xD;
      the changes that occur in the body during weight loss. If these changes are reduced, the&#xD;
      process of weight loss could be easier and faster when adhering to a low calorie diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, leptin or placebo is administered by an injection under the skin, in a way&#xD;
      that is similar to injections of insulin to diabetic patients. 50% of the subjects&#xD;
      participating in the study are treated by leptin and 50% are treated by placebo. Blood leptin&#xD;
      levels are maintained in the pre-diet range in leptin treated subjects by leptin treatment.&#xD;
      Subjects treated by placebo will also lose weight if they adhere to the liquid diet provided&#xD;
      by the Rockefeller University Bio-nutrition Department. The investigators and the&#xD;
      participants don't know if leptin or placebo are used since this is a double blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To participate in this study, subjects have to stay at the Rockefeller University Hospital as&#xD;
      inpatients for about two months and continue the study as outpatients for 4 more months.&#xD;
      During the outpatient period, subjects have to attend a clinic visit once a week. During the&#xD;
      first 3 weeks of the study, subjects are introduced to a weight stabilization liquid diet.&#xD;
      During this time, the initial weight is maintained and baseline study tests are performed.&#xD;
      When testing is completed, a very low calorie liquid diet and leptin or placebo&#xD;
      administration are initiated. Weight is monitored until 10% weight loss is achieved. At this&#xD;
      time, a second testing period is performed in an inpatient setting. When testing is&#xD;
      completed, weight loss and leptin or placebo treatment continue at home in an outpatient&#xD;
      setting until 20% weight loss is achieved. When this period is completed, a third testing&#xD;
      period is performed in an inpatient setting. The last month of the study is dedicated to a&#xD;
      transition from the liquid diet to solid food, and to weight maintenance education provided&#xD;
      by the hospital staff in an outpatient setting. A solid food weight maintenance diet is&#xD;
      provided to participants during this period. At the end of this period, two days of testing&#xD;
      are performed and leptin/placebo administration is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study testing periods are performed over 12 days in an inpatient setting and include a&#xD;
      variety of blood draws, urine collection, and metabolic and behavioral tests that are known&#xD;
      to be affected by weight loss.&#xD;
