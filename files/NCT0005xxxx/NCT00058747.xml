    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, exploratory, open-label study of the investigational product AG-858, in&#xD;
      patients who are cytogenetically positive after treatment with Gleevec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of three independent Phase II evaluations of patient groups according&#xD;
      to their cytogenetic status as defined in the eligibility criteria (Eligibility Criteria 4a,&#xD;
      4b, and 4c).&#xD;

      The goals of this study are to determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the proportion of patients with a complete cytogenetic response (CCR) within&#xD;
           each patient group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the proportion of patients with a substantial molecular response (SMR)&#xD;
           within each patient group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the frequency and severity of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the feasibility of AG-858 production.&#xD;

             phase&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a complete hematologic response&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have received Gleevec™, IFN-α, cytarabine, busulfan, hydroxyurea,&#xD;
