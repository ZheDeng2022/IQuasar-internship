      The purpose of this study is to determine if E7070 is a safe and effective treatment for&#xD;
      cancer of the kidneys.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 2% of all cancers and its incidence is&#xD;
      increasing with worldwide deaths of over 100,000 patients per year. About 50% of RCC patients&#xD;
      have inoperable or metastatic disease that surgery cannot be performed on. RCC is also&#xD;
      considered to be resistant to both radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of E7070 by assessing progression free&#xD;
      survival, tumor response rate, duration of response/stable disease, and survival time. E7070&#xD;
      will be administered as a single iv infusion over 60 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle. Patients&#xD;
      will continue treatment with E7070 until they no longer have clinical benefit and have&#xD;
      disease progression, or toxicity leads to patient withdrawal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;=18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have histologically/cytologically confirmed clear cell RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously untreated or one prior treatment with immunotherapy (one prior treatment&#xD;
             may be represented by single agent interferon, single agent interleukin-2 or a&#xD;
             combination of interferon with interleukin-2 with or without accompanying&#xD;
             hematological growth factors).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented evidence of progressive disease in the previous 3 months. In the absence of&#xD;
             radiographic studies, patients may be entered on the study if they have clinical&#xD;
             evidence of progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have at least one unidimensional measurable lesion of RCC according to the RECIST&#xD;
             guidelines. The following will not qualify as measurable lesions: bone, leptomeningeal&#xD;
             disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal&#xD;
             masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, and cystic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be ambulatory and have a Karnofsky performance status &gt;=70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Give written informed consent prior to any study-specific screening procedures, with&#xD;
             the understanding that the consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without&#xD;
             prejudice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Woman who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential with either a&#xD;
             positive pregnancy test at screening or no pregnancy test. Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential unless (1) surgically sterile or (2) using adequate contraceptive measures&#xD;
             (postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fertile male subjects not willing to use contraception and whose female partners are&#xD;
             not under adequate contraceptive protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known CNS metastases (if clinical suspicion of CNS metastases exists appropriate&#xD;
             imaging must be performed prior to study entry).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with chemotherapy (there is no restriction on prior epidermal growth&#xD;
             factor directed therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe and uncontrolled cardiac or cardiovascular abnormalities.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any of the following abnormal screening hematological values: Hemoglobin (Hb) &lt;9g /dL&#xD;
             (6 mmol/L), Neutrophils &lt;1.5 x 10^9/L, Platelets &lt;100 x 10^9/L.&#xD;

             upper normal limit (ULN), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate&#xD;

             &gt;= 5 x ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following abnormal screening renal function tests: either a serum creatinine &gt; 1.5&#xD;
             x ULN or a creatinine clearance (estimated from serum creatinine) &lt; 40 mL/minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy (except palliative).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any investigational drug study or immunotherapy within 4 weeks&#xD;
             preceding treatment start.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent or previous malignancy of a different tumor type within 5 years of&#xD;
             starting E7070 treatment except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or&#xD;
             cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant disease, which in the Investigator's opinion would exclude the patient&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Legal incapacity.&#xD;
