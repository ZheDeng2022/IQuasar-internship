  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how breast cancer tumors respond to treatment combining&#xD;
      the drugs docetaxel and ZD1839.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced breast cancer continue to have an extremely poor prognosis with an&#xD;
      average life expectancy of approximately 2 years. Novel treatments designed to exploit&#xD;
      biologic properties of the tumor are urgently required as a means to improve the outcome for&#xD;
      the large numbers of patients who relapse after receiving optimal chemotherapy treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overexpresssion of EGFR and/or TGF-alpha is frequent in human breast cancer and has been&#xD;
      correlated in many cases with poor prognostic features. Inhibition of the EGFR pathway has&#xD;
      been proposed as a potential therapeutic modality in advanced breast cancer. The&#xD;
      antiproliferative activity of ZD 1839 in combination with cytotoxic drugs, such as docetaxel&#xD;
      was evaluated in breast cancer cell lines ZR-75-1 and MCF-10A ras that coexpress EGFR and&#xD;
      TGF-alpha. Combination treatment demonstrated dose dependent supra-additive growth inhibition&#xD;
      and markedly enhanced apoptotic cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although taxanes bind to the microtubular network in cells that is essential for mitotic and&#xD;
      interphase cellular functions, the mechanism by which these agents induce cell death is not&#xD;
      entirely clear. Docetaxel has also shown dose-dependent anti-angiogenic activity. Thus, the&#xD;
      mechanism(s) of anti-tumor activity of docetaxel remain unclear and combinations of signal&#xD;
      transduction pathway inhibition and/or anti-angiogenesis may provide potentiation of&#xD;
      concurrent ZD 1839 and docetaxel therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase 2 trial is designed to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safetey of&#xD;
      combination therapy with ZD 1839 and docetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
