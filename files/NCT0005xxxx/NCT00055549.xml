      This study will examine how dextromethorphan, a drug that alters reflexes of the larynx&#xD;
      (voice box), might change voice symptoms in people with voice disorders due to uncontrolled&#xD;
      laryngeal muscle spasms. These include abductor spasmodic dysphonia (breathy voice breaks),&#xD;
      adductor spasmodic dysphonia (vowel breaks), muscular tension dysphonia (tight strained&#xD;
      voice), and vocal tremor (tremulous voice). Dextromethorphan-one of a group of drugs called&#xD;
      NMDA antagonists-has been used for years in over-the-counter cough suppressant medicines. In&#xD;
      animal studies, the drug has blocked one of the reflexes in the larynx that may be associated&#xD;
      with spasms in the laryngeal muscles. This study will compare the effects of&#xD;
      dextromethorphan, lorazepam (a valium-type drug), and a placebo (inactive substance) in&#xD;
      patients with the four types of voice disorders described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with spasmodic dysphonia, muscular tension dysphonia and vocal tremor may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Individuals who smoke or use tobacco, who have vocal nodules or&#xD;
      polyps, or who have a history of airway obstruction may not participate. Candidates will be&#xD;
      screened with a medical history and physical examination, a questionnaire, voice recording&#xD;
      (repeating sentences into a microphone), and nasolaryngoscopy (examination of the larynx with&#xD;
      a tube advanced through the nose). For the nasolaryngoscopy, the inside of the nose is&#xD;
      sprayed with a decongestant (to open the nasal passages) and possibly a local anesthetic. A&#xD;
      small, flexible tube called a nasolaryngoscope is passed through the nose to look at the&#xD;
      larynx during speech and other tasks, such as singing, whistling and prolonged vowels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for each of three visits, which will&#xD;
      last from the afternoon of one day to late afternoon of the following day. At each visit,&#xD;
      patients will complete a questionnaire, baseline speech recording, and a test for sedation&#xD;
      level. They will take three pills-either dextromethorphan, lorazepam, or placebo-one every 6&#xD;
      hours. Vital signs will be checked every 6 hours and the level of sedation during waking&#xD;
      hours will be monitored. One to three hours after taking the third pill, speech recording,&#xD;
      questionnaire and test of sedation will be repeated to check for possible voice changes.&#xD;
      Patients will be given a different pill at each visit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Studies of spasmodic dysphonia (SD) have increasingly pointed to the possibility of a central&#xD;
      sensori-motor control disorder. Sensori-motor processing has been found abnormal in both&#xD;
      adductor and abductor spasmodic dysphonia based on reflex conditioning studies. These studies&#xD;
      demonstrated an increased frequency of R2 muscle responses during rapid paired presentation&#xD;
      of electrical stimuli to the superior laryngeal nerve in spasmodic dysphonia. Thus,&#xD;
      uncontrolled R2 responses were hypothesized to be the basis for the uncontrolled muscle&#xD;
      bursts in these patients. Selective suppression of late R2 laryngeal adductor responses by&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) blockade in cats was demonstrated by Ambalavanar et.al. In&#xD;
      particular, dextromethorphan reduced the frequency of R2 responses from 95% to 25% (P =&#xD;
      0.015). Dextromethorphan is a widely used antitussive agent that has been in use for over 30&#xD;
      years. In a double-blind randomized crossover design, 3 groups of patients will receive be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of 6 order cohorts. They will then receive either dextromethorphan&#xD;
      at a 8 mg/kg/d dose divided in a Q6 hour dosing schedule with only 3 doses administered PO&#xD;
      every 6 hours for 3 dosages, 04 mg/kg/d of lorazepam PO every 6 hours for 3 dosages or a&#xD;
      placebo administrated in the same way during Phase A. After a minimum of a 1-week washout&#xD;
      interval, the patients will be given either the other medication or placebo during Phase B&#xD;
      and then the remaining medication or placebo during Phase C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that dextromethorphan, an NMDA receptor blocker, will reduce voice breaks&#xD;
      in spasmodic dysphonia to a greater degree than lorazepam, which has similar sedating side&#xD;
      effects, but does not affect NMDA receptors with a different mechanism. On the other hand,&#xD;
      patients with other idiopathic voice disorders, muscular tension dysphonia and vocal tremor,&#xD;
      are hypothesized not to have a similar benefit from dextromethorphan. During the double-blind&#xD;
      randomized cross-over study, three groups will be included, 10 patients with adductor or&#xD;
      abductor spasmodic dysphonia, 10 with muscular tension dysphonia and 10 with vocal tremor.&#xD;
      The results will determine if dextromethorphan has potential as a treatment option for&#xD;
      patients with adductor or abductor SD.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Spasmodic Dysphonia will meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. No structural abnormalities affecting the larynx such as vocal fold nodules, polyps,&#xD;
             carcinoma, cysts, contact ulcers, inflammation (laryngitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptoms of adductor or abductor spasmodic dysphonia present during speech and not&#xD;
             apparent at rest,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Symptoms of adductor or abductor spasmodic dysphonia less evident during whisper,&#xD;
             singing or falsetto.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Symptoms of adductor or abductor spasmodic dysphonia become worse with prolonged&#xD;
             speaking, practice or anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Reflexive and emotional aspects of voice function are unaffected, such as coughing and&#xD;
             laughter or crying.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Muscular Tension Dysphonia will meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Increased phonatory muscle tension in the paralaryngeal and suprahyoid muscles on&#xD;
             palpation,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Constant elevation of the larynx in the neck during speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A consistent hypertonic laryngeal posture for phonation, either an open posterior&#xD;
             glottic chink between the arytenoid cartilages on phonation, an anterior-posterior&#xD;
             squeeze (pin hole posture) or ventricular hyperadduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A normally appearing larynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with vocal tremor will have tremor isolated to the larynx without noticeable&#xD;
        tremor of the head and pharynx. Tremor of the vocal folds should be evident during a&#xD;
        prolonged vowel and also noticeable in the larynx during connected speech containing&#xD;
        vowels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects in all three groups will be without:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, psychiatric or speech and hearing problems as&#xD;
             determined by medical history and examination by a physician and an EKG. Any patient&#xD;
             with a history of airway obstruction will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Reduction in the range of vocal fold movement during non-speech tasks such as&#xD;
             whistling suggesting either paralysis or paresis, joint abnormality or neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No smokers or tobacco users will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Exclude mucosal changes such as vocal nodules or polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with a history of a psychiatric disorder, under the care of a psychiatrist,&#xD;
             or on medications for treatment of a psychiatric disorder will be excluded from study.&#xD;
             Examples of psychiatric disorders to be excluded are: somatoform disorders, conversion&#xD;
             disorders, currently under treatment for a major depression, or a history of&#xD;
             schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder. However, a history of a previous episode of a&#xD;
             minor reactive depression would not exclude a person from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects taking carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, cimetidine, hydrochlorthiazide,&#xD;
             nicotine, quinidine, ranitidine, sodium or calcium bicarbonate and triamterene must&#xD;
             either discontinue these medications or be excluded from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with grade 2 or higher hepatic or renal dysfunction will be excluded from&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnant women will be excluded from the study as it is not known if the study drugs&#xD;
             are harmful to the fetus. If a woman becomes pregnant during the study, she will be&#xD;
             removed.&#xD;
