  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and immune system response to the TBC-3B&#xD;
      HIV vaccine when it is injected either into the groin area or into the arm. The goal is to&#xD;
      determine which injection site is better at producing a particular type of immune response.&#xD;
      This study is not evaluating the effectiveness of the vaccine, so volunteers must maintain&#xD;
      low risk behavior for HIV transmission throughout the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this vaccination study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      Therion Biologic Corporation (Cambridge, MA) TBC-3B vaccine. TBC-3B consists of live,&#xD;
      recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the env and gag/pol genes of HIV-1 strain IIIB. TBC-3B&#xD;
      will be administered by subcutaneous injection in the groin and in the deltoid region, with&#xD;
      the aim of determining which site is better at inducing mucosal immune responses. Because the&#xD;
      groin area drains to the inguinal lymph nodes, vaccines given there may stimulate local&#xD;
      immunologic activity in the draining rectal mucosa as well as systemic immunologic activity&#xD;
      in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be followed for 20 months. The first 2 months of the study will be an&#xD;
      evaluation of volunteers' normal immune function. Volunteers will then be randomly selected&#xD;
      to receive the TBC-3B experimental HIV vaccine in either the groin area or in the deltoid&#xD;
      region. Neither volunteers nor study personnel will know which group the volunteer will be in&#xD;
      until the day of the first immunization. All volunteers will receive TBC-3B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 20 months of the study, volunteers will be asked to donate blood up to 14 times,&#xD;
      undergo seven flexible sigmoidoscopies with biopsies, and receive three pairs of vaccine&#xD;
      injections. For up to 36 days after each experimental vaccination, volunteers will be asked&#xD;
      to abstain from activity that might spread the virus in the vaccine and put others at risk.&#xD;
      Volunteers will receive specific instructions on how to avoid these risks. Volunteers will&#xD;
      also be asked not to engage in receptive anal intercourse during the study.&#xD;
