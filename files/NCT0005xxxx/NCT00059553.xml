  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incomplete spinal cord injury often results in difficulty walking. Training on a treadmill&#xD;
      with body weight support may improve walking ability after spinal cord injury. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to examine the effect of treadmill speed on spinal cord function and walking&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Conventional rehabilitation following spinal cord injury (SCI) emphasizes functional gains&#xD;
      through strengthening and compensation, using braces and assistive devices to achieve&#xD;
      mobility. Rehabilitation practice using compensatory approaches is based on the prevailing&#xD;
      assumption that neural recovery is not possible following SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence contradicts this assumption. Stimulated by the proper activation of&#xD;
      peripheral afferents associated with walking, neuronal circuits may reorganize by&#xD;
      strengthening of existing and previously inactive descending connections and local neural&#xD;
      circuits. New approaches to locomotor recovery after SCI utilize sensory information related&#xD;
      to locomotion to improve treadmill and overground walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locomotor training velocity may be a critical, task-specific, and activity-dependent&#xD;
      parameter affording appropriate phasic, afferent input to the neural system and promoting&#xD;
      neural plasticity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of training velocity&#xD;
      in a long-term locomotor training program on both neurophysiological and behavioral&#xD;
      plasticity in individuals with incomplete SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixteen patients with incomplete SCI will be recruited to participate in this study. Baseline&#xD;
      evaluations will include American Spinal Injury Association classification, rate-sensitive&#xD;
      depression, phase-dependent H-reflex modulation at self-selected and fast overground walking&#xD;
      velocities, and MRI of the spine. Patients will wear a step activity monitor for a 48-hour&#xD;
      period, quantifying baseline walking activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will participate in a locomotor training program. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either training at self-selected treadmill velocity or at a normal walking&#xD;
      velocity. Patients will have 45 training sessions over 9 weeks. Each training session will&#xD;
      include 30 minutes of walking. Interim testing of rated depression, spatial-temporal&#xD;
      parameters of walking, MRI, and walking activity will occur through the 9-week training&#xD;
      period. Post-testing will occur within 2 days of the last training session and at a 1 month&#xD;
      after completion of the training. During the month following long-term training, patients&#xD;
      will be instructed to return to their self-selected routine activities of daily living.&#xD;
