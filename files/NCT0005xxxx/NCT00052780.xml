    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the safety of combining O6-benzylguanine with temozolomide in treating&#xD;
      children who have recurrent or refractory brain tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use&#xD;
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.&#xD;
      O6-benzylguanine may increase the effectiveness of temozolomide by making tumor cells more&#xD;
      sensitive to the drug.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide (Temodar) when administered with&#xD;
      O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) with and without G-CSF support to pediatric patients with refractory&#xD;
      brain tumors stratified by previous radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide and O6-BG when used in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize toxicities associated with the combination of O6-BG and temozolomide with&#xD;
      and without G-CSF support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To document antitumor response in patients when treated with O6-BG and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the levels of MGMT enzyme and mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in tumor&#xD;
      tissue, investigating a possible correlation with patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temozolomide with and without filgrastim (G-CSF).&#xD;
      Patients are stratified according to prior radiotherapy (RT)/myeloablative therapy (no RT or&#xD;
      focal RT vs craniospinal RT or myeloablative therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV continuously on days 1 and 2 and oral temozolomide on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 2-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 25% of&#xD;
      patients experience DLT. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at that&#xD;
      dose level for a total of 12 patients treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For courses 1-12, patients experiencing neutropenia may also receive G-CSF subcutaneously or&#xD;
      IV daily beginning on day 3 and continuing until blood counts recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If neutropenia is the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for the first 2 strata, patients are&#xD;
      further stratified according to concurrent G-CSF support (yes vs no).Cohorts of 3-6 patients&#xD;
      in each stratum receive escalating doses of temozolomide with G-CSF until the MTD is&#xD;
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience DLT. Once the MTD is determined, 6 additional patients are treated at&#xD;
      that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for resolution of all adverse events occurring while on treatment&#xD;
      and/or within 30 days of the last administration of study drug. Patients will be followed for&#xD;
      the shortest of 1) three months after the last protocol based treatment, or 2) the date other&#xD;
      therapy is initiated.&#xD;
