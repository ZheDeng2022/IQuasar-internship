      This study will evaluate children with mastocytosis, a disease of excessive mast cells in&#xD;
      tissues such as skin and bone marrow, to identify the cause of the disease and describe its&#xD;
      course. Mast cells can release chemicals that cause itching, blisters, flushing, bone pain,&#xD;
      and abdominal pain. Usually, mastocytosis in children involves the skin only and is of&#xD;
      limited duration. This study, however, will focus on children with more severe disease that&#xD;
      more closely resembles adult-onset mastocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients up to 21 years of age with childhood-onset mastocytosis may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates must have one or more of the following abnormalities, which indicate severe&#xD;
      disease: enlarged liver or spleen; diffuse skin involvement; history of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding or peptic ulcer; bone marrow biopsy with abnormal mast cells either in number or&#xD;
      shape; elevated blood levels of the enzyme tryptase; or abnormal hemoglobin, white blood&#xD;
      cells, platelets, or clotting factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history and physical examination; various blood tests,&#xD;
      including studies to identify genetic changes that are important in the growth, development,&#xD;
      and functioning of human mast cells; and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. For the bone&#xD;
      marrow procedure, the skin over the hipbone and the outer surface of the bone itself are&#xD;
      numbed with an injection of local anesthesia. Then, a special needle is inserted into the&#xD;
      hipbone and about 2 tablespoons of bone marrow are drawn into a syringe. Another needle is&#xD;
      then inserted through the first needle to collect a small piece of the bone marrow. Pain will&#xD;
      be managed according to the individual patient s needs. Additional procedures, such as a&#xD;
      gastroenterology consultation, colonoscopy to examine the colon, or computerized axial&#xD;
      tomography (CT) or ultrasound of the abdomen to assess the liver and spleen, may be done if&#xD;
      medically indicated. Standard medical treatment, including antihistamines for itching or&#xD;
      steroids for abdominal cramping or diarrhea, will be recommended as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients biologic parents may also be enrolled to provide a blood sample for genetic analysis&#xD;
      and a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy for clinical and research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to NIH once a year for follow-up evaluations until their disease is&#xD;
      stable or until the 5-year study ends.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mastocytosis in infants and children is an unusual disease characterized by an excess of mast&#xD;
      cells in tissues. In pediatric onset mastocytosis, disease is usually localized to the skin&#xD;
      and disease is considered to be of limited duration. However, a subset of children appear to&#xD;
      develop a clinical picture resembling that observed in adults who have adult-onset disease.&#xD;
      This study will focus on children with more severe mastocytosis in an attempt to define its&#xD;
      pathogenesis, focusing on mutations and polymorphisms in genes regulating mast cell&#xD;
      proliferation and survival to determine if they might contribute to this disease pattern. If&#xD;
      severe pediatric-onset disease does not fit within the existing classification, new criteria&#xD;
      of diagnosis must be proposed for the pediatric age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine children and young adults age birth to 21 years with pediatric-onset&#xD;
      disease previously enrolled on NIAID mastocytosis protocols, or as a result of physician&#xD;
      referral, which have disease more consistent with adult-onset disease or parameters&#xD;
      associated with increased morbidity. The evaluation may include serum tryptase, blood count,&#xD;
      bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, morphology and mutational analysis. Subjects may be asked to&#xD;
      return in 12-24 months for assessment. If relevant mutation effecting mast cell growth and&#xD;
      function are identified, such mutations will be sought in the biologic parents as&#xD;
      appropriate, but only when such mutations are believed to be germ line (not somatic)&#xD;
      mutations. This study will aid in the understanding of the characteristics of severe&#xD;
      mastocytosis in the pediatric age group.&#xD;
