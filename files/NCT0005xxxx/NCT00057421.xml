  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a clinical trial in HIV infected patients with tuberculosis. The study assessed&#xD;
      whether the addition of prednisolone, a type of steroid medication, to the standard treatment&#xD;
      for tuberculosis improved immune and viral outcomes in the patients. The study demonstrated&#xD;
      that prednisolone increased the CD4 cell count as was hoped, but the beneficial effect was&#xD;
      short-lived and was gone within 4 months of stopping therapy. Therefore, the use of&#xD;
      prednisolone for tuberculosis in HIV infected patients is not recommended at this time.&#xD;

      Recent observations from retrospective cohort studies indicate that HIV-associated&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) is associated with reduced survival and increased rate of opportunistic&#xD;
      infections compared to CD4-matched controls. Mounting evidence from immunologic and virologic&#xD;
      studies supports the concept of co-pathogenesis, in which cytokines such as tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor alpha (TNF alpha) are over-expressed during the course of TB and stimulate viral&#xD;
      replication in latently infected cells, possibly leading to greater viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of cytokines, including TNF, and clinicians have&#xD;
      extensive experiences with their use in HIV infection. Although corticosteroid use in HIV&#xD;
      infection has a record of safety, the safety and bioavailability of corticosteroids in HIV/TB&#xD;
      coinfection has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluated the change in viral load and CD4 count in HIV infected patients with TB&#xD;
      who were treated with oral prednisolone. The study found that the viral load increased&#xD;
      slightly when prednisolone was administered and that patients receiving prednisolone cleared&#xD;
      their tuberculosis more rapidly. Although there was some benefit to using prednisolone in&#xD;
      these patients, the benefit was short-lived and was gone within 4 months of stopping therapy.&#xD;
