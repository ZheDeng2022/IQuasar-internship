      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) may prevent cardiovascular events&#xD;
      in high risk persons and improve skeletal muscle function in heart failure patients by means&#xD;
      of mechanisms that are independent of blood pressure changes. However, there is limited&#xD;
      knowledge of all the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic benefits of ACE inhibition. ACE&#xD;
      inhibitors may favorably modify markers of fibrinolysis, inflammation, endothelial function,&#xD;
      and extracellular tissue remodeling, all of which are associated with atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. But, clinical trial evidence on these effects is limited. In&#xD;
      addition, polymorphisms of the ACE, angiotensinogen, PAI-1 and IL-6 genes may modify the&#xD;
      therapeutic response to ACE inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a double-blind cross-over, randomized, placebo controlled trial in 286 persons with&#xD;
      high cardiovascular risk to compare the effects of 6 months of treatment with fosinopril and&#xD;
      6 months with placebo on the following primary outcomes: plasma plasminogen activator&#xD;
      inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen, C- reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble&#xD;
      vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1). The secondary objectives were (a) to assess the&#xD;
      effects of fosinopril on IL-6/IL-6 Soluble Receptor ratio, PAI-1 activity, tissue plasminogen&#xD;
      activator (TPA) antigen, fibrinogen, endothelin-1, TNF-alpha, soluble intercellular cell&#xD;
      adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), E-selectin, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and tissue&#xD;
      inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1); and (b) to explore the effects of ACE,&#xD;
      angiotensinogen, PAI-1, and IL-6 gene polymorphisms on these biomarkers, and test the&#xD;
      interaction of the gene polymorphisms with the effects of fosinopril. The study had&#xD;
      sufficient power to detect small changes in several biomarkers compared to placebo. The&#xD;
      assessment of these biological mechanisms had clinical relevance for identifying the patients&#xD;
      who may benefit the most from ACE inhibition. While the focus of the study was on novel&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, the results may also have future implications for developing new&#xD;
      indications for ACE inhibitors, such as, for example, the prevention of age-related muscle&#xD;
      wasting and physical disabilities in older persons, for which inflammation may be a causal&#xD;
      factor.&#xD;
