  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine the usefulness of a new instrument called the Dynamic Light&#xD;
      Scattering (DLS) device for documenting and monitoring changes in the cornea, the front part&#xD;
      of the eye where contact lenses are placed. The DLS device uses a low-intensity laser similar&#xD;
      to that used in supermarket checkouts to measure the cloudiness of the cornea. The results of&#xD;
      this study may lead to further investigations using DLS to discover the cause of corneal&#xD;
      clouding and to develop treatments to prevent it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with corneal clouding or opacification 18 years of age and&#xD;
      older may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a standard eye examination, including a check of visual acuity and eye&#xD;
      pressure. The retina will also be examined and photographs of the cornea may be taken. For&#xD;
      the DLS test, the subject sits in front of the device and looks at a yellow-green target&#xD;
      while the cloudiness of the cornea is measured. Subjects will be tested four times. The&#xD;
      entire procedure takes less than 30 minutes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Corneal disease and injuries are the leading cause of visits to eye care clinics in the US&#xD;
      today. These diseases are also some of the most painful eye disorders. Two important areas&#xD;
      for research on the cornea are 1) to explore and understand the molecular basis of corneal&#xD;
      transparency and 2) to analyze the molecular nature of corneal inflammation and wound&#xD;
      healing. We have developed a new clinical device to understand molecular changes that occur&#xD;
      in the lens, called Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) device. Studies have shown its potential&#xD;
      in the detection of the earliest changes occurring in the cataract, and have also shown good&#xD;
      test retest reproducibility of the system. We now would like to apply this technique to study&#xD;
      changes that occur in corneal opacification. In this pilot project, we would like to study&#xD;
      the normal cornea in young and older persons (volunteers) as well as cloudy, opaque corneas.&#xD;
      This will allow us to determine if useful data can be obtained, and if so, lead to further&#xD;
      studies in various corneal disorders caused by trauma, infections, and dystrophies, as well&#xD;
      as those caused by systemic or inherited disorders.&#xD;
