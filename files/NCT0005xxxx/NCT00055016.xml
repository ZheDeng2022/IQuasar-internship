  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compile a registry of patients with Fabry disease, an&#xD;
      inherited metabolic disorder. In this disease, an enzyme called a-galactosidase A, which&#xD;
      normally breaks down a lipid (fatty substance) called globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), is missing&#xD;
      or does not function properly. As a result, Gb3 accumulates, causing problems with the&#xD;
      kidneys, heart, nerves, and blood vessels. It is not known exactly how lipid accumulation&#xD;
      causes these problems, but in another lipid storage disease called Gaucher disease the&#xD;
      illness can be reversed if the accumulated lipid is removed by repeated intravenous (into a&#xD;
      vein) infusions of the deficient enzyme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fabry disease registry is a voluntary and anonymous list of patients that includes&#xD;
      information about their health and allows doctors to follow changes in their symptoms and&#xD;
      test results over time. It also allows doctors to compare symptoms between patients who are&#xD;
      receiving certain therapies with those who are not receiving therapy. The goals of the&#xD;
      registry are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Better understand the natural history of Fabry disease, including disease variations&#xD;
           within and between affected families;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide a basis for developing guidelines for disease management;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate how treatment affects the course of disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide high-quality data and analyses that will help to continuously develop better&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of all ages with biochemical or genetic evidence of Fabry disease (i.e., individuals&#xD;
      who have a deficiency of the enzyme a-galactosidase A or a mutation in the gene that encodes&#xD;
      this enzyme, or both) are eligible for this study. This worldwide study will include 100&#xD;
      patients participating in Fabry disease studies at the NIH. These patients will come to the&#xD;
      NIH Clinical Center only as required for participation their Fabry disease study. No&#xD;
      additional procedures will be required for the current registry study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIH patients will take part in the registry study for their lifetime, or as long as they are&#xD;
      being followed at the NIH for their Fabry disease. At their regularly scheduled NIH clinic&#xD;
      visits, participants will have routine medical procedures and examinations deemed necessary&#xD;
      by the doctor. The results of blood and urine tests taken at these visits will be entered&#xD;
      into the registry database. Blood tests will include information on genotype (determination&#xD;
      of which gene mutation is responsible for the disease), a-galactosidase A levels, Gb3 levels,&#xD;
      and creatinine. Urine tests results will include creatinine clearance (a measure of kidney&#xD;
      function) and protein evaluation.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL TITLE: Registry of Fabry Disease: A Multicenter, Longitudinal Observational Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL IDENTIFIER: FOS (Fabry Outcome Survey)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT: Post Marketing Outcome Survey (Outcome Survey)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURVEY OBJECTIVES/ENDPOINTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this outcome survey are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  enhance the understanding of the natural history of Fabry disease, including the intra-&#xD;
           and inter-familial variations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  provide a basis for the development of management guidelines for Fabry disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the impact of therapeutic intervention on the clinical course of Fabry disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  generate data and analyses to enable the continuous improvement of Fabry disease&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collect long term safety and efficacy data on patients treated with Replagal enzyme&#xD;
           replacement therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry/outcome survey is open for all patients of all ages, male and female, with a&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are unwilling to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are receiving enzyme replacement therapy other than Replagal for Fabry&#xD;
           Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients currently enrolled in an ongoing blinded clinical trial in which the product is&#xD;
           considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS PLANNED AND DURATION OF SUBJECT PARTICIPATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no predetermined number of patients that must be enrolled into the outcome survey.&#xD;
      Patients who have been diagnosed (biochemically or genetically) with Fabry disease that&#xD;
      consent to participate will be followed for an undetermined amount of time (i.e., until the&#xD;
      sponsor closes the outcome survey or the patient withdraws consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENTS ADMINISTERED AND TREATMENT SCHEDULE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients consenting to participate in the outcome survey will either be untreated or treated&#xD;
      with Replagal ERT. It is recommended that patients be followed at increments determined to be&#xD;
      necessary by the treating physician. It is also recommended that data on all patients be&#xD;
      entered into the outcome survey on a bi-annual basis (every six (6) months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be supplied with Replagal at no charge as a result of participating in the&#xD;
      Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS). Patients will receive Replagal through their participation in&#xD;
      ongoing open label clinical trials or compassionate programs. Additionally, patients may&#xD;
      receive commercially available product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURVEY ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recommended that patients be followed at clinically relevant intervals determined by&#xD;
      their treating physician. Data collected is to be entered into the FOS database as soon as&#xD;
      possible after physician assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURVEY METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational data will be recorded in the FOS database based on routine clinical evaluations&#xD;
      performed by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis of FOS data will be performed by a bio-statistician designated by&#xD;
      Shire HGT and in accordance with documented company guidelines and standard operating&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
