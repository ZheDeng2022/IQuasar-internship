  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of TNFerade™&#xD;
      Biologic when administered concurrently with 5-FU and radiation therapy as first-line&#xD;
      treatment of unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNFerade™ is a replication deficient adenovirus vector containing the gene for TNF-alpha&#xD;
      controlled by a chemoradiation inducible promoter. This allows the expression of TNF-alpha to&#xD;
      be greatest in the area receiving radiation. TNF-alpha is a cytokine that has been shown to&#xD;
      have potent anti-cancer activities but, due to systemic toxicity, could not be delivered at&#xD;
      effective doses. TNFerade™ Biologic is a novel way of selective delivery of TNF-alpha to&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNFerade™ Biologic will be injected during five weekly injection sessions, concomitant with&#xD;
      radiation and 5-FU. TNFerade™ Biologic will be administered by direct intratumoral injection&#xD;
      using a percutaneous approach (PTA) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).&#xD;

             loss of patent superior mesenteric-portal vein confluence), who have not received&#xD;
             previous treatment for pancreatic cancer. Patients who have been surgically explored&#xD;
             and deemed unresectable on that basis are eligible, provided other entry criteria are&#xD;
             met&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic (stage IV) disease (including involvement of the colon, adrenals, or&#xD;

          -  History of other malignancy in the past 2 years except carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;
             or bladder, non-melanomatous skin cancer or localized early stage prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous chemotherapy or radiation for pancreatic cancer or previous radiation to the&#xD;
             target field&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver enzymes &gt;3 x ULN (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase)&#xD;
