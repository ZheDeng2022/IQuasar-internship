      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy uses certain drugs to try to prevent the development or&#xD;
      recurrence of cancer. Celecoxib may be effective in preventing the development or recurrence&#xD;
      of lung cancer in former heavy smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing the&#xD;
      development or recurrence of lung cancer in former heavy smokers who are at risk of&#xD;
      developing cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility of chemoprevention of lung cancer with celecoxib in former&#xD;
           heavy smokers at risk for developing primary or second primary lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and side effects of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the role of COX-2-specific inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) on antitumor immunity&#xD;
           within the lung microenvironment of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effects of COX-2 inhibition on angiogenesis in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are&#xD;
      stratified according to presence of preinvasive lesions (yes vs no). Patients are randomized&#xD;
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 6 months. Treatment in both arms&#xD;
           continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed every 6 months during treatment and then annually for up to 4&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed annually for up to 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (90 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
