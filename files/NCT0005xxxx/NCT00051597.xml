  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a multi-dose regimen of SGN-30, a novel chimeric&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody (mAb), in patients with refractory or recurrent CD30+ hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm, open-label phase I/II study designed to define the toxicity profile,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and anti-tumor activity of a multi-dose regimen of SGN-30 in&#xD;
      patients with refractory or recurrent CD30+ hematologic malignancies. The phase I study will&#xD;
      be a modified dose escalation of SGN-30. Based on preclinical pharmacology and toxicokinetics&#xD;
      (TK) and the first use in human single-dose phase I study, SGN-30 will be administered on a&#xD;
      weekly schedule. An initial dose of 2 mg/kg will escalate until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) has been reached or until a weekly dose of 12 mg/kg is achieved.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histologically confirmed CD30+ hematologic malignancy. Immunohistochemistry or flow&#xD;
        cytometry may be performed on either original diagnostic biopsy material or biopsy of&#xD;
        relapsed disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with HD must have failed systemic chemotherapy either as initial therapy for&#xD;
             advanced stage disease or as salvage therapy after initial radiotherapy (XRT) for&#xD;
             early stage disease and be ineligible for, or refuse treatment by stem cell&#xD;
             transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other CD30+ malignancies must be beyond 1st remission or refractory to&#xD;
             front line chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with refractory or chemo-resistant multiple myeloma (MM), as defined by a&#xD;
             failure to respond (&lt;50% reduction in M-protein level), or disease progression less&#xD;
             than 2 months after receiving at least two conventional chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with MM in the Plateau Phase of their disease may be included in the study.&#xD;
             Plateau phase will be defined as persistent (more than 6 weeks) M-protein in the serum&#xD;
             or urine despite a significant initial reduction (&gt;50%) in response to previous&#xD;
             therapy. These patients should have received at least two of the conventional&#xD;
             chemotherapy regimens listed above prior to enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with relapsed MM as defined by disease progression more than 2 months after&#xD;
             initial therapy and subsequent failure to respond (&lt;50% reduction or progression in&#xD;
             M-protein levels) to ONE of the above listed regimens or other salvage regimens (high&#xD;
             dose cyclophosphamide, topotecan).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bidimensional or unidimensional measurable disease on physical examination or&#xD;
             radiologic evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of bone marrow disease to any degree in patients with HD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt;10% tumor cells in bone marrow in patients with other CD30+ malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum of 4 weeks from last therapy (including radiotherapy or chemotherapy); a&#xD;
             minimum of 6 weeks from last treatment with nitrogen mustard agents, melphalan or BCNU&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status â‰¤ 2 (Appendix B) with a life expectancy &gt; 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) or non-secretory MM&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic cardiac disease including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery disease&#xD;
             or arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than one primary malignancy with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer or&#xD;
             cervical carcinoma in situ (CIN) on a biopsy or squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL)&#xD;
             on PAP smear&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection including known HIV positivity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic brain metastases requiring treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent therapy with other anti-neoplastic agents, corticosteroids, or experimental&#xD;
             agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious underlying medical condition which would impair the ability of the patient&#xD;
             to receive or tolerate the planned treatment including prior allergic reactions to&#xD;
             recombinant human or murine proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any therapeutic mAbs within 6 months unless a recent serum testing reveals&#xD;
             no antibody titer and no evidence of anti-chimeric or anti-murine antibody in the&#xD;
             peripheral circulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
