    <textblock>
      Patient at increased risk for developing a new head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are&#xD;
      invited to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators of this trial will attempt to study the effectiveness of Celecoxib in&#xD;
      preventing cancer in patients who have oral leukoplakia and/or head and neck dysplasia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Celecoxib is being studied in precancerous lesions of the head and neck in part because, it&#xD;
      has been shown to prevent the progression of another type of precancerous polyps (a type of&#xD;
      abnormal growth) in patients at high risk for colorectal cancer. There are, however, no&#xD;
      published studies yet looking at this drug in humans for the prevention of head and neck&#xD;
      cancers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved celecoxib for arthritis and the&#xD;
      prevention of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (a type of precancerous&#xD;
      syndrome in some families that can lead to colon cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done to find out several things:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is celecoxib, also known by the trade name Celebrex ®, effective in reducing the&#xD;
           expression of precancerous markers (biological signals for specific cellular activities)&#xD;
           in oral leukoplakia and dysplasia (abnormal growth) of the oral mucosa?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is celecoxib effective in reducing the size of oral leukoplalda lesions and/or presence&#xD;
           of dysplasia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the reduction in precancerous markers correspond with reduction of oral leukoplalda&#xD;
           and/or presence of dysplasia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the side effects of celecoxib in this patient population?&#xD;
