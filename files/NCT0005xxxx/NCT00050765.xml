  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MyoCell™ implantation by epicardial injection during CABG surgery has the potential to add a&#xD;
      new dimension to the management of post-infarct deterioration of cardiac function. Based on&#xD;
      existing non-clinical studies and clinical reports, implantation of autologous skeletal&#xD;
      myoblasts appears to lead to the replacement of non-functioning myocardial scar with&#xD;
      functioning muscle and appears to improve myocardial performance relative to case without&#xD;
      myoblast implantation. In a few investigational patients, myoblast implantation can be, and&#xD;
      has been, done in conjunction with CABG and appears to have the potential to provide for&#xD;
      additive treatment during surgery. The present study is being conducted to evaluate more&#xD;
      fully the safety of MyoCell™ implantation via epicardial injection during CABG surgery and&#xD;
      its effect on regional myocardial function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      MyoCell™ mediated cellular cardiomyoplasty is a novel therapeutic approach to the management&#xD;
      of progressive heart failure in patients who have damaged myocardial tissue resulting from a&#xD;
      myocardial infarct. MyoCell™ consists of patient autologous skeletal myoblasts which are&#xD;
      expanded ex vivo and supplied as a cell suspension in a buffered salts solution for injection&#xD;
      into the area of damaged, akinetic myocardium with the goal of having the myoblasts populate&#xD;
      the implant area and generate elastic, contractile skeletal muscle-like tissue within the&#xD;
      damaged myocardium. Because the physiological goal is to replace inelastic, fibrous&#xD;
      myocardial scar tissue with skeletal muscle-like tissue, originating from the cellular&#xD;
      implants, this therapeutic approach is termed &quot;cellular cardiomyoplasty&quot; or &quot;CCM&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety of MyoCell™(expanded autologous skeletal&#xD;
      myoblasts) using a dose escalation methodology following epicardial injection into myocardial&#xD;
      scar tissue in patients who have experienced anterior, lateral, posterior or inferior wall&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, require coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and who have an&#xD;
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in place (ICD can be implanted during the CABG&#xD;
      procedure or 3 to 4 days post CABG procedure). Safety endpoints will be the evaluation of the&#xD;
      nature and frequency of Adverse Events during the 12-month period following MyoCell™&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient meets the baseline enrollment criteria, a 5-10 gram skeletal muscle biopsy will&#xD;
      be obtained for myoblast isolation and expansion in vitro at Bioheart's designated facility&#xD;
      for MyoCell™ production. Biopsy will occur 3 - 4 weeks prior to the anticipated implantation&#xD;
      of the MyoCell™ product. At the time of the patient's CABG surgery MyoCell™ will be injected&#xD;
      into the akinetic myocardial scar in the region of a previous infarct utilizing a sterile&#xD;
      hypodermic syringe fitted with a 25 gauge needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a dose escalation study with 3 cohort groups consisting of 5 patients each. A&#xD;
      report of the 1 month safety data from each cohort will be presented to the data safety&#xD;
      monitoring board for permission to go to the next higher dosage. In the first cohort of this&#xD;
      dose escalation study; 2 injections will be performed, for the second cohort; 6 injections&#xD;
      and for the third cohort; 18 injections depending on the size of the infarct scar, so as to&#xD;
      inject the entire myocardial infarct scar akinetic area.&#xD;
