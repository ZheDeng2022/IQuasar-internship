  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) in&#xD;
      controlling Crohn's disease symptoms as patients taper their corticosteroid dose. Crohn's&#xD;
      disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Patients commonly have chronic diarrhea with&#xD;
      abdominal pain, loss of appetite and weight loss. Acute disease flares are treated with large&#xD;
      doses of corticosteroids, but long-term use of these drugs can have harmful side effects. ECP&#xD;
      (described below), is approved to treat skin symptoms associated with a type of cancer called&#xD;
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and has been used experimentally in conditions involving abnormal&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have had Crohn's disease for at least 6 months, who&#xD;
      are corticosteroid-dependent, and whose symptoms are controlled well enough so that their&#xD;
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is less than 220, may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history and review of medical records, physical&#xD;
      examination, electrocardiogram, blood tests, urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential, and a questionnaire about how Crohn's disease affects their life and activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a CDAI score of less than 150 will begin ECP treatments as soon as possible.&#xD;
      Those with scores from 150 to 219 will have their corticosteroid dose increased enough to&#xD;
      bring their CDAI score to below 150 before beginning ECP. Patients who do not achieve a CDAI&#xD;
      of less than 150 after 4 to 6 weeks of increased corticosteroids will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have ECP treatments for 2 consecutive days every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, for&#xD;
      a total of 26 treatments. For ECP, patients undergo leukapheresis, a method of collecting&#xD;
      large numbers of white blood cells, or leukocytes-cells that may be responsible for many of&#xD;
      the medical problems in Crohn's disease. Whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm&#xD;
      vein, similar to donating a unit of blood. The blood flows through a machine that separates&#xD;
      it into its components by spinning. The white cells are removed and collected in a plastic&#xD;
      bag, and the red blood cells and plasma are returned to the patient's bloodstream through the&#xD;
      same needle. The collected white cells are mixed with a drug called UVADEX® (Registered&#xD;
      Trademark), exposed to ultraviolet (UVA) light, and then returned to the patients'&#xD;
      bloodstream. (The UVADEX allows the blood cells to absorb more UVA.) The UVA changes the&#xD;
      cells in a way that, once they are back in the body, they cause changes in other cells like&#xD;
      them. Each ECP treatment takes 3 to 4 hours. On the first day of each 2-day treatment,&#xD;
      patients will undergo a review of symptoms, check of vital signs, and blood draw. They will&#xD;
      complete a CDAI diary for 7 days before the first of the two ECP treatments and a&#xD;
      questionnaire about their life and activities at 4-week intervals. During the ECP treatment&#xD;
      period, corticosteroids will be slowly reduced as long as disease symptoms do not worsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose disease remains under control with cessation of all steroids may begin&#xD;
      maintenance ECP, 2 days in a row every 4 weeks for an additional 20 weeks (another 10&#xD;
      treatments), with the same follow-up as described above, and a full physical examination 4&#xD;
      weeks after the final treatment. Patients who were able to reduce, but not stop, steroid&#xD;
      treatment may be considered for maintenance therapy if it is thought that continuing&#xD;
      treatment may enable further reduction of steroids. Patients whose disease symptoms worsen&#xD;
      with ECP or who have not been able to decrease their steroid dose will not be eligible for&#xD;
      maintenance therapy and their participation in the study will end.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol aims to measure the safety and effectiveness of extracorporeal photopheresis&#xD;
      (ECP) therapy for maintaining remission of symptoms during withdrawal of corticosteroids from&#xD;
      patients with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease. Potential subjects will be asymptomatic or&#xD;
      have a low level of symptoms that respond to an increase in their steroid dose; furthermore&#xD;
      potential subjects will be dependent on steroids to control their symptoms and have a history&#xD;
      of failing other immunosuppressive drugs to control their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an unblinded, single-arm study of ECP in Crohn's disease. This trial will use ECP&#xD;
      twice a week every two weeks over 24 weeks during which time the dose of corticosteroids will&#xD;
      be tapered. If the corticosteroids are able to be withdrawn without an increase in symptoms,&#xD;
      then subjects may be eligible for further ECP (twice a week every four weeks over 24 weeks)&#xD;
      as a maintenance regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters include the rates of complete and partial steroid tapering while&#xD;
      maintaining remission, the rates of adverse events, and secondary clinical outcomes such as&#xD;
      duration of response, rate of and time to relapse, and changes in symptom index scores. In&#xD;
      addition, the NIH will perform a substudy that includes serial colonoscopy to measure&#xD;
      cytokine and cell population changes in mononuclear cells extracted from biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goals of this study are to test the safety and efficacy of ECP as a&#xD;
      steroid-sparing and remittive therapy in Crohn's disease, to determine the immune response it&#xD;
      effects in the gut mucosa, and identify factors associated with responders versus&#xD;
      non-responders to ECP.&#xD;
