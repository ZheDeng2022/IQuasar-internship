      This study will conduct tests in patients with primary chronic autonomic failure (CAF) to&#xD;
      learn more about these disorders, which include pure autonomic failure, multiple system&#xD;
      atrophy, Parkinson's disease with autonomic failure, and autoimmune autonomic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with primary CAF 18 years of age or older may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Participants undergo some of the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood studies, including arterial catheter insertion to measure blood pressure and&#xD;
           collect arterial blood samples, blood flow studies using sensors applied to the skin and&#xD;
           a pressure cuff around a limb, and blood draw for genetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bladder motility: Ultrasound test of bladder function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram and heart ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Responses to changes in temperature: Warm water and then room temperature water are&#xD;
           passed through watertight pads applied to the back and front of the body and body&#xD;
           temperatures are measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrointestinal motility: Bowel sounds are recorded using a microphone placed on the&#xD;
           abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lower body negative pressure: The lower body is placed into an airtight barrel-like&#xD;
           chamber. Some air is sucked out of the barrel, causing blood to pool in the legs, as&#xD;
           occurs during standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture: A needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back&#xD;
           to collect a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microdialysis to measures levels of chemicals in the body fluid of certain tissues. A&#xD;
           solution is passed through a thin tube inserted into the skin. Chemicals in the body&#xD;
           tissues enter the solution. The solution is collected and the chemical levels are&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET scanning: A nuclear medicine test to produce images of body organs. For patients&#xD;
           with urinary problems, a catheter is inserted into the bladder before starting the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pupillometry: The pupil of the eye is measured using a special camera in a&#xD;
           light-controlled room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QSART. A small amount of a brain chemical is applied to the skin with a tiny amount of&#xD;
           electricity, and the sweat in a nearby patch of skin is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of saliva production, using a cotton-like material placed between the teeth&#xD;
           and gums to absorb saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin electrical conduction test, using sensors on the skin to measure sweat production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin and core temperature measurements using sensors on the skin and in the ear canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speech and swallowing assessment for patients with speech and swallowing difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress echocardiogram: A catheter is placed in the subject's arm for sampling blood or&#xD;
           giving a drug while the subject exercises. During the test, blood pressure, pulse rate,&#xD;
           and EKG are continuously monitored.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In dysautonomias, altered functions of one or more components of the autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      adversely affect health. Primary dysautonomias have been classified clinically into chronic&#xD;
      autonomic failure (CAF) syndromes that include pure autonomic failure (PAF), multiple system&#xD;
      atrophy (MSA), and Parkinson disease (PD) with autonomic failure (manifested especially by&#xD;
      neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH)). Clinical assessment alone is often inadequate for&#xD;
      correct diagnosis and does not provide insights into mechanisms or identify new therapeutic&#xD;
      targets. This protocol calls for continuous development and assessment of physiological,&#xD;
      neuropharmacologic, neurochemical, neuroimaging, and other clinical laboratory approaches, to&#xD;
      identify lesion types and sites in CAF and improve diagnosis, increase mechanistic&#xD;
      understanding, and incite novel therapeutics. PAF, MSA, and PD exemplify alpha&#xD;
      synucleinopathies, in which deposits of the protein alpha-synuclein occur in Lewy bodies in&#xD;
      catecholamine-producing neurons (PD, PAF) or in the cytoplasm of glial cells (MSA). Only the&#xD;
      Lewy body forms of synucleinopathy are consistently associated with loss of catecholaminergic&#xD;
      neurons. Under this protocol we have obtained evidence that patients with Lewy body diseases&#xD;
      have decreased ability to take up intra-neuronal catecholamines from the cytoplasm into&#xD;
      storage vesicles. Cytoplasmic catecholamines are cytotoxic, such as by enzyme-catalyzed&#xD;
      conversion to highly reactive catecholaldehydes. By studying CAF patients we hope to make&#xD;
      discoveries that will yield a unifying, integrative concept for the pathogenesis and&#xD;
      different clinical manifestations of Lewy body diseases. Autonomic function testing under&#xD;
      this protocol is also required for screening purposes for entry into other protocols of the&#xD;
      Clinical Neurocardiology Section. Moreover, comprehensive autonomic function testing is&#xD;
      requested in patients of the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program. Finally, in a long-term&#xD;
      project as a member of the Autonomic Rare Diseases Clinical Research Consortium we are&#xD;
      applying this testing to study the natural history of neurogenic OH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of patients with idiopathic, or primary, CAF, with emphasis on&#xD;
      PAF, MSA, and PD. Comparison groups include healthy volunteers (HVs), patients with PD who do&#xD;
      not have OH, and patients with iatrogenic CAF such as from bilateral thoracic&#xD;
      sympathectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Subjects undergo multiple physiological, neuropharmacologic, neurochemical, and&#xD;
      neuroimaging, and other tests, to see if the results by different modalities agree and point&#xD;
      to specific sites and types of lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological outcome measures include hemodynamic responses to the Valsalva maneuver,&#xD;
      orthostasis, and altered temperature at skin of the back. Neuropharmacologic measures include&#xD;
      cardiovascular responses to test drugs that probe specific components of the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system. Neurochemical measures include plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, microdialysate,&#xD;
      urine, and skin biopsy tissue levels of catecholamines and related compounds. Neuroimaging&#xD;
      measures include positron emission tomographic scanning after injection of 18F-dopamine,&#xD;
      18F-DOPA, 13N-ammonia, or 11C-methylreboxetine.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subjects are patients with known or suspected primary CAF, based on referral&#xD;
        information and confirmation of the clinical diagnosis at the intake evaluation. They are&#xD;
        classified by results of the intake evaluation and then undergo comprehensive autonomic&#xD;
        function testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with primary or iatrogenic CAF are included. Control patients have been previously&#xD;
        diagnosed with PD or MSA without OH, confirmed at the time of the intake evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteers 18 years old or older are included. People at increased risk for PD or&#xD;
        CAF consent in this study as if they were patients (e.g., to enable DNA extraction and&#xD;
        storage).&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects must be able to provide their own consent to participate or have an existing&#xD;
        Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: People younger than 18 years old are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Risk: A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator or&#xD;
        Clinical Director, protocol participation would place the subject at substantially&#xD;
        increased acute medical risk. This includes the risks associated with air travel to the&#xD;
        NIH. A candidate subject is excluded if, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or&#xD;
        Clinical Director, the medical risk outweighs the potential scientific benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Disqualifying Conditions A candidate subject is excluded if there is a disqualifying&#xD;
        condition. Examples of disqualifying conditions are hepatic or renal failure (defined by&#xD;
        serum creatinine more than 1.5 g/dL), symptomatic congestive heart failure, severe anemia,&#xD;
        psychosis, refractory ventricular arrhythmias, and symptomatic coronary heart disease.&#xD;
        Patients are excluded from further participation if the results of the intake evaluation&#xD;
        lead to a diagnosis of a secondary form of CAF, such diabetic autonomic neuropathy.&#xD;
        Candidate subjects who are unable to give their own consent and who do not have an existing&#xD;
        DPA in place are excluded. Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medications Patients with known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to any test drug&#xD;
        are excluded from receiving that drug. Patients are not to discontinue any medications&#xD;
        before the patient or the patient s doctor discusses this with the Principal Investigator,&#xD;
        Research Nurse, or Nurse Practitioner. If it is decided that discontinuing medications&#xD;
        would be unsafe, then the patient may be excluded from all or part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements&#xD;
        are known or suspected to interfere with the experimental results, and such herbal&#xD;
        medicines or dietary supplements may be disallowed before enrollment in the study. For many&#xD;
        herbal medicines or dietary supplements, the mechanisms of action and therefore the&#xD;
        possible effects on the experimental results are unknown. In cases where the subjects wish&#xD;
        to continue their herbal medicines or dietary supplements while on study, and search of the&#xD;
        available medical literature fails to identify effects that are known or expected to&#xD;
        interfere with the experimental results, then the subjects may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Practical Limitations Patients in whom we feel it would be difficult to insert a catheter&#xD;
        into a vein may be excluded. Subjects who are not expected clinically to tolerate lying&#xD;
        still during the procedures may be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from the protocol overall. In women with&#xD;
        child-bearing potential, blood testing for pregnancy will be done with 24 hours before&#xD;
        initial testing (except for obtaining the medical history and physical examination) or any&#xD;
        testing involving radioactivity under the protocol. Repeat pregnancy testing will be done&#xD;
        before any procedure or drug administration under the protocol that takes place more than&#xD;
        one week from a previous pregnancy test. Participants will not start or remain in the study&#xD;
        if pregnancy test is positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Refusal to Undergo Certain Procedures Candidate subjects are excluded if they refuse to&#xD;
        undergo certain procedures. These are: (1) IV catheter; (2) electrocardiogram; (3) blood&#xD;
        drawing; (4) DNA extraction and storage (patients and non-HV controls only); and (5) DNA&#xD;
        analysis (patients and non-HV controls only).&#xD;
