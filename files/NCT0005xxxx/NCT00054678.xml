      The MyoCell™ implantation using the MyoCath™ delivery catheter system may have the potential&#xD;
      to add a new dimension to the management of post-infarct deterioration of cardiac function in&#xD;
      subjects with congestive heart failure. Based on pre-clinical studies, implantation of&#xD;
      autologous skeletal myoblasts may lead to replacement of non-functioning myocardial scar with&#xD;
      functioning muscle and improvement in myocardial performance. Preliminary data in human&#xD;
      subjects suggest skeletal myoblast implantation at the time of CABG may lead to the same&#xD;
      effects. In principal, myoblast implantation by catheter delivery may offer the same&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit. The present clinical study is to be conducted primarily to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of MyoCell™ implantation using the MyoCath™ delivery system and secondarily to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect on regional myocardial function post treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A very promising approach to reversal or stabilization of the post-infarct remodeling process&#xD;
      is the direct injection of regenerative cells into the myocardial infarct scar. Such&#xD;
      cell-based therapy for cardiac repair is called &quot;cellular cardiomyoplasty&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MyoCell™ implantation using the MyoCath™ delivery catheter system may have the potential&#xD;
      to add a new dimension to the management of post-infarct deterioration of cardiac function in&#xD;
      subjects with congestive heart failure. MyoCath™ is Bioheart's proprietary catheter delivery&#xD;
      system being developed by Bioheart to facilitate MyoCell™ delivery into the myocardium via&#xD;
      the retrograde catheterization of the left ventricular cavity. Based on pre-clinical studies,&#xD;
      implantation of autologous skeletal myoblasts may lead to replacement of non-functioning&#xD;
      myocardial scar with functioning muscle and improvement in myocardial performance.&#xD;
      Preliminary data in human subjects suggest skeletal myoblast implantation at the time of CABG&#xD;
      or via the endoventricular approach may lead to the same effects. In principle, myoblast&#xD;
      implantation by catheter delivery may offer the same therapeutic benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical study is to be conducted primarily to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the safety and effect on myocardial function of MyoCell™ (autologous skeletal&#xD;
           myoblast) using a dose escalation methodology following implantation into myocardial&#xD;
           scar tissue of subjects with congestive heart failure who have experienced previous&#xD;
           myocardial infarction(s) and have had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)&#xD;
           previously implanted. Safety endpoints will be the evaluation of the nature and&#xD;
           frequency of Adverse Events during the 12-month period following MyoCell™ treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety and feasibility of using the transendocardial injection catheter&#xD;
           (MyoCath™) as a system for delivering MyoCell™ into myocardial scar tissue of subjects&#xD;
           with congestive heart failure who have experienced previous myocardial infarction(s) and&#xD;
           have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) previously implanted. Catheter&#xD;
           performance will be assessed at the time of the implantation using clinical evaluation&#xD;
           questionnaires. Safety endpoints will be the evaluation of the nature and frequency of&#xD;
           Adverse Events from the time of implantation to the Day 14 follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient meets the baseline enrollment criteria, approximately 5-10 grams of skeletal&#xD;
      muscle is obtained from the subject's leg muscle for myoblast isolation and expansion in&#xD;
      vitro (MyoCell™) at a specified off site cGMP culture laboratory. The expanded myoblast&#xD;
      cells, MyoCell™ will be implanted into the akinetic myocardial scar in the region of a&#xD;
      previous infarct utilizing Bioheart's MyoCath™ transendocardial delivery catheter system. The&#xD;
      MyoCath™ endoventricular device is expected to deliver the MyoCell™ autologous skeletal&#xD;
      myoblast cells into the scarred myocardial region by steering a catheter which contains a&#xD;
      retractable hypodermic needle to the targeted sites for implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a dose escalation study with 4 cohort groups consisting of 5 patients each. A&#xD;
      report of the 1 month safety data from each cohort will be presented to the Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board for permission to go to the next higher dosage. In the first cohort of this&#xD;
      dose escalation study, 2 injections will be performed; for the second cohort, 6 injections;&#xD;
      for the third cohort, 18 injections; and for the fourth cohort, 27 injections, depending on&#xD;
      the size of the infarct scar, so as to inject the entire myocardial infarct scar akinetic&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study is expected to be completed during the first half of 2007, including&#xD;
      completed enrollment as well as 12-month follow-up of the last subject.&#xD;
