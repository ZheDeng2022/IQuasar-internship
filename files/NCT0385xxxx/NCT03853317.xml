      This is a phase II, single-arm study of combination therapy of avelumab, haNK, and N-803 in&#xD;
      patients with Merkel Cell Carcinoma who have progressed on or after checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy as assessed by ORR. Patients must have progressed on or within six months of&#xD;
      completing treatment with either avelumab or pembrolizumab. Patients will received treatment&#xD;
      for a maximum of two years, with avelumab and haNK administered every two weeks, and N-803&#xD;
      administered every three weeks. Radiologic evaluation will occur every eight weeks during the&#xD;
      first year of treatment, and every twelve weeks during the second year of treatment.&#xD;

             IRB or IEC guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Histologically-confirmed metastatic MCC that has progressed during treatment or within&#xD;
             6 months after completing treatment with single-agent avelumab or pembrolizumab&#xD;
             therapy, as per FDA indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2.&#xD;

          5. Have at least 1 measurable lesion of ≥ 1.0 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must have a recent FFPE tumor biopsy specimen following the conclusion of the most&#xD;
             recent anticancer treatment and be willing to release the specimen for exploratory&#xD;
             tumor molecular profiling. If an historic specimen is not available, the subject must&#xD;
             be willing to undergo a biopsy during the screening period, if considered safe by the&#xD;
             Investigator. If safety concerns preclude collection of a biopsy during the screening&#xD;
             period, a tumor biopsy specimen collected prior to the conclusion of the most recent&#xD;
             anticancer treatment may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must be willing to provide blood samples for exploratory analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must be willing to provide a tumor biopsy specimen 8 weeks after the start of&#xD;
             treatment for exploratory analyses, if considered safe by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Ability to attend required study visits and return for adequate follow-up, as required&#xD;

             potential and non-sterile males. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree&#xD;
             to use effective contraception for up to 1 year after completion of therapy, and&#xD;
             non-sterile male subjects must agree to use a condom for up to 4 months after&#xD;
             treatment. Effective contraception includes surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy,&#xD;
             tubal ligation), two forms of barrier methods (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with&#xD;
             spermicide, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and abstinence.&#xD;

             investigational drug used in this study or that would put the subject at high risk for&#xD;
             treatment-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Systemic autoimmune disease (eg, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, [subjects&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Platelet count &lt; 75,000 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Total bilirubin greater than twice the ULN (unless the subject has documented&#xD;

          8. Current chronic daily treatment (continuous for &gt; 3 months) with systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids (dose equivalent to or greater than 10 mg/day methylprednisolone),&#xD;
             excluding inhaled steroids. Short-term steroid use to prevent IV contrast allergic&#xD;
             reaction or anaphylaxis in subjects who have known contrast allergies is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the study medication(s), including&#xD;
             anaphylactic reaction to sulfur-containing medications.&#xD;

             reaction with any of the study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Assessed by the Investigator to be unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements&#xD;
