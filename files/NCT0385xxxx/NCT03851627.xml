      The epidemics of obesity, MeTSy, T2DM and CVD are increasing worldwide. Non-alcoholic fatty&#xD;
      liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming recognized as a condition possibly involved in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of these diseases. The prevailing hypothesis for NAFLD pathogenesis is the&#xD;
      'two-hit' model, with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia playing essential roles, which&#xD;
      have a plethora of effects on hepatic lipid metabolism and can lead to accumulation of&#xD;
      triglycerides in hepatocytes. Accepted treatment for NAFLD is lifestyle modifications. Sex&#xD;
      hormones might be relevant in T2DM development and treatment. Low testosterone (T) has&#xD;
      deteriorating effects on glucose levels, and aggravates in obesity as aromatization of T is&#xD;
      enhanced. T deficiency is related to increases of visceral fat accumulation and associated&#xD;
      with development of NAFLD. T replacement might be a successful way in hypogonadism to treat&#xD;
      obesity and counteract progression of MEtSy,T2DM or CVD driven by visceral fat accumulation&#xD;
      or NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To investigate the effects on hepatic lipid content reduction of a therapy&#xD;
      with Testosterone undecanoate 1000mg compared to placebo given for 52 weeks in patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypogonadism.&#xD;

      Background The epidemics of obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis&#xD;
      are increasing worldwide. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), for a long time unnoted&#xD;
      in the metabolic field, is becoming recognized as a condition possibly involved in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of these diseases. Support for this hypothesis emerges from studies revealing&#xD;
      that NAFLD precedes the manifestation of the metabolic derangements. NAFLD includes the whole&#xD;
      spectrum from non-evolutive simple steatosis to progressive non-alcoholic steatohepatitis&#xD;
      (NASH) with/without cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in individuals without relevant&#xD;
      alcohol consumption. NAFLD is a relevant issue in public health owing to its' epidemiologic&#xD;
      burden. It represents the most common chronic liver disease in the general population and is&#xD;
      expected to increase in the future as a result of an ageing population, the improving control&#xD;
      of other major causes of chronic liver disease and the epidemics of obesity and diabetes. The&#xD;
      prevalence of NAFLD varies according to age, gender and ethnicity. In the general population,&#xD;
      the prevalence of NAFLD is about 25% and the incidence is of two new cases/100 people/year.&#xD;
      2-3% of individuals in the general population will suffer from NASH. Furthermore, up to&#xD;
      15-20% of patients with NASH may develop cirrhosis and 30-40%of these patients who develop&#xD;
      cirrhosis may suffer from liver-related mortality. NAFLD is tightly associated with the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome is a condition characterized by a cluster of&#xD;
      alterations including glucose intolerance/ insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, atherogenic&#xD;
      dyslipidemia (low concentrations of high density lipoprotein- cholesterol and high&#xD;
      concentrations of triglycerides), elevated blood pressure, a proinflammatory and a&#xD;
      prothrombotic state. It increases morbidity and mortality, especially due to cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. The prevailing hypothesis for NAFLD pathogenesis is the 'two-hit' model, with&#xD;
      insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia playing essential roles. Insulin resistance and&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia have a plethora of effects on hepatic lipid metabolism and can lead to&#xD;
      accumulation of excess triglycerides in hepatocytes. The progression to NASH entails a&#xD;
      'second hit', which is believed to be due to oxidative stress, upregulation of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators, and dysregulated apoptosis, resulting in inflammation (producing NASH) and&#xD;
      fibrosis. Currently, the only accepted treatment for NAFLD regardless of stage is lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications. These include weight loss by a combination of decreased caloric intake and&#xD;
      increased physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study rationale Many patients worldwide are suffering from type 2 diabetes with steeply&#xD;
      rising numbers predicted for the next decades. Although much progress can be seen in the&#xD;
      field of diabetic research and new treatment modalities, new approaches have to be found to&#xD;
      cure the disease and underlying risk factors. As men and women show sex specific differences&#xD;
      especially in risk factors of T2DM, a sex- and gender-sensitive approach might be considered.&#xD;
      Sex hormones might play an important role in the development and possibly the treatment of&#xD;
      T2DM. In women higher but in men lower than normal testosterone concentrations predispose for&#xD;
      a higher diabetes risk making evident that sex hormones and sex hormone equilibrium are&#xD;
      relevant in disease progression. Especially in men low testosterone levels have deteriorating&#xD;
      effects on glucose levels, which is aggravated in obesity as aromatization of testosterone to&#xD;
      estrogen is enhanced. Due to this mechanism changes in energy homeostasis are reported which&#xD;
      lead to changes in lipid accumulation, as described for visceral obesity. Testosterone&#xD;
      deficiency is related to increases of visceral fat accumulation. Furthermore testosterone&#xD;
      deficiency is associated with the development of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a&#xD;
      well known risk factor for progression of metabolic syndrome (MEtSy), T2DM and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Thus, testosterone replacement might be a successful way in hypogonadal men to treat&#xD;
      obesity and counteract the further progression of MEtSy, T2DM or cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      mainly driven by visceral fat accumulation and NAFLD and are able to improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testosterone and changes in metabolism:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether low testosterone levels have direct effects on hyperglycaemia or testosterone&#xD;
      deficiency is caused by chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes is not yet fully understood&#xD;
      and needs further clarification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies are showing that the link between hypogonadism and the metabolic syndrome is&#xD;
      bidirectional. On the one hand MetSy and obesity are associated with a higher risk of&#xD;
      hypogonadism in the future but on the other hand low testosterone levels and SHBG levels are&#xD;
      strong predictors for the development of MetSy and T2DM. It is further hypothesized that&#xD;
      hypoandrogenism is an early marker for disturbances in glucose metabolism. Many studies&#xD;
      proved that low testosterone levels may aggravate hyperglycaemia and also may deteriorate&#xD;
      other metabolic parameters such as insulin levels and sensitivity, lipid levels, hepatic,&#xD;
      myocardial and visceral fat content or body composition in general. Just recently the ADA&#xD;
      recommends to test for testosterone deficiency (morning testosterone levels) in all men with&#xD;
      T2DM with symptoms or signs of hypogonadism, which are decreased sexual desire or erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment in asymptomatic men is controversial. Supplementation of testosterone in diabetic&#xD;
      men with hypogonadism was reported to increase insulin sensitivity and to significantly&#xD;
      reduce HbA1c, which was also reported in a long time observational study including men with&#xD;
      T2DM with an amelioration of glycemic control as well as other cardiovascular and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic parameters. Furthermore, total and LDL cholesterol, as well as lipoprotein a&#xD;
      were lowered, and body composition, libido, and sexual function improved, whereas frequencies&#xD;
      of adverse events (AEs) or serious AEs between groups were comparable after 6 months of&#xD;
      transdermal testosterone application. These results were corroborated by a systematic review&#xD;
      including five RCTs with 350 diabetic hypogonadal men showing improvements in fasting&#xD;
      glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c and triglyceride levels. In a recent study depression was&#xD;
      found to have confounding effects with alleviated success in reduction in waist&#xD;
      circumference, weight, and body mass index as well as improvements in glycaemic control in&#xD;
      men with psychiatric disorders. Testosterone is an important regulator of central and&#xD;
      peripheral adipose tissue and shows many inhibitory effects such as triglyceride uptake in&#xD;
      fat tissue or lipoprotein lipase activity, as well as a higher lipolytic activity triggered&#xD;
      by β-adrenergic receptors. An RCT found that in men with hypogonadism subcutaneous fat mass&#xD;
      decreases, lean mass and insulin sensitivity increase and the expression of insulin signaling&#xD;
      genes is upregulated after testosterone treatment. Furthermore, inflammatory parameters as&#xD;
      well as FFA decrease after testosterone treatment. Interestingly in this study a decrease in&#xD;
      hepatic lipids in the treatment group was found, which was not significant in a 24 weeks&#xD;
      treatment period. However, treatment groups were inhomogenous regarding baseline hepatic&#xD;
      lipid content, the lipid content was relatively low for a collective of subjects with T2DM&#xD;
      and the treatment period was relatively short. Another recent RCT found significant&#xD;
      reductions in HOMA-IR, HbA1c by 0.94 +- 0.88% and an increase in flow-mediated dilatation,&#xD;
      which indicates improved endothelial function in a hypogonadal male population with obesity&#xD;
      and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testosterone and cardiovascular risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of testosterone on cardiovascular risk factors is not well investigated as&#xD;
      prospective data are widely missing but evidence shows that testosterone application in men&#xD;
      does not increase cardiovascular risk. Furthermore androgen deficiency is associated with a&#xD;
      higher risk in cardiovascular mortality. Recent epidemiological data suspect testosterone&#xD;
      replacement therapy to increase cardiovascular risk. However, FDA experts find that data is&#xD;
      insufficient to make clear suggestions and that there is a need for clinical trials assessing&#xD;
      safety of testosterone replacement in people at high risk for cardiovascular risk, like older&#xD;
      men, men with T2DM or obesity. After this FDA statement a retrospectively assessed&#xD;
      observational study with over 80000 male veterans with documented low total testosterone&#xD;
      levels was published reporting a reduction of all cause mortality, myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      stroke in men with testosterone replacement therapy. A reduction of MACE was also reported in&#xD;
      a further study in male subjects with low testosterone levels substituted to normal levels&#xD;
      compared to those with persistent low levels. Men with high testosterone levels had similar&#xD;
      MACE risk but a trend for higher stroke risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Especially in an obese population with T2DM and hypogonadism the mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      caused by coronary artery disease is expected to be high, as CAD is the leading cause of&#xD;
      death in subjects with T2DM and often progresses asymptomatic until an infarction or sudden&#xD;
      cardiac death occur. Recent conducted MPI (=myocardial perfusion imaging) studies in T2DM&#xD;
      patients have shown higher prevalence of abnormal MPI, with more extensive ischemia, compared&#xD;
      with subjects without T2DM. The DIAD trial did not show any benefit in prevention of cardiac&#xD;
      events comparing MPI screening at regular intervals with a non-screened diabetic population&#xD;
      up to nearly 5 years. However, it remains uncertain whether asymptomatic patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes benefit from revascularization after the identification of inducible ischemia, as&#xD;
      was suggested in a prior retrospective database analysis and a small randomized pilot study.&#xD;
      Currently in obese men with hypogonadism and T2DM it is largely unknown whether testosterone&#xD;
      replacement has any effects on cardiac perfusion. According to appropriate use criteria (AUC)&#xD;
      for the detection a risk assessment of stable ischemic heart disease MPI is a potential&#xD;
      diagnostic method to detect CHD at stages of high global coronary artery disease risk [42].&#xD;
      According to NCEP ATP III criteria, the recommended tool of the AUC, the patient collective&#xD;
      of TEST2FUNC featuring male subjects with hypogonadism, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      overweight/obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia are at high risk for coronary heart&#xD;
      disease, as diabetes is seen as a CHD risk equivalent and confers to a high risk of new CHD&#xD;
      within 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study wants to investigate the direct effects of intramuscular testosterone replacement&#xD;
      versus placebo in changing the intrahepatic fat content, myocardial fat content, visceral and&#xD;
      abdominal fat content as well as pancreatic fat content of poorly controlled men suffering&#xD;
      from T2DM and secondary hypogonadism. Furthermore, the effects of testosterone on glycaemic&#xD;
      control and cardiovascular safety will be investigated. The effect of testosterone on cardiac&#xD;
      perfusion will be tested in this high risk collective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For studying long-term effects, an open-label extension of the study by an additional 2 years&#xD;
      is intended.&#xD;
