      Objective: Evaluate the efficacy and physiological effects of sublingual buprenorphine&#xD;
      (SL-BUP; Subutex) combined with extended-release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX; Vivitrol) in&#xD;
      the treatment alcohol use disorder of comorbid (AUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: The treatment of (sublingual buprenorphine) SL-BUP + (extended release&#xD;
      naltrexone) XR-NTX will significantly reduce both (alcohol use disorder) AUD and&#xD;
      (post-traumatic stress disorder) PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Inclusion Criteria: Treatment-seeking individuals with comorbid AUD and PTSD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Completion Target: A total of 90 male and female, treatment-seeking individuals with&#xD;
      comorbid AUD and PTSD screened, enrolled, and randomized to treatment group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Potential participants are pre-screened by phone to ensure they meet basic study&#xD;
      criteria. During informed consent and screening processes, participants receive thorough&#xD;
      pre-enrollment education and the commitment to and feasibility for follow-up are confirmed.&#xD;
      Screening visit is separate (at least 2-day interval) from Baseline visit. A participant who&#xD;
      is otherwise meeting eligibility criteria except for taking an excluded medication can&#xD;
      undergo a medically supervised discontinuation and 5-day washout of medication(s). At any&#xD;
      point in the screening process and based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed&#xD;
      above, the participant may be deemed eligible and proceed to baseline visit or investigator&#xD;
      may exclude a participant and refer him/her for appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, participants are randomized to receive either treatment A (buprenorphine 2mg SL&#xD;
      with naltrexone 380mg IM) or treatment B (SL placebo and IM placebo) in a double-blind&#xD;
      fashion. The treatment allocation ratio for the treatment vs. placebo regimens is 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Screening, Baseline and Follow-up, an independent rater at each site performs the Timeline&#xD;
      Follow Back (TLFB), Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), and Columbia&#xD;
      Suicide Severity Rating (CSSR) assessments. Safety endpoints, adverse events (AEs), vital&#xD;
      signs, and laboratory measures are tracked for each subject to assess study drug safety.&#xD;
