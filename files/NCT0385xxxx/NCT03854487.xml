    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of mirror&#xD;
      therapy (MT), with reference to sham mirror (a glass wall) and control (a covered mirror), in&#xD;
      reducing unilateral neglect for patients with stroke in 2 centres.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-one subacute inpatients with left unilateral neglect after right-hemispheric stroke,&#xD;
      recruited from 2 hospitals - Hong Kong and Guangzhou, in 1 and a half years, were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to three groups; mirror therapy, sham therapy (in the form of a transparent glass&#xD;
      wall), and control (covered mirror). The treatment programme for all groups consisted of 12&#xD;
      sessions (4 per week for 3 weeks) movement practice for the hemiplegic arm involved 5&#xD;
      table-top tasks graded according to the severity of patients' arm impairments. Blinded&#xD;
      assessments were administered at baseline, 3-week postintervention, and 3-week follow-up upon&#xD;
      completion of training.&#xD;

    <description>A mirror is placed at the midsagittal plane of the patient. The patients in the mirror therapy group watched the mirror illusion of the non-affected arm in the mirror and moved together with the affected arm. The treatment programme for all groups consisted of 12 sessions (4 per week for 3 weeks), each lasting for 30 minutes. The movement practice involved 5 table-top tasks and the patient was instructed to perform as many trials as possible in each session with a maximum of 30 trials per task, giving a total of 150 trials per session. Treatment activities are graded according to the severity of the patient's upper extremity impairment.</description>

The patients in the control group watched the movements of the non-affected arm and moved together with the affected arm behind the covered mirror.
