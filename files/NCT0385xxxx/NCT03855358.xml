        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - 1、18 and 75 years old; ECOG physical condition: 0 - 1 points; expected survival time more&#xD;
        than 3 months。 2、Histological or cytological diagnosis of relapsed/metastatic triple&#xD;
        receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC).TNBC is defined negatively expression of&#xD;
        estrogen(ER), progesterone(PR) and human epidermal receptor-2(HER2).If there is a pathology&#xD;
        report of the metastasis, take the histopathology of the metastases as standard. Negative&#xD;
        of ER and PR is defined as expression of ER,PR&lt;1% of the tumor cells by&#xD;
        immunohistochemistry (IHC). HER2-negative is defined as a score of 0 and 1+ by IHC, or IHC&#xD;
        2+ &amp; fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)negative. If the ER2 test result is 0 or 1+ by&#xD;
        IHC, FISH detection is optional, but the result must be negative.&#xD;
