      Non-randomized open label study to investigate factors mediating changes in insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, glucose tolerance and other metabolic outcomes after bariatric surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric and weight loss surgery is an effective treatment for severe obesity. Bariatric&#xD;
      surgery also decreases insulin resistance and improves diabetes. Our study enrolled&#xD;
      individuals approved for bariatric surgery to collect data on modifiable predictors and&#xD;
      laboratory outcomes. These data would allow us to systematically assess clinical outcomes&#xD;
      over one year post bariatric surgery and elucidate how insulin resistance is decreased and&#xD;
      diabetes is improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of surgery was selected by the subjects between Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or a&#xD;
      laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Participation in the study involved having a small&#xD;
      sample of tissue obtained from the abdomen and subjects were also given the option to have a&#xD;
      biopsy performed in the thigh area during their elective surgical procedure (optional adipose&#xD;
      and muscle tissue biopsies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were examined prior to surgery and at 2, 3, 6 months after intervention.&#xD;
      Anthropometric and body composition measurements were performed using the Bioelectrical&#xD;
      Impendence Analysis (BIA) before surgery and 6 months post operatively. Morning blood was&#xD;
      collected after overnight fasting during each visit. Some of the non-diabetic subjects&#xD;
      completed a mixed nutrient stimulation study during the baseline and 6-month visit. Blood&#xD;
      samples were collected immediately prior to drinking the liquid drink, and every 30 minutes&#xD;
      after the meal ingestion for 2 hours.&#xD;
