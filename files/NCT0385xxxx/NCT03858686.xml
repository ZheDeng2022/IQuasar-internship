  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase IIa, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2-way crossover,&#xD;
      2-center (conducted in EU; The Netherlands) study in male and female subjects with stable,&#xD;
      mild HDM-allergic asthma. The study will consist of two identical study periods of 12&#xD;
      treatment days each, separated by a washout period of at least 3 weeks (and no more than 7&#xD;
      weeks). Approximately 36 eligible subjects will be enrolled, to yield 32 evaluable subjects&#xD;
      who will be treated with both FP-025 (400 mg BID) or matching placebo in a cross-over design&#xD;
      from the evening of Day 1 till the morning of Day 12 (22 doses per study period in total).&#xD;
