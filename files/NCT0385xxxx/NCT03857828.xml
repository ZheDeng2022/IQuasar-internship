    <textblock>
      Clusterin, known as apolipoprotein J, sulphated glycoprotein-2 or testosterone - repressed&#xD;
      prostate message-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It plays important roles in several pathophysiological processes, including tissue&#xD;
      remodelling, lipid transport, reproduction, complement regulation and apoptotic cell death .&#xD;
&#xD;
      As clusterin expression is markedly upregulated in various normal and malignant tissues&#xD;
      undergoing apoptosis, it has been regarded as a marker for cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a conflicting findings concerning the relationship between elevated clusterin&#xD;
      expression and enhanced induction of apoptosis; that is, clusterin has appeared to have a&#xD;
      powerful anti-apoptotic function through a chaperone-like activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the anti-apoptotic activity, seminal clusterin was reported to promote a&#xD;
      tolerogenic response to male antigens, thereby contributing to female tolerance to seminal&#xD;
      antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the testis, clusterin is secreted by Sertoli cells into the fluid of the seminiferous&#xD;
      epithelium and deposited onto the membranes of elongating spermatids and mature spermatozoa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, however, there has been little information with respect to the functional roles of&#xD;
      clusterin in the male reproductive tract under physiological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, it remains controversial as to whether or not clusterin helps assist the&#xD;
      normal spermatogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) males are characterised by impaired spermatogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although NOA patients have impaired global spermatogenic function, focal areas of&#xD;
      spermatogenesis may still exist in their testes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focal spermatogenesis could possibly be obtained by testicular sperm extraction (TESE)&#xD;
      technique .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of factors have been suggested to be of predictive value for patients with a good&#xD;
      chance to retrieve sperm cell such as testicular volume, serum FSH levels , serum total&#xD;
      testosterone and serum inhibin B levels.&#xD;
