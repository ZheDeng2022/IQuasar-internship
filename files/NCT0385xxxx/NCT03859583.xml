  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of capsaicin rich foods on resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure and substrate oxidation. We plan to recruit 30 healthy lean and overweight&#xD;
      individuals age 18-45 (women) and age 18-50 (men) who will undergo two test days in random&#xD;
      order. During one day they will receive a breakfast of toast, orange juice and an omelette&#xD;
      with 4tsp of cayenne pepper while on the other day they will receive the same breakfast&#xD;
      without the cayenne pepper. Metabolic rate and Respiratory quotients is measured for 30&#xD;
      minutes before the meal and for 2 hours after the meal. Capillary glucose levels and heart&#xD;
      rate and blood pressure are measured before the meal and every 30 minutes thereafter for 2&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;

      Participants will be recruited by posters distributed on campus bulletin boards and asked to&#xD;
      contact the investigator by phone or e-mail. Participants will complete a screening&#xD;
      questionnaire by phone to determine eligibility. Once they pass the screening, they will be&#xD;
      invited to the laboratory to sign the consent form, which will be administered by Rafia Virk.&#xD;
      They will also be given a demographic survey. The survey will inquire about height, weight,&#xD;
      medical conditions, medications and inclusion/exclusion criteria and availability. This&#xD;
      survey will be used for screening purposes only and will not contribute to the research data.&#xD;
      The survey is included in this application and inclusion and exclusion criteria are outlined.&#xD;
      If participants are determined eligible, they will be contacted to set up with two study&#xD;
      visits, pre-test instructions will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *For both appointments, participants will arrive to the test location after a 12-hour fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appointment 1: Participants will arrive at the Nutrition Assessment Laboratory between 7:00am&#xD;
      and 7:30am. Details of the study will be re-iterated and informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      first thing on the morning of the first appointment. Eligibility will then then be confirmed&#xD;
      by measuring height and weight and BMI calculation, and a over the counter pregnancy test&#xD;
      will be performed on women. Demographic survey and 24-hour dietary recall will be obtained&#xD;
      for 2 week days and 1 weekend day. Baseline measurements will then be obtained which include:&#xD;
      Waist circumference, body compositition by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan&#xD;
      (performed by Dr. de Jonge or Rafia Virk, who will be trained by Dr. de Jonge). The DXA scan&#xD;
      involves lying on a table while wearing lose fitting, comfortable clothing. The scanner uses&#xD;
      a low dose x-ray to determine the amount of fat, muscle and bone in your body. After lying&#xD;
      down for 30 minutes, a metabolic cart will be used to measure resting energy expenditure by&#xD;
      indirect calorimetry. For this procedure, a plastic dome will placed over the participants&#xD;
      head that will measure their resting energy expenditure (REE). Baseline REE will then be&#xD;
      measured for 30 minutes. After getting a baseline measure participants will consume a&#xD;
      standard meal. We will continue to measure resting energy expenditure for 120 minutes. Blood&#xD;
      glucose using a glucometer will also be determine before and 2 hours after the standardized&#xD;
      meal. The REE measurements will be performed by Ms. Rafia Virk. Ms. Virk will be trained in&#xD;
      the use of the metabolic cart by Dr. Lilian de Jonge who has over 20 years experience in the&#xD;
      use of indirect calorimetry for the assessment of REE. After this test, the subjects will&#xD;
      undergo a capsaicin threshold test. For this test, deionized water with red food coloring&#xD;
      will serve as the blank. The testing compound will be cayenne pepper. The target samples,&#xD;
      containing very low concentrations of cayenne pepper (0-1mg/g), will also have red food&#xD;
      coloring so that they will only be distinguishable to participant by sense of taste rather&#xD;
      than taste and sight. There will be nine sets of rows, each with 3 sets of samples. Each set&#xD;
      will contain 2 blanks and one target sample. The target sample increase in concentration as&#xD;
      the participant moves along the row. The participant will be asked to taste test the samples&#xD;
      and pick the target sample out of the three. This appointment will take about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second test day will occur within one week of the first day. The participant will arrive&#xD;
      with a 12 hour fast during the first week of the study. They will consume the same&#xD;
      standardized meal (provided by Dr. de Jonge) from first appointment but with the addition of&#xD;
      capsaicin (cayenne pepper powder form) (4tsp). They will then undergo a metabolic cart test&#xD;
      (120 mins). Their blood glucose will also be determined using a glucometer for the following&#xD;
      3 hours post consumption. This appointment will last about 3 hours.&#xD;
