  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project sets out to compare two different splints in the outcome of zone II flexor tendon&#xD;
      injury hand therapy rehabilitation programme. Traditional hand therapy is based on using a&#xD;
      long forearm-based splint for 6 weeks in zone II flexor tendon injuries. Manchester&#xD;
      University NHS Foundation Trust have devised a new shorter splint to use as an alternative to&#xD;
      the traditional longer splint as there are cogent reasons for believing that permitting more&#xD;
      wrist movement during rehabilitation will improve the range of finger movement ultimately&#xD;
      (tendonesis effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to receive either the traditional long splint, or the short&#xD;
      splint. Patients will be followed up and data will be collected at routine hand therapy&#xD;
      appointments.&#xD;
