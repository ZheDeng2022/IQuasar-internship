    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of four weeks of sofosbuvir&#xD;
      plus glecaprevir-pibrentasvir, followed by immediate retreatment of virological relapse with&#xD;
      glecepravir-pibrentasvir for 12 weeks, in treatment-naïve participants with chronic HCV&#xD;
      infection and early liver disease (F0-F2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The capacity to eliminate HCV through rapid direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy scale-up&#xD;
      would be enhanced by shortened duration therapy in key populations. The &quot;next generation&quot; DAA&#xD;
      regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (300mg/120mg), an NS3/4a protease inhibitor and NS5A&#xD;
      inhibitor, provides key features for potential simplified shortened duration therapy in&#xD;
      people with early liver disease (F0-2), including pangenotypic activity, high efficacy, and&#xD;
      favourable on-treatment HCV RNA kinetics. The addition of sofosbuvir (400 mg) may provide&#xD;
      further feasibility for shortened duration therapy with a potent triple class DAA regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shortened duration therapy (4-6 weeks) has been evaluated in chronic HCV populations with&#xD;
      several DAA regimens, with generally unfavourable outcomes (SVR&lt;50%) for 4 week&#xD;
      durations.8-11 In a study among a predominantly African American population of 4 week&#xD;
      duration therapy of 3 or 4 DAAs, with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir/GS-9451 (protease inhibitor) and&#xD;
      sofosbuvir/ledipasvir/GS-9451/GS-9669 (non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor), SVR was only 40%&#xD;
      (10/25) and 20% (5/25) in the 3 and 4 DAA regimen groups, respectively.10 In separate phase&#xD;
      II studies that included evaluation of 6 weeks sofosbuvir (400mg)/velpatasvir&#xD;
      (100mg)/voxilaprevir (100 mg) in treatment naïve patients without cirrhosis, SVR was 88%&#xD;
      (29/33) among patients with genotype 2, 3, 4, or 6,12 93% (14/15) in patients with genotype&#xD;
      13,13 and and 71% (24/34) in patients with genotype 1.14 Non-published data (provided by&#xD;
      Gilead Sciences) from the latter study demonstrates a higher SVR (88%, 14/16) in the&#xD;
      sub-population of patients with F0-2. Thus, in patients with relatively early liver disease&#xD;
      virological failure is uncommon with 6-week duration sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies would suggest that a 6-week duration therapy, particularly with a potent 3 DAA&#xD;
      triple class regimen, may be feasible for many patients with chronic HCV infection, but a&#xD;
      4-week duration would probably compromise treatment outcomes. However, in a small study&#xD;
      (n=16) among younger people who inject drugs (PWID) with early liver disease (&lt;50 years,&#xD;
      F0-2) in Denmark, a 4-week regimen of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir plus ribavirin provided a per&#xD;
      protocol (PP)(n=13) SVR of 92% (one relapse) with intention to treat (ITT) SVR of 75%. In the&#xD;
      same study 16 PWID were treated with the same regimen plus pegylated interferon with PP and&#xD;
      ITT SVR of 100% and 94%, respectively. Further evidence for the potential of ultra-short&#xD;
      duration DAA therapy comes from a response-guided study in Hong Kong. Patients with HCV&#xD;
      genotype 1b were treated with three different triple class DAA regimens, including&#xD;
      sofosbuvir/ledipasvir + asunaprevir, sofosbuvir + daclatasvir + simeprevir, or sofosbuvir +&#xD;
      daclatasvir + asunaprevir, and those with an ultra-rapid virological response (HCV RNA &lt;500&#xD;
      IU/mL at day 2; 18/26) had treatment duration shortened to three weeks. The SVR rate was 100%&#xD;
      (18/18) in the three-week treated population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While efficacy has been suboptimal in most studies of short duration DAA therapy to date, the&#xD;
      emergence of clinically significant resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) has not been&#xD;
      seen, and retreatment with the same regimen for 12 weeks has been successful.8,9 The FOURward&#xD;
      study examined the safety and efficacy of short-duration therapy (4 or 6 weeks) with&#xD;
      sofosbuvir + daclatasvir/asunaprevir/beclabuvir in patients with HCV genotype 1 and without&#xD;
      cirrhosis.9 Although efficacy was suboptimal (SVR12 43%), among those with virological&#xD;
      relapse (n=16), 44% (n=7) had no emergent RAS detected at failure. Furthermore, in the nine&#xD;
      patients with treatment-emergent NS5A RAS, the clinical significance was uncertain, as all&#xD;
      emergent NS5A RAS conferred low-nanomolar resistance in vitro. Regardless of RAS emergence,&#xD;
      retreatment of patients who experienced virological relapse with 12 weeks sofosbuvir +&#xD;
      daclatasvir/asunaprevir/beclabuvir + ribavirin resulted in SVR of 100%. C-SWIFT evaluated the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir + elbasvir/grazoprevir in patients with HCV genotype 1 and&#xD;
      without cirrhosis for four and six weeks, with SVR12 rates of 32% (10/31) and 87% (26/30),&#xD;
      respectively.8 All patients with virological relapse who received retreatment with 12 weeks&#xD;
      of sofosbuvir + elbasvir/grazoprevir + ribavirin achieved SVR12, despite the majority having&#xD;
      NS5A and/or NS3 RAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of sofosbuvir (400 mg) + glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (300mg/120mg) has not been&#xD;
      evaluated as a shortened duration triple class DAA regimen. It has been evaluated as a 12 and&#xD;
      16-week regimen in combination with ribavirin for treatment of prior glecaprevir-pibrentasvir&#xD;
      virological failure (8 or 12-week duration prior therapy), with very high efficacy of 96%&#xD;
      (22/23) and good tolerability (Wyles D. et al. ILC 2018). A non-ribavirin containing regimen&#xD;
      would be expected to have further enhanced tolerability.&#xD;
