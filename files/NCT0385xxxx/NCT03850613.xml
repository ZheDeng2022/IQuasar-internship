    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a mobile app for caregivers and tests its feasibility for a period&#xD;
      of 8 weeks. A mixed-method study design with both qualitative and quantitative components&#xD;
      will be used. A maximum of 36 caregivers will be involved in the six focus groups. Each focus&#xD;
      group interview will involve 6 caregivers of persons with dementia. Another 30 caregivers&#xD;
      will be involved in the 8-week trial use of the app. Each focus group interview will last for&#xD;
      about 1.5 hours, facilitated by a moderator. Before and after the 8-week trial use of the&#xD;
      app, four outcome measures (Zarit Burden Interview, Self-rated Health, Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire, and Modified Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey) will be taken. This&#xD;
      study will provide evidence of the feasibility of the use of the newly developed app among&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;

      Background Caregivers of persons with dementia experience tremendous stress Caregivers of&#xD;
      persons with dementia (PWD) in Hong Kong reported high level of stress due to caregiving&#xD;
      (Cheung et al., 2015). Caregiver stress was defined as &quot;an unequal distribution of&#xD;
      responsibilities on the caregiver as a result of caring for someone with a prolonged&#xD;
      impairment&quot; (Pearlin et al., 1990 cited in Llanque et al., 2016). Providing care to PWD&#xD;
      persons imposed tremendous stress on caregivers as PWD often performed problematic behaviours&#xD;
      that might affect others (Kang et al., 2006). PWD's dependency in activities of daily living,&#xD;
      severity and frequency of behavioural symptoms was found to be significantly associated with&#xD;
      caregivers' depressive symptoms (Lee et al., 2017). Another source of stress was caregivers'&#xD;
      feeling of overload, which was considered as subjective stressor (Son et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of mobile applications in stress management Mobile applications (apps) have been&#xD;
      developed in stress management. Persons suffered from post-traumatic stress disorders have&#xD;
      been selected as targeted population to assess feasibility and acceptability of apps to&#xD;
      manage acute stress or stress symptoms (Kuhn et al., 2014). From the users' perspective (as&#xD;
      stated in focus group interviews), using app was considered as 'acceptable and helpful' tool&#xD;
      for stress management (Kuhn et al., 2014). Activities could be scheduled by the app and this&#xD;
      arrangement was welcome by app users (Kuhn et al., 2014). Apps are considered as potentially&#xD;
      effective self-management tool for persons suffered from stress (Kuhn et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      New feature of the mobile app: e-painting Evidence had shown that intervention of art therapy&#xD;
      reduced stress symptoms among paediatric patients (Chapman et al., 2001), working adults&#xD;
      (Karpaviciute &amp; Macijauskiene, 2016), and older adults (Walker et al., 2016). Group&#xD;
      interactions among participants in art therapy contributed to its effectiveness, thus group&#xD;
      therapy was recommended as 'best practice' (Spiegel et al., 2006). Painting (or visual art&#xD;
      production) is recommended because looking at painting (or cognitively evaluated artwork)&#xD;
      does not show similar effect on stress reduction in adulthood (Bolwerk et al., 2014). Using&#xD;
      functional MRI (fMRI), Bolwerk and team (2014) found that those who participated in visual&#xD;
      art production showed greater spatial improvement in functional connectivity of posterior&#xD;
      cingulated cortex to the frontal and parietal cortices after the intervention than those who&#xD;
      cognitively evaluated artwork at a museum. This implied that painting, but not viewing art&#xD;
      work, had effect on psychological resilience in adulthood (Bolwerk and team, 2014). A review&#xD;
      (Slayton et al., 2010) summarised that a brief period of painting significantly reduced&#xD;
      anxiety score (Sandmire et al., 2012; Curry &amp; Kasser, 2005), distress (Franks &amp; Whitaker,&#xD;
      2007), depression (Gussak, 2006) but increased mental alertness and sociability (Rusted,&#xD;
      Sheppard, &amp; Waller, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the knowledge in the production of painting and its possible impacts on caregivers'&#xD;
      emotion (anxiety, stress, depression) and sociability, we plan to develop a mobile&#xD;
      application which allows caregivers to create their own e-paintings and share with others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify caregivers' preferred functions of the app and training needed to use the&#xD;
           app;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the trial process and procedures (estimate the recruitment rate, dropout rate,&#xD;
           the compliance of emotional assessments in the app);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To collect app users' comments on the use of the app after the 8-week trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine the consistency of the effects of the app intervention on emotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This study adopts a mixed method (qualitative and quantitative method).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative component comprises of six focus group (FG) interviews. FG 1-3 aim to explore the&#xD;
      caregivers' preferences of the features of the e-painting mobile app. FG 4-6 aim to collect&#xD;
      the app users' views on the use of the app after the trial period of 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guiding questions for Focus Group 1-3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What functions are preferred by the caregivers in the e-painting app?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What kind of training do caregivers need before they use the e-painting app?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What kind of follow-up do caregivers expect after using this app? Analytical results of&#xD;
           their paintings in form of a prop-up message? Connection to health professionals who&#xD;
           could provide help to the caregivers?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guiding questions for Focus Group 4-6:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What did the app users (caregivers) think about this app?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What did the app users like or dislike most about the app?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What feature should be added to the app so as to support the app users?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Did the app users enjoy the use of this app to draw their paintings? Why?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative component of the study is the trial run of the app over a period of 8 weeks with&#xD;
      30 caregivers. Participants will be asked to download the app to their mobile phone and use&#xD;
      the app at least two times per week. They will be asked to go through a set of emotion&#xD;
      assessments in the app before and after the 8-week trial. The following measures will be&#xD;
      included in the emotional assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Caregivers' level of stress (measured by a 11-item Zarit Burden Interview, CZBI-Short,&#xD;
           Tang et al., 2015) (Primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-rated health status (measured by the 1-item self-rated health likert scale)&#xD;
           (Secondary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Depressive symptoms (measured by a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9, Cheng &amp;&#xD;
           Cheng, 2007) (Secondary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Instrumental and emotional social support (measured by a 8-item Modified Medical Outcome&#xD;
           Study Social Support Survey (mMOS-SS, Moser et al., 2012) (Secondary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-paintings will be analysed by a certified art therapist through discussions with the&#xD;
      participants. Data about colour hue, saturation and brightness will be analysed. Data will be&#xD;
      collected in recruitment rate of caregivers who are willing to join the study, the dropout&#xD;
      rate at the end of the 8-week trial, and the compliance rate of emotional assessments in the&#xD;
      app. Frequency of the participation in e-painting will be collected. Comparison of the app&#xD;
      users' stress level, depressive level, self-rated health status and social support before and&#xD;
      after the trial will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects. A maximum of 36 caregivers will be involved in the six focus groups. Each focus&#xD;
      group interview will involve 6 caregivers of persons with dementia. Another 30 caregivers&#xD;
      will be involved in the 8-week trial of the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected deliverables&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A e-painting mobile app for caregiver to reduce stress;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A presentation in an international conference (reporting app users' comments on the use&#xD;
           of the app after the 8-week trial);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A paper in an international peer-refereed journal (reporting caregivers' preferred&#xD;
           functions of the app, the training needed to use the app, the recruitment rate of&#xD;
           caregivers to the study, the dropout rate of participation in the 8-week trial, the&#xD;
           compliance of emotional assessments in the app and the consistency of the effects of the&#xD;
           app intervention on emotion).&#xD;
