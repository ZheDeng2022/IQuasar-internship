      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug Jardiance treats diabetes. It lowers blood sugar by increasing glucose the kidneys&#xD;
      excrete. This increases levels of ketones formed in the blood. The body makes ketones when it&#xD;
      does not have enough glucose for fuel. The brains of many people with age-related diseases&#xD;
      like Alzheimer s do not use glucose well. Brain use of ketones might improve mental ability.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see how Jardiance affects ketone levels, which could lead to ways to&#xD;
      improve brain health as people age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how taking Jardiance affects ketone levels in people without diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 55 years old without diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fast before all visits and sometimes during visits. Snacks or meals will be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 study visits over about 4 weeks, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a thin plastic tube inserted in an arm vein for frequent blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have their urine collected throughout the visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Write what they eat and when in a diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answer questions about symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have an MRI/MRS scan. A strong magnetic field and radio waves will take pictures of the brain&#xD;
      and measure its blood flow and function. Participants will lie on a table that slides into&#xD;
      the scanner. They will wear a plastic device on their head and earplugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the study drug once a day for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get an activity monitor and walk about 2,000 steps most evenings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small sensor will be inserted in participants upper arm for 4 weeks to measure blood&#xD;
      glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up phone call.&#xD;

      Objective and Specific Aims: The objective of this proof-of-concept study is to demonstrate&#xD;
      in non-diabetic men and women age &gt; 55 years that a sGLT2 inhibitor will increase ketone&#xD;
      bodies and metabolites used for gluconeogenesis. We also hypothesize that sGLT2 inhibitor&#xD;
      (empagliflozin) will increase circulating glucagon and fatty acids, decrease circulating&#xD;
      amino acids, increase expression of receptors and mediators of ketone metabolism in plasma&#xD;
      exosomes and change Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) brain metabolism measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods: 10 men and 10 women will be recruited for this pilot study.&#xD;
      Each eligible participant will have a screen visit (Visit 0) and three additional 2-day study&#xD;
      visits (Visit 1-3). On Visits 1, 2 and 3, frequent blood sampling for Beta-hydroxybutyrate&#xD;
      butyrate (Beta-OHB), acetoacetate, fatty and amino acids, glucagon, insulin and glucose&#xD;
      levels will be carried out; these visits will also include blood work for exosome markers and&#xD;
      brain MRS. In addition, placement of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) along with a 34-hour&#xD;
      urine collection will be carried out. On Visits 1 and 2 the participants will wear the CGM&#xD;
      until they return for their next visit. On Visit 3 the CGM will be removed at the end of the&#xD;
      study visit. On Visit 1, no empagliflozin will be administered. Participants will return in&#xD;
      13 +/- 2 days for Visit 2. Visit 2 is the same as Visit 1 except empagliflozin 25 mg will be&#xD;
      administered both mornings, at least 30 minutes before eating breakfast and participants will&#xD;
      continue empagliflozin 25 mg once every morning, at least 30 minutes before eating breakfast,&#xD;
      at home until they return in 13 +/- 2 days for Visit 3. At the end of Visit 3, empagliflozin&#xD;
      will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Relevance and Expected Outcome: Elevating ketone bodies may bolster neuronal health&#xD;
      and delay onset and progression of cognitive impairment. The expected outcome of this study&#xD;
      is that we will see an increase in circulating levels of ketones, glucagon and fatty acids,&#xD;
      an increased expression of receptors and mediators of ketone metabolism in plasma exosomes&#xD;
      and a change in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) brain metabolism measures, in subjects&#xD;
      taking a sGLT2 inhibitor. We expect circulating amino acid levels will decrease, especially&#xD;
      during the overnight hours. This study will aid in deciding whether this class of compound&#xD;
      may be used in a larger study to improve cognitive function in patients with diagnosis&#xD;
      consistent with declining cognitive function. We require that empagliflozin be taken for up&#xD;
      to 2 weeks before returning for Visit 3, because we need to fully understand the homeostatic&#xD;
      adaptations that may occur in the metabolite response to empagliflozin due to prolonged (up&#xD;
      to 2 weeks) sGLT2 inhibition. It is our goal in the future to use the information gathered in&#xD;
      this pilot study to design a long-term study in people who actually suffer from mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment/AD and therefore a Visit 2 (34-hour acute study) only, as outlined&#xD;
      above, would not give us the full picture of the metabolic changes that might occur with&#xD;
      prolonged use, especially in a non-diabetic population.&#xD;
