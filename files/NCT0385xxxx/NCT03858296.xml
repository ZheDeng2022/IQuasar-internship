  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the project is to develop three internet-delivered cognitive behavior&#xD;
      therapies for inappropriate anger expression to test the isolated and combined effects of two&#xD;
      types of regulation strategies, emotional awareness and cognitive reappraisal. Treatments&#xD;
      will be evaluated in a stratified single blind parallel randomized block design, along with a&#xD;
      pooled interrupted time series design. Self-recruited adults with elevated levels of anger&#xD;
      will be stratified based on baseline level of anger. The particular aims are to examine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the overall and separate effects of emotional awareness training, cognitive reappraisal&#xD;
           training, and emotional awareness and cognitive reappraisal training on anger and&#xD;
           aggression;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. whether treatment effects are differentially moderated by baseline levels of emotional&#xD;
           awareness, cognitive reappraisal, anger expression-out, anger expression-out, anger&#xD;
           control-in, and trait anger;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. whether the treatment effects are mediated by changes in emotional awareness, cognitive&#xD;
           reappraisal, and anger control-in.&#xD;

      1. Following the intention-to-treat principle, all primary data models will include all&#xD;
           individuals as randomized. 3-month follow-up will be considered as the primary&#xD;
           end-point. We will analyze both (1) overall treatment effect of all treatments (active&#xD;
           treatment phase and 3-month follow-up compared to baseline) and (2) the relative&#xD;
           efficacy for the emotional awareness training, cognitive reappraisal training, and&#xD;
           emotional awareness and cognitive reappraisal training, respectively. We expect that,&#xD;
           compared to a prolonged baseline phase, all treatments will result in greater&#xD;
           improvements in on both primary and secondary outcomes. Further, we predict that the&#xD;
           combined intervention will produce, on average, the strongest effects on primary and&#xD;
           secondary outcomes relative to the separate interventions. We expect that cognitive&#xD;
           reappraisal training will result in greater improvements relative to emotional awareness&#xD;
           as a standalone treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Growth models that include the interaction terms between experimental conditions&#xD;
           (contrast coded) and baseline levels of moderator variables (as continuous measures)&#xD;
           will be utilized to examine moderated treatment effects. Significant interactions will&#xD;
           be examined following recommendations for probing interactions in growth models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Weekly measurements of mediators will be analyzed with state-of-the-art methods for&#xD;
           longitudinal mediation analysis, and we aim to to examine associations among process and&#xD;
           outcome variables both within and between individuals as a function of condition and&#xD;
           treatment phase.&#xD;
