    <textblock>
      This trial will consist of 2 parts. Phase 1 will use a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) dose&#xD;
      escalation design of GP-2250 as intravenous single-dose monotherapy, followed by combination&#xD;
      therapy with gemcitabine in subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer. A Simon Two-Stage&#xD;
      Design (Phase 2) will follow this to assess preliminary clinical activity of GP-2250 in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in subjects with advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer previously treated with FOLFIRINOX but never exposed to therapeutic&#xD;
      gemcitabine&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase 1 of the study, the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment period will be 5&#xD;
      weeks---one-week run-in at each dose level of intravenous GP-2250 monotherapy followed by a&#xD;
      full cycle of GP-2250 plus gemcitabine (3 weeks on and 1 week off). Single-subject cohorts&#xD;
      will be enrolled until the occurrence of the first DLT, at which point cohorts will be&#xD;
      expanded to 3 subjects. If there are no DLTs observed within the first 3 single subject&#xD;
      cohorts, there will be an expansion to 3 subject cohorts beginning with Cohort#4. Between&#xD;
      single-subject cohorts, dose escalation increments of GP-2250 will be 100%. Beginning with&#xD;
      the Cohort#4 further dose escalation increments between cohorts will be 35% to 45%. Subjects&#xD;
      may continue to receive treatment until disease progression by Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 criteria, clinical disease progression as assessed by&#xD;
      the Investigator, development of a DLT (in Phase 1) or unacceptable toxicity, the subject&#xD;
      requests withdrawal, the subject meets one of the criteria for treatment discontinuation, the&#xD;
      Investigator determines the risks outweigh the benefits of continuing therapy, withdrawal of&#xD;
      subject consent, or closure of the trial by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, subjects will receive weekly doses of GP-2250 in combination with a standard dose&#xD;
      of gemcitabine for 3 consecutive weeks (3 weeks on therapy and 1 week off). A Simon Two-Stage&#xD;
      design will be used. In the first stage, 10 subjects will be enrolled. If at least 2&#xD;
      responses are observed, an additional 19 subjects will be enrolled. If at the end of the&#xD;
      Phase 2 stage of the trial at least 6/29 responders are observed, it can be concluded that&#xD;
      the response rate (RR) with GP 2250+gemcitabine is consistent with that of approximately 30%.&#xD;
      Subjects may continue to receive treatment until withdrawn by the Investigator, the subject&#xD;
      requests withdrawal, unacceptable toxicity occurs, the subject meets one of the criteria for&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation, or disease progression, or closure of the trial by the sponsor.&#xD;
