      Background: The relationship between the appearance of insulin resistance phenomena and&#xD;
      insufficient or poor-quality sleep is scientifically documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of an intervention based on behavioural techniques&#xD;
      on sleep in the nursing consultation in the Primary Care setting to improve the level of&#xD;
      HbA1c in patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 2 (DM2) or prediabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients diagnosed with DM2 or prediabetes with poor sleep quality would improve&#xD;
      their HbA1c levels after an intervention on healthier sleep hygiene practices. Sleeping 6 or&#xD;
      less hours in adults diagnosed with DM2 or prediabetes would be related to worse metabolic&#xD;
      control results. Patients diagnosed with DM2 or prediabetes who would value their sleep as&#xD;
      poor quality would have poorer metabolic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Design: Not masked randomized clinical trial. Target population: Patients&#xD;
      diagnosed up to the time of DM2 (E11) or prediabetes (R73, R73.9) with age over 18 attending&#xD;
      the chronic nurses' follow-up visits of the Basic Health Area of Balaguer in the time range&#xD;
      from November 2017 to December 2018. Determinations: Dependent variables: Glycemia and HbA1c.&#xD;
      Independent variables: Sex, age, value of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), declared&#xD;
      hours of sleep, sleep efficiency, body mass index (BMI), pharmacologic antidiabetic&#xD;
      treatment, changes in it, changes in diet, physical exercise and sleep hygiene. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis: Analysis of the comparability of the groups and calculation of the confidence&#xD;
      interval of the difference in the glycaemic values and HbA1c at the end of the follow-up,&#xD;
      with respect to the initiation within the intervention group and within the control, and&#xD;
      control group with respect to the group intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown the association between short and poor sleep quality and&#xD;
      alterations in glucose metabolism as well as the appearance of insulin resistance phenomena.&#xD;
      This issue makes the research on this subject relevant to establish interventions aimed at&#xD;
      improving the quality of sleep. Nursing professionals in the field of Primary Care have a&#xD;
      decisive role in the monitoring and control of chronic diseases, among which DM2 stands out&#xD;
      due to its high prevalence, great morbidity and mortality and healthcare pressure. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is necessary to check the efficiency of healthy sleep hygiene to carry out prevention and&#xD;
      achieve good metabolic control of the patient. Therefore, it is, in this way, important to&#xD;
      prevent the development of the disease in the case of patients with prediabetes and the&#xD;
      appearance of complications in patients with DM2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the overall objective is to determine the efficiency of an intervention based on&#xD;
      behavioural techniques on sleep in the nursing consultation in the Primary Care setting to&#xD;
      improve the level of HbA1c in patients diagnosed with DM2 or prediabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the mean and range of hours that patients with DM2 or prediabetes declare to&#xD;
           sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyse the assessment of the quality of sleep referred by people with DM2 or&#xD;
           prediabetes through the PSQI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Calculate the correlation between the number of hours of sleep declared and the HbA1c&#xD;
           values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare the amount and quality of sleep and HbA1c value in the control group and the&#xD;
           experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the other hand, the hypotesis are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Patients diagnosed with DM2 or prediabetes with poor sleep quality would improve their&#xD;
           HbA1c levels after an intervention on healthier sleep hygiene practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sleeping 6 or less hours in adults diagnosed with DM2 or prediabetes would be&#xD;
                related to worse results of metabolic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients diagnosed with DM2 or prediabetes who would value their sleep as poor&#xD;
                quality would have worse metabolic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The variables are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dependent variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Value of the difference between the basal glycemia figure at the beginning and at&#xD;
                the end of the study. Measurement in mg / dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Value of the difference between the HbA1c level at the beginning and at the end of&#xD;
                the study. Measure in%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Independent variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age. Measure in years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sex. Man/Woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th version). E11&#xD;
                Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus/R73 Elevated blood glucose level/ R73.9&#xD;
                Hyperglycaemia, unspecified.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Antidiabetic pharmacological treatment. Yes/No.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  BMI. Measure in kg/m2. PSQI (pre and post-intervention). Good sleep quality (≤ 5&#xD;
                points)/ Bad sleep quality (&gt; 5 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Declared sleeping hours (pre and post-intervention). Measure in hours/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sleeping efficiency (pre and post-intervention). Measure in%&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in antidiabetic pharmacological treatment 3 months after the first visit.&#xD;
                Yes/No&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in diet 3 months after the first visit. Yes/No.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in physical exercise 3 months after the first visit. Yes/No.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in sleep hygiene (post-intervention). Yes/No.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data will be collected through the computerized clinical record ECAP and through the&#xD;
           patient's own consent and acceptance of their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Necessary data for the selection of the sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Computerized clinical and administrative database (ECAP) of the participating centres:&#xD;
           this source will be used to obtain the complete list of patients with the diagnostic&#xD;
           codes E11 (E11.2-E11.9), R73 and R73.9 and the criterion of age (≥ 18 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Necessary data to obtain the values of the dependent variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - HbA1c and baseline glycaemia values for the experimental group and control group&#xD;
           performed pre and post-intervention. The results of the analytics will be obtained,&#xD;
           according to laboratory criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Necessary data to obtain the values of the independent variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Declared sleep hours, efficiency and quality of sleep from the PSQI performed on&#xD;
                the patient. The average number of hours of sleep on weekdays will be requested at&#xD;
                the time of introducing the individual into the study regardless of whether the&#xD;
                individual is active or a pensioner. The values will be recorded in the initial and&#xD;
                final visit through the PSQI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  BMI obtained in the nursing consultation in the follow-up visits before 6 months&#xD;
                from the date of the visit. Otherwise, it will be calculated after the measurement&#xD;
                of weight and size at the time of the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Antidiabetic pharmacological treatment that patients currently take through the&#xD;
                computer clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in the antidiabetic pharmacological treatment, in the diet, in physical&#xD;
                exercise and in sleep hygiene through a clinical interview with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The instrument used is the PSQI that is a validated version in Spanish facilitated by&#xD;
           its authors from the University of Pittsburgh. It consists of 24 items, 19 are answered&#xD;
           by the patient and 5 are answered by the couple or roommate. In the event that the&#xD;
           patient only goes to the consultation, only the first 19 items will be answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The maximum score of the questionnaire is 21 points. Scores greater than five points&#xD;
           indicate poor quality in the sleep standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The questionnaires will be completed by the nursing professionals assigned to the&#xD;
           patients through an individual, directed and structured interview, after explaining the&#xD;
           study and justifying the access and review of the clinical history. The data collection&#xD;
           will be by manual registration in a grill.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data collection will be made in the Primary Care Nursing consultation when the&#xD;
           patient goes to a visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The principal investigator will be responsible for the review of clinical histories to&#xD;
           obtain the variables and analysis of the PSQI, noting the result in the clinical&#xD;
           history.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two sections will be used in the registry of the information collected in the&#xD;
           consultation to which the principal investigator has access.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  General data section where all the variables mentioned above will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Specific data section for PSQI analysis, in which the responses of the&#xD;
                questionnaire will be introduced to obtain the variables of declared hours, sleep&#xD;
                efficiency and the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A screening visit and three follow-up visits will be carried out to each patient&#xD;
           included in the study in which the professionals will follow a support guide by&#xD;
           presenting the project to the team.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Identify the patient with diagnosis prediabetes or DM2. Analyze inclusion and&#xD;
                     exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Once included, explain the study and give a fact sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Provide informed consent to be signed by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Pass the first PSQI. Patients with good sleep quality will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Ask for previous HbA1c if the last one registered exceeds 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Schedule the patient in a month. The principal investigator will write down&#xD;
                     the result of the PSQI and the clinical order to follow&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  First visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Look at clinical course. The PSQI result and the clinical order will appear&#xD;
                depending on the group to which the patient belongs (experimental or control).&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Experimental: the educational intervention will be carried out and the booklet of&#xD;
                Recommendations on Sleep Hygiene will be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Control: no educational intervention will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Ask for the analysis of HbA1c and basal glycaemia to be done in the 3 months&#xD;
                after in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Schedule the patient for results (3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Schedule a telephone contact (1 month)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Second visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Carry out telephone contact as an educational reinforcement on sleep hygiene&#xD;
                     recommendations one month after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Third visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Look at analytical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Ask about changes in the antidiabetic pharmacological treatment, diet,&#xD;
                     physical exercise and sleep hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Re-pass PSQI. The principal researcher will review the clinical history to&#xD;
                     obtain the variables to study. When the study ends at the last visit, the&#xD;
                     results of the PSQI will be re-analysed, as well as the remaining variables to&#xD;
                     perform the statistical analysis of the results and the final report of the&#xD;
                     study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           First, the initial comparability of the groups will be checked by calculating the&#xD;
           Student's T value and its statistical significance for the quantitative variables: basal&#xD;
           glycemia, HbA1c, declared sleep hours, sleep efficiency, age and BMI. The variables:&#xD;
           sex, diagnosis, PSQI and antidiabetic treatment will be compared by the significance of&#xD;
           the chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The premise of randomness will remain intact, and patients will be analysed according to&#xD;
           intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On the other hand, subsets of the study groups will be analysed (by sex, age group,&#xD;
           treatment, BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
           As a global result of the clinical trial, the difference between the glycemia and HbA1c&#xD;
           values of the final figure with respect to the initial one will be calculated with its&#xD;
           respective 95% confidence interval within the intervention group and within the control&#xD;
           group and the control group with respect to the group intervention, also with the 95%&#xD;
           confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Through our study we want to corroborate the available evidence on the influence of&#xD;
           sleep duration and quality on the ethology of DM2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There have been few studies in the field of Primary Care on the importance of sleep on&#xD;
           the health of people. Sleeping is a health habit and, as such, is a tributary of&#xD;
           educational interventions in the health environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The scientific demonstration that a concrete measure of health education such as the one&#xD;
           proposed in this study, is useful in demonstrable biological terms, would open a door to&#xD;
           healthy sleep promotion activities in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Regarding the socioeconomic aspect, information as a basis for health education and,&#xD;
           specifically, in the topic of sleep hygiene does not require expensive resources and,&#xD;
           through our study, we intend to demonstrate that it can be done from the primary care&#xD;
           nursing consultation.&#xD;
