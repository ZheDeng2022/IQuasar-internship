      This study aims to improve cognition and function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD)&#xD;
      by administering the oral antibiotic, Rifaximin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin is a virtually non-absorbed antibiotic with the unique properties of lowering blood&#xD;
      ammonia levels and altering gut microbiota. It is FDA approved for use in patients with&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin lowers blood ammonia by altering fecal flora by blocking&#xD;
      bacterial RNA synthesis and also by increasing small bowel glutaminase. The Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that rifaximin will improve cognition and function in AD patients by lowering&#xD;
      blood ammonia and / or lowering circulatory pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by harmful&#xD;
      gut bacteria. The Investigators will enroll up to 10 subjects with probable middle stage&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease. The subjects will be given rifaximin 550 mg orally twice daily for 3&#xD;
      months after evaluation to ensure they have no contraindications. Physician clinical and&#xD;
      safety assessments, adverse events, as well as the ADAS-Cog-11 will be administered at&#xD;
      baseline and at the 3 month endpoint and two months after stopping treatment (at month 5).&#xD;
      Interim safety checks will occur via phone calls one week after baseline and then every 2&#xD;
      weeks till end point. Serum neuronal biomarkers, ammonia levels and pro-inflammatory and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory compounds will also be measured at those times. Bodily fluids (Stool&#xD;
      samples) will also be collected. Because of a small risk of developing C. difficile up to 2&#xD;
      months following the last administration of rifaximin, the subjects will be followed for an&#xD;
      additional 2 months after the 3 month treatment ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to rifaximin or rifamycin&#xD;
      antimicrobials. Hypersensitivity reactions include exfoliative dermatitis, angioneurotic&#xD;
      edema, and anaphylaxis. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea is a risk whenever a&#xD;
      patient is maintained chronically on antibiotics, with complications ranging from mild&#xD;
      diarrhea to fatal colitis. Drug resistant bacteria can also result from long term use. There&#xD;
      is increased systemic exposure to rifaximin in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in&#xD;
      patients who are taking P-glycoprotein inhibitors concomitantly. Regarding use in geriatric&#xD;
      patients, there were no reported overall differences in the safety of the drug when used in&#xD;
      patients 65 years of age or over, when compared with younger subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to improve cognition and function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD)&#xD;
      by administering the oral antibiotic, rifaximin. Rifaximin is a virtually non-absorbed&#xD;
      antibiotic with the unique properties of altering gut microbiota and lowering blood ammonia&#xD;
      levels. It is FDA approved for use in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin lowers&#xD;
      blood ammonia by blocking gut bacterial RNA synthesis and also by increasing small bowel&#xD;
      glutaminase. The Investigators hypothesize that rifaximin will improve cognition and function&#xD;
      in AD patients by mechanisms such as lowering circulatory pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted&#xD;
      by harmful gut bacteria or lowering blood ammonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin is a relatively gut-specific antibiotic that interferes with by binding to the&#xD;
      transcription subunit of bacterial . Because Rifaximin is absorbed poorly, most of the drug&#xD;
      taken RNA polymerase orally stays in the gastrointestinal tract. It has been available since&#xD;
      2004 in the US and has orphan gastrointestinal tract drug status for hepatic encepalopathy.&#xD;
      Rifaximin's relatively good safety profile and its ability to alter gut flora and lower blood&#xD;
      ammonia have made it an attractive drug to treat hepatic encephalopathy or conditions such as&#xD;
      traveller's diarrhea. The Investigators hypothesize that rifaximin will improve cognition and&#xD;
      function in AD patients by mechanisms such as lowering circulatory pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      secreted by harmful gut bacteria or lowering blood ammonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will measure a variety of blood markers, such as pro-inflammatory and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory compounds, and analyze fecal microbiota in patients with AD before and&#xD;
      after 3 months of rifaximin therapy. If patients exhibit measurable improvement in cognition&#xD;
      and function, The Investigators will analyze our data to see if their improvement correlates&#xD;
      with a shift towards anti-inflammatory species in the gut and a similar shift in the blood&#xD;
      cytokine panel to favoring anti-inflammatory compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence supporting our hypothesis for this study is presented below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut harbors 95% of the total human microbiome and is made up of more than 5,000 taxa. Gut&#xD;
      species remain relatively constant throughout adulthood until the seventh decade, when it&#xD;
      becomes less diverse, harboring higher numbers of Proteobacteria and lower numbers of&#xD;
      Bifidobacteria. An imbalance in the gut bacterial species can weaken the intestinal barrier&#xD;
      and create system wide inflammation via gut lymphoid tissue which comprises 70% - 80% of the&#xD;
      immune system. Blood brain barrier permeability is also altered. The gut bacteria secrete&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory compounds and neuroactive molecules that include serotonin,&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), catecholamines and acetylcholine which cross the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier and cause brain inflammation and brain dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing number of pro-inflammatory compounds secreted by gut bacteria and seen in patients&#xD;
      with AD are being discovered. These include interleukin (IL) - 6, tumor necrosis - alpha and&#xD;
      the inflammasome complex (NLRP3). A recent study revealed higher numbers of Escherichia and&#xD;
      Shigella in the gut of amyloid positive AD patients when compared with healthy controls and&#xD;
      this correlated with higher levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. The AD patients&#xD;
      also had lower numbers of gut Eubacterium rectale and this correlated with lower levels of&#xD;
      circulating anti-inflammatory compounds than seen in controls. Other researchers found that a&#xD;
      preponderance of gut Bacteroides and Blautia and reduced numbers of SMB53 and Dialister&#xD;
      correlated with elevated levels of brain amyloid Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) biomarkers.&#xD;
      Interestingly, Clostridium tyrobutyricum and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, have been shown to&#xD;
      actually increase the integrity of the blood brain barrier by enhancing expression of tight&#xD;
      junction proteins and helping to maintain brain homeostasis. Recent evidence also suggests&#xD;
      that neurotransmitters and neuropeptides secreted by bacteria in the gut activate vagal nerve&#xD;
      ascending fibers, influencing brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ammonia Neurotoxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second theory is that the blood brain barrier allows greater amounts of ammonia into the AD&#xD;
      brain, triggering or worsening pre-existent changes. The possibility that ammonia is at least&#xD;
      partly responsible for the pathologic changes seen in the AD brain was first proposed by&#xD;
      Seiler in 1993, when he noted that some of the changes in the AD brain can also be seen in&#xD;
      the brains of hyperammonemic patients. Arteriovenous sampling in early stage normoammonemic&#xD;
      AD patients demonstrated higher endogenous cortical ammonia compared to young control&#xD;
      subjects Low glutamine synthetase levels have been found to correlate with increased density&#xD;
      of amyloid deposits in the AD brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain also receives exogenous ammonia, of which the gut is a major source. The aging&#xD;
      colon contains a greater percentage of protein fermenting bacteria than is seen in the colon&#xD;
      of younger patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin lowers blood ammonia by altering fecal flora by blocking bacterial RNA synthesis&#xD;
      and also by increasing small bowel glutaminase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesize that Rifaximin will improve cognition and function in AD&#xD;
      patients by lowering circulatory pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by harmful gut bacteria&#xD;
      and / or lowering blood ammonia levels. The subjects will be given rifaximin 550 mg orally&#xD;
      twice daily for 3 months after evaluation to ensure they have no contraindications. Physician&#xD;
      clinical and safety assessments, adverse events, as well as the ADAS-Cog11 will be&#xD;
      administered at baseline and at the 3 month endpoint. Interim safety checks will occur via&#xD;
      phone calls one week after baseline and then every 2 weeks till 3 month end point. Serum&#xD;
      neuronal biomarkers, ammonia levels and pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory compounds will&#xD;
      also be measured at those times. Bodily fluids (Stool samples) will also be collected.&#xD;
      Because of a small risk of developing C. difficile up to 2 months following the last&#xD;
      administration of rifaximin, the subjects will be followed for an additional 2 months after&#xD;
      the 3 month treatment ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label pilot study designed to provide preliminary evidence on the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of rifaximin in improving cognition in AD patients. The Investigators will be&#xD;
      looking for improvement in test scores and changes in serum levels of neuronal markers,&#xD;
      circulating cytokine pro-inflammatory compounds and colonic microbiota following treatment.&#xD;
      The Investigators will also be collecting data regarding the safety of long term use of this&#xD;
      non-absorbed antibiotic for this disease. This pilot may form the basis for a future larger&#xD;
      randomized, double blind controlled study to further test this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rifaximin dosage and route of administration are the same as that used to treat hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy, for which the drug and dosage are FDA approved. The dose will remain the same&#xD;
      throughout the 3 month study of rifaximin administration unless stopped for safety reasons.&#xD;
      The age and study sample of mild to moderate probable AD is similar to that used in AD prior&#xD;
      trials. The Investigators will select our sample to be medically stable and free of hepatic&#xD;
      disease and not having had recent antibiotic therapy to minimize risk for C Difficile&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the study will occur 5 months after baseline testing and first administration of&#xD;
      the drug. While drug administration will conclude and endpoint testing will be done at 3&#xD;
      months, The Investigators will continue to follow each subject for an additional 2 months, as&#xD;
      C. difficile infectious diarrhea can occur up until 2 months after stopping an antibiotic.&#xD;
