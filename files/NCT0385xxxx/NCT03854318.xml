      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genes tell the body and its cells how to work. Familial platelet disease (FPD) or FPD with&#xD;
      associated malignancies (FPDMM) is caused by a mutation in the gene RUNX1. People with this&#xD;
      disease may have problems with their blood and bleed for a long time when they are injured.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about RUNX1 mutations and FPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about FPD in people with RUNX1 mutations to lead to better diagnosis,&#xD;
      monitoring, and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People any age with a suspected or confirmed RUNX1 mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who have a family member with the mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be screened with a phone call and a blood, saliva, or cheek cell&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a suspected or confirmed mutation will have 1 visit. It will last about 2&#xD;
      days. They will then have visits at least once a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests or saliva sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible skin biopsy: A small piece of the participant s skin will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy: The participant s bone marrow will be removed by&#xD;
           needle from a large bone such as the hip bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible apheresis: Blood will be removed from the body and certain blood cells will be&#xD;
           taken out. The rest of the blood is returned to the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between visits, participants with a suspected or confirmed mutation will keep a diary of&#xD;
      disease symptoms and signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples from all participants may be used for genetic testing&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inherited mutations in RUNX1 are responsible for familial platelet disorder with associated&#xD;
      myeloid malignancies (FPDMM, or simply FPD), an autosomal dominant disease characterized by&#xD;
      defective megakaryocytic development, low platelet counts, prolonged bleeding times, and a&#xD;
      life-long risk of developing hematological malignancies. Disease penetrance and clinical&#xD;
      presentations vary among families with different germline RUNX1 mutations, and even among&#xD;
      affected individuals within a single family. Currently there are no biomarkers or assays to&#xD;
      predict which patients will progress to malignancy, and some patients present with AML as&#xD;
      their initial manifestation of the germline syndrome. We propose to characterize the etiology&#xD;
      and natural history of patients with RUNX1 mutations, both known and yet-to-be discovered. In&#xD;
      so doing, we will expand our knowledge about this disorder and provide access to patients of&#xD;
      interest for research, teaching, and clinical experience. The knowledge gained through this&#xD;
      study will lead to better understanding of the disease progression, both clinically and at a&#xD;
      molecular level, which may result in the development of better diagnosis, monitoring, and&#xD;
      innovative therapies.&#xD;
