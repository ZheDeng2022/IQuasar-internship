      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central venous catheters are frequently used during cancer treatment with the aim of&#xD;
      venepreservation. It can facilitate venous access for the safe administration of irritating&#xD;
      or vesicant intravenous cancer medications and / or other fluids, to collect blood samples or&#xD;
      to ensure accurate venous access for contrast during medical imaging. In addition, this means&#xD;
      more comfort for the patient who needs to be punctured less peripherally. However, central&#xD;
      venous catheters can also be a source of bloodstream infections and other complications,&#xD;
      leading to increased morbidity and hospital costs (1). In our hospital, there is a general&#xD;
      practice that if an infection of the device is suspected, the central venous catheter should&#xD;
      be removed if antibiotics do not seem or prove to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to assess the frequency of implanted port catheter-removal in&#xD;
      cancer patients due to suspected infection of the device in a particular oncology center over&#xD;
      a time period of seven years. Furthermore, evidence for real device infections&#xD;
      (per/post-surgery) and the potential contribution of different (institution-specific) risk&#xD;
      factors on device infection will be explored. There will be focused on implanted port&#xD;
      catheters only, as this is the main used central venous access device within the oncological&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this retrospective descriptive trial is to evaluate the frequency of&#xD;
      implanted port catheter-removal in cancer patients due to suspected infection of the device,&#xD;
      over a time period of seven years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to examine whether the device infection could be confirmed during or&#xD;
      after removal of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At last, the tertiary aim is to verify whether certain variables can be denoted as potential&#xD;
      risk factors for central venous access infection. Selection of those variables of interest&#xD;
      will be based on a thorough review of the literature and discussion with the responsible&#xD;
      healthcare professionals.&#xD;
