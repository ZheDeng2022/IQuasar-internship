  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive treatment that&#xD;
      involves stimulating the brain; however, treatment benefit depends on placing a TMS coil in&#xD;
      the correct place on the head to reach critical brain regions below. Clinicians typically use&#xD;
      scalp-based targeting, a process in which rather than using MRI guidance to target brain&#xD;
      regions for stimulation, they use landmarks on the scalp. Several researchers, including the&#xD;
      investigators' lab, showed that the current scalp-based targeting techniques do not position&#xD;
      stimulation above the correct brain region, and patients fail to respond. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to improve clinical scalp-based targeting by comparing it to MRI guided targeting.&#xD;
      The most common clinical population receiving rTMS therapy is depressed patients. The&#xD;
      investigators' plan is to study the accuracy of certain scalp-based rules in patients with&#xD;
      depression. Accurate brain stimulation targeting is critical for effective rTMS therapy.&#xD;

      Potential participants are first identified and contact is made. Potential participants are&#xD;
      then screened for inclusionary and exclusionary information (see tab 9. Eligibility) that&#xD;
      relate to whether they can safely and comfortably perform the procedures and whether they are&#xD;
      considered healthy or have the disorder for which brain stimulation therapy will be&#xD;
      delivered. They will undergo informed consent that will disclose all the different risks and&#xD;
      benefits for the procedures they will undergo. The list of procedures in which participants&#xD;
      consent to participate is below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three procedures conducted at VA Palo Alto are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Psychological / functional assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interview, computerized, and paper and pencil measures of psychological functioning.&#xD;
           These measures are used to characterize patients' diagnosis and psychological status.&#xD;
           For example, depressed patients will answer questions about depressive symptoms and&#xD;
           potentially comorbid symptoms such as post-traumatic stress disorder. This testing&#xD;
           typically lasts 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MRI and functional MRI Patients will undergo an MRI that indicates where they receive&#xD;
           stimulation by a marker placed on a cap that displays brightly on an MRI. At Lucas&#xD;
           center or the Palo Alto VA and involves brain imaging that will be related to brain&#xD;
           stimulation techniques either through facilitating image guidance or providing&#xD;
           information that will be correlated to data collected during stimulation. Typically, a&#xD;
           session lasts about 2.5 hours since there is setup time involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Brain Stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS-transcranial magnetic stimulation which will be collected at the Palo Alto VA. Part of&#xD;
      this procedure may include electromyography (EMG) which involves placing electrodes on the&#xD;
      skin, typically the hand, and measuring indicators of muscle contraction. Sometimes this&#xD;
      information is used to decide stimulation intensity during TMS and sometimes the TMS induced&#xD;
      response will be a source of data in itself. Typically, this is only a measure conducted in&#xD;
      parallel with other procedures and thus will not be given its own consent. MRI Guided TMS. An&#xD;
      MRI will be used to target a selective brain region. To accomplish this, the MRI will be&#xD;
      displayed on a computer screen and an infrared camera enables identification of the&#xD;
      correspondence between the image and the participant's head. To study errors in scalp-based&#xD;
      targeting, the investigators will perform scalp targeting while under MRI guidance but&#xD;
      without the typical visual feedback provided by the MRI. Then this will be compared to scalp&#xD;
      targeting with MRI guidance. The difference will identify typical errors in scalp targeting.&#xD;
      Typically, a session will last approximately 1.5 hours.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who can not safely and comfortably undergo MRI OR TMS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If they are left handed or their language is not primarily English they may be&#xD;
             excluded depending on how dependent the imaging and cognitive tasks are on language&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Additionally, participants may be excluded if English is not their primary&#xD;
                  language and they therefore do not fully understand the consenting process&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to safely and comfortably undergo an MRI and TMS&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An example of safety screen details for an MRI is detailed in the Stanford&#xD;
                  University MRI screening form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI exclusions include having any non-removable device or implant that makes scanning&#xD;
             unsafe, claustrophobia, and size (e.g. weight, girth) beyond the constraints of the&#xD;
             MRI and scanner bed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For TMS the investigators will follow safety guidelines set by Rossi et. al.,2009&#xD;

               -  Specifically, the investigators will not include subjects whose Motor Threshold&#xD;
                  (MT) is greater than 84% of maximum device output because mathematically they&#xD;
                  would not be able to be safely stimulated using the standard 120% of MT (i.e. the&#xD;
                  device cannot stimulate more than 100% of its potential output)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The investigators will report these high MT data in our secondary analyses.&#xD;
                  Additional TMS exclusions include any history or condition that puts patients at&#xD;
