      This is an observational, prospective study that will leverage existing Standard of Care&#xD;
      (SOC) patient reported outcomes (PRO) and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data and collect&#xD;
      additional Pain Rating Scale (PRS) data and blood samples from patients who consent to be in&#xD;
      the study. Active duty service members and DEERS eligible patients who are injured and/or&#xD;
      will undergo elective orthopaedic surgery are the target population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sleep problems and pain, both acute and chronic, are common among military service members,&#xD;
      reducing quality of life and military readiness. Evidence indicates sleep problems more&#xD;
      strongly predict future acute and chronic pain than vice versa. This same pattern is also&#xD;
      seen in the perioperative period, with sleep problems strongly predicting long-term post&#xD;
      surgical pain. Though tightly linked, underlying biological mechanisms of the sleep-pain&#xD;
      relationship in the perioperative period have yet to be identified, and treatment targets&#xD;
      remain unknown. However, new technologies and methods in the areas of biomarker research&#xD;
      (mRNA, microRNA, cytokine expression), as well as research describing psychosocial and&#xD;
      clinical correlates, may help to identify patients most at-risk for long-term post-surgical&#xD;
      sleep problems and pain, as well as identify new treatment targets.To address this research&#xD;
      gap, the present observational study aims to collect four blood-samples from patients&#xD;
      undergoing orthopedic surgeries at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC)&#xD;
      (N=240), both prior to and in the months following surgery, Additionally, patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes, using the NIH's Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS),&#xD;
      are collected as standard of care in the surgical clinics prior to surgery and for several&#xD;
      years post-surgery. PROMIS scales cover a range of psychosocial (e.g., anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      anger, social satisfaction, social isolation) and physical (e.g., fatigue, physical function)&#xD;
      predictors. Through partnerships with the Defense and Veterans Center for Integrative Pain&#xD;
      Management (USU), and WRNMMC Department of Orthopedic Surgery, the investigators will&#xD;
      identify serum biomarkers (microRNA, cytokine expression) associated with pain and&#xD;
      sleep-related outcomes prior to and in the months following surgery, as well as the role of&#xD;
      psychosocial and clinical predictors, e.g. anxiety, depression, physical functioning, social&#xD;
      functioning, opioid use) in outcomes. The long-term goal of this study are to understand&#xD;
      risks for negative post-surgical outcomes, as well as help pave the way for future efforts to&#xD;
      identify and test therapeutic interventions. Through this research, not only can the findings&#xD;
      be used to improve surgical outcomes, but also increase quality of life among service members&#xD;
      and force readiness.&#xD;

    <description>To determine the biomarkers (microRNA, mRNA, proinflammatory cytokines) associated with the presence (risk-related) or absence (resilience related) of sleep dysregulation and pain prior to surgery. To determine the biomarkers associated with increases/maintenance (risk-related) and decreases (resilience-related) of sleep dysregulation and pain chronification after surgery. Protein Biomarker Analysis: The cytokine expression analysis will be done using the Human Inflammatory Cytokines Multi-Analyte ELISArray Kit. The cytokines and chemokines to be tested with this array include IL1α, IL1β, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12, IL17A, IFNγ, TNFα, and GM-CSF (Qiagen Inc.). For this analysis, we will use 50ul of serum samples along with the 50ul of assay buffer which will be loaded in the ELISA strips.</description>
