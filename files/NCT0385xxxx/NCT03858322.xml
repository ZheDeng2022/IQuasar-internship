  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is dedicated to patients age 70 and older and is focused on understanding&#xD;
      how the investigators can improve upon breast cancer outcomes for older women, a group of&#xD;
      patients who often do worse than younger patients and who are not well represented in&#xD;
      clinical trials to date. Through this clinical trial, the investigators aim to better&#xD;
      understand the side effects, experiences, and changes in physical function that may occur&#xD;
      with chemotherapy. The investigators are also very interested in the genomics (or&#xD;
      gene-changes) and biological changes that may occur in breast cancers in older women that may&#xD;
      be different from the changes we see in younger patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the chemotherapy agents being used in this study are used frequently when&#xD;
      treating breast cancer, The investigators have limited information on how these agents are&#xD;
      tolerated in older patients. This research study is called a Feasibility Study, because the&#xD;
      investigators will be closely monitoring how easily it is to administer chemotherapy to a&#xD;
      relatively small group of participants (up to 40) and to what degree side effects occur. The&#xD;
      investigators will administer commercially available chemotherapy agents used in breast&#xD;
      cancer in the specific setting of the treating older patients with early-stage breast cancer&#xD;
      and with some mild modification of how these agents are given and in what combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants with triple negative breast cancer, paclitaxel and carboplatin will be&#xD;
      administered in standard, weekly doses. Both agents are FDA-approved for use in early breast&#xD;
      cancer. However, carboplatin and paclitaxel are not typically used as a 'stand-alone'&#xD;
      treatment for breast cancer, meaning they are often used together along with other&#xD;
      chemotherapy agent(s) over a longer period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, paclitaxel and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide will be administered, which are both FDA-approved agents to treat breast&#xD;
      cancer as part of a longer regimen to treat early breast cancer. In this clinical trial the&#xD;
      investigators are modifying the way the chemotherapy is delivered so that it may be more&#xD;
      tolerable than the longer treatment course. This clinical trial does not limit the use of&#xD;
      other chemotherapy or other treatments being recommended for breast cancer, but any other&#xD;
      recommended treatments would be given after the participants receive their paclitaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin on the clinical trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Estrogen Receptor and Progesterone immunohistochemistry (IHC) status must be known;&#xD;
             any status is eligible, but this will define in which cohort a patient will enroll:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional eligibility for cohort 1: Triple negative disease- defined as IHC staining&#xD;
             of &lt;10% for ER and PR per local pathology review&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional eligibility for cohort 2: Hormone receptor-positive disease defined as IHC&#xD;
             for ER or PR &gt;/= 10% per local pathology review&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 70 and older at the time of protocol registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-metastatic, invasive breast cancer (scans are not required to document&#xD;
             non-metastatic disease- any staging work-up is up to the treating provider's&#xD;
             discretion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recommended to have either neoadjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy per their&#xD;
             treating provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any surgery, nodal assessment, radiation, hormonal therapy is left up to the treating&#xD;
             provider but should not occur concurrently with study therapy. If any additional&#xD;
             chemotherapy is planned by a treating provider, this must occur AFTER all&#xD;
             study-related chemotherapy is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient receiving pre-operative hormonal therapy and who is then recommended for&#xD;
             adjuvant chemotherapy is eligible, though hormonal therapy should be held during study&#xD;
             treatment administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All study-related chemotherapy must be given prior to surgery if neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
             is planned or adjuvantly if postoperative chemotherapy is planned. For example, giving&#xD;
             6 doses pre-operatively and 6 doses postoperatively is not allowed on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are no restrictions on life expectancy, ECOG Performance Status, or baseline&#xD;
             blood values or organ function; Appropriateness of chemotherapy treatment is left up&#xD;
             to the treating provider but providers should be ok with the full starting doses of&#xD;
             each agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to fill out surveys over time or designate a proxy to&#xD;
             answer on their behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not speak or read English are eligible as long as adequate interpreter&#xD;
             services are available or the surveys are available in the preferred language (i.e.&#xD;
             PRO surveys are available in many languages)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have already received chemotherapy for the current cancer. Prior&#xD;
             diagnoses of breast cancers are allowed, provided that the treating provider feels&#xD;
             that the current cancer represents a new primary breast cancer and not recurrent&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational or anti-cancer agents. Any&#xD;
             additional radiation, hormonal therapy or chemotherapy planned should be administered&#xD;
             once the study treatments have completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy receipt is allowed in the setting of treatment of other/prior&#xD;
             cancers, but no prior carboplatin (cohort 1), cyclophosphamide (cohort 2), or&#xD;
             paclitaxel (both cohorts) receipt in the last 2 years is allowed (given toxicity and&#xD;
             possible efficacy concerns&#xD;
