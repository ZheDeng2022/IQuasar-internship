  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our group recently reported that tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the&#xD;
      IL-6 receptor, may be effective when administered monthly to patients with chronic&#xD;
      antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). The current paradigm to assess response to therapy&#xD;
      involves serial monitoring for donor-specific antibodies, measurement of kidney function with&#xD;
      creatinine, and periodic kidney transplant biopsies to survey for histologic findings&#xD;
      indicative of ongoing ABMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new non-invasive blood test, donor-derived cell-free DNA (Allosure) has recently reported&#xD;
      to have a high degree of discrimination for rejection and may be used to assess the&#xD;
      likelihood of rejection. It has not been tested to see if it can be used to assess treatment&#xD;
      response for rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess longitudinal changes in donor-derived cell-free DNA measurements in&#xD;
      response to monthly therapy with tocilizumab for chronic ABMR and correlate these&#xD;
      measurements to histologic changes on a follow-up kidney transplant biopsy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) is now recognized as the leading cause of late&#xD;
      kidney transplant failure (1). A number of new immunosuppressive medications have been&#xD;
      introduced to the field of kidney transplantation over the last twenty years, leading to a&#xD;
      reduction in early acute rejection rates (2). However, long-term graft survival has not&#xD;
      improved, primarily because of failure to make a timely diagnosis of chronic ABMR and a lack&#xD;
      of effective therapeutic options. To date, treatment options for chronic ABMR are limited and&#xD;
      include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), rituximab, and plasmapheresis. These agents are&#xD;
      effective for treatment of acute ABMR; however, they are generally ineffective in sustaining&#xD;
      kidney function and prolonging graft survival in chronic ABMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade has emerged as a promising therapy for chronic ABMR. Our group&#xD;
      recently reported that tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL-6&#xD;
      receptor, administered monthly to patients with chronic ABMR is associated with a reduction&#xD;
      in donor specific antibodies (DSA), stabilization of renal function, improvement in&#xD;
      histologic features of chronic ABMR, and excellent patient and graft survival up to six years&#xD;
      (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic criteria for antibody-mediated rejection in kidney transplantation requires&#xD;
      serologic evidence of donor-specific antibodies to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or other&#xD;
      antigens in conjunction with histologic findings of ABMR on biopsy for a definitive diagnosis&#xD;
      of ABMR (4). The criteria recognize that the mere presence of DSA alone is not sufficient to&#xD;
      classify a patient as having ABMR, as has been described previously (5). Among patients&#xD;
      treated for ABMR, a reduction in DSA is associated with a favorable response but is only&#xD;
      observed in a small percentage of treated patients (6). Among patients with chronic ABMR who&#xD;
      are treated, there is a subset with persistence of high titer DSA, yet stable renal function&#xD;
      and resolution of active lesions of ABMR on follow-up kidney biopsy. Although these patients&#xD;
      may not warrant continuing therapy with tocilizumab, they cannot be distinguished from&#xD;
      patients with persistently active ABMR without undergoing an additional allograft biopsy. A&#xD;
      non-invasive test for ABMR is preferred, as allograft biopsies are invasive,&#xD;
      resource-intensive, carry a risk of bleeding, and are time-consuming for the patient. If&#xD;
      validated, non-invasive testing for ABMR can be useful for monitoring for a treatment&#xD;
      response and may help guide therapy for ABMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because donor-derived cell-free DNA (Allosure) is predictive of rejection n kidney&#xD;
      transplantation, longitudinal changes in the percentage of donor-derived cell free DNA&#xD;
      detected in plasma of kidney transplant recipients with chronic ABMR may correlate with a&#xD;
      histologic and clinical response to treatment. The primary objective is to assess whether&#xD;
      longitudinal changes in donor-derived cell-free DNA correlate with histologic and clinical&#xD;
      response to treatment with tocilizumab for chronic ABMR. The secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      assess the test performance of donor-derived cell-free DNA measured against histologic&#xD;
      findings on biopsy, provide molecular evidence for response to tocilizumab therapy, and to&#xD;
      describe the time course of treatment effect of tocilizumab in chronic ABMR.&#xD;
