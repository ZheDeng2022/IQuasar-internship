  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to enroll up to 750 subjects over the course of 5 years. Study&#xD;
      duration will be 2 visits over 7 days (+/-3). Participants will be consented and undergo&#xD;
      baseline procedures. Participants will be grouped into 1 of 3 groups, based on infection and&#xD;
      antibiotic status at screening. Debridement will be performed per standard of care and&#xD;
      collection of tissue will be taken from this discarded tissue. A blood draw will be performed&#xD;
      at each of these two visits as well. This is for research purposes only. All other data will&#xD;
      be obtained from the electronic medical record. All standard of care except for the blood&#xD;
      draws.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be divided 1:1:1 into groups with&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: clinically uninfected (1A and 1C) ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: clinically infected (redness, edema, induration, heat, exudate,&#xD;
           tenderness/pain (1B and 1D)) with no recent antibiotic therapy (within 28 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: clinically infected (redness, edema, induration, heat, exudate,&#xD;
           tenderness/pain (1B and 1D)) on antibiotic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Subject Participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening: Within 7 days of baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline (can be the same day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 1 visit: one week after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up period - EMR: 6 months from baseline measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total duration of subject participation: Up to 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Explain purpose and nature of the study and obtain signature on the informed consent&#xD;
      document and HIPAA Authorization. 2. Screen the subject against protocol inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, including all pertinent tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (may be done as same day as screening procedures). This visit may last 1.4-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtain general medical history, demographic information and social history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complete a physical examination of the foot, body weight, height, and vital signs,&#xD;
           including measurement of resting heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure while&#xD;
           seated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Select the target ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Obtain complete history pertinent to ulcer disease including duration of the target&#xD;
           ulcer, previous and current treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Perform debridement if indicated. Debridement is to be performed using a curette,&#xD;
           scissors, scalpel, or forceps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Obtain study samples a. 2 blood samples - one for serum and one collected in PAXgene&#xD;
           tubes b. 5 tissue samples - one frozen, one fixed in formalin, one placed in RNAlater,&#xD;
           one fixed for confocal microscopy and one prepped for SEM analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Assess the post-debridement ulcer size using a ruler.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Perform standardized photography of the study wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Perform additional vascular and neuropathy studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Collect all relevant concomitant medications for the previous 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Clinician will perform standard wound care, including wound measurements and&#xD;
           photography, and apply appropriate dressings/treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Record wound treatment applied including off-loading and debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Urine pregnancy test if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1: this visit will not take longer than a normal standard of care visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess target ulcer&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Debridement is to be performed using curette, scissors, scalpel, or forceps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obtain study samples a. 2 blood samples - one for serum and one collected in PAXgene&#xD;
           tubes b. 5 tissue samples- one frozen, one fixed in formalin, one placed in RNAlater,&#xD;
           one fixed for confocal microscopy and one prepped for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perform standard of care wound care per physician discretion including wound&#xD;
           measurements and standardized photography of the study wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinician will perform standard wound care, including wound measurements and&#xD;
           photography, and apply appropriate dressings/treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Record wound treatment applied including off-loading and debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Any changes in concomitant medications since baseline will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Subject stipend disbursement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up assessment through medical record&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Wound healing - includes closure or changes in wound size&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Wound treatment - includes details/changes in treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Labs/Concomitant medications/studies related to wound treatment - includes any studies&#xD;
           relative to the medical status, wound status, infection, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dehiscence - will be defined as any site along the site of surgical wound closure that&#xD;
           fails to have 100% epithelialization without drainage at the time sutures are removed.&#xD;
           Often part of the surgical wound will dehisce after it is closed. Therefore, the&#xD;
           investigators will evaluate the time until the wound is completely healed. For surgical&#xD;
           wounds this will be the time sutures are removed with complete epithelialization of the&#xD;
           study wound, or secondary wound healing after previous surgical closure has dehisced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Wound infection - infection will be defined and stratified base in the Infectious&#xD;
           Disease Society of Americas classification and criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Amputation - The investigators will document amputation using an ordinal scale (no&#xD;
           additional amputation, toe and metatarsal, transmetatarsal amputation, midfoot&#xD;
           amputation, below the knee, knee disarticulation, and above the knee amputation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Foot related adverse events including hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The investigators will assess perfusion using Arterial dopplers (bedside may be done for&#xD;
           screening if formal ABIs have not yet been performed/resulted) as part of the screening&#xD;
           procedures. If other procedures are collected as part of standard of care, those data&#xD;
           may be acquired from the medical record.&#xD;
