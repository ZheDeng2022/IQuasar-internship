  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical study compares NuShield® plus&#xD;
      SOC to SOC alone in subjects with chronic DFUs. NuShield® will be used along with standard of&#xD;
      care on diabetic foot ulcers of greater than 6 weeks which have not adequately responded to&#xD;
      conventional ulcer therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred (200) subjects with a chronic DFU ranging in size from 0.5cm2 and 25 cm2 will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to either NuShield® and SOC or SOC alone following the 14 day screening&#xD;
      period. Following screening and randomization, subjects shall be seen weekly for up to 24&#xD;
      weeks. For subjects that heal prior to week 24, a healing confirmation visit shall occur two&#xD;
      weeks later to confirm maintenance of complete wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that are randomized into the SOC group whose DFU has not healed by week 12 may be&#xD;
      crossed over to receive NuShield® and followed for an additional 12-14 weeks.&#xD;
