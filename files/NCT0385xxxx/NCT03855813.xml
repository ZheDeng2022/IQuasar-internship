  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: It is estimated that 14% of the Swedish population have knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      Common osteoarthritis symptoms are pain, stiffness and impaired physical function. To&#xD;
      evaluate muscle strength in the lower extremities could indicate if there is a risk for a&#xD;
      patient with osteoarthritis to worsen their disease. Increased muscle strength could improve&#xD;
      physical function and pain for this patient group. A reliable self-test to evaluate physical&#xD;
      function could help patients with diagnosed or suspected knee osteoarthritis to seek&#xD;
      healthcare in time. The 30 seconds chair stand test (30 CST) is part of a test battery which&#xD;
      is recommended to use for patients with osteoarthritis, both in research and in a clinical&#xD;
      setting. It is a valid and a reliable measurement for patients with osteoarthritis. However,&#xD;
      reliability studies of the 30 CST as a self-test is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine whether 30 CST is a reliable self-test to evaluate physical function&#xD;
      among patients with knee osteoarthritis, we want to explore how much it differs in the test&#xD;
      results when the patient is performing the test by herself and also compare it with when it&#xD;
      is conducted in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 147 participants with knee osteoarthritis will be recruited from three&#xD;
      rehabilitations centers in primary care. The participant will perform the self-test twice at&#xD;
      home, and the self-test will be compared with when the test is guided by a physical therapist&#xD;
      at a rehabilitation center. The reliability results will be presented with an intraclass&#xD;
      correlation coefficient and standard error measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated results: It is expected that the results from this study will clarify if 30 CST can&#xD;
      be used as a self-test for persons with suspected or diagnosed/confirmed knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      If this performance test show enough reliability to be used as a self-test, it could be used&#xD;
      as an indicator if the patient should seek healthcare or not due to impaired function. To&#xD;
      seek healthcare in an earlier phase usually require less efforts and often leads to shorter&#xD;
      healthcare process. These improvements of the healthcare process could be of value to manage&#xD;
      the expected future increase of osteoarthritis consultations to primary care.&#xD;

      The project leader will be visiting recruiting units to inform and educate about the study&#xD;
      protocol and data collection procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with knee osteoarthritis will be recruited from three rehabilitations centers in&#xD;
      region Västra Götaland, Sweden. When eligible participants have been identified according to&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, the participants will get written information about the study, including&#xD;
      informed consent, manual to the 30 CST self-test, and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 CST: The 30 CST will be performed on an approximately 45 cm high chair without armrest (if&#xD;
      possible). The participant will be asked to perform as many stands as possible during 30&#xD;
      seconds. Start position is sitting on the chair, and the arms should be crossed over the&#xD;
      chest during the whole test. The stands must be to upright standing position (i.e. fully&#xD;
      extended hips and knees), and back to sitting position. The patients pain intensity will be&#xD;
      measured with numeric rating scale before and during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual to the 30 CST self-test and questionnaires: The participants will get a description of&#xD;
      how the self-test should be performed. The self-test should be performed twice with&#xD;
      approximately two days apart, and the last measurement should be approximately one week&#xD;
      before the planned physical therapist testing with the 30 CST. The self-test results will be&#xD;
      sealed in an envelope together with the completed questionnaires (demographic data,&#xD;
      Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome&#xD;
      Score (KOOS-PS)). The patients will be bringing these data to their physical therapists till&#xD;
      their next visit at the rehabilitation center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical therapist testing: All physical therapists in the study will get an education about&#xD;
      the study protocol and the 30 CST. The physical therapists will be blind of the self-test&#xD;
      result during the testing. They will use the same manual for the 30 CST as the patients.&#xD;
      Participants will be notified how well their 30 CST test results are compared to the normal&#xD;
      population. The participants' length and weight will be measured by the physical therapist to&#xD;
      calculate the body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting for adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patients or physical therapists have to cancel the test, they will be able to report&#xD;
      the reason why they needed to cancel (e.g. increased pain, unsafe due to difficulties with&#xD;
      patients balance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be coded and managed according to the General Data Protection Regulation. All&#xD;
      data will be confidential and only authorized will have access to the patient registry. No&#xD;
      individual information can be identified since the results will be presented at group level.&#xD;
      Data will be saved for at least 10 years to enable audit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated with statistical software program PASS 16. A sample size of 117&#xD;
      participants with two observations per participant for inter respectively intra rater&#xD;
      reliability achieved a power of 80% to detect an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of&#xD;
      0.8 with a significance level of 0.05. With an estimated 20% drop-out rate, 147 participants&#xD;
      are planned to be recruited to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data will be analyzed descriptively. It will be presented as number and percent,&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation, and median and 25th to 75th percentiles. Relative reliability&#xD;
      (inter and intra reliability) will be presented with an ICC using a 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
      ICC-values &gt; 0.8 indicate enough reliability and values &gt; 0.9 represent optimal reliability.&#xD;
      Absolute reliability will be presented with standard error measurement. The analyses will be&#xD;
      made in SPSS with a significance level of p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
