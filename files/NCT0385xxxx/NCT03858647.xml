    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to measure patient performance after cochlear implantation with the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Advanced Bionics HiFocus L23 device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the project are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure implant audiologic performance as defined by speech performance in standard&#xD;
           cochlear implant speech test batteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine scalar location after insertion through either intraoperative or&#xD;
           postoperative imaging and correlate this with audiologic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the rates of preservation of residual acoustic hearing and correlate those&#xD;
           with scalar location as determined in specific aim 2 and audiologic performance as&#xD;
           determined in specific aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate speech outcomes with quality of life measures, as defined by validated&#xD;
           questionnaires including the Tinnitus Handicap Index (THI), Speech and Spatial Qualities&#xD;
           (SSQ) Questionnaire, and Nijmegen Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate intraoperative ease of insertion from the surgeon's perspective and&#xD;
           correlate this with postoperative electrode location and audiologic performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cochlear implants (CI) are biomechanical sense prostheses approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of sensorineural hearing loss. CI's function by bypassing the absent or&#xD;
      dysfunctional cochlear end organs to directly electrically stimulate the spiral ganglion and&#xD;
      cochlear nerve. A variety of commercially available FDA-approved implants exist for the&#xD;
      treatment of severe to profound deafness. Implants are typically designed in two broad&#xD;
      categories: lateral wall electrodes and perimodiolar. Perimodiolar electrodes are precurved&#xD;
      electrodes that are designed to hug the center of the cochlea (modiolus) after insertion.&#xD;
      Lateral wall electrodes are slim and straight, hugging the lateral wall on insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that electrode design and location within the cochlea impact&#xD;
      patient performance. Specifically, electrodes located completely within the scala tympani are&#xD;
      associated with better outcomes than those that cross over from the scala tympani to the&#xD;
      scala vestibuli during insertion. The same study has shown that lateral wall electrodes are&#xD;
      less likely than perimodiolar electrodes to have scalar excursion to the scala vestibuli.&#xD;
      Location matters with these implants because electrode position completely within the scala&#xD;
      tympani is associated with higher rates of preservation of residual hearing. Minimizing&#xD;
      cochlear trauma allows for preservation of residual acoustic hearing particularly in low&#xD;
      frequencies. While this low frequency hearing is of little benefit independently, when&#xD;
      combined with the electrical stimulation from the cochlear implant patients have improved&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HiFocus L23 electrode is manufactured by Advanced Bionics (Valencia, California), and is&#xD;
      FDA approved for the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss in adult and pediatric patients.&#xD;
      It is designed as a slim and straight lateral wall electrode that can be inserted with low&#xD;
      force to minimize intracochlear trauma. While pre-market studies were performed by Advanced&#xD;
      Bionics as a part of its approval for use by the FDA, no post-market studies have been&#xD;
      performed to assess the audiologic outcomes, electrode location after insertion, and hearing&#xD;
      preservation rates when using this electrode. These aims will be accomplished through several&#xD;
      means. Audiologic speech performance will be assessed through a standardized&#xD;
      clinical/audiometric protocol currently followed by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center&#xD;
      cochlear implant team. Electrode location for all participants will be determined using novel&#xD;
      software created by Vanderbilt engineering faculty and graduate students that uses&#xD;
      computerized tomography (CT) images obtained as a part of practice postoperatively or&#xD;
      intraoperatively using an FDA approved Xoran xCATÂ® device, a portable flat panel volume&#xD;
      computerized tomography (fpVCT) machine (Vanderbilt) or regular CT scan at participating&#xD;
      institutions as applicable. These images can be registered to existing pre-operative&#xD;
      conventional CT scans and used to produce 3-dimensional models of electrode placement within&#xD;
      each patient's cochlea. This software is investigational and used in other research studies&#xD;
      for the same purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extent to which the electrode remains in the desired location (scala tympani) will then&#xD;
      be correlated with audiologic outcomes as obtained above. Residual hearing rates and quality&#xD;
      of life measures will be obtained as a part of audiologic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a fine resolution, high quality conventional head CT has been previously obtained, or is&#xD;
      obtained as part of routine care this scan may be used in place of the fpVCT or in addition&#xD;
      to the fpVCT scan. The option of having a conventional head CT performed in radiology for&#xD;
      research purposes in place of the fpVCT head CT scan will also be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons will complete surveys after each case concludes to evaluate the ease of insertion&#xD;
      and will record the insertion via standard recording techniques in the operating room that&#xD;
      are available for any microscopic case. These videos for all surgeries will be blinded and&#xD;
      reviewed at Vanderbilt for ease and speed of insertion.&#xD;

    <description>Patient quality of life assessment: tinnitus compared post-implant to pre-implant. The sum of all responses to 25 questions is the THI score, with a range from 0-100. The higher the score, the more handicap the subject has due to tinnitus.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient quality of life assessment: hearing and listening ability compared post implant to pre-implant. The SSQ 12 survey uses a visual analog rating scale from 0-10 over three listening domains: speech understanding in various listening conditions; spatial hearing associated with distance, movement, and direction; and the overall quality of speech including clarity and naturalness of sound. The higher the score, the better speech understanding, spatial hearing, and sound quality a subject has.</description>

    <measure>QOL Nijmegen</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient quality of life assessment: hearing ability scores compared post-implant to pre-implant. The Nijmegen is a 60 question survey covering three general domains: physical, psychological, and social functioning. Subjects rate each question on a scale of how often they can hear an event as noted. The subdomain mean score for each subject is derived by assigning values to survey items as follows: 1 = 0, 2 = 25, 3 = 50, 4 = 75, and 5 = 100 and then calculating the quantitative mean scores across the subdomains.</description>
