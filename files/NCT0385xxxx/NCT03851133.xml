  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to partner with individuals known or suspected to have pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer to build a biobank dedicated to minimizing disparities and personalizing care for&#xD;
      individuals affected by pancreatic cancer. A biobank is a resource that involves collection,&#xD;
      processing and storage of blood, other bodily fluids, and tissue.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Doctors, researchers, and patient advocates from numerous institutions throughout the state&#xD;
      of Florida have formed a partnership known as the Florida Pancreas Collaborative. The goals&#xD;
      of the Florida Pancreas Collaborative team are to find better ways to diagnose and treat&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer and improve quality of life. Recent research suggests that pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer affects people of various racial and ethnic groups differently, with some groups&#xD;
      having more aggressive disease and a poorer prognosis than other groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators want to partner with individuals known or suspected&#xD;
      to have pancreatic cancer to build a 'biobank' dedicated to minimizing disparities and&#xD;
      personalizing care for individuals affected by pancreatic cancer. A biobank is a valuable&#xD;
      resource that involves collection, processing, and storage of blood, other bodily fluids, and&#xD;
      tissue (obtained during biopsy or surgery) to improve the investigator's understanding of&#xD;
      health and disease. When combined with information and medical images obtained through&#xD;
      routine care, the investigators will be able to investigate biological processes that may&#xD;
      underlie differences and poor outcomes and target them with more effective therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies tailored to the individual.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Investigators requesting to use Florida Pancreas Collaborative (FPC) data, images, and/or biospecimens will need to submit a written proposal to the FPC biobank utilization committee. Decisions will be based on scientific merit, specimen availability, experience of the requesting investigator, and resources to conduct proposed methods. De-identified samples and/or data will be released if the concept receives approval and after scientific review committee and IRB approval is obtained, conflict of interests are checked, and a material transfer agreement is established. Intellectual property issues will need to be agreed upon. If access is granted, the biobank utilization committee may monitor the Investigator's Research studies to ensure appropriate use of the biospecimens and/or data. The Investigator shall provide a written summary of their research findings and reference this funding source in future manuscripts and presentations.</ipd_description>
