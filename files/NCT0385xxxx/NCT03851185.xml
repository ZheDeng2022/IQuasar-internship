  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 60,000 patients in the UK are being treated for severe kidney failure. The most common&#xD;
      treatment is haemodialysis (HD). An important part of HD is removing extra fluid from the&#xD;
      body which the kidneys normally remove in urine. Deciding how much fluid to remove is not&#xD;
      easy. It is normally based on clinical signs, such as blood pressure or tissue swollen with&#xD;
      fluid, but there is a need for better tests to help guide these decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioimpedance tests are one way of measuring fluid status. They involve passing a small&#xD;
      electric current through tissue using stickers on the skin. The test is portable, cheap,&#xD;
      simple, painless and harmless. One bioimpedance device, the Body Composition Monitor (BCM),&#xD;
      has been designed particularly for kidney patients. However the BCM measures fluid in the&#xD;
      whole body and cannot tell us how much fluid is in the blood (the blood volume), which has&#xD;
      the biggest effect on patients' health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to see whether blood volume measurements can help to make fluid&#xD;
      management more individualised. This could reduce the impact of dialysis on patients' health&#xD;
      and improve patients' experience of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To demonstrate whether the addition of blood volume measurements can help to&#xD;
      tailor fluid management to HD patients' individual needs. In particular we will look at how&#xD;
      body size, nutritional state, age and localised fluid can affect patients' blood volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To see if there is a simple way of making blood volume measurements with no need&#xD;
      for expertise or extra equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to recruit 40 patients into 4 clinically different groups and compare results&#xD;
      between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be compared between groups to help us understand how decisions about fluid&#xD;
      management can be tailored to keep blood volume at the optimal level.&#xD;
