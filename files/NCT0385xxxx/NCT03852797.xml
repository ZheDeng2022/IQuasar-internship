  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor uterine tone after the birth of a baby may cause serious bleeding (called postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage or PPH). This is a major cause of maternal death worldwide. In the developed world&#xD;
      the cesarean section rate is increasing. There are two modalities for anesthesia for cesarean&#xD;
      section; general and regional (eg. spinal anesthetic). General anesthesia has been associated&#xD;
      with increased blood loss compared to regional and the reasons for this may be&#xD;
      multifactorial. Some of the anesthesia gases have been studied and there is laboratory&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that these gases may reduce the tone of the uterus and therefore cause&#xD;
      increased blood loss due to poor uterine tone. To date there has been little study on the&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia agents. These agents are usually administered to anaesthetise the&#xD;
      patient at the start of surgery (induction of anesthesia), however they can also be used&#xD;
      instead of the gases to keep the patient asleep using a 'total intravenous anesthesia'&#xD;
      technique. Laboratory work in rats has suggested that high doses of these intravenous drugs&#xD;
      might reduce uterine tone, thus increasing the risk of blood loss. Interestingly, at low&#xD;
      doses one of these drugs (ketamine) may actually increase uterine tone. Only one of these&#xD;
      drugs has been studied in human uterine tissue. The investigators plan to compare three&#xD;
      anaesthesia induction agents on human uterine tissue under physiological conditions in the&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first to compare these three drugs on human tissue. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to determine the impact of these drugs on spontaneous uterine contractility and also&#xD;
      contractilty induced by oxytocin, which is the drug most commonly administered to help&#xD;
      contract the uterus after birth. This is important as it will help inform anesthesiologists&#xD;
      as to the best drug to use depending on the clinical circumstance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the intravenous induction agents will cause a dose&#xD;
      dependent decrease in spontaneous uterine contractility, similar to what has been described&#xD;
      in the rat model. The investigators also expect that exposure to high concentrations of&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia induction agents will cause a blunted contractile response to&#xD;
      oxytocin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing need to fully understand the mechanisms that contribute to the higher&#xD;
      blood loss after general anesthesia during cesarean section therefore it is important the&#xD;
      investigators identify all pharmacological contributors to poor uterine tone. Furthermore,&#xD;
      anesthesiologists are increasingly called upon to care for women undergoing a range of&#xD;
      in-utero fetal surgeries which require a careful balanced anesthetic and strict control of&#xD;
      uterine tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first study that compares the three commonly used intravenous anesthesia&#xD;
      agents on human myometrium: ketamine, etomidate and propofol. This study is required to allow&#xD;
      doctors make informed decisions about which anesthesia agent is most suitable to manage their&#xD;
      patient depending on clinical circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective of this project is to investigate the pharmacological dose-response&#xD;
      profiles of different anesthesia induction agents by in-vitro isometric tension measurements&#xD;
      of contractions in gravid human myometrium. The investigators will study both spontaneous and&#xD;
      oxytocin induced contractility.&#xD;
