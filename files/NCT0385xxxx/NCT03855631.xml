  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Starting from isolating primary cells from affected patients, an in vitro disease model&#xD;
      system for KS will be developed. Using alternative strategies to obtain patient-derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells, an integrative approach will be adopted for defining both the&#xD;
      transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory networks perturbed upon the loss of function of&#xD;
      KMT2D. Combining the self-renewal potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with CRISPR/Cas9&#xD;
      technology, an epigenome editing approach as therapeutic strategy to rescue the activity of&#xD;
      MLL4 will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A step forward is expected towards the understanding of those the molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      governing the aetiology of Kabuki Syndrome (KS) and that the proposed in vitro disease model&#xD;
      will provide to the scientific community an experimental system to study the KS. Importantly,&#xD;
      the aim is to define the molecular bases of KS and to develop a therapeutic strategy that&#xD;
      could ameliorate some of the abnormalities associated with KS.&#xD;

      Main and secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to study the pathological role of ML mutations in KS to facilitate the&#xD;
      identification and characterization of therapeutic strategies to improve the symptoms of&#xD;
      patients with KS. Due to the lack of treatment in the KS, the aim is to develop a model of&#xD;
      this disease from fibroblasts from patients and reprogram them into mesenchymal stem cells.&#xD;
      This approach will generate a KS-specific stem cell bio-bank, allowing the identification of&#xD;
      common disturbances caused by the loss of function (LoF) of KMT2D. The impact of the KMT2D&#xD;
      LoF on transcription but also the epigenetic mechanisms activated during MSC differentiation&#xD;
      will be described. Finally, the therapeutic potential of an epigenome &quot;editing&quot; approach to&#xD;
      increase the expression of the wild KMT2D allele to restore the functional activity of MLL4&#xD;
      in treated MSCs will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the ability to return to normal after CRISPR/Case9&#xD;
      gene therapy treatment on patients' cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology (design study, population, description of groups (if applicable), inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, non-inclusion, main and secondary judgment criteria, number of subjects to be&#xD;
      included, statistical analysis...) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting from primary cells isolated from affected patients, an in vitro model of the disease&#xD;
      will be developed. An integrative but alternative strategy approach to obtain mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells derived from patients to define normal and abnormal transcription and epigenetic&#xD;
      circuits during KMT2D LoF will be adopted. By combining the autonomous renewal potential of&#xD;
      MSCs with CRISPR/Cas9 technology, an approach to &quot;editing&quot; the epigenome for therapeutic&#xD;
      purposes to restore MLL4 activity will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will represent a step forward in understanding the molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for KS. The in vitro model will provide the scientific community with an&#xD;
      experimental system to study KS. Finally, the aim is to define the molecular basis of KS and&#xD;
      develop a therapeutic strategy to improve certain symptoms in patients with KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process (number of visits, duration of inclusions, duration of follow-up):&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 people will be included: 4 patients with Kabuki syndrome authenticated by the molecular&#xD;
      genetics study of the KMT2D gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 parents of the same sex as the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical genetics department of the Montpellier University Hospital, more than 40&#xD;
      patients with Kabuki syndrome are followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impacts / prospects :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of the consequences of mutations in the KMT2D gene on epigenetic mark&#xD;
      changes and cellular structural changes as well as the attempt at gene correction by&#xD;
      CRISPR/Cas9 will provide a better understanding of the disease (and the genes that are&#xD;
      deregulated by post-KMT2D epigenetic changes) and will also open a promising path for gene&#xD;
      therapy by CRISPR/Cas9 method.&#xD;
