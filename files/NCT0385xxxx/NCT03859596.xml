      Background: One anastomosis Gastric Bypass/Mini Gastric Bypass (OAGB/MGB) is a new operation&#xD;
      that provides comparable outcomes to the common bariatric procedures. Revisional surgery is&#xD;
      still needed after a number of OAGB/MGB procedures. The aim of this study is to report the&#xD;
      causes and management of these revisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: From 2010 -2018, 925 OAGB/MGB operations were performed at 7 bariatric units across&#xD;
      the United Kingdom and included in this retrospective cohort study. The data was&#xD;
      retrospectively collected and analysed. The primary end point was identification of the&#xD;
      causes and management of revisions. Follow up ranged from 6 months to 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Twenty-two patients (2.3%) required revisional surgery after OAGB/MGB. Five patients&#xD;
      (0.5%) developed severe diarrhoea managed by shortening the bilio-pancreatic limb (BPL) to&#xD;
      150cm. Four patients (0.4%) developed afferent loop syndrome and bile reflux was reported in&#xD;
      another 3 (0.3%) cases; all were managed by either conversion to Roux en Y Gastric Bypass&#xD;
      (RYGB) or a Braun anastomosis. Postoperative bleeding was controlled laparoscopically in 3&#xD;
      patients (0.3%). Liver decompensation was reported in 2 patients (0.2%) was treated by&#xD;
      shortening the BPL in one patient and a reversal to normal anatomy in another. The liver&#xD;
      failure resolved in both patients. Other indications for revision included two gastro-jejunal&#xD;
      stenosis (0.2%), one perforated ulcer (0.1%), one patient (0.1%) with excessive weight loss&#xD;
      and one case (0.1%) of protein malnutrition. None of the 22 patients undergoing revisional&#xD;
      surgery after OAGB/MBG died. Lost to follow up rate was 0.2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Complications requiring revisional surgery after OAGB/MGB are uncommon (2.3%) and&#xD;
      the majority can be managed by bilio-pancreatic limb shortening, the addition of a Braun&#xD;
      side-to-side anastomosis or conversion to RYGB. Bilio-pancreatic limb length of 200 cm or&#xD;
      more resulted in serious complications of liver failure, protein malnutrition, excessive&#xD;
      weight loss and diarrhoea.&#xD;

      The UK OAGB/MGB collaborative group of 12 consultant bariatric surgeons was founded in 2017&#xD;
      and the data of 925 OAGB/MGB procedures were retrospectively collected and analysed in this&#xD;
      cohort study. The treatment pathway is the SAME at each NHS centre. The indications for&#xD;
      referral, consultations, and follow up after surgery are similar. This is agreed bariatric&#xD;
      practice governed by British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society's [BOMSS] guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' age, BMI, presence of T2DM, comorbidities, Gastro-oesophageal reflux and hiatus&#xD;
      hernia, Barrett's oesophagus, family history of upper gastro-intestinal cancer, and the&#xD;
      patient choice were the main factors to influence the decision to the procedure type. Each&#xD;
      centre is offering Roux en Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG),&#xD;
      MGB/OAGB and Adjustable Gastric Band (AGB). The allocation of the procedure is finalised&#xD;
      after mutual agreement between the patient and the surgeon taking in consideration the above&#xD;
      factors and patient's choice. The data was retrospectively collected by the surgical team at&#xD;
      each institution and sent to the lead of the collaborative group. The follow up is conducted&#xD;
      by clinical visits, blood tests and radiology [ultrasound, computed tomography ] when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures were performed between September 2010 and May 2018. A long gastric pouch of&#xD;
      average 15cm was constructed over a 34-36F bougie using laparoscopic staplers. The start&#xD;
      point of stapling is at the crow's foot. The omentum was only divided in selected cases such&#xD;
      as male patients with a very high Body Mass Index (BMI). After identifying the&#xD;
      duodeno-jejunal junction, a BPL ranging from 150-300 cm was measured. The end-side /side-side&#xD;
      gastro-jejunostomy was made using a combined hand-sewn /stapled technique. Use of drains and&#xD;
      closure of Petersen's space varied between different surgeons. The patients were discharged&#xD;
      after 2-3 nights. The follow up was ranged from 6 months to 3 years. In the UK the NHS and&#xD;
      private practice are following National Institute of Clinical Excellence [NICE] guidelines in&#xD;
      management and post operative follow up. Thus there is very strict follow up for two years&#xD;
      after the operation. The patients are seen two weeks after the primary surgery at which&#xD;
      clinical examination, dietary assessment and baseline post operative blood test is performed.&#xD;
      Then the patients are seen one month after that, then 3 monthly period for the initial year,&#xD;
      and 6 monthly for the last year. During all these visits, clinical, dietary and routine&#xD;
      biochemical assessments were conducted. For patients who developed complications, a different&#xD;
      and longer pathway of follow up is adopted until they recover and then, discharged to their&#xD;
      general practitioners (GPs). The paper was written to comply with STROCSS guidelines&#xD;
      (www.strocssguideline.com).&#xD;
