    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if paediatric intensive care nurses and&#xD;
      physicians can identify non-convulsive seizures in critically ill children using quantitative&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG), in real time at the bedside. Quantitative EEG is a computer&#xD;
      software tool which summarizes large volumes of brain wave electrical activity, called EEG&#xD;
      into simple graphs and patterns. This has helped to shorten the EEG reading time.The study&#xD;
      will also describe the neurological outcome of children monitored this way and assess if it's&#xD;
      possible to use this approach. The investigators hypothesis is that paediatric intensive care&#xD;
      nurses and physicians with focused training should be the first to identify non-convulsive&#xD;
      seizures at the bedside using quantitative EEG, with reasonable accuracy and reliability.&#xD;
      They should be able to confirm their findings with a neurologist to treat seizures quickly&#xD;
      without over treatment. Due to the small numbers in this pilot study, the investigators are&#xD;
      unlikely to be able to draw definitive conclusions on the clinical effects of this approach&#xD;
      on the short- or long-term outcomes. This proof-of-concept study should, enable the&#xD;
      investigators to assess if it's possible to use this method for a future multi-centre&#xD;
      controlled study.&#xD;

      Overall Goals: The overall goals of this research are to: (i) determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      studying another approach to the detection of non-convulsive seizures in the paediatric&#xD;
      intensive care unit, (ii) determine if paediatric intensive care nurses and&#xD;
      non-neurophysiologist critical-care physicians can accurately identify seizures in critically&#xD;
      ill children by reading quantitative EEG trends, as well as the positive and negative&#xD;
      predictive value and inter-rater reliability of this approach, (iii) explore children's&#xD;
      short- and long-term neurological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Non-convulsive seizures and non-convulsive status epilepticus are common in&#xD;
      children with acute brain injury admitted to paediatric intensive care units. Electrographic&#xD;
      seizure burden and status epilepticus contribute to neuronal injury, and worsen functional&#xD;
      and quality of life outcomes. Accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment of non-convulsive&#xD;
      seizures are essential in these critically ill children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This exploratory study aims to: (i) enable the investigators, after proof of&#xD;
      concept, to assess the feasibility of this method, (ii) determine the performance - in real&#xD;
      time at the bedside of critically ill children - of caregivers other than neurologists to&#xD;
      identify electrographical seizures, using panels of quantitative EEG trends, and (iii)&#xD;
      describe the outcome of these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This pilot study will be a single-centre prospective open observational study. Thirty&#xD;
      consecutive children who meet the specific criteria for continuous EEG in the paediatric&#xD;
      intensive care unit at McMaster Children's Hospital will be eligible for enrolment. The&#xD;
      paediatric intensive care nurse and resident or fellow will review the quantitative EEG&#xD;
      trends to detect seizures at the bedside and complete the seizure log. This will be compared&#xD;
      to the seizures detected on the raw EEG data read by the neurologist. Demographic data,&#xD;
      baseline, short- and long-term (12-month) questionnaires of each child's global function,&#xD;
      quality of life, seizures and brain behaviour will be completed to assess functional and&#xD;
      quality of life outcomes. This will include a Seizure questionnaire, the Glasgow Outcome&#xD;
      scale, the Paediatric Cerebral Performance Category score, the Paediatric Quality of Life&#xD;
      Inventory, the Adaptive Behaviour Assessment System 3, the Child Behaviour Checklist and the&#xD;
      Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expertise: The investigator team includes research experts in neurology, epilepsy,&#xD;
      neurophysiology, developmental paediatrics, critical care and biostatistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Due to the small numbers in this pilot study, the investigators are unlikely to&#xD;
      be able to draw definitive conclusions on the clinical effects of this approach on the short-&#xD;
      or long-term outcomes. This proof-of-concept study should enable the investigators to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of this method for a future multi-centre controlled study, which has the&#xD;
      potential to revise and considerably improve the method of detecting non-convulsive seizures&#xD;
      in the paediatric intensive care unit. If earlier detection and treatment of seizures in&#xD;
      critically ill children are feasible, this should lead to improvements in short- and&#xD;
      long-term neurological outcome and quality of life. These improvements may substantially&#xD;
      benefit the person, family and society while reducing the burden placed on the health care&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
