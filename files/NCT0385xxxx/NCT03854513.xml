  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive loss in renal function over a period of months&#xD;
      or years. As kidney function declines, there is progressive deterioration in mineral&#xD;
      homeostasis manifesting as disruption of serum and tissue concentrations of phosphorus and&#xD;
      calcium (Ca), as well as changes in circulating levels of hormones such as parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone (PTH). These mineral and endocrine functions are critically important in the&#xD;
      regulation of both initial bone formation during growth (bone modeling) and bone structure&#xD;
      and function during adulthood (bone remodeling) Residual renal function (RRF) plays an&#xD;
      important role in maintaining fluid balance, phosphorus control, nutrition, and removal of&#xD;
      middle molecular uremic toxins. Decline of RRF also contributes significantly to anemia,&#xD;
      inflammation, and malnutrition in patients on dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation and activation of acute-phase responses are common in chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causes of inflammation in HD patients are multifactorial. Inflammatory reaction may&#xD;
      originate from several sources, including graft or fistula infections, bioincompatible&#xD;
      dialysis membrane, dialysate, endotoxin exposure, back filtration, chronic infections, and&#xD;
      malnutrition. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) assay is useful for sensitive&#xD;
      detection of the inflammatory state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residual renal function (RRF) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy is defined as the ability of native kidneys to eliminate water and uremic&#xD;
      toxins. In clinical practice, it is considered synonymous with such parameters as daily&#xD;
      diuresis and/or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The optimal method to measure RRF has not&#xD;
      been established . RRF remains important even after beginning of dialysis. RRF contributes&#xD;
      significantly to the overall health and well-being of patients on dialysis Residual Renal&#xD;
      (RRF) plays an important role in maintaining fluid balance, phosphorus control, nutrition,&#xD;
      and removal of middle molecular uremic toxins and shows inverse relationships with valvular&#xD;
      calcification and cardiac hypertrophy in patients on dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decline in RRF also contributes significantly to anemia, inflammation, and malnutrition in&#xD;
      patients on dialysis . RRF may allow for a reduction in the duration of hemodialysis (HD)&#xD;
      sessions and the need for dietary and fluid restrictions in both patients on peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis (PD) and patients on HD. More importantly, the loss of RRF is a powerful predictor&#xD;
      of mortality. Much of RRF is lost during the first 18 months of HD, and appears to depend on&#xD;
      the primary cause(s) of kidney failure as well as on other patient-related and&#xD;
      treatment-related factors&#xD;
