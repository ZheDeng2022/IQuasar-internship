  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) relies on stimulation of pain-relieving pathways in the spinal&#xD;
      cord to treat chronic neuropathic pain. Traditional paresthesia-based SCS (PB-SCS) relies on&#xD;
      providing analgesia through stimulation of spinal cord dorsal columns but it is often&#xD;
      associated with attenuation of analgesic benefit and lack of acceptance of paresthesias.&#xD;
      Recently introduced three different paresthesia-free (PF-SCS) modes of stimulation aim to&#xD;
      overcome limitations of PB-SCS. Several questions regarding PB and PF SCS modes remain&#xD;
      unanswered including the mechanisms of therapeutic benefit, criteria for selecting patients&#xD;
      likely to benefit, and long-term outcomes. A concerted effort is required to understand and&#xD;
      optimize utilization of SCS. This project has the twin goals of using neuroimaging techniques&#xD;
      to understand mechanisms that underlies analgesic benefit from PB/PF-SCS modes and to&#xD;
      identify criteria for selecting patients based on monitoring of pain and its related domains&#xD;
      in patients undergoing SCS trials. Achieving these objectives will increase probability of&#xD;
      analgesic benefit while minimizing adverse effects and knowledge gains from this study will&#xD;
      be applicable to other therapies for chronic pain conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 7 million Canadians suffer from chronic pain with 1 in 4 patients having neuropathic&#xD;
      pain (NP), a condition caused by injury to nerves in the body. NP tends to have an extremely&#xD;
      unpleasant character, severe intensity, and a persistent unremitting course. Conventional&#xD;
      medical management (CMM) is often ineffective in relieving NP in majority of these patients.&#xD;
      Paresthesia-Based Spinal Cord Stimulation (PB-SCS) has been used to treat NP but it has&#xD;
      limitations in terms of preserving analgesic benefit and it is often associated with adverse&#xD;
      effects. Recently introduced Paresthesia-Free SCS (PF-SCS), available at all tertiary level&#xD;
      pain centers, has the potential to overcome these limitations but knowledge gaps remain in&#xD;
      understanding and applying this modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will be a prospective, exploratory study with randomization of order of no&#xD;
      stimulation with novel modes of PF-SCS during the SCS trial and blinding of subjects (as per&#xD;
      clinical standard of care) and outcome assessors. Participants with appropriate indications&#xD;
      for trial of SCS with novel paresthesia-free modes will be enrolled. Baseline demographic and&#xD;
      pain-related data including opioid intake in Oral Morphine Equivalents Per day in mg (OMED)&#xD;
      will be collected. Pre-SCS trial neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG) and QST will be performed to&#xD;
      establish parameters for future comparisons. Data on physical activity and sleep will be&#xD;
      collected using actigraphy, as per standard of care. Data on pain and its related domains&#xD;
      will be collected using validated questionnaires on the Manage My Pain app, in which all&#xD;
      questionnaires administered are part of the patient's clinical standard of care. Ninety&#xD;
      subjects will undergo a percutaneous trial of SCS that will last 12 days and the trial will&#xD;
      be divided into three phases. All subjects will trial a conventional paresthesia-based SCS&#xD;
      mode in the first four days of the trial. Subjects will then proceed the next four days (day&#xD;
      5-8) with no (placebo) stimulation, followed by one of the three novel PF-SCS modes (Burst,&#xD;
      High Frequency, High Density) for the last 4 days of the trial. This process is currently&#xD;
      adopted for all patients receiving SCS as standard of care. Neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG) and QST&#xD;
      will be performed at the end of the SCS trial. Subjects who achieve significant reduction in&#xD;
      pain, disability and sleep disturbance questionnaire scores with one of the novel PF-SCS&#xD;
      modes will be offered percutaneous implantation of SCS system 4 to 6 weeks after the end of&#xD;
      the trial using the novel PF-SCS mode they experienced during the trial. MEG and QST will be&#xD;
      performed and data from validated questionnaires on the Manage My Pain app will be collected&#xD;
      at 6 months after implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), MEG (Magnetoencephalography), and QST&#xD;
      (Quantitative Sensory Testing) in this study will help improve understanding of the&#xD;
      alteration in brain in NP and the analgesic action of PB/PF-SCS. Validation of wearable&#xD;
      technology and of app-based digital platforms will allow these available but&#xD;
      infrequently-used modalities to improve success of analgesic treatments in patients with&#xD;
      chronic pain. Healthcare systems will benefit through efficient use of resources to treat&#xD;
      chronic pain made possible by understanding what works, who does it work for, and how to&#xD;
      predict analgesic benefit.&#xD;

    <description>At baseline, the following data will be recorded: standard-of-care questionnaire scores, neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG), psychophysical testing (QST), accelerometer sleep and activity data.&#xD;
The trial will proceed as follows:&#xD;
Day 1-4: Paresthesia-based SCS (PB-SCS)&#xD;
Day 5-8: No SCS (placebo)&#xD;
Day 9-12: PF-SCS&#xD;
Neuroimaging and psychophysical testing will be conducted at the end of the trial, and will be assessed 6-months post-implantation of the SCS device along with adverse effects. A decision to implant the SCS system will be made based on reduction of patient pain intensity by 50% in PB-SCS and/or PF-SCS modes, but not with placebo SCS.&#xD;
Based on the response in the trial, the patient will either not be a candidate for an SCS implant, or they will receive one of the four modes upon implantation (PB-SCS, or one of the three PF-SCS: Burst, High Frequency, High Density).</description>
