  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial diseases are complex diseases with great clinical and genetic heterogeneity and&#xD;
      their diagnosis is difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medical Genetics Department includes among its activities the diagnosis of these&#xD;
      diseases. It has been a reference centre for mitochondrial diseases at the national level&#xD;
      since 2006 and was recently approved under the call for projects &quot;European Reference Network&#xD;
      (ERN) for rare diseases&quot;, EURO-NMD, supported by the Nice University Hospital. The routine&#xD;
      diagnostic strategy is based on high throughput mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing analysis&#xD;
      and a panel of 281 targeted &quot;mitochondriopathies&quot; genes. When these analyses are negative, an&#xD;
      exome analysis (high throughput sequencing of all exons in the genome) can be performed in a&#xD;
      research setting. To date, about 40% of the patients analysed remain without genetic&#xD;
      diagnosis. Indeed, it does not allow to identify large variations of deletion, duplication or&#xD;
      CNV (copy number variation) type. Moreover, targeting only exons, exome sequencing does not&#xD;
      allow the detection of intronic or localized mutations in regulatory regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of CNVs is made possible by chromosomal analysis on a DNA chip (CADC).&#xD;
      This recognized technique is used routinely in the laboratory. The investigators use chips&#xD;
      with a minimum resolution of approximately 13Kb for the genome-wide study of CNVs in patients&#xD;
      with developmental disorders. However, this resolution is insufficient to detect rework&#xD;
      events of the order of magnitude of an exon. There are high-resolution DNA chips, compatible&#xD;
      with our platform, that would allow the investigators to more accurately visualize smaller&#xD;
      rearrangements that could not be identified by exome analysis. The combined exome/CADC&#xD;
      strategy has already proven its effectiveness in diagnosing various diseases by increasing&#xD;
      yield.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the investigators aim to use this strategy in this non-interventional study&#xD;
      on a series of 15 patients with mitochondrial disease who remain undiagnosed after analysis&#xD;
      of mtDNA, gene panel and exome. They will test 2 types of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the first series, whose disease is supposed to be transmitted in an autosomal&#xD;
           recessive mode, only one heterozygous variant was identified in a gene already described&#xD;
           in a comparable clinical picture. It is therefore possible that these patients are&#xD;
           carriers on the second allele of a CNV, which the exome sequencing could not identify.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the second series, the exome analysis did not allow the identification of a single&#xD;
           responsible gene (several candidate genes without any certainty on the pathogenicity of&#xD;
           the gene(s) or variant(s))&#xD;
