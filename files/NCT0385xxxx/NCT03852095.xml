      A recent internal study evaluating the relevance of the visit to traumatology consultation in&#xD;
      our establishment highlight that 49.3% of consultations were not relevant passages. The&#xD;
      project consists of individualizing 5 to 6 pathologies and to create care sheets and patient&#xD;
      sheets to be given to the care teams and patients when the pathology lends itself to it. The&#xD;
      aim is to reduce the irrelevant passage rate during these consultations, which is the source&#xD;
      of absence from iterative work for parents, collateral expenses (toll, parking), absence from&#xD;
      school for the children, unjustified expenses and X-ray examination unnecessary most often.&#xD;

      The Pediatric Orthopedics and Traumatology department proposes a reform of the care in&#xD;
      Traumatology of the children in order to improve and homogenize the care for a better&#xD;
      relevance of these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent internal study (June 2018) evaluating the relevance of the visit to traumatology&#xD;
      consultation in our establishment to highlight that 49.3% of consultations were not relevant&#xD;
      passages (Benign diseases of sprained ankle type, muscular contusion or simple bone&#xD;
      removals). Indeed, these specialist consultations are currently filled by pathologies of&#xD;
      simple treatment that do not require medical follow-up (neither clinical nor radiological&#xD;
      follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project consists of individualizing 5 to 6 pathologies found in consultation recurrently&#xD;
      which the scientific literature has established that their follow-up is not justified, and to&#xD;
      create care sheets and patient sheets to be given to the care teams and patients when the&#xD;
      pathology lends itself to it. These cards will include all the management of the pathology of&#xD;
      the definition itself, including the treatment and expected outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to reduce the irrelevant passage rate during these consultations, which is the&#xD;
      source of absence from iterative work for parents, collateral expenses (toll, parking),&#xD;
      absence from school for the children, unjustified expenses and X-ray examination unnecessary&#xD;
      most often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefit is parental and child satisfaction, a time saving for the practitioner&#xD;
      that he can reinvest in consultations for patients who are in fact a specialist opinion and a&#xD;
      relative budget saving for the establishment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of study of the decline of irrelevant consultations will be made by a systematic&#xD;
      review of each reason for consultation over a period of 3 months after implementation of the&#xD;
      cards and study of the percentage of irrelevant consultation over the same period. The&#xD;
      objective pursued is a drop in attendance of at least 25% of consultations deemed irrelevant&#xD;
      in Traumatology, associated with a satisfaction rate of parents greater than 90%.&#xD;
