  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate peripheral vibrotactile coordinated reset stimulation for&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease seeks to explore the safety and efficacy of an experimental non-invasive&#xD;
      method to aid in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The purpose of the study is to verify&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of non-painful sensory (tactile) vibratory stimulation delivered&#xD;
      to the fingertips of patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a non-invasive, experimental method to&#xD;
      aid in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. A glove device produces non-painful sensory&#xD;
      (tactile) vibratory stimulation to the fingertips of Parkinson's patients. Vibrotactile&#xD;
      coordinated reset (vCR) will help investigators compare durability and efficacy of the&#xD;
      tactile stimulation to current medical therapy. Participants will receive vCR for a minimum&#xD;
      of 3 months and a maximum of 13 and motor ability will be recorded. If the results of this&#xD;
      study suggest that vibrotactile CR stimulation is safe and effective for the treatment of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, this non-invasive treatment approach would have a substantial impact on&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
