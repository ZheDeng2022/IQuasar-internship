    <textblock>
      Pragmatic randomized clinical trial comparing Iodine Povacrylex based on alcohol to&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine also based on alcohol in efficacy and security to diminish frequency of&#xD;
      surgical site infections in major abdominal elective clean contaminated wounds. Will be held&#xD;
      in a third level university, high volume national public hospital in San Salvador, El&#xD;
      Salvador.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative antiseptic Chlorhexidine based on alcohol has been established as gold standard&#xD;
      of care for clean contaminated wounds. It was compared to Iodine solutions non-alcohol based.&#xD;
      There is a question about alcohol based solution was a confounder in the comparison. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to compare the efficacy of both solutions alcohol based, 0.7% iodine&#xD;
      povacrylex plus 74% alcohol, against gluconate chlorhexidine 2% plus 70% alcohol, in clean&#xD;
      contaminated wounds, in major abdominal elective surgeries, in a wider range than colorectal&#xD;
      surgeries, Materials and methods. With a pragmatic randomized, phase 4, controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. Comparison of two antiseptic solutions, using manufacturer (3M) sterile appliers' for&#xD;
      both products, Food and Drugs Agency approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of data will be assured by first training all surgeons and residents besides&#xD;
      researchers in the study protocol for protocol compliance in subject identification,&#xD;
      randomization moment, and follow up. There is a plan for weekly monitoring of protocol&#xD;
      compliance, and monthly data monitoring and auditing from Faculty of Medicine Research Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and auditing will comply protocol compliance and data integrity against subject's&#xD;
      medical records and random interviews of patients in their post-surgical control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Site Infection definitions are those taken from Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
      definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Operating Procedures will be established in all moments of the trial, from subject&#xD;
      identification, informed consent, recruitment, randomization process in the operating room,&#xD;
      and data collection in pre specified files for data collection and data management. Protocol&#xD;
      compliance and Standard Operating Procedures compliance will be monitored by Principal&#xD;
      Investigator constantly. Report of adverse events will be done in accordance to Salvadoran&#xD;
      National ethics committee Standard Operating Procedures as also any other communication such&#xD;
      as protocol deviance or amendments. Previous research has not reported adverse events, but we&#xD;
      will be expectant to their appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated for a total of 964 subjects, 482 in each group, using statistics&#xD;
      software, were we established a statistic significant level for a bilateral hypothesis of 95%&#xD;
      and a power of 80%, based on previous research of comparison of both solutions to get a&#xD;
      probability of SSI of 4.2% in Chlorhexidine group against 8.6% in Iodine povacrylex group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will establish a strict follow up of patients in the 30 days considered as post-operative&#xD;
      time, by enabling the whole public health system to integrate in subjectsÂ´, surgical care&#xD;
      (primary care) to diminish the probability of missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be done following &quot;intention to treat&quot; analysis principle. Primary outcome&#xD;
      will be any kind of Surgical Site Infection, categorical variable, will be analyzed with chi&#xD;
      square for a bilateral hypothesis, and also measure the difference with risk ratio and its&#xD;
      95% confidence interval.&#xD;
