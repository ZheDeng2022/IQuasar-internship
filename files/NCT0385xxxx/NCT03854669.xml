  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a subjective experience that differs in intensity from one person to another.&#xD;
      Appropriate medical care relies on an accurate assessment of the patients' condition.&#xD;
      However, when it comes to subjective assessment, accurate assessment is a challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common tools used to estimate pain intensity depend on patient pain reports on a&#xD;
      numerical pain scale (NPS) or a similar scales. Although these tools are widely used, there&#xD;
      is a tendency to ignore the fact that the reliability and accuracy of pain reports are&#xD;
      strongly influenced not only by the measuring instrument, but also by the person who uses it.&#xD;
      A method has recently been developed to assess the accuracy of pain reports, and in a series&#xD;
      of studies it has been found that the more accurate a person is in pain reports in response&#xD;
      to stimulation,the smaller his placebo effect is .The aim of the study is to investigate&#xD;
      whether assessing the accuracy of a person's pain reports can predict who will experience&#xD;
      intensified post-operative pain and post-operative analgesic medications intake.The study&#xD;
      will include 40 patients undergoing elective head &amp; neck surgery. The study will be conducted&#xD;
      prospectively and will include one pre-operative meeting to assess the accuracy of pain&#xD;
      reports using the Focused Analgesia Selection Test (FAST). Patients will also complete&#xD;
      pain-related psychological questionnaires during the session. In addition, post-operative&#xD;
      pain measurements (NPS), and the use of pain relieving drugs (SOS) will be taken until&#xD;
      release.&#xD;

      Objectives and hypotheses: The purpose of this study is to examine whether pain reporting&#xD;
      accuracy (as examined in the FAST test) predicts the intensity of acute post-operative pain&#xD;
      and the consumption of pain-relieving drugs. The investigators hypothesize that the more&#xD;
      accurate a person is in his pain reports, the more likely he will be to correlate&#xD;
      postoperative pain and Analgesic drugs consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population: The sample will include 40 subjects (men and women) who are about to&#xD;
      undergo elective head &amp; neck surgery in the Department of Otolaryngology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The institutional ethics committee of Carmel Medical Center approved the study protocol in&#xD;
      accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, and written consent will be obtained from each&#xD;
      subject before the beginning of the experiment. Participants will be enrolled into the study&#xD;
      after meeting the inclusion criteria. The experiment will consist of one session, which will&#xD;
      last about 45 minutes, during which the subject will undergo brief familiarization with the&#xD;
      device, the stimulation and the scale in the study. Thereafter, all subjects will undergo the&#xD;
      FAST procedure. Between the familiarization and the FAST, the subject will fill out&#xD;
      pain-related personality questionnaires. From the moment of returning to the department after&#xD;
      the surgery, the clinical follow-up will begin following pain reports and the consumption of&#xD;
      pain-relieving drugs until the patient is released.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychophysical assessment: The contact-heat Q-sense system (Medoc, Ramat-Yishai, Israel) will&#xD;
      be used to deliver the tonic heat stimulations applied by a 30 x 30 mm Peltier surface&#xD;
      stimulator, which will be attached by Velcro straps to the volar surface of the forearm of&#xD;
      the subject hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familiarization: At the beginning of the experimental session, all subjects will undergo a&#xD;
      short training in order to familiarize them with the device and with the sensations evoked by&#xD;
      the painful stimulation, and to train them to report their perceived pain intensity using the&#xD;
      numerical pain scale. The training will include exposure to three short contact-heat stimuli&#xD;
      (44, 46.5, and 48°C), each lasting for 7 seconds from the time that the stimulation intensity&#xD;
      reach the destination temperature. Subjects will be asked to report their pain on numerical&#xD;
      pain scale (NPS) ranging from 0, denoting no pain, to 100, denoting the worst pain&#xD;
      imaginable, induced by each stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain reporting accuracy assessment: Will be assessed by the FAST procedure. During the&#xD;
      procedure, the thermode will be attached to the ventral surface of the subject's non-dominant&#xD;
      arm and the temperature will be raised from a baseline of 32°C, peaks for 3 seconds at 1 of 7&#xD;
      designated temperatures (44°C, 45°C, 46°C, 47°C, 48°C, 49°C, and 50°C), and then decreased&#xD;
      down to the baseline. Stimulus rate of rise and fall will be kept constant. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to rate the peak pain intensity of each stimulus verbally using the NPS. Each&#xD;
      temperature will be presented 7 times in a random block-ordered design (49 stimuli in total),&#xD;
      with Inter-stimulus intervals of 20 seconds. The location of the thermode will be adjusted&#xD;
      every 10 stimuli to minimize sensitization and/or habituation effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of clinical variables: The clinical follow-up of patients begins from the moment&#xD;
      the operation ends and continues until discharge (24-48 hours post-operation), and includes&#xD;
      two measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain reports (NPS) - pain assessment at the time of analgesic medication consumption and&#xD;
           an hour after administration of the drug, in addition to regular monitoring of every 6&#xD;
           hours during hospitalization. The reports will be documented by the nursing staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow-up after use of analgesic medications (according to the standard protocol + SOS&#xD;
           medications including: Paracetamol IV, Optalgin PO, Oxycodone PO and Trimal IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain-related psychological questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain sensitivity will be assessed by the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ). Dispositional&#xD;
      optimism will be assessed by the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be processed and analyzed using Excel , and SPSS® software version 23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to present demographic and baseline characteristics. Pain&#xD;
      scores captured during the FAST procedure will be used to calculate 3 FAST outcomes as&#xD;
      follows: 1) R2 will be calculated by using a power model regression. Disparity between the&#xD;
      predicted function and actual scores could be a result of inaccuracy or unreliability. Close&#xD;
      concordance between actual and predicted scores (higher R2) suggests greater accuracy and&#xD;
      reliability. 2) Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be computed using a 2-way mixed&#xD;
      model for the 7 presentations of each of the 7 intensity levels. An ICC score approaching 1.0&#xD;
      denotes a high degree of reliability or the agreement in responses to the same stimulus over&#xD;
      several presentations. 3) The coefficient of variation (CoV) is the ratio of the standard&#xD;
      deviation to the mean. The average CoV will be calculated as the mean of 7 CoVs, 1 at each&#xD;
      stimulus level. Spearman's correlation between FAST outcome measures, NPS, analgesic&#xD;
      consumption, PSQ and LOT-R will be calculated in order to assess relationships between pain&#xD;
      reporting accuracy, clinical post-operative pain and pain-relates psychological measures.&#xD;
      Exploring whether being identified as more painful patient in the acute post-operative phase&#xD;
      (pro-nociceptive) could be predicted by pain reporting accuracy (as measures by FAST), and&#xD;
      pain sensitivity (as assessed by PSQ) and optimism (as assessed by LOT-R) will be made by&#xD;
      multivariate regression analyses.Statistical significance was defined as P≤0.05.&#xD;
