  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder. Rikkunshito, a&#xD;
      traditional Japanese Kampo medicine, has shown efficacy in improving FD symptoms in&#xD;
      controlled trials in Japan. Its putative benefit for European patients has never been&#xD;
      investigated. Further, its exact mechanism of action is incompletely elucidated. This study&#xD;
      aimed to examine the effect of rikkunshito on gastric motility and GI symptom perception in&#xD;
      FD in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Intragastric pressure (IGP) was&#xD;
      assessed using high-resolution manometry as an indirect measurement of gastric accommodation&#xD;
      and gastric motility.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study had a total duration of&#xD;
      14 weeks, consisting of a two-week run-in period, two treatment phases of four weeks each and&#xD;
      a four-week washout period separating the treatment phases to prevent carry-over effects.&#xD;
      Study visits were held at baseline (screening) and after the run-in period, treatment phases&#xD;
      and washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of rikkunshito on intragastric pressure as an indirect measure for&#xD;
      gastric motility, high-resolution manometry (HRM) was performed after the run-in period and&#xD;
      after both treatment phases. During intragastric pressure measurement, a nutrient tolerance&#xD;
      test was performed and symptom questionnaires were completed. Throughout the entire study,&#xD;
      patients scored their gastrointestinal symptoms on a daily basis in the Leuven Postprandial&#xD;
      Distress Scale (LPDS) diary. In addition, questionnaires on gastrointestinal symptoms and&#xD;
      psychosocial state were completed each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety measures performed each study visit included blood pressure, heart rate and weight&#xD;
      assessment, performing an electrocardiogram, adverse event evaluation and physical&#xD;
      examination. Furthermore, blood samples were collected during screening and after each&#xD;
      treatment phase to check liver and kidney function. Serum levels of potassium, creatine&#xD;
      kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-&#xD;
      glutamyltransferase were assessed. Women of childbearing potential were asked to do a&#xD;
      pregnancy test before study enrollment and before each treatment period.&#xD;
