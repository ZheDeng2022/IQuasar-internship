  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) has been used as one of the treatments for graft versus&#xD;
      host disease (GVHD). Responses were observed in skin, liver, GI tract, mouth, eye and lung.&#xD;
      ECP does not cause immune suppression and therefore less risk of infection or relapse of&#xD;
      malignancy. However, the exact mechanism of action of this expensive procedure is not fully&#xD;
      understood and no predictors of response to ECP are known so far. This reflects the need for&#xD;
      a better understanding of GVHD and its response to ECP. Blood samples from 15 patients who&#xD;
      receive ECP as part of the treatment of GVHD at our institution will be collected. Samples&#xD;
      will be analyzed using flow cytometer&#xD;
