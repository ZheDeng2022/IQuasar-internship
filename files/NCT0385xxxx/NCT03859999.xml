    <textblock>
      The Colles fracture, a fracture of the wrist, is frequently associated with deformity of the&#xD;
      broken part of the bone, particularly in older or frail patients. This can cause long term&#xD;
      wrist deformity and problems using the wrist and hand if not corrected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA) is often undertaken in the emergency department (ED) for&#xD;
      'displaced' fractures in an attempt to correct the deformity. The procedure involves a local&#xD;
      anaesthetic technique, additional staff, and takes some time to complete. The procedure is&#xD;
      not without risk; it can cause bruising, skin tears, complications from the local anaesthetic&#xD;
      and can be uncomfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although fracture positions are usually improved by ED manipulation initially; these&#xD;
      fractures can slip back to an unacceptable position over the next 1-2 weeks, despite plaster&#xD;
      cast immobilisation. For fractures that slip, open surgery is usually required to correct and&#xD;
      hold the fracture with metal plates or wires. This is performed in the operating theatre and&#xD;
      requires another visit to the hospital. Preliminary work suggests this affects over a quarter&#xD;
      of patients, undergoing ED MUA for Colles' wrist fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it were possible to reliably identify patients whose fractures were likely to slip and&#xD;
      require open surgery despite ED manipulation, unnecessary procedures and visits to hospital&#xD;
      could be avoided. This would ensure patients got the right treatment first time and save&#xD;
      patients and the NHS time and money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of factors that might affect the likelihood of fracture instability and&#xD;
      need for surgery. These include patient factors such as age, functional status and presence&#xD;
      of osteoporosis (thin weak bones) and the specific position of the fracture. In this study we&#xD;
      will be measuring the fracture positions on x-rays of patients with a Colles' fracture to see&#xD;
      if we can accurately predict ED MUA failure on the initial x-ray.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many thousands of patients attend emergency departments (ED) with displaced (deformed) wrist&#xD;
      fractures and undergo closed manipulation under local anaesthetic (MUA) in the ED. Local&#xD;
      audit suggests between 25-40% of these manipulated fractures slip back into an unacceptable&#xD;
      position (unstable fractures) and require a subsequent open operation to reduce and pin or&#xD;
      plate the bone (ORIF). There is some evidence that the degree of initial deformity and other&#xD;
      factors might predict instability but this is neither well established nor well researched.&#xD;
      Reliably predicting which fractures are likely to fail and which are likely to succeed closed&#xD;
      ED manipulation could reduce the proportion undergoing a futile ED procedure, save patients'&#xD;
      time and visits to hospital and ensure definitive care the first time round.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will identify cases from a previously conducted clinical activity analysis of patients who&#xD;
      had undergone MUA for Colles' fracture over a two year period at Royal Devon and Exeter&#xD;
      Hospital ED. These cases were retrospectively identified (from electronic attendance logs)&#xD;
      and followed up until fracture healing or surgery. In this database, the need for subsequent&#xD;
      surgery was recorded from electronic records and review of comments in fracture clinic.&#xD;
      X-rays of these patients have been identified and anonymised by a member of radiology staff,&#xD;
      who is not a member of the research team. These X-rays and the database cases have been given&#xD;
      a unique trial number and all identifiable data removed before trial use. The database will&#xD;
      be used to provide outcome data for the development of a model to see if x-ray features can&#xD;
      reliably predict ED MUA failure. We will exclude Smiths' (anteriorly displaced) fractures and&#xD;
      those whom there is no follow up data in the database eg. Patients who were followed up&#xD;
      elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymised x-rays will be used to develop computer-assisted methods to measure key fracture&#xD;
      angles as well as other factors such as degree and position of comminution (fragmentation)&#xD;
      and markers of osteoporosis. All x-rays will then by analysed using the system to record&#xD;
      these measurements. Depending upon the speed of development, any user facing systems could&#xD;
      also be tested on staff to gauge usability and test for inter-rater agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis of these x-ray features measured by computer, together with the&#xD;
      database demographic and outcome data will be used to develop the best model /decision rule&#xD;
      to predict likelihood of MUA success. A 'leave one out cross validation' technique will be&#xD;
      used to validate such a model and assess whether we could have reduced the ED MUA failure&#xD;
      rate without increasing the overall number of open operative procedures. This work will be&#xD;
      used to inform a larger prospective study where any decision rules can be assessed and&#xD;
      further factors explored with the prospect of adding these to any final computer model.&#xD;
