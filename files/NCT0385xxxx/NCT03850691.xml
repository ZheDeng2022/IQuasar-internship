  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the combination of checkpoint blockade and&#xD;
      aldesleukin (IL-2) therapy after a course of standard of care palliative radiation in the&#xD;
      management of unresectable metastatic melanoma. To be eligible, a patient must have a minimum&#xD;
      of 3 (preferably &gt;5) radiographically distinct, measurable (&gt;1.5 cm) lesions based on RECIST&#xD;
      1.1. Metastatic cutaneous melanoma must be refractory to standard immunotherapy drugs,&#xD;
      molecular targeted agents and/or chemotherapy. Patients with ocular melanoma subtypes may&#xD;
      enroll in this study without prior therapy, as there is no standard front-line therapy for&#xD;
      this subset of patients.&#xD;

             are allowed. Intranasal influenza vaccine (eg, Flu - Mist®) is a live attenuated&#xD;
             vaccine, and is not allowed.&#xD;
