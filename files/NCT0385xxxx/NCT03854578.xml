        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having a diagnosis of a MDD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
             Mental Disorders-V (DSM-V) (single episode or recurrent) with a MADRS total score&#xD;
             between ≥ 7 and &lt; 26 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female aged 18 to 45 years, inclusive at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men able to&#xD;
             father a child must be ready and able to use highly effective methods of birth&#xD;
             control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be, in the opinion of the Investigator, capable of and eligible for&#xD;
             completing the fMRI and tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have acceptable weight as defined by BMI (weight [kg]/height [m]²) range&#xD;
             of 18 to 30 kg/m², inclusive at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be a non-smoker or light smoker (≤ 5 cigarettes per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed the informed consent form prior to the first study-related&#xD;
             procedure indicating they understand the purpose of and procedures required for the&#xD;
             study and are willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Further inclusion criteria apply&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meeting any diagnostic criteria for a major psychiatric disorder (other than MDD), as&#xD;
             determined by DSM-V at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a prescribed medication (including antidepressants) within 28 days prior&#xD;
             to Visit 1 (apart from the contraceptive pill) or having received over the counter&#xD;
             medication (including pain killers) within 10 days prior to screening. Participants&#xD;
             who have taken prescription medication may still be entered into the study, if, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, the medication received will not interfere with the study&#xD;
             procedures or compromise safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients where it is foreseen (per investigator judgement) that a delay of initiation&#xD;
             of standard of care therapy for the depressive disorder to 14 days after day 1 of&#xD;
             Visit 2 is medically not justifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of alcohol or substance dependence or abuse within the last 12 months from&#xD;
             Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a current or recent history of clinically significant suicidal ideation within the&#xD;
             past 6 months, corresponding to a score of 4 or 5 for ideation on the C-SSRS, or a&#xD;
             history of suicidal behavior within the past year, as validated by the C-SSRS at&#xD;
             screening or treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of, or presents (in the opinion of the Investigator) with, significant&#xD;
             neurological or psychiatric conditions (such as stroke, traumatic brain injury,&#xD;
             seizures, space occupying lesions, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, vascular&#xD;
             dementia, transient ischemic attack, schizophrenia, blackouts requiring&#xD;
             hospitalisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A planned medical treatment within the study period that might interfere with the&#xD;
             study procedures.&#xD;

          -  Further exclusion criteria apply&#xD;
