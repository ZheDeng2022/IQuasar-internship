  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study whether Pazopanib, taken daily for 6 months, will reduce the&#xD;
      severity of nose bleeds in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Patients will&#xD;
      either be provided drug or a placebo [sugar non-drug pill], and be tested for nose bleed&#xD;
      severity throughout the trial, including particularly nose bleed duration. Investigators will&#xD;
      also test for blood loss, as well as for safety.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Once a single dose pk study is performed to properly establish similar exposure with the&#xD;
      prior pilot 50mg tablet, a double blind, placebo controlled study will follow, which proposes&#xD;
      to define primarily the value of low dose Pazopanib on nose bleed duration, in the context of&#xD;
      assessing perceived nose bleed severity. A 3mth follow-up period will support safety and&#xD;
      efficacy elements. Secondary endpoints will be interrogated, including ongoing blood loss,&#xD;
      use of iron and blood products, quality of life, and drug safety.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After at least a 3wk baseline period, patients will be assigned low dose drug or placebo. After 3mths of therapy, if epistaxis duration endpoint has been reached, the drug dose will remain the sameâ€¦ However, if this end point is not reached, and no safety signals have been observed, the dose can be advanced up to double the initial dose. A strong initial trend would still permit continuance of the low dose intervention. Post-study drug discontinuance, a 3 month follow-up time period will continue assessments to define maintenance of effect, and/ or relapse. An interim to adjust total subject number, and potential futility occurs after 12 patients have completed their 24 week dosing period.</intervention_model_description>
