    <textblock>
      CC-90011-SCLC-001 is a multicenter, Phase 1b, open-label, dose finding study to assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of CC-90011 given concurrently and&#xD;
      sequentially to standard of care platinum-based, cisplatin and etoposide, carboplatin and&#xD;
      etoposide and/or etoposide and Nivolumab to subjects with first line ES SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose finding part of the study will explore escalating oral doses of CC-90011 in&#xD;
      combination with cisplatin, etoposide and/or carboplatin with or without Nivolumab&#xD;
      (chemotherapy), to determine the maximum tolerated dose of CC- 90011 in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy with or without Nivolumab to subjects with first line ES SCLC.&#xD;

    <description>During the Chemotherapy Treatment Period, the dose escalation is designed to explore three dose levels of CC-90011, for example 20, 40, and 60 mg as determined by Bayesian design, administered orally Days 1 and 8, in combination with cisplatin intravenous (IV) 75 mg/m2, Day 1, and etoposide iv 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 2, and 3, for 4 cycles of 21 days each. Subjects completing the chemotherapy and being responders as per RECIST 1.1 will enter the Maintenance Treatment Period. Subjects completing 6 cycles of maintenance treatment subject will be treated only with CC-90011 at RP2D (60 mg) and continuing on CC-90011 are only required to have clinic visits/assessments performed on Day 1 (± 3 days) of each subsequent cycle (Cycles 6 and higher) unless more frequent visits are clinically indicated.</description>

    <description>When the RP2D of CC-90011 in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide is determined, the combination of CC-90011 at RP2D with cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide plus nivolumab IV 240 mg Day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, will be explored. For CC-90011 in combination with chemotherapy and nivolumab, the starting dose will be the RP2D of CC-90011 in combination with chemotherapy.&#xD;
A maintenance therapy will be given to subjects responding to the combination of CC-90011 with chemotherapy or to chemotherapy with nivolumab, as per RECIST 1.1. These subjects will receive 60 mg or 40 mg (in case of combination with nivolumab) of CC-90011 orally once weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, during cycles of 28-day each and, in the case of the combination with nivolumab, nivolumab IV 480 mg on Day 1 during cycles of 28-day each.</description>
