  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised double-blinded controlled trial aims to compare the live birth rate in&#xD;
      natural FET cycles with and without oral dydrogesterone as luteal phase support. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the use of oral dydrogesterone will increase the live birth rate of&#xD;
      natural cycle FET.&#xD;

      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women undergoing FET in the Centre of Assisted Reproduction and Embryology, The University of&#xD;
      Hong Kong-Queen Mary Hospital, will be recruited and will be randomized into one of the&#xD;
      following two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group: Oral dydrogesterone 10mg tds will be given for two weeks from the next day&#xD;
      of the LH surge or hCG induced ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Placebo will be given given for two weeks from the next day of the LH surge or&#xD;
      hCG induced ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian stimulation protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women received ovarian stimulation according to the standard protocol of the Centre. Egg&#xD;
      collection is carried out 36 hours after the HCG trigger. One to two early cleaving embryos&#xD;
      or blastocysts will be transferred and any excess good quality cleaving embryos or blastocyst&#xD;
      will be frozen two to six days after egg collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FET cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FET is carried out at least 2 month after the stimulated cycle if the patient fails to get&#xD;
      pregnant in the stimulated IVF cycle. Frozen cleaving embryos or blastocysts after thawing&#xD;
      are transferred in natural cycles for those women having regular ovulatory cycles. Women are&#xD;
      monitored daily from 18 days before the expected date of he next period for pelvic ultrasound&#xD;
      assessment of the size of the leading follicle and determination of serum oestradiol (E2) and&#xD;
      LH concentrations until the LH surge, which is defined by the LH level being above 20 IU/L&#xD;
      and more than double of the average of the LH levels over the past three days. HCG can also&#xD;
      be given when the leading follicle reaches 17mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be counseled by a designated research nurse who will explain the purpose of this&#xD;
      study when they first attend the clinic for FET. On the day of the hCG trigger or one day&#xD;
      after the LH surge, those who consent to join the study will be randomized into one of the&#xD;
      two study arms specified in an opaque envelope according to a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization list prepared by a research nurse who is not involved in the present study.&#xD;
      Oral dydrogesterone and placebo tablets have the same appearance and will be started one day&#xD;
      after the hCG trigger or the LH surge for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transfer is performed on the third day after the LH surge or the fourth day after the hCG&#xD;
      trigger for frozen cleaving embryos (on the sixth day after the LH surge or the seventh day&#xD;
      after hCG trigger for frozen blastocysts). Again 1-2 cleaving embryos are replaced according&#xD;
      to our standard protocol. A urine pregnancy test will be performed 16 days after the FET. In&#xD;
      case of pregnancy, the outcome of pregnancy will be traced afterwards and used for analysis.&#xD;
      Luteal phase support is not required in those who get pregnant.&#xD;
