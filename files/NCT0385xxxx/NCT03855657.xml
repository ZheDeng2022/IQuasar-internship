      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects 1 in 500 to 1,000 people in the West. Previously a&#xD;
      disease predominantly of the West, there is now a marked increase in the incidence of&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) in Asia, with an estimated prevalence of 1&#xD;
      in 3,000 and 1 in 10,000 respectively[1]. The rapid increase of IBD in Asian raising concern&#xD;
      of investigators. Therefore setting up a large scale biobank with comprehensive clinical data&#xD;

      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects 1 in 500 to 1,000 people in the West. Previously a&#xD;
      disease predominantly of the West, there is now a marked increase in the incidence of&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) in Asia, with an estimated prevalence of 1&#xD;
      in 3,000 and 1 in 10,000 respectively [1]. IBD is thought to result from an aberrant immune&#xD;
      response to intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible individuals [2]. Genetic variants&#xD;
      have been shown to contribute to an increased IBD risk. Although genetic traits predispose to&#xD;
      the development of IBD in Asia, the change in epidemiology that has occurred over only a few&#xD;
      decades suggests that other, presumably environmental factors play the major role in the&#xD;
      development of disease [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBD patients often rely on medical therapy to achieve remission. Due to the diverse features&#xD;
      of severity, phenotypes, clinical courses and responses, personalizing IBD therapy is&#xD;
      important to maximize management efficacy, minimize adverse events and decrease cost.&#xD;
      Thiopurines is a key component of medications in the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease&#xD;
      (IBD). However, achieving an optimal efficacious thiopurine dosing can be difficult, as up to&#xD;
      10% of patients have dose-dependent toxicities and up to 9% of patients are resistant to&#xD;
      thiopurine therapy [16, 17]. Such clinical toxicity could be due to inherited genetic&#xD;
      variation of certain enzyme, leading to an unusual metabolic pathway, which generates toxic&#xD;
      metabolites. On the other hand, few studies have studied the longitudinal changes in the gut&#xD;
      microbiome with drug treatment in IBD. Shaw et al. characterized 19 children with CD and 4&#xD;
      with ulcerative colitis (UC), showing that dysbiosis at baseline correlated with the degree&#xD;
      of inflammatory burden of luminal disease.Therefore, identification of comprehensive targets&#xD;
      for drug monitoring will improve our understanding of the basis for inter-patient variability&#xD;
      in drug toxicity and efficacy, and enable more individualized therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolism has an essential role in biological systems; and metabolites represent the end&#xD;
      products of this important process from a cell of a certain physiological status. Blood and&#xD;
      urine are integrative fluids that incorporates the metabolic outputs at different of the&#xD;
      body, and thus providing a metabolic footprint as an end product [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metagenomics which is a study of microbes as communities is also an important approach to&#xD;
      study microbiota in human.The interplay between microbiota and genetics gives unique&#xD;
      transcription profiles in the gut, and gene expression analyses provide insights into the&#xD;
      transcriptional activity and functional molecular pathways underlying disease progression.&#xD;
      Therefore, deep sequencing analysis of the colon suggests hypotheses about the&#xD;
      pathophysiological processes in IBD patients. Further transcriptomics study and in&#xD;
      combination with other meta'omics studies will provide the basis for in-depth understanding&#xD;
      of IBD pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the bio-clinical complexity of diseases and microbiota, a long term, large-scale&#xD;
      prospective biobank is necessary to carry out meaningful research. This biobank will provide&#xD;
      a powerful platform for studying a range of complex factors associated with IBD that are of&#xD;
      great relevance to public health. Such biobank may be extended to other diseases including GI&#xD;
      diseases and autoimmune disorder, which may possibly provide insight to the role of&#xD;
      microbiota in human health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of the intestinal ecosystem, epigenetic,&#xD;
      metabolic and transcription profiles, as well as their mechanisms in the disease pathogenesis&#xD;
      in patients with IBD and other diseases may help us identify potential biomarkers. However,&#xD;
      our current knowledge about them is still very limited, particularly in Asian patients, who&#xD;
      have not been extensively researched. Further investigation in this field is needed. To serve&#xD;
      these purposes, we aim to setup a large scale biobank with comprehensive clinical data.&#xD;
