      An international, multicentre, African cluster randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether increased postoperative surveillance in high-risk adult surgical&#xD;
      patients reduces overall in-hospital mortality in surgical patients aged 18 years and over in&#xD;
      Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-hospital mortality, censored at 30 days if the patient is still alive and in-hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether increased postoperative surveillance in high-risk adult surgical&#xD;
      patients reduces the overall incidence of the composite of severe in-hospital complications&#xD;
      and mortality in adult surgical patients aged 18 years and over in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composite of severe in-hospital complications and mortality, censored at 30 days if the&#xD;
      patient is still alive and in-hospital.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASOS-2 is an African, international, multicentre, cluster randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients: All consecutive adult patients aged 18 years and over admitted to&#xD;
           participating centres undergoing elective and non-elective surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participating surgical centres: Randomised according to a stratification based upon the&#xD;
           level of the surgical facility and the surgical case load. Recruitment will start in May&#xD;
           2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Prior participation in ASOS-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pragmatic trial. It is an African, international cluster randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial in several African countries. Participating surgical sites will be randomised to either&#xD;
      increased postoperative surveillance or usual postoperative care. The investigators expect&#xD;
      all consecutive adult patients aged 18 years and over admitted to participating centres&#xD;
      undergoing elective and non-elective surgery to be included in the trial. 'Broadcasting'&#xD;
      through appropriate hospital notices and signage will inform the patients and the public that&#xD;
      the hospital is participating in the cluster randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The requirement for patient consent is expected to vary according to regulations of the&#xD;
      participating nations. The national leaders will ensure ethics approval is obtained from&#xD;
      their respective countries and centres. Centres will not be permitted to record data unless&#xD;
      ethics approval or an equivalent waiver is in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating sites will be randomised to normal postoperative care, or increased&#xD;
      postoperative surveillance. Randomisation will be stratified according to the level of the&#xD;
      surgical facility and the expected weekly surgical case-load.The investigators plan to&#xD;
      randomise 664 hospitals to either increased postoperative surveillance or standard care for&#xD;
      high-risk adult (â‰¥18 years) surgical patients. The follow up is in-hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention arm to which each participating site is randomised will be offered to all&#xD;
      eligible surgical patients for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating sites which have been randomised to increased surveillance will need to provide&#xD;
      increased surveillance to surgical patients with a predicted increased postoperative risk as&#xD;
      determined by the ASOS risk stratification tool. Increased postoperative surveillance can&#xD;
      include either of the following; i) admission to a higher care ward than had been planned at&#xD;
      the time of surgery, ii) an increase in the frequency of nursing observations in the&#xD;
      postoperative period, iii) ensuring that the patient is placed in view of the nursing&#xD;
      station, and not in a remote location in the postoperative ward, or iv) allowing family&#xD;
      members to stay with the patient in the ward in the postoperative period. The nature of the&#xD;
      offered increased postoperative surveillance will be left to the discretion of the healthcare&#xD;
      workers and the participating sites. However, all sites will be encouraged to include more&#xD;
      than one of the increased postoperative surveillance intervention. The healthcare providers&#xD;
      will also receive information on the leading causes of postoperative mortality in African&#xD;
      surgical patients as documented in ASOS; surgical site infections, bloodstream infection and&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, postoperative bleeding,&#xD;
      and cardiac arrest. This will be known as the 'Postoperative surveillance bedside guide' and&#xD;
      will be placed at the bedside of every patient flagged as high-risk by the ASOS Surgical Risk&#xD;
      Calculator. This should be placed in a visible position at the patient's bedside e.g. posted&#xD;
      on the wall above the patient's bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating sites randomised to the control arm will provide usual postoperative care to&#xD;
      patients. The care will be left to the discretion of the healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and collation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centre specific data will be collected once for each hospital including: university or&#xD;
      non-university hospital, number of hospital beds, number of operating rooms, number and level&#xD;
      of critical care beds and details about the reimbursement status of the hospital. An ASOS-2&#xD;
      case record form (CRF) will be completed for every eligible patient who undergoes surgery&#xD;
      during the trial. Patients will be followed up until hospital discharge. This will be&#xD;
      censored at thirty days i.e. patients will be followed up until discharge or for thirty days&#xD;
      whichever is the shorter period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up data will be collected by a site trial investigator. Investigators will review a&#xD;
      participant's in-hospital medical records (paper or electronic) up to hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cluster randomised trial of hospitals in Africa. The investigators will match&#xD;
      hospitals on expected surgical volume in a week of surgery. This varied tremendously across&#xD;
      the ASOS group; with a median number of surgical procedures per hospital for the study week&#xD;
      in ASOS of 29 (IQR 10-71). The variability of the individual patient outcomes explained by&#xD;
      the cluster (or surgical site) is taken into account in these sample size calculations. The&#xD;
      inter-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) in ASOS was 0.01. For the sample size&#xD;
      calculation, the investigators have therefore used a conservative ICC of 0.015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on ASOS, the investigators estimate the coefficient of variance for a 4-week&#xD;
      recruitment period to be 0.63. A 4-week recruitment period is defined as the following; i)&#xD;
      hospitals stop recruiting at the end of the week in which they have exceeded 100 enrolled&#xD;
      patients, and ii) if a site had not reached 100 enrolled patients after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      recruiting, it would stop recruiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of mortality in ASOS was 2.1%. The investigators expect a 25% relative risk&#xD;
      reduction in mortality through increased surveillance of postoperative surgical patients at&#xD;
      high-risk of severe complications or in-hospital mortality. Based on the intra-cluster&#xD;
      correlation coefficient (ICC) for the composite of severe complications and mortality in&#xD;
      ASOS-2 of 1.5%, a coefficient of variance of 0.63, and stratification for the level of the&#xD;
      surgical facility, and the volume of procedures per week, a trial for efficacy of increased&#xD;
      postoperative surveillance would require 64,200 patients, from 642 surgical centres across&#xD;
      Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be presented at a continental level. All institutional level data will be&#xD;
      anonymised prior to publication. Categorical variables will be described as proportions and&#xD;
      will be compared using chi-square tests. Continuous variables will be described as mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation if normally distributed or median and inter-quartile range if not normally&#xD;
      distributed. Comparisons of continuous variables between groups will be performed using&#xD;
      t-tests, one-way ANOVA or equivalent non-parametric tests as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be in hospital mortality. Overall differences in in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality will be compared between the intervention and control clusters. All analyses will&#xD;
      account for clusters. A list of baseline risk factors (the risk factors in the ASOS Surgical&#xD;
      Risk Calculator) will be included in the analysis. The investigators will use logistic&#xD;
      regression model to estimate the effect of increased postoperative surveillance, on the&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes. The investigators will calculate the odds ratios and their&#xD;
      associated 95% confidence intervals. The investigators will infer statistical significance if&#xD;
      the computed 2-sided p-value is &lt; 0.05. A single final analysis is planned at the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An a priori decision has been taken to conduct the following subgroup analyses; i) between&#xD;
      high- and low-outcome hospitals, ii) between district hospitals and higher-level hospitals,&#xD;
      iii) between low- and high-human resourced surgical hospitals, iv) between low-income&#xD;
      countries and middle-income countries, and v) between the different types of postoperative&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary studies: The use of the ASOS-2 Trial data for secondary studies will be encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and auditing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor will have oversight of the trial conduct at each site. The trial team will take&#xD;
      day-to-day responsibility for ensuring compliance with the requirements of GCP in terms of&#xD;
      quality control and quality assurance of the data collected as well as safety reporting. The&#xD;
      ASOS-2 Trial Management Group will communicate closely with individual sites and the&#xD;
      Sponsor's representatives to ensure these processes are effective.&#xD;
