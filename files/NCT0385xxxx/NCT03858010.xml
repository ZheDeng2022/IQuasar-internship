  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop a PROM for preschool children with recurrent wheeze. Nearly one&#xD;
      third of children will have at least one episode of wheeze in the first five years of life.&#xD;
      The majority of these children grow out of the condition in early school years. However,&#xD;
      their families go through challenging times often with numerous emergency department&#xD;
      admissions and hospitalizations. Hospital admission rates for preschool children with wheeze&#xD;
      attacks remain high and are increasing in the UK. New treatments have become available, but&#xD;
      although current treatments speed recovery from a wheeze attack, still many children visit&#xD;
      hospitals for rescue medications and medical reviews. Recent Australian data show that one&#xD;
      fourth of these children remain at emergency departments for a less than four hours period,&#xD;
      suggesting that with better information and education, these children could have remained at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification-Significance of the work By understanding what really matters for these&#xD;
      families, clinicians and stakeholders will be better able to design interventions that will&#xD;
      reduce the hospital attendances and admissions by empowering parents to manage their&#xD;
      children's condition. More specifically, this tool will assist GPs identify which of these&#xD;
      children need to be reviewed by specialists, aid holistic management, ensure interventions&#xD;
      are meaningful for families and assess the benefits of novel treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The items of the questionnaire have been generated through discussions with&#xD;
      families in a qualitative research study conducted by the research team. These items will be&#xD;
      refined and the questionnaire will be tested with families in different healthcare settings.&#xD;
      Researchers will assess how well this questionnaire is identifying the children who present&#xD;
      with greater number of hospital admissions and will be benefited from suggested&#xD;
      interventions. The data will be analysed and based on the results, amendments will be made to&#xD;
      the questionnaire, which can will then be introduced in the routine management of these&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

      The validation of the tool will take place at St Mary's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire aims to measure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. incidence of wheeze attacks and use of rescue medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. parental/caregiver perception of recurrent wheeze control&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. parental/caregiver perception of effect of recurrent wheeze on family/child quality of&#xD;
           life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given the questionnaire at the emergency departments or outpatients&#xD;
      clinics following having consented to the study and will be asked to fill in the&#xD;
      questionnaire and return it to their clinician.&#xD;
