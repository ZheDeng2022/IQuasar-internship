  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the research project is to determine the changes in motivation to perform mental&#xD;
      and physical tasks, feelings of vigor and fatigue, mental task vigilance and fine motor&#xD;
      function after consumption of a commercially available energy product. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is determine whether e+shot, a product containing natural caffeine, will impact mood&#xD;
      and performance up to 108 minutes post consumption compared to a sweetened solution&#xD;
      containing synthetic caffeine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled participants who are low consumers of caffeine will be administered either a placebo&#xD;
      (3mg caffeine), caffeinated placebo (~100mg of caffeine) or e+shot first and then will be&#xD;
      crossed over to receive the other two interventions. The study consists of 3 treatment&#xD;
      periods of 108 minutes each with a washout period of 48 hours.&#xD;

    <description>9-hole peg test- measured in seconds- The validated nine-hole peg test of finger dexterity was used to measure fine motor control. The 12 cm × 12 cm wooden pegboard contained nine holes and was placed on the desktop in front of the seated participant. There were nine 0.64 cm wide cylindrical pegs, were placed on the desktop outside of the container on the right side of the board and on the left side of the board for when the participant's right hand and left hand were tested, respectively. Participants were instructed to place one peg at a time into the pegboard holes until they were filled, and then remove each peg one at a time onto the desktop as fast as they could, first with their dominant hand and next with their non-dominant hand. Each test was performed twice.</description>

    <description>Continuous Performance Task- Percentage of correct responses Participants monitored a continuous series of letters (A-Z; Tahoma Regular font, size 20 pt) presented on the screen for 1000 ms. Participants were told to respond to the detection of the letter &quot;X&quot; only when it was preceded by the letter &quot;A&quot; by striking the left key on the key pad. The task was scored for percentage of target strings correctly detected, errors of omission (missed targets), average reaction time for correct detections, and the number of false alarms. The task lasted for two minutes and 48 targets were randomly presented</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>After screening 1035 surveys, 30 participants completed the study (see Figure 1). Recruitment and data collection lasted from September 25th 2015 to December 10th, 2016 until 30 participants had completed all 3 days of treatment. There were no harms or unintended consequences for any of the interventions.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>43 participants were randomized. Of the 43 participants who were randomized, 13 did not start the study due to scheduling conflicts and were un-enrolled from the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>9-hole peg test- measured in seconds- The validated nine-hole peg test of finger dexterity was used to measure fine motor control. The 12 cm × 12 cm wooden pegboard contained nine holes and was placed on the desktop in front of the seated participant. There were nine 0.64 cm wide cylindrical pegs, were placed on the desktop outside of the container on the right side of the board and on the left side of the board for when the participant's right hand and left hand were tested, respectively. Participants were instructed to place one peg at a time into the pegboard holes until they were filled, and then remove each peg one at a time onto the desktop as fast as they could, first with their dominant hand and next with their non-dominant hand. Each test was performed twice.</description>

Participants were told to respond to the detection of the letter &quot;X&quot; only when it was preceded by the letter &quot;A&quot; by striking the left key on the key pad. The task was scored for percentage of target strings correctly detected, errors of omission (missed targets), average reaction time for correct detections, and the number of false alarms. The task lasted for two minutes and 48 targets were randomly presented</description>
