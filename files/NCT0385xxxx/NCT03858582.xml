  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II single center, open-label, single arm study in patients with unresectable&#xD;
      thymic epithelial tumors (Masaoka stage III, IVA). Patients will be treated with&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab 200 mg, Docetaxel 75mg/m2, Cisplatin 75mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles and&#xD;
      will be evaluated for the operability. Patients with R0 resection will receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
      200mg for 32 cycles. Patient who had R1 resection will receive radiation 52.8Gy/24Fx with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab 200mg for 32 cycles. Patients who had R2 resection will receive radiation&#xD;
      59.4Gy/27Fx with pembrolizumab 200mg for 32 cycles. Patients who showed non-progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD) to initial neoadjuvant therapy but remained unresectable will receive radiation&#xD;
      59.4Gy/27Fx with 200mg for 32 cycles. Otherwise patients are off the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Male/female participants who are at least 19 years of age on the day of signing&#xD;
