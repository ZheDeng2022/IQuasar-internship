    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase III, two-part (double-blind placebo-controlled/open-label) multicenter&#xD;
      study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of inclisiran in subjects with&#xD;
      homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has two sequential parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: 6-month double-blind period in which subjects will be randomized to receive&#xD;
           either inclisiran or placebo on Days 1 and 90&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: 18-month open-label follow-up period; placebo-treated subjects from Part 1 will&#xD;
           be transitioned to inclisiran on Day 180 and all subjects will participate in an&#xD;
           open-label follow-up period of inclisiran only&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Have any medical or surgical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Any uncontrolled or serious disease, or any medical or surgical condition, that may&#xD;

             participates in the clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any underlying known disease, or surgical, physical, or medical condition that, in the&#xD;
