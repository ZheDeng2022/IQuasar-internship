  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this TARGet Kids! Study, we want to find out whether a short questionnaire can be used to&#xD;
      help find out about mental health problems in preschool age children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research indicates that more than 1 in 10 preschoolers have significant social, emotional and&#xD;
      behavioural problems also known as mental health problems. Unfortunately, parents and doctors&#xD;
      rarely identify mental health problems in young children in order to begin treatment. We are&#xD;
      testing a short five-minute questionnaire completed by parents to see if this may help a&#xD;
      doctor notice if a child has social, emotional and behavioural problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we also hope to find out if the presence of feelings of stress and depression in&#xD;
      on or both parents may be associated with mental health problems in their preschool child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted by researchers at SickKids and St. Michael's Hospital.&#xD;
