      Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the most disabling anxiety disorders occurring&#xD;
      in about 2 out of a 100 adults. Untreated, OCD is a chronic and deteriorating condition,&#xD;
      negatively impacting multiple areas of life with high personal and socioeconomic costs. In&#xD;
      Denmark, anxiety disorders are estimated to be the most expensive of all psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders and the most common reason for forced retirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many countries including DK, CBT is the recommended, first-line treatment for OCD. All&#xD;
      individuals who seek treatment in the Danish Regions are offered CBT. However, reviews show&#xD;
      that up to 50% of patients either do not respond to CBT or terminate treatment prematurely.&#xD;
      Despite this large number of non-responders, no significant progress for OCD treatment has&#xD;
      been made since initial efficacy trials. Alternatives to CBT are needed .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment therapy (ACT) is an innovative psychotherapy that can potentially&#xD;
      help individuals with OCD who do not benefit from CBT. ACT targets the habitual thinking and&#xD;
      behaviors that mark OCD by aiming to increase value-based behavior. OCD often co-occurs with&#xD;
      depression and other anxiety disorders making treatment more difficult. ACT is a&#xD;
      transdiagnostic treatment targeting symptoms that are common to anxiety and mood disorders.&#xD;
      Preliminary findings indicate that ACT may be an effective treatment for OCD. However, these&#xD;
      findings constitute a low level of evidence. Before ACT can be declared as an effective&#xD;
      treatment for OCD, it needs to be demonstrated in randomize controlled trials, in which ACT&#xD;
      is compared to legitimate, active treatments, such as CBT. This project will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of group-based ACT by comparing it to the first-line treatment, group-CBT in&#xD;
      180 participants referred for treatment in a specialized outpatient clinic at the Mental&#xD;
      Health Services, Capital Region of Denmark. Furthermore, moderators and predictors of&#xD;
      treatment response will be investigated.&#xD;

      Introduction Anxiety disorders are some of the most prevalent mental illnesses affecting&#xD;
      350.000-400.000 Danes every year. Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the most&#xD;
      disabling anxiety disorders and is characterised by the presence of intrusive thoughts,&#xD;
      urges, or images that cause anxiety, and, in turn, by repetitive behaviours that are often&#xD;
      performed in an attempt to reduce the anxiety. OCD has a lifetime prevalence of 2-3 %. If&#xD;
      left untreated, OCD is a chronic anxiety disorder resulting in deteriorating mental health&#xD;
      with high personal costs and negative impacts on multiple areas of life. OCD is also&#xD;
      associated with more functional impairment, more use of healthcare services and poorer&#xD;
      quality of life than seen for any other patient group (including substance abuse and somatic&#xD;
      illnesses). Additionally, OCD often precedes the onset of other common comorbid anxiety,&#xD;
      mood, eating and substance abuse disorders and is strongly associated with suicide. The&#xD;
      negative impact of OCD carries over into the families of patients and to society at large. In&#xD;
      Denmark, anxiety disorders are estimated to be the most expensive of all disorders with&#xD;
      annual costs estimated at 9.4 billion DKK, and they are the most common reason for forced&#xD;
      retirement. The high personal and societal costs of OCD makes it a significant public health&#xD;
      concern. Despite having been conceptualized as an illness with a poor prognosis, systematic&#xD;
      reviews have consistently shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure&#xD;
      and response prevention (ERP) is an effective treatment for OCD. This has made CBT the first&#xD;
      choice for treating OCD in many mental health settings, as also recommended by the Danish&#xD;
      Health Authorities. Nonetheless, a relatively large group of OCD patients does not benefit&#xD;
      from CBT. Reviews of CBT-based treatment studies show that up to 50% of patients do not&#xD;
      respond to CBT or terminate treatment prematurely. Despite the large number of&#xD;
      non-responders, no significant progress for OCD treatment has been made since initial&#xD;
      efficacy CBT trials in the 1970Â´ies. Thus, it is crucial to establish more effective&#xD;
      psychotherapies (for the non-responders of CBT-based treatments) for OCD. Preliminary&#xD;
      findings suggest that Acceptance and Commitment therapy (ACT) may be an effective treatment&#xD;
      for OCD. ACT aims at increasing the participants valued actions in life (e.g. family life,&#xD;
      work, sports), and the willingness to experience unpleasant emotions and thoughts. Both&#xD;
      aspects are especially relevant for individuals with OCD, as a substantial amount of time is&#xD;
      spent on OCD-behavior and avoiding the experience of distress and anxiety. To date, the&#xD;
      support for ACT stems from smaller case studies and one controlled trial comparing ACT to&#xD;
      Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR), including 79 individuals with OCD. The case studies&#xD;
      showed that ACT was effective for OCD, and these positive results were also found in the&#xD;
      controlled trial showing an effect size of 0.77 at post-treatment and of 1.10 at follow-up&#xD;
      (3-months). Of the participants randomized to ACT, 46% showed significant symptom change&#xD;
      compared to 13% of the participants who received PMR. Importantly, participants rated ACT as&#xD;
      highly acceptable. However, serious limitations of the currently available evidence limit the&#xD;
      conclusions that can be drawn on the effectiveness of ACT for OCD. First, the studies&#xD;
      included relatively small samples. Second, PMR has not shown to be an effective treatment for&#xD;
      OCD. Third, none of the previous studies have investigated the long-term effect of ACT on&#xD;
      OCD. Thus, studies including a large sample and comparing the effect of ACT to the gold&#xD;
      standard treatment, CBT, is warranted. Furthermore, studies should examine the long-term&#xD;
      effect of ACT. In addition, previous studies have primarily been conducted in laboratory&#xD;
      settings with maximal exclusion criteria which compromises the external validity. But OCD is&#xD;
      commonly seen with comorbid depression and/or other anxiety diagnoses, so results based on&#xD;
      highly selected patient samples treated in research clinics that specialize in OCD treatment&#xD;
      are not generalizable to typical individuals with OCD or to clinics which treat most OCD&#xD;
      patients. In sum, controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of ACT to CBT are warranted&#xD;
      to confirm whether ACT is indeed the sought-after alternative to CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What treatment works for whom? Another crucial step in order to improve the treatment for OCD&#xD;
      is to consider individual patient characteristics in the composition of optimal treatment&#xD;
      setups facilitating personalized treatment. This requires extensive knowledge of predictors&#xD;
      and moderators of OCD treatment success. However, to date no reliable predictors or&#xD;
      moderators have been identified. Previous predictor and moderator studies have suggested that&#xD;
      attachment patterns and anxiety sensitivity may be related to treatment outcome for ACT and&#xD;
      CBT. Accumulating studies also highlights the relevance of investigating biological markers&#xD;
      in relation to OCD. However, very little is known about the role of biomarkers in OCD and in&#xD;
      psychotherapy although studies are emerging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose This study aims to test the (long-term) effectiveness of ACT for OCD and to compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness to CBT in a naturalistic clinical setting. Additionally, the aim is to&#xD;
      identify reliable markers to guide efficient treatment choice by examining several&#xD;
      theory-driven, putative predictors and moderators: 1) moderators which are theoretically&#xD;
      connected to the two treatments (e.g. thought-action-fusion, anxiety sensitivity) 2)&#xD;
      personality and interpersonal characteristics involved in the maintenance of OCD (e.g.&#xD;
      emotion regulation, attachment style, personality traits) and 3) biomarkers known to be&#xD;
      associated with comorbidity, chronicity and treatment refractivity. Finally, 4) the study&#xD;
      will investigate the moderating effects of clinical and demographic characteristics (e.g.&#xD;
      comorbid depression, gender, education, age). Main hypotheses 1: In the overall sample, both&#xD;
      the ACT and CBT treatment will yield clinically significant results, indicated by a change in&#xD;
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores from pre- to posttreatment, with ACT&#xD;
      and CBT being equally effective. 2: The effect at 6- and 12-months follow-up will be equal&#xD;
      for ACT and CBT, measured with Y-BOCS. 3: Participants with comorbid depression at baseline&#xD;
      will benefit more from ACT than CBT. Method The study is a double blinded, pragmatic,&#xD;
      non-inferiority, parallel, multi-center randomized controlled trial of ACT vs CBT for OCD. In&#xD;
      total, 180 patients are recruited from two regional MHS centers across Capital Region of&#xD;
      Denmark and included in two intervention arms. The participants will be assessed with&#xD;
      diagnostic interview and self-report measures at baseline, post-treatment, 6-months and&#xD;
      12-months follow-up. Randomization The randomization will be carried out based on an&#xD;
      allocation list with permuted blocks using the RegionÂ´s secure system REDcap by a person not&#xD;
      attached to the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations and data analysis To calculate the sample size, G*Power 3.1. was used.&#xD;
      Based on previous studies, we expect that there will be a medium to large effect of the&#xD;
      ACT-intervention (similar to the CBT-intervention), corresponding to effect sizes (Cohen's f)&#xD;
      between 0.25 and 0.4. To detect a large effect (f = 0.4) between the two intervention groups&#xD;
      at the four measurement points, we need a total sample of 34 in each arm to power the study&#xD;
      sufficiently (80%) at a Î±-level of 0.05. To detect a medium effect (f = 0.25) a total sample&#xD;
      size of 82 is needed. To be conservative, it is expected to find a medium effect. Previous&#xD;
      clinical studies show a drop-out rate of 25%, thus a total sample of 124 is recruited at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal data will be analyzed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) and&#xD;
      Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) and an intend-to-treat sample including all randomized&#xD;
      participants. Detection of the moderating value of the proposed variables will be analyzed in&#xD;
      the two domains, using the method proposed by Kraemer. The possible moderators will be&#xD;
      examined for individual effect sizes and then entered into a forward-stepwise regression&#xD;
      model predicting differential treatment response. K-fold cross validation will be used to&#xD;
      identify the number of variables to be included in the final moderator model in order to&#xD;
      identify moderators in rank-order. Timeplan The project is planned to start in January 2019&#xD;
      and will run over 4 years.&#xD;
