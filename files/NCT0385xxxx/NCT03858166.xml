    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial. Patients with ovarian&#xD;
      cancer receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were eligible to enroll in this study.&#xD;
      Eligible patients were randomly allocated in a &quot;1:1&quot; to &quot;Standard group&quot; ( 6mg PEG-rhG-CSF&#xD;
      was administrated subcutaneously in 24h after chemotherapy) and &quot;Adjusted group&quot; (6mg&#xD;
      PEG-rhG-CSF was administrated subcutaneously when ANC &lt; 1000/mm3 after chemotherapy). All&#xD;
      patients need to receive at least 2 cycles of PEG-rhG-CSF administration. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is the incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia, and the duration of grade 3/4 neutropenia, the&#xD;
      second outcomes are the incidence of FN, neutropenia-related hospitalization, incidence of&#xD;
      reduction and delay of chemotherapy dose and safety of PEG-rhG-CSF.&#xD;

      Patients with ovarian cancer receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were recruited and&#xD;
      randomly allocated in a &quot;1:1&quot; to &quot;Standard group&quot; (6mg PEG-rhG-CSF was administrated&#xD;
      subcutaneously in 24h after chemotherapy) and &quot;Adjusted group&quot; (6mg PEG-rhG-CSF was&#xD;
      administrated subcutaneously when ANC &lt; 1000/mm3 after chemotherapy). Eligible patients&#xD;
      enrolled in this study need to receive 6 cycles of docetaxel or paclitaxel (including&#xD;
      liposome paclitaxel) and carboplatin on day 1, every 3 weeks. All patients need to receive at&#xD;
      least 2 cycles of PEG-rhG-CSF administration. The primary outcome is the incidence of grade&#xD;
      3/4 neutropenia, and the duration of grade 3/4 neutropenia, the second outcomes are the&#xD;
      incidence of FN, neutropenia-related hospitalization, incidence of reduction and delay of&#xD;
      chemotherapy dose and safety of PEG-rhG-CSF.&#xD;
