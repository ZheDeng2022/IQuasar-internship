  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have confirmed the link between chronic RV apical pacing and the development&#xD;
      of heart failure and LV systolic dysfunction in some patients 1,2. However, questions&#xD;
      continue to remain unanswered in regard to the adverse effects of RV pacing such as the exact&#xD;
      amount of RV pacing that is detrimental to cardiac function and which subsets of patients are&#xD;
      most at risk for developing cardiac dysfunction from chronic RV pacing. Rates of permanent&#xD;
      pacemaker implantation have been increased over the last twenty years with expanding&#xD;
      indications to include permanent pacing after AV node ablation for the treatment of drug&#xD;
      refractory atrial fibrillation and other atrial tachy-arrhythmias. The current standard of&#xD;
      practice is to minimize RV pacing however in patients that have had an AV node ablation right&#xD;
      ventricular pacing cannot be avoided therefore it is important to identify if this particular&#xD;
      group of patients is at an increased risk for developing worsening cardiac function. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to compare cardiac function over time between patients that have&#xD;
      undergone AV node ablation versus patients that have had pacemaker implantation for AV node&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;

      Study Design This is a retrospective chart review of patients that have undergone permanent&#xD;
      pacemaker implantation by the electrophysiology group at Oregon Health and Sciences&#xD;
      University Hospital during the period between 01/2003 and 01/2013 for chronic RV pacing after&#xD;
      AV node ablation or for AV node dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal The goal of this study is to determine if patients requiring RV pacing after AV nodal&#xD;
      ablation are at increased risk for developing worsening cardiac function secondary to chronic&#xD;
      RV pacing compared to patients requiring RV pacing for AV node dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the number of patients that have a permanent pacemaker implanted after AV&#xD;
           node ablation and for AV node dysfunction within the last 10 years at OHSU Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the number of patients that have a biventricular pacemaker implanted with&#xD;
           or without an implantable cardiac defibrillator within the last 10 years at OHSU&#xD;
           Hospital (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amongst those patients identified determine (1) left ventricular ejection fraction prior&#xD;
           to permanent pacemaker or biventricular pacemaker implantation and over time (2) left&#xD;
           ventricular volume and/or diameter prior to permanent pacemaker placement and over time&#xD;
           (3) all cause mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amongst those patients identified determine incidence of new onset atrial fibrillation&#xD;
           after permanent pacemaker or biventricular pacemaker implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amongst those patients identified determine incidence of inpatient admission of heart&#xD;
           failure exacerbation defined as presenting symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal&#xD;
           nocturnal dyspnea, increased lower extremity edema requiring IV diuretics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective chart review of patients that have undergone permanent pacemaker&#xD;
      medical record system used at OHSU Hospital) with the help of an EPIC representative. If the&#xD;
      patient was referred for permanent pacemaker or biventricular pacemaker implantation from a&#xD;
      physician or medical group outside of OHSU records will be requested from that physician or&#xD;
      medical group.&#xD;
