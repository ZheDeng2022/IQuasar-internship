  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is for women with lipedema, a painful fat disorder where fat cannot be&#xD;
      lost from the legs and hips with diet and exercise. The study will compare the use of the&#xD;
      specialized exercise equipment called HYPOXI, which is like a bike but you lie down and air&#xD;
      circulates around the participant's legs like a vacuum with pressure increasing and&#xD;
      decreasing in cycles over time. The goal of the study is to see if using a HYPOXI bike&#xD;
      compared to a regular recumbent (sit down) bike helps women with lipedema lose weight. The&#xD;
      women with lipedema in the study will have the option to use a whole-body suit that works&#xD;
      like a pump and was designed to improve blood circulation in the body. The body suit is&#xD;
      called Dermology and can be used before the HYPOXI exercise equipment but will be optional&#xD;
      for the women in the study. The study is 16 weeks long for 20 women with lipedema. Ten women&#xD;
      with lipedema will exercise with HYPOXI for 8 weeks then switch to a recumbent bike for the&#xD;
      second 8 weeks. The other 10 women will exercise on a recumbent bike for 8 weeks then switch&#xD;
      to HYPOXI for 8 weeks in the second half of the study. Baseline, mid-study, and end of study&#xD;
      data will be collected including measurements of body composition and shape, a blood draw at&#xD;
      the beginning, middle and end, and questionnaires. This study will be listed on&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov for more information.&#xD;
