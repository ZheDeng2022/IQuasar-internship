      In surgical patients considered with &quot;high cardiovascular risk&quot;, by their field or by the&#xD;
      nature of their intervention, it is recommended to use hemodynamic monitoring including a&#xD;
      continuous measurement device of arterial pressure and cardiac output (CO). However,&#xD;
      targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP) with boluses of selective peripheral vasopressors&#xD;
      (without positive inotropic or chronotropic effects) could have deleterious effects on CO.&#xD;
      Thus, it seems important to use a combined analysis of MAP and CO to estimate the&#xD;
      afterload-related cardiac performance (ACP) The investigators recently proposed a cardiac&#xD;
      afterload monitoring, in the descending thoracic aorta, based on a combined analysis of flow&#xD;
      velocity signal recorded by trans-oesophageal Doppler and aortic pressure, the&#xD;
      Velocity-Pressure Loop (VP Loop). VP Loop, and its derived indicators, especially Global&#xD;
      AfterLoad Angle (GALA), could be useful during hemodynamic management for continuous cardiac&#xD;
      afterload monitoring. However, in cardiology unit, cardiac afterload is usually measured at&#xD;
      the ascending aorta behind the aortic valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to compare VP Loop parameters build in the ascending and&#xD;
      descending thoracic aorta according to patient cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;

      Main objective In order to personalize patient approach and better care during surgery, the&#xD;
      investigators recently proposed a cardiac afterload monitoring, in the descending thoracic&#xD;
      aorta, based on a combined analysis of flow velocity signal recorded by trans-oesophageal&#xD;
      Doppler and aortic pressure, the Velocity-Pressure Loop (VP Loop). Cardiac afterload is&#xD;
      usually measured at the ascending aorta behind the aortic valves. The main objective of this&#xD;
      study is then to compare VP Loop parameters build in the ascending and descending thoracic&#xD;
      aorta according to patient cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac afterload is measured under general anesthesia in the ascending and descending aorta,&#xD;
      using recognized arterial indices describing it and parameters derived from the VP loop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac afterload can be schematically defined by the combination of three components:&#xD;
      peripheral vascular resistance (PVR), total arterial compliance (Ctot) and aortic wave&#xD;
      reflections (WR). WR could be assessed by pulse wave pressure analysis with the augmentation&#xD;
      index (Aix) or after pulse wave pressure separation into a forward and backward wave with the&#xD;
      wave reflection index (WRi) or the wave reflection area (WRa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aortic pressure measurements As required by the standard of care of the interventional&#xD;
      neuroradiology procedure, the neuroradiologist also cannulated the femoral artery. At the end&#xD;
      of the procedure, during catheter withdrawal, pressure waveforms are recorded at two&#xD;
      predefined aortic locations: in the ascending aorta and in the descending thoracic aorta just&#xD;
      in front of the esophageal Doppler probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aortic velocity recording VP Loop in ascending aorta and aortic velocity are measured in the&#xD;
      flushing chamber of the left ventricle from the apical five-chamber view by trans-thoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography (TTE) (Philips, EPIQ 7). Descending aortic velocity is measured with a&#xD;
      transesophageal Doppler CardioQ-ODM+ (Deltex Medical, Chichester, UK) in order to construct&#xD;
      the VP Loop in descending thoracic aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VP Loop construction Digitalization of pressure and velocity signals are performed with the&#xD;
      IntelliVue MP60 monitor (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at a sampling frequency of 125&#xD;
      Hz and saved using ixTrend software (ixellence, Wildau, Germany) on a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, the velocity coordinates is plotted on the x axis and the pressure coordinates on&#xD;
      the y axis. The investigators characterise the VP Loop by 4 points (A, B, C, D), allowing us&#xD;
      to identify 3 angles: Alpha, Beta and GALA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate in patients cardiac after-load obtained by VP loop and&#xD;
      to compare VP Loop parameters build in the ascending and descending thoracic aorta according&#xD;
      to patient cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design This is a single-center, interventional, category II prospective study&#xD;
      (minimal risks and constraints) Population concerned Patients will be included if their&#xD;
      perioperative risk required a continuous monitoring of MAP and CO. The study involves major&#xD;
      patients under general anaesthesia in interventional neuroradiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Proceedings For all patients, data from trans-oesophageal Doppler, trans-thoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography (TTE) and hemodynamic data are collected at the end of the procedure. During&#xD;
      catheter withdrawal, pressure waveforms are recorded at two predefined aortic locations: in&#xD;
      the ascending aorta and in the descending thoracic aorta just in front of the esophageal&#xD;
      Doppler probe. All data from monitoring are connected to the main monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no benefit for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collective benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP) with boluses of selective peripheral vasopressors&#xD;
      (without positive inotropic or chronotropic effects) could have deleterious effects on&#xD;
      cardiac output. Thus, it seems important to use a combined analysis of MAP and CO with low&#xD;
      invasive methods to estimate the Afterload-related cardiac performance (ACP) in surgical&#xD;
      patients considered with &quot;high cardiovascular risk&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and minimal constraints added by the research No added risk. Patients are included if&#xD;
      their perioperative risk required a continuous monitoring of MAP and CO. The standard of care&#xD;
      for the interventional neuroradiology procedure needs a catheterization of the femoral artery&#xD;
      using the Seldinger technique and insertion of a catheter. All the other ones measures are&#xD;
      obtained non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are assigned to one of two groups according to their risk of increased arterial&#xD;
      stiffness as reported in cardiological publications. The criteria used by investigators are&#xD;
      as follows: age &gt; 50 years old as a major criterion 20 and cardio-vascular risk factors&#xD;
      (history of congestive heart failure, history of cardiovascular event, current smoking,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and arterial hypertension) as minor criteria. Patients were&#xD;
      classified into the high risk group (Hi-risk) if they had at least one major criterion or two&#xD;
      minor criteria or into the low risk group (Lo-risk) if they presented with no or one minor&#xD;
      criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During their interventional neuroradiology procedure, all patients' routine monitoring will&#xD;
      consist of electrocardiogram, pulsated oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2, respiratory rate,&#xD;
      tidal volume and monitoring of neuromuscular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients whatever the comorbidities, anesthesia induction will be performed using a&#xD;
      target-controlled infusion (Orchestra® Base Primea - Fresenius Kabi France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our standard of care, intra-operative episodes of hypotension (mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP) &lt; 65 mmHg or &lt; 80% baseline) are treated by Norepinephrine bolus of 10 µg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, data from trans-oesophageal Doppler, trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE)&#xD;
      and hemodynamic data are collected at the end of the procedure. During catheter withdrawal,&#xD;
      pressure waveforms are recorded at two predefined aortic locations: in the ascending aorta&#xD;
      and in the descending thoracic aorta just in front of the esophageal Doppler probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of selected subjects Selection of patients up to 55 analysable patients Number of&#xD;
      Centre : 1 Research Agenda inclusion period: 12 months duration of participation (treatment +&#xD;
      follow-up): duration of the interventional neuroradiology procedure: 1 day total duration: 12&#xD;
      months Number of planned inclusions by centre and month : 5 Number of subjects required : 55&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be expressed as mean ± SD and qualitative variables are expressed&#xD;
      as n (%). For comparison between LR and HR, investigators used the t-test or chi-squared test&#xD;
      for continuous or categorical variables. The comparison of hemodynamic parameters between&#xD;
      ascending and descending aorta is performed by a paired t-test. A Pearson correlation is used&#xD;
      to study the relationship between different hemodynamic indices. Receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic curves (ROC) and Area under the curves (AUC) will be performed to calculate&#xD;
      the performance of each cardiac afterload index to discriminate LR and HR patients. P-value&#xD;
      less than 5% is considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is based on the following assumptions: incidence of Hi-risk&#xD;
      patients of 50%, as previously reported, incidence of increase of intrinsic arterial&#xD;
      stiffness (after-load). In low risk patients a difference in arterial stiffness between low-&#xD;
      and high-risk patients at 30%, power at 80% and type I error at 5%. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      calculated sample size is 55 patients for the entire population.&#xD;
