      When patients get musculoskeletal pain and seek care, the healthcare professional performs a&#xD;
      detailed clinical examination to determine a diagnosis and determine a plan of care which&#xD;
      often includes imaging. There are only a few studies that have looked at the accuracy of the&#xD;
      clinical examination in a primary care setting, most studies having been performed in a&#xD;
      specialty practice treating Orthopedic or Sports injuries. In these practices, surgery has&#xD;
      become and remains the gold standard. However, in primary care, often imaging like Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become the the criterion standard. This double blind study will&#xD;
      compare the diagnosis reached by clinical exam to the results found on MRI. In addition, the&#xD;
      examining clinician will report their recommended plan of care after the examination.&#xD;
