  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasotracheal intubation(NTI) is commonly used in operations of the mouth, pharynx, larynx and&#xD;
      also the neck. While these patients showed higher rates of difficult laryngoscopy. Therefore,&#xD;
      duration of apnoea is prolonged and re-oxygenation is inevitable.Mask ventilation is the most&#xD;
      fundamental technique in maintaining oxygenation, even when endotracheal intubation is&#xD;
      failed. However, the most common complication of NTI is epistaxis, removing the nasotracheal&#xD;
      tube could make mask ventilation extremely difficult.So the investigatorsbelieve the ideal&#xD;
      approach is ventilation through original nasotracheal tube.Several techniques of supraglottic&#xD;
      ventilations through endotracheal tubes have been reported.It remains uncertain whether&#xD;
      supraglottic ventilation through inflated nasal RAE endotracheal tube has similar efficiency&#xD;
      as mask ventilation after general anesthesia induction. Based on previous clinical&#xD;
      experience, the investigators hypothesised that ventilations through inflated nasal RAE&#xD;
      endotracheal tube and through facemask were comparable in terms of tidal volume and airway&#xD;
      pressure in anesthetized, apnoeic adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients were randomly assigned (sealed envelope method) to face mask（Group A，n=20）or&#xD;
      nasal ventilation(Group B，n=20), For A: face mask ventilation followed by nasal ventilation&#xD;
      and for B:nasal ventilation followed by face mask ventilation.Measure the tidal volume and&#xD;
      air leakage of face mask and nasal ventilation during pressure-controlled ventilation mode&#xD;
      and volume-controlled mode, respectively.&#xD;

    <description>Group A was first ventilated through the face mask, and the tidal volume was measured under pressure-controlled mode (10, 15, 20 cm H2O) ;Switched to volume-controlled (6,8,10ml/kg predicted body weight)mode, the actual tidal volume was recorded, and the air leakage was calculated. Then, put a nasal RAE tube in one side of the nostril, inflate the cuff, make the catheter in a natural position after inflation, clip the other side of the nostril, close the lip with tape, connect the breathing circuit, record the actual tidal volume; measure the expired tidal volume during pressure-controlled ventilation (10, 15, 20 cm H2O).Subject will start with one technique and then cross over to the other technique.</description>
