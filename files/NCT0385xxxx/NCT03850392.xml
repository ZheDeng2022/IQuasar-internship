      47 patients with non-septic knee arthritis were treated by local ice (30 min) or cold CO2 (2&#xD;
      min) twice at an 8 hour-interval for 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The synovial fluid was collected just before the first cold application then 24 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokine, VEGF, NF-kB, PG-E2 levels were assessed in the synovial fluid before/after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contralateral arthritic knees were used as paired controls when possible.&#xD;

      Patient inclusion Patients hospitalized in the rheumatology department in the Besançon&#xD;
      university hospital in France and suffering from non-septic knee arthritis (rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis according to the ACR-EULAR criteria, spondyloarthritis according to the ASAS&#xD;
      criteria, gout or calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPDD) - diagnosed by microscopic&#xD;
      microcrystal assessment in synovial fluid) were included consecutively after signed informed&#xD;
      consent. The protocol was declared and approved by the local ethic committee -&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov:NCT02573298, Comité de Protection des Personnes - Est II: 12-664) and all&#xD;
      research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines/regulations. Patients suffering&#xD;
      from septic arthritides and knee osteoarthritis were excluded. The patients had received no&#xD;
      biologic treatment nor conventional DMARD for the 6 months preceding inclusion.&#xD;
      Corticosteroids, colchicine and NSAIDs were stopped for at least 24 hours prior to inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design In the first phase of the study, the included patients were then randomized&#xD;
      (1:1) to receive either local ice (Thermogel®, Artsana, Grandate, Italy - 30 minutes&#xD;
      application - N=16) or hyperbaric cold CO2 at -78°C (Cryo+®, Cryonic, Salins-les-Bains,&#xD;
      France - 2 minutes-N=16). Each patient received two applications of the randomly chosen&#xD;
      technique at an 8 hour interval (9 a.m and 5 p.m). The skin temperature was monitored on the&#xD;
      treated knee using MLT409/A Skin Temperature Probe® and ML309 Thermistor Pod®&#xD;
      (ADInstruments,Dunedin, NZ). Thirty of these 32 patients were also included in another part&#xD;
      of the study,aiming at evaluating the variations of the synovial power Doppler&#xD;
      semi-quantitative score before/after 2 cold applications (ice versus cold CO2) 2. Just before&#xD;
      the first cold application, at 9 a.m., and 24 hours later (day=1 at 9 a.m), an arthrocentesis&#xD;
      was performed. Standard analyses were performed on the synovial fluid (bacteriology, cytology&#xD;
      and microcrystal microscopic assessment). Furthermore, a part of the synovial fluid was&#xD;
      centrifuged then frozen at -80°C. For the second arthrocentesis, after the synovial fluid was&#xD;
      gathered for the same analyses, an intra-joint corticosteroid injection (Triamcinolone,&#xD;
      HEXATRIONE®, Ethypharm, Saint-Cloud, France) was performed before removing the needle. These&#xD;
      synovial fluid samples were used to perform the present part of the study, which was overall&#xD;
      powered to evaluate the IL-6 level variations in the synovial fluid before/after 2 cold&#xD;
      applications. After all the patients were included, synovial fluid IL-6, IL-17A, IL-1β,&#xD;
      TNF-α, VEGF (Multiplex flow cytometry, CBA® BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA)&#xD;
      and PG-E2 (ELISA, KGE004B®, Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA), NF-KB-P65/NFkB- p65-P&#xD;
      (ELISA,85-86083-11®, Thermofisher, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) levels were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study, we only included patients suffering from arthritides of&#xD;
      both knees and treated them with local ice only, according to the protocol described above&#xD;
      (N=15 +1 patient with knee bi-arthritis previously included in the first phase of the study&#xD;
      in the ice treated group). The same protocol was applied to contralateral non-treated knees&#xD;
      except cryotherapy treatment. Therefore, the synovial fluid was gathered and analyzed at the&#xD;
      same evaluation times compared to treated knees, so these contralateral arthritic knees were&#xD;
      used as paired controls for cytokine and enzyme assays (N=16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses. The sample size was calculated in order to detect a significant&#xD;
      variation in IL-6 synovialprotein levels before/after 2 cold applications. 15.78 (N=16)&#xD;
      patients per group were necessary to detect a difference of 2325 pg/mL in IL-6 protein level&#xD;
      with a power of 95% and a p-value of 0.05, according to published results of IL-6 assays in&#xD;
      knee synovial fluid. Therefore, 2 groups of 16 patients were included in the first randomized&#xD;
      phase of the study(ice versus cold CO2), then 16 patients with knee bi-arthritis were&#xD;
      required for the second phase of the study (ice-treated versus contralateral knee, N=15+1&#xD;
      patient already enrolled in the first phase). For these reasons, a total of 47 patients were&#xD;
      included. Paired Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney tests were performed in order to compare the mean&#xD;
      cytokine and enzyme levels before/after treatment. Subgroup analyses were also planned&#xD;
      (according to the treatment modalities (ice or cold CO2) and to the type of rheumatic disease&#xD;
      (microcrystalinduced arthritides - pooled gout and CPDD patients - versus&#xD;
      non-microcrystal-induced diseases - pooled RA and SpA patients). Furthermore, an interclass&#xD;
      effect-size (weighted mean differences with 95% CI) for cytokine levels (before/after&#xD;
      treatment) was calculated between ice-treated knees and the corresponding contralateral&#xD;
      non-treated knees using R® software (rmeta® and meta® packages). Correlation tests were also&#xD;
      performed using Pearson's coefficients in order to assess the parameters associated with&#xD;
      cytokine level variations (before/after treatment). The statistical analyses were performed&#xD;
      using R® and Graphpad® softwares.&#xD;
