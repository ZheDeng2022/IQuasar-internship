  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of MG1113 in the single&#xD;
      ascending dose study (IV injection or SC injection) in healthy subjects and hemophiia&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose study that explore the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of the study&#xD;
      drug by sequentially increasing the study drug in 4 dose levels. The route of administration&#xD;
      is either subcutaneous (SC) injection or intravenous (IV) injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For healthy subjects, 6 subjects will be assigned to the study group and 2 subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned to the placebo group to explore the safety and tolerability, and PK/PD of the study&#xD;
      drug in comparison with placebo. Hemophilia patients will be assigned only to the study group&#xD;
      with 3 and 6 subjects in each cohort, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator and subjects will know which cohort the healthy subjects have been assigned&#xD;
      to, but they will be double-blinded as to whether the subjects are assigned to the study&#xD;
      group (study drug) or the placebo group (placebo) within each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses planned in healthy subjects are 0.5 mg/kg, 1.7 mg/kg, and 3.3 mg/kg by SC&#xD;
      injection; 3.3 mg/kg by IV injection. In hemophilia patients, 1.7 mg/kg and 3.3 mg/kg will be&#xD;
      administered by SC injection. The planned dose will be administered after checking the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability at the previous dose to the extent not exceeding the criteria for&#xD;
      discontinuation of dose escalation. The dose escalation will be decided by the Data&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee(DMC) and Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMB) in the blinded&#xD;
      evaluation of the safety and tolerability data obtained from each previous cohort for 7 days&#xD;
      after administration. Before deciding dose escalation and proceeding to the next step, the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK, and PD data obtained from all healty subjects and hemophilia&#xD;
      patients up to cohort 6 will be evaluated by the Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMB) in&#xD;
      an unblinded manner. In addition, if necessary, the analysis result of cohort that has&#xD;
      completed all the scheduled visits can be reviewed in an unblinded manner.&#xD;
