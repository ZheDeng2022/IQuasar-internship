    <textblock>
      Infants with developmental disabilities present a high risk of behavioral and socio-emotional&#xD;
      problems. Their parents are themselves at risk of developing emotional and affective&#xD;
      disorders which can impact the quality of the interaction with the infant. Early parenting&#xD;
      empowerment focused on parent-infant interaction are beneficial in supporting infants&#xD;
      development and parental adjustment. By using a multi-layer approach to outcomes assessment&#xD;
      (i.e., behavioral, neuroendocrine and epigenetic outcomes), the present longitudinal,&#xD;
      multi-center, change-promoting clinical trial is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      early parenting empowerment intervention based on video-feedback technique to support&#xD;
      maternal responsiveness and the socio-emotional development of infants with developmental&#xD;
      disabilities.&#xD;

      RATIONALE: Infants with developmental disabilities (e.g., cerebral palsy and genetic&#xD;
      syndrome) present a high risk of behavioral and socio-emotional problems. Their parents are&#xD;
      themselves at risk of developing emotional and affective disorders which can impact the&#xD;
      quality of the interaction with the infant. Typical development research is highlighting the&#xD;
      potentials of biological markers of less-than-optimal mother-infant interaction, such as&#xD;
      altered neuroendocrine regulation (i.e., cortisol and oxytocin). Increased infants' salivary&#xD;
      cortisol reactivity has been found in response to experimental suspension of maternal&#xD;
      responsiveness (Still-Face paradigm, SFP). On the other hand, oxytocin administration to&#xD;
      mothers increases responsiveness to infants socio-emotional signals and oxytocin has also&#xD;
      been associated with socioemotional stress regulation in humans. Interestingly, previous&#xD;
      research suggests that the epigenetic regulation of specific genes (i.e., SLC6A4, NR3C1,&#xD;
      BDNF, OXTR) transcription might be affected by alterations of maternal caregiving behavior.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, to date there is no investigation of the&#xD;
      epigenetic vestiges of the effects of an early parenting intervention (i.e., video-feedback)&#xD;
      on the behavioral outcomes of infants with developmental disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1: To assess the effectiveness of the video-feedback intervention to enhance the&#xD;
      socio-emotional behavior of infants with developmental disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AIM 1: The present research project will include two groups&#xD;
      (Video-Feedback Group, VFG; Phone-Call Group, PCG) and four phases: T0, baseline assessment;&#xD;
      T1, post-intervention assessment ; T2, follow-up#1 (3 months after the intervention); T3,&#xD;
      follow-up#2 (6 months after the intervention). All infants and their mothers will be enrolled&#xD;
      at three Child Neuropsychiatric Units in Lombardia Region (OU1, Scientific Institute IRCCS E.&#xD;
      Medea; OU2, Fondazione Istituto Neurologico Casimiro Mondino, Pavia, Italy; OU3, Università&#xD;
      degli Studi, Brescia, Italy). At each phase, mother-infant interactions will be videotaped&#xD;
      during SFP. The VFG dyads will participate to a 6-session videofeedback intervention The aim&#xD;
      of the video-feedback intervention is to support maternal sensitivity to the infants'&#xD;
      behaviors focusing on different aspects of mother-infant interactions. PCG mothers will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone weekly for 6 weeks, and will be asked for information on their&#xD;
      infants' development. No advice about sensitive parenting will be given to the control PCG&#xD;
      mothers during these conversations. In each of the three Units, the intervention will be&#xD;
      conducted by psychologists/developmental neuropsychiatrists trained on the video-feedback&#xD;
      intervention. Infant behavior regulation will be observationally assessed at each of the four&#xD;
      phases of the research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 2: To examine the effects of the intervention on maternal responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AIM 2: Paralleling infants' behavioral assessment, maternal&#xD;
      responsiveness will be assessed at each project phase by means of video-tapes. Additionally,&#xD;
      maternal reports of emotional and affective states, including depressive and anxious symptoms&#xD;
      and stress perception in taking care of the infant, will be obtained and controlled for. The&#xD;
      rate of change over the phases of the project in maternal self-reported emotional states,&#xD;
      feelings of attachment and coded sensitivity will concur in defining the efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention in the VFG subjects against the PCG counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 3: To investigate the immediate and follow-up pre/post intervention variations&#xD;
      in the neuroendocrine functioning (i.e., salivary cortisol and oxytocin) and in the DNA&#xD;
      methylation of specific genes associated with infants' behavioral regulation such as: NR3C1,&#xD;
      BDNF, SLC6A4, OXTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AIM 3: Salivary samples will be collected from the infant at each phase&#xD;
      before and after the SFP interaction. For what pertains neuroendocrine markers (i.e.,&#xD;
      salivary cortisol and oxytocin) saliva will be collected from the infants (and mothers) using&#xD;
      an oral cotton swab and it will be collected in eppendorf, centrifuged and conserved&#xD;
      according to kit producer guidelines. Samples will be obtained before (1 sample) and after (3&#xD;
      samples: +10, +20, and +30 minutes) the SFP procedure. Due to circadian rhythm of the&#xD;
      neuroendocrine systems, all the interactions will occur in the morning, between 9.00 and&#xD;
      12.00 AM. For what pertains the epigenetic profiling, saliva will be collected once per&#xD;
      phase. DNA methylation will be assessed at the different CpG sites within the promoter&#xD;
      regions of specific target genes (NR3C1, SLC6A4, BDNF, OXTR) previously associated with&#xD;
      infants' behavioral development. The rate of change in neuroendocrine concentrations of&#xD;
      cortisol and oxytocin as well as the alterations in global and site-specific DNA methylation&#xD;
      of the selected genes will be used as independent biomarkers of the effects of the&#xD;
      video-feedback intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE AND INNOVATION: First, the study has the potential to bring new evidence in the&#xD;
      clinical practices promoting an early intervention for mothers of infants with developmental&#xD;
      disabilities. Second, the multi-center nature of this clinical trial will provide a common&#xD;
      early intervention program in the Italian context, with potential indirect implication for&#xD;
      healthcare costs optimization. Indeed, it has been shown that interventions starting earlier&#xD;
      in childhood may be more effective and efficient than those provided in a later period of&#xD;
      life. Consistently, the project will be conducted during the first year of life of infants&#xD;
      with the potential to permanently alter infants' development trajectories and to yield a&#xD;
      significant economic return for the healthcare system. Finally, examining the epigenetic&#xD;
      variations related to early parenting intervention the project introduces an innovative&#xD;
      approach to early intervention research for families of infants with developmental&#xD;
      disabilities.&#xD;
