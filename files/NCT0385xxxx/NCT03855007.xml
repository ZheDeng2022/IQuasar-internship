      This study is designed to observed prospectively the efficacy and safety of 6 months&#xD;
      treatment of iguratimod alone, or with methotrexate (MTX), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and&#xD;
      prednisone step by step on Chinese rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and early rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (ERA) patients who were naïve or shown insufficiency response or intolerance to DMARDs. If&#xD;
      volunteered, patients who completed the 6-month study can continue to follow our plans for 24&#xD;

      This study will enroll 200 cases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and early rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (ERA) patients in China, who are naïve or shown insufficiency response or intolerance to&#xD;
      DMARDs. The participants plan to be treated with iguratimod alone, or along with methotrexate&#xD;
      (MTX)/ hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) / prednisone (Pred) step by step for 6 months if participants&#xD;
      are in medium or high disease activity (DAS28≥3.2). Participants can choose to continue the&#xD;
      study up to 24 months.The efficacy and safety of 6 months and 24 months Iguratimod treatment&#xD;
      in RA and ERA patients will be evaluated with DAS28-ESR and other disease activity indices.&#xD;

    <description>The percentage of patients whose Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) achieve remission（DAS28-ESR≤ 2.6）and Low Disease Activity (DAS28-ESR ≤ 3.2). The DAS28 is a composite score derived from 4 of these measures，that is the count of tender joint count（TJC, 0-28）and swollen joint count（SJC, 0-28）, measure erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, mm/h) or C reactive protein (CRP, mg/L) and to make a patient assessment of disease activity i.e. 'global assessment of health' (GH) using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) with 0 = best, 100 = worst. DAS28 values were calculated as follows: DAS28- ESR = 0.56√(TJC) + 0.28√(SJC) + 0.70 ln ESR + 0.014 x GH. High disease activity: DAS28-ESR &gt; 5.1; Moderate disease activity: 5.1≥ DAS28 &gt; 3.2 to 5.1; Low disease activity (LDA) and Remission mean Clinical remission.</description>
