  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no clinical biomarker that can be used to select patients for&#xD;
      CCR2-targeted therapy and to monitor response to such therapy. Considering the toxicity and&#xD;
      the rate of response to CCR2-targeted therapy, it is crucial to be able to identify patients&#xD;
      who may not response to this therapy in order to avoid the morbidity and expense associated&#xD;
      with ineffective therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the combination of the novel CCR2 imaging agent with the novel CCR2-targeted&#xD;
      therapy in this trial is of great importance to promote science while prolonging the life and&#xD;
      its quality in patients with PDAC. The investigators also believe that this combination will&#xD;
      make substantial contributions to the fields of cancer immunotherapy and tumor&#xD;
      monocyte/macrophage biology. Moreover, this imaging agent has the potential to not only&#xD;
      facilitate development and testing of future CCR2-targeted therapeutic agents but also serve&#xD;
      as a prescreen tool to select appropriate patients for imaging guided treatment.&#xD;

    <description>SUVmax is a mathematical measurement of tumor burden seen on images and calculated by the following equation SUVmax= r / (a'/w) where r= radioactivity concentration in tumor (kBq/ml) as measured by the PET scanner within a defined region of interest, a'=the decay corrected amount of injected 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i and w= weight of the patient in grams When PET imaging shows uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i in site(s) of known tumor the SUVmax will be compared to clinical measurement of response to treatment taking into consideration standard response criteria including radiological imaging, laboratory values, physical examination and repeat pathology as applicable.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate whether tumor take of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i post therapy correlates with CCR2 expression and is predictive of response to therapy as measured by visual tumor uptake on 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i images</measure>

    <description>Visual tumor uptake as compared to background blood/tissue uptake: 1=no uptake, 2=mild uptake, 3=moderate uptake, and 5=striking update&#xD;
A decrease in visual tumor uptake from baseline to post therapy imaging in cohort 2 subject is hypothesized to represent response to CCR2 directed therapy while an increase in tumor uptake is expected in cohort 1b subjects who progress while receiving standard therapy.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate if tumor take of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i is predictive of response to CCR2-directed therapy measured by comparison of SUVmax at imaging prior to the start of CCR2 directed therapy and SUVmax at imaging performed after 2 cycles of CCR2 directed therapy</measure>
