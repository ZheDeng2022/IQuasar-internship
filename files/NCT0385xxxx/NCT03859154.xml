      In hematotoxic snakebites, due to the lack of a better alternative, 20 minute whole blood&#xD;
      clotting test (20'WBCT) or Clotting time remains the standard test in developing countries&#xD;
      even though its reliability and sensitivity has been shown to be low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) based Clot Waveform Analysis (CWA) is an optic&#xD;
      absorbance assay that can be used as a global clotting test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It essentially detects the change in colour of the plasma as coagulation progresses and&#xD;
      quantifies the change in the form of a waveform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators intend to study prospectively the behaviour of clot wave&#xD;
      (CW) in hematotoxic bites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot observational study was initially conducted (IEC Ref No. 42/16/IEC/JMMC and RI) and&#xD;
      CWA showed changes which provided information earlier than the conventional coagulation&#xD;
      studies in the snakebite victims studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While aPTT or WBCT reflects clotting time, CWA conveys the dynamic process of clot formation.&#xD;
      CWA may reveal disorders of clotting in snakebite victims before the conventional tests&#xD;
      become abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators aim to study the changes in CWA in snakebite victims who develop&#xD;
      coagulation disorders in blood&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Viperidae bites are quite common in India and are notorious to cause hematotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hematotoxic bites, the test recommended to ascertain the development of coagulopathy is a&#xD;
      whole blood clotting test (WBCT) as per the current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eventhough the reliability and sensitivity of WBCT has been shown to be low, it still remains&#xD;
      the standard test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There exists a need to explore other coagulation studies in snakebite to look for a better&#xD;
      and efficient alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clot waveform analysis (CWA) is an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based optic&#xD;
      absorbance assay that can be used as a global clotting test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown useful in identifying disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in&#xD;
      sepsis with high specificity (97.6%) and sensitivity (98%), and the test is recommended by&#xD;
      the British Committee for Standards in Hematology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      of DIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CWA is based on the traditional aPTT assay. On assessing aPTT with light transmission, a&#xD;
      change in the light absorbance is observed as the clot stabilizes by fibrin polymerization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plotting the milliabsorbance (mAbs) of the sample to time, a curve is obtained which reflects&#xD;
      the optical profile that is generated as a clot is formed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This tracing against time gives a qualitative assessment of fibrin polymerization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delta in absorbance (dAbs) is based on the change in mAbs value from the baseline to the&#xD;
      endpoint (plateau) along the Y-axis of the clot curve. The dAbs values of &lt;100 mAbs denote&#xD;
      low fibrinogen samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normal clot waveform has five main phases: delay, baseline, acceleration, deceleration,&#xD;
      and end point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;delay&quot; period begins at 0 and precedes the &quot;baseline.&quot; which denotes the mixing of the&#xD;
      reagents and system optimization of light intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;baseline&quot; is the portion of the curve which appears after all reagents have been added&#xD;
      to the time and the clot formation begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aPTT value is noted at this point (vertical red line). The &quot;acceleration&quot; phase denotes&#xD;
      fibrin clot formation, whereas &quot;deceleration&quot; denotes decreasing rate of clot formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two more curves that are plotted in CWA, the first derivative and the second&#xD;
      derivatives. They are both derivatives of the absorbance curves. The first derivative&#xD;
      reflects the coagulation velocity, whereas the second derivative reflects the acceleration of&#xD;
      coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators in this study aim to assess the changes in the CW form in viper-envenomated&#xD;
      victims and to compare CWA with standard tests such as prothrombin time (PT) with the&#xD;
      international normalized ratio (INR), aPTT, clotting time (CT) (modified Lee and White&#xD;
      method) and 20'WBCT( twenty minute whole blood clotting test)&#xD;
