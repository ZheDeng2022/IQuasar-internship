  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have been shown to be effective in reducing the&#xD;
      disease activity in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) but these&#xD;
      treatments, often need to be used continuously for an unknown duration, rendering the&#xD;
      long-term use extremely expensive. In addition, chronic administration of DMTs is often&#xD;
      associated with undesirable side effects. Among these medications, B-cell depleting&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies might have the properties of an ideal group of medications: i) B-cell&#xD;
      depleting antibodies have proven to be extremely potent in reducing or stopping the disease&#xD;
      activity in relapsing MS, ii) B-cell depleting antibodies are very safe if used for a short&#xD;
      period and use for a short duration may stop the inflammatory disease activity over long&#xD;
      term, although current clinical practice and protocols are based on continuing B-cell&#xD;
      depletion for an unknown period of time. Indeed, early phase clinical trials of rituximab and&#xD;
      ocrelizumab suggested that a short course treatment with B-cell depleting antibodies can have&#xD;
      long term effects and disease activity will not return even long after B-cell repopulation in&#xD;
      the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This long-term effect might be related to the specific pattern of B-cell tolerance defect in&#xD;
      patients with MS and the potential of its normalization with B-cell depleting antibodies. By&#xD;
      analyzing the reactivity of recombinant antibodies expressed from single B-cells, the&#xD;
      investigators' collaborators have demonstrated that the pattern of B-cell tolerance defect is&#xD;
      different in people with MS who only display an impaired removal of developing autoreactive&#xD;
      B-cells in the periphery while central B-cell tolerance in the bone marrow is functional in&#xD;
      most patients. In contrast, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type-1 diabetes (T1D) or&#xD;
      Sjögren's syndrome (SS) show defective central and peripheral B-cell tolerance checkpoints.&#xD;
      As a consequence, while anti-B-cell therapy does not correct defective early B-cell tolerance&#xD;
      checkpoints in T1D and only temporarily slows down autoimmune processes before newly&#xD;
      generated autoreactive B-cells likely induce patient relapse, the investigators postulate&#xD;
      that the efficacy of B-cell depleting antibodies in MS may be linked to the B-cell depleting&#xD;
      antibodies' normal central B-cell tolerance and the production of a normal B-cell and T-cell&#xD;
      compartment after anti-B-cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' goal is to provide proof-of-concept that a short duration of treatment&#xD;
      with B-cell depleting antibodies can correct B-cell tolerance defects in MS and allow for&#xD;
      medication-free prolonged freedom from disease activity, at least in a proportion of subjects&#xD;
      with relapsing MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an open label study, 10 patients with active relapsing MS will be treated with two courses&#xD;
      of ocrelizumab and will be followed clinically and radiologically for at least two and a half&#xD;
      years. Time to the return of disease activity (defined as clinical relapses or new or&#xD;
      enhancing lesions on the MRI) will be the primary outcome of the study. The investigators&#xD;
      will harvest B-cells before starting the treatment and after B-cell repopulation and assess&#xD;
      the central and peripheral tolerance defects. The investigators hypothesize that in most&#xD;
      participants, the disease activity will not come back, and this prolonged response to anti&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation 20 (CD-20) therapy is associated with normalization of B-cell&#xD;
      tolerance defect in these patients. Considering the safety of this approach, it can be&#xD;
      adopted widely among people with MS. Hence, the proposed B-cell analyses before and after&#xD;
      B-cell depletion in people with MS will provide novel insights regarding the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the beneficial effect of B-cell depleting antibodies and the potential long-term&#xD;
      suppression of disease activity. This strategy can therefore improve the approach to&#xD;
      treatment of many people with relapsing MS.&#xD;
