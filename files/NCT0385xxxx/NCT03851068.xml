  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct the initial clinical investigation of the Foldax&#xD;
      Polymer Aortic Valve to collect evidence on the device's safety and performance. The study is&#xD;
      anticipated to confirm successful clinical safety and clinical effectiveness with significant&#xD;
      improvements in clinical hemodynamic performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Foldax Polymer Aortic Valve is indicated as a replacement for a diseased, damaged, or&#xD;
      malfunctioning native aortic heart valve via open heart surgery. This is a first in human&#xD;
      study conducted under US FDA's Early Feasibility Investigational Device Exemption and will&#xD;
      enroll up to 40 patients. These patients will be followed up to 5 years after implantation.&#xD;
