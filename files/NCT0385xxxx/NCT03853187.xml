  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study, to assess feasibility and safety of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant setting in patients with resectable NSCLC. Additional analyses of potential&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers, e.g. Zr-89 labelled durvalumab (MEDI4736), ex vivo In-111-oxine labelled&#xD;
      CD8+ T-cells and high-resolution immune cell imaging, in relation to immunotherapy induced&#xD;
      immune responses on quantitative immune histochemical analysis of the resected tumor&#xD;
      specimen, will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study in 20 patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer who&#xD;
      will receive 2 courses of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in the neo-adjuvant setting, followed by&#xD;
      surgery with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental imaging procedures include 1) Zr-89-labelled durvalumab (MEDI4736) scan prior to&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant treatment to determine accessibility and intra-tumoral distribution of&#xD;
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) and 2) injection of ex vivo In-111-oxine labelled autologous CD8+&#xD;
      T-cells 48 hours prior to surgery. The scan is scheduled on the day of surgery and after&#xD;
      surgery, the resected tumor specimen with In-111-oxine labelled CD8+ T-cells in situ, is&#xD;
      fixated for high-resolution ex vivo imaging on a preclinical U-SPECT scanner and quantitative&#xD;
      histopathological analysis, next to standard histopathological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the study is maximum 42 days (from injection therapeutic dose durvalumab&#xD;
      (MEDI4736) to surgery).&#xD;

    <description>Patient related outcome measurements (PROMS) will be evaluated based on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 (quality of life) questionnaire (in Dutch) at baseline, prior to surgery, at first post-operative visit and follow-up.&#xD;
The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.&#xD;
Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>
