  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled to undergo routine upper endoscopy for foregut or esophageal symptoms or&#xD;
      undergoing surveillance for Barrett's esophagus with no dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia are&#xD;
      candidates for participation, but patients with known high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      or with a history of prior endoscopic resection or ablation for these conditions are not&#xD;
      candidates for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At endoscopy, all patients will be initially assessed for the presence of an endoscopic&#xD;
      suspicious lesion using white light and if appropriate narrow band imaging or similar&#xD;
      enhanced imaging techniques. All suspicious lesions undergo targeted biopsy first, and then&#xD;
      either 4-Quadrant Random Forceps Biopsy or WATS biopsies of the GEJ and if present the&#xD;
      columnar-lined esophagus based on the assigned randomization away from the area of targeted&#xD;
      biopsies. A biopsy will be obtained from the antrum in each patient to assess for H. pylori&#xD;
      infection and the presence of intestinal metaplasia.&#xD;

      Patients scheduled to undergo routine upper endoscopy for foregut or esophageal symptoms will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Patients undergoing surveillance for Barrett's esophagus with no dysplasia or&#xD;
      low-grade dysplasia are candidates for participation, but patients with known high-grade&#xD;
      dysplasia or adenocarcinoma or with a history of prior endoscopic resection or ablation for&#xD;
      these conditions are not candidates for participation. Informed consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      every patient prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized prior to starting the procedure. Each patient will receive a&#xD;
      randomization code at the time of randomization. It is important that the randomization code&#xD;
      be included in the Case Report Form submitted with each patient, and will represent the&#xD;
      unique deidentified code for each patient's data for inclusion in the study database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At endoscopy, all patients will be initially assessed for the presence of an endoscopic&#xD;
      suspicious lesion using white light and if appropriate narrow band imaging or similar&#xD;
      enhanced imaging techniques. All suspicious lesions undergo targeted biopsy first, and then&#xD;
      either 4-Quadrant Random Forceps Biopsy or WATS biopsies of the GEJ and if present the&#xD;
      columnar-lined esophagus based on the assigned randomization away from the area of targeted&#xD;
      biopsies. A biopsy will be obtained from the antrum in each patient to assess for H. pylori&#xD;
      infection and the presence of intestinal metaplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted forceps biopsies of any endoscopic suspicious area will be placed in a separate&#xD;
      pathology bottle from those obtained from 4-Quadrant Random Forceps Biopsy and analyzed&#xD;
      separately as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the components needed to perform WATS biopsies are included in a kit with complete&#xD;
      written instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WATS specimens will be analyzed by CDx Diagnostics. Investigator will ship the WATS specimens&#xD;
      to CDx Diagnostics in accordance with CDx's instructions. Forceps biopsies will be analyzed&#xD;
      by institution's pathology department and the pathology department of each additional site&#xD;
      participating in the Study per standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will determine appropriate follow-up of patients with and without IM or&#xD;
      dysplasia detected by WATS or FB per standard individual and / or institution protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator and all investigators at the additional sites will supply the study coordinator&#xD;
      with de-identified data for each specimen, such de-identified data including patient&#xD;
      demographics, endoscopic findings, and results of the FB of GEJ, antrum plus / minus&#xD;
      esophagus. Study Data will be maintained on a secure database by the study coordinator during&#xD;
      the Term and for six years thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies with intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia may be reviewed by a central pathologist to&#xD;
      confirm the original pathologic interpretation when there is a discrepancy between WATS and&#xD;
      FB that is greater than 10%.&#xD;

    <description>Intestinal metaplasia is a premalignant change in the normal epithelium lining the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. It is evaluated on tissue samples from these areas by a pathologist under a microscope, who then determines if intestinal metaplasia is present or not. All specimens retrieved by upper endoscopy, whether by standard biopsy or by WATS, will be examined by a pathologist. The pathology reports will be reviewed and the frequency that intestinal metaplasia is found by standard biopsy vs WATS will be statistically compared.</description>
