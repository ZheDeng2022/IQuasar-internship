      The investigators will conduct a two-period, two-intervention, cluster randomized crossover&#xD;
      (CRXO) designed study at Foothills Hospital in Calgary, Alberta. Each cluster (hospital ward)&#xD;
      will receive each of the two interventions in a separate approximately 6-month period of time&#xD;
      leading to two &quot;cluster-periods&quot; with associated &quot;wash-in&quot; and &quot;wash-out&quot; periods attached.&#xD;
      The two interventions are: 1) a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) using near-patient testing (NPT)&#xD;
      for C. difficile infections (CDI); 2) testing for CDI using centralized testing facilities&#xD;
      (standard operating procedure, 2 step algorithm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that NPT for CDI will result in reduced patient isolation days&#xD;
      in the hospital, decreased morbidity and mortality, reduced unnecessary antibiotic use and&#xD;
      overall reduced costs to the health care system, including both hospital and laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary endpoint is to examine the differential effect of NPT on the duration of contact&#xD;
      precautions (i.e. patient isolation days). Secondary outcomes will compare turn-around times&#xD;
      from specimen submission to result, days of hospitalization, the number of days of antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy, the incidence of CDI, severe CDI, and in-hospital mortality. A comprehensive&#xD;
      economic evaluation will be performed to determine the cost of testing, patient isolation,&#xD;
      and hospitalization for all patients in the control and treatment arms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been designated as a major priority by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Public Health&#xD;
      Agency of Canada (PHAC). PHAC has identified Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) as a Tier&#xD;
      1 AMR priority pathogen. CDI occurs directly as a consequence of antibiotic use and falls&#xD;
      under the clinical syndrome of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). It is the most common&#xD;
      cause of infectious diarrhea among hospitalized patients in developed countries like Canada&#xD;
      (Skidmore, 1993). The economic cost of CDI in the United States is estimated at USD 5.4&#xD;
      billion, close to 87% of which occurs in healthcare settings (Desai et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical microbiologists have developed a two-step algorithm in which an EIA or an RDT is&#xD;
      first used to screen stools for the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) antigen derived&#xD;
      from C. difficile. The GDH antigen test is very specific (&gt; 95%) and negatives can be&#xD;
      reported right away, only requiring GDH-positive or toxin-positive specimens (by EIA or RDT)&#xD;
      to be confirmed by NAAT. In Calgary, the two-step algorithm is performed for a population of&#xD;
      close to 1.5 million people at an offsite Diagnostic and Scientific Centre (DSC). The use of&#xD;
      a testing centre undermines some of the advantages of the rapid testing methodologies&#xD;
      developed in recent years, because of increased transportation and processing time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key issue in many settings is that testing falls into a separate budget from the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with CDI infections. This has the potential to distort the decision of whether to&#xD;
      run a test and, if so, what sort of test. The distortions are of two types. First, the&#xD;
      hospital may decide to order more tests than is optimal, since the tests are perceived as&#xD;
      &quot;free&quot; from the perspective of decision-makers. At the same time, the diagnostic facility may&#xD;
      choose low-cost, slow diagnostics, because the costs associated with delays in test results&#xD;
      are borne by the hospital. This is a classic case of silos in health care costs inefficiently&#xD;
      distorting policy decisions, with potentially negative results for both patient health and&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many institutions follow the clinical practice guidelines provided by the Infectious Diseases&#xD;
      Society of America for the management of C. difficile (Cohen et al., 2010). As part of&#xD;
      routine Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) management, patients with acute diarrhea of&#xD;
      unknown cause are pre-emptively placed in private rooms with additional contact precautions,&#xD;
      which mandate the use of gowns and gloves for healthcare workers. This is also known as&#xD;
      patient isolation. Investigation for gastrointestinal pathogens is typically initiated and&#xD;
      the duration of patient isolation depends largely on the result of microbiological testing.&#xD;
      When severe or complicated CDI is suspected, patients are initiated on empiric treatment as&#xD;
      soon as the diagnosis is suspected. Generally, oral metronidazole is used for&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate CDI and oral vancomycin for severe CDI. Among hospitalized patients with&#xD;
      acute diarrhea, initiation of pre-emptive management for CDI is common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention of interest is implementing a new RDT to Near Patient Testing (NPT); initial&#xD;
      screening for CDI to be performed at the on site hospital rapid response laboratory (RRL)&#xD;
      instead of the DSC. Techlab Inc. offers a lateral flow assay (C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETEÂ®&#xD;
      test) that detects both GDH and Toxin simultaneously and further simplifies the testing&#xD;
      algorithm. As prescribed in the two-step algorithm, GDH and Toxin negatives will be reported&#xD;
      out immediately as negative for CDI, while positive or discrepant results will be confirmed&#xD;
      at the DSC using NAAT. The vast majority of requests for CDI testing are negative thus&#xD;
      allowing a majority of results to be reported immediately without confirmation at the DSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will conduct a two-period, two-intervention, cluster randomized crossover&#xD;
      (CRXO) design study at Foothills Hospital. Each cluster (ward) will receive each of the two&#xD;
      interventions in a separate 6-month period of time leading to two &quot;cluster-periods&quot; with&#xD;
      associated &quot;wash-in&quot; and &quot;wash-out&quot; periods attached. The interventions are RDT using NPT for&#xD;
      CDI, and testing for CDI using our centralized testing facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is cross-sectional CRXO in that, each cluster-period consists of different&#xD;
      individuals (patients). The order in which the interventions are delivered to each cluster&#xD;
      (ward) is randomized to control for potential period effects. Within Foothills Hospital there&#xD;
      are 40 wards which will be observed over a 12-month period. Each ward is randomly assigned to&#xD;
      administer one of the two interventions for the first 6-month period (Period 1). In the&#xD;
      second 6-month period (Period 2), the ward will administer the other intervention. Within&#xD;
      each ward (cluster) there are two cluster-periods. Study outcomes during Period 1 and Period&#xD;
      2 intervention will be compared in both arms (NPT and centralized laboratory testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NPT testing can deliver results within several hours, while typically off-site testing takes&#xD;
      about one day. If NPT and the off-site testing deliver identical test results as our pilot&#xD;
      data suggest, the investigators can follow the clinical outcomes for each arm without the&#xD;
      confounder of differences in test performance. As a contingency, if variation in test&#xD;
      performance characteristics is found, analysis of patient outcomes will take this into&#xD;
      consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients without CDI, the antibiotics, and in many cases, the isolation, is unnecessary.&#xD;
      NPT testing has the potential to avoid this unnecessary use of antibiotics and to avoid&#xD;
      costly isolation procedures for the day+ that standard testing requires. It also enables a&#xD;
      better-directed diagnostic process for the cause of diarrhea. For patients who are positive&#xD;
      for CDI, the earlier test result will influence downstream events such as initiation of&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy, resolution of disease, hospitalization days, and other clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that NPT for CDI will result in reduced patient isolation days&#xD;
      in the hospital, decreased morbidity and mortality, reduced unnecessary antibiotic use and&#xD;
      overall reduced costs to the health care system, including both hospital and laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous data at this facility has indicated that the mean number of patients per ward is&#xD;
      39/month (SD=43) for a total of 1578 patients in a 6-month period and the mean number of&#xD;
      negative patients is 33/month (SD=34) for a total of 1300 negative pts in a 6-month period.&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria will be diarrhea in adult patients admitted to Foothills Medical&#xD;
      Center in Calgary, Alberta being tested for CDI. Outpatients and patients in the emergency&#xD;
      room will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary endpoint is to examine the differential effect of NPT on the duration of contact&#xD;
      precautions (i.e. patient isolation days). Secondary outcomes will compare turn-around times&#xD;
      from specimen submission to result, days of hospitalization, the number of days of antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy, the incidence of CDI, severe CDI, and in-hospital mortality. A comprehensive&#xD;
      economic evaluation will be performed to determine the cost of testing, patient isolation,&#xD;
      and hospitalization for all patients in the control and treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact precautions (i.e. patient isolation) due to CDI will be defined as an order by&#xD;
      healthcare workers for contact precautions within the 7-day infection window of a CDI&#xD;
      diagnosis. The length of time on contact precautions will be defined as the calendar date&#xD;
      contact precautions are completed or patient discharge date minus the calendar date contact&#xD;
      precautions are ordered. Data on contact precautions will be extracted from the clinical&#xD;
      patient management system in Calgary, known as Sunrise Clinical Manager (SCM). It is used&#xD;
      extensively in all Calgary acute care facilities and emergency departments. These data&#xD;
      include patient identifiers (e.g. patient health number, names, date of birth), start and&#xD;
      stop dates of isolation, facility, and patient care unit where isolation order was placed,&#xD;
      and the reason for isolation (e.g. CDI, diarrhea). These data will be linked to the specimen&#xD;
      results tested for CDI by the patient's Personal Health Number (PHN). Turn-around times from&#xD;
      specimen submission to result will be provided by Calgary Laboratory Services. Days of&#xD;
      hospitalization will be defined as the difference between the admission and discharge date.&#xD;
      The specimen results will be linked to the Discharge Abstract Database using the patient's&#xD;
      PHN to determine during which acute care encounter the specimen was collected and the&#xD;
      admission/discharge dates of that encounter. Antibiotic therapy will be defined as the&#xD;
      administration of antibiotics initiated on the day of and up to 48 hours after specimen&#xD;
      collection for CDI testing. Total days of antibiotic therapy during the acute care encounter&#xD;
      will be defined as the calendar date antibiotic therapy is completed minus the calendar date&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy is ordered. The data will be extracted from SCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also account for the severity of CDI. The epidemiological definition&#xD;
      for severe CDI is that primarily proposed by Cohen et al. This definition has been used by&#xD;
      infectious disease specialists in Alberta to guide the management and treatment of patients&#xD;
      with CDI. Patients with severe CDI will have leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count&#xD;
      &gt;15,000 cells/ÂµL OR an elevated serum creatinine (i.e. 200 Âµmol/L or greater). The inpatient&#xD;
      laboratory results that will be considered to meet the definition for severe CDI will be&#xD;
      those collected within a 7-day infection window around the date the laboratory tested&#xD;
      positive for C. difficile. The presence of either measure meeting the criteria within the&#xD;
      defined infection window will qualify as meeting the definition of severe CDI. If either&#xD;
      criterion is measured more than once during the infection window, the highest value will be&#xD;
      used to represent the severity of CDI. The laboratory values will be provided by Calgary&#xD;
      Laboratory Services and linked to the positive C. difficile test results. In-hospital,&#xD;
      all-cause mortality will be defined as death occurring during the acute care encounter where&#xD;
      specimens were collected for C. difficile testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict that, given the large number of patients and randomized study&#xD;
      design, matching of patients by age, gender, and co-morbidities is not required. Potential&#xD;
      hurdles in the study model are logistical challenges associated with building a testing and&#xD;
      reporting system for a hospital on 24hrs/7 days per week basis. The strength of the proposal&#xD;
      lies in the scale and nature of the study which seeks to establish the medical and economic&#xD;
      benefit of NPT versus centralized testing. The results could dramatically influence public&#xD;
      health policy in this country and seek to bridge traditional silos, namely the laboratory and&#xD;
      hospital budgets. Data on costs will be furnished by our partners at Calgary Laboratory&#xD;
      Services/Alberta Health Services (Infection Prevention and Control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond evaluating the relative merits of NPT versus centralized testing, studies will also&#xD;
      look at the microbiology of CDI in this study. Specifically, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      several laboratory methods to examine antibiotic resistance and genetic variation in CDI. For&#xD;
      example, whole genome sequencing of cultured CDI isolates may inform us about the&#xD;
      transmission of specific strains in our setting. Indeed, certain strains and states of gut&#xD;
      dysbiosis may result in increased morbidity and mortality (Shahinas et al., 2012). The&#xD;
      investigators will look at the microbiome of patients in this study to determine if dysbiosis&#xD;
      contributes to adverse clinical outcomes. The investigators will also correlate the strain&#xD;
      types with the results of testing to determine if genetic variation affects test performance.&#xD;
      Cultured toxin-producing CDI isolates will serve as a gold standard to evaluate test&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
