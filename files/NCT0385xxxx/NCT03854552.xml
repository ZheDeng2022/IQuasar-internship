    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to investigate safety and tolerability of BI 764198 in&#xD;
      healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the exploration of pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose&#xD;
      proportionality of BI 764198 after single oral dosing.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male subjects who meet any of the following criteria from administration of trial&#xD;

                  contraception (condom)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects who are not vasectomised or sexually abstinent have to ensure that an&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Intake of an investigational drug in another clinical trial within 60 days of planned&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,&#xD;
