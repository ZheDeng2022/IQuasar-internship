    <textblock>
      Screening of a population of volunteer workers recruited on the occasion of their&#xD;
      occupational health visit, within the Ministry of Defense and civil enterprises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The voluntary subjects included will, after signing a consent, take a saliva sample (Kit&#xD;
      Oragen DNA OG500) and fill out a computerized questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A posteriori, the genotyping polymorphisms may be associated with variations in the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of caffeine will be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine whether polymorphisms (alone or in combination) of&#xD;
      genes associated with the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of caffeine are independent&#xD;
      risk factors for sleep disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine the frequency of these polymorphisms and to&#xD;
      evaluate the consequences of these associations on sleep habits (sleep time, chronotype,&#xD;
      quality of sleep), daytime sleepiness, caffeine consumption, antecedents of accidents at work&#xD;
      or traffic, drug consumption ...&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coffee is one of the most consumed drinks in the world and its consumption has doubled in 20&#xD;
      years. Because of the health benefits of caffeine (present in many foods and medicines), but&#xD;
      also adverse effects, its physiological actions deserve to be better known and its use better&#xD;
      framed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, caffeine is the most used psychoactive substance to prevent the deterioration of the&#xD;
      cognitive performance of night workers and soldiers in operation. Its &quot;strategic&quot; use is even&#xD;
      recommended in many armies. In its sustained-release dosage form (Caffeine 300 mg), it is the&#xD;
      only drug, increasing alertness, authorized in the French military. Caffeine also has&#xD;
      beneficial effects on inflammatory response, muscle activity, insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk, weight gain, neuroprotection, chronic pain. Usual consumption of 2 to 3&#xD;
      coffees a day is recommended by the American Nutrition Society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, coffee consumption is associated with many side effects such as anxiety, sleep&#xD;
      disorders, increased blood pressure, cardiovascular and obstetric conditions or depression.&#xD;
      Many authors therefore recommend limiting its use. In particular, it is considered a risk&#xD;
      factor for sleep disorders such as insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiological effects and sensitivity to side effects of caffeine are characterized by&#xD;
      very high individual variability3 related to age, sex, habitual coffee consumption, smoking,&#xD;
      but also to genetic polymorphisms. Indeed, multiple polymorphisms are associated with changes&#xD;
      in pharmacokinetics (see Table 1) or pharmacodynamics (efficacy, see Table 2) of caffeine.&#xD;
      Sensitivity to caffeine is associated in particular with greater vulnerability to sleep&#xD;
      deprivation, sleep disorders and stress.n particular, polymorphisms of the adenosine receptor&#xD;
      (ADORA) gene, a therapeutic target for caffeine, are particularly involved in the individual&#xD;
      variability of caffeine sensitivity, side effects and consumption habits. But many other&#xD;
      polymorphisms of genes encoding enzymes involved in metabolism or physiological effects are&#xD;
      also associated with the individual variability of caffeine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, some gene polymorphisms such as the adenosine deaminase gene (ADA) which&#xD;
      degrades caffeine and regulates intra- and extracellular concentrations, are associated with&#xD;
      greater vulnerability to sleep deprivation, without the effects on caffeine sensitivity are&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, it is difficult to assess the impact of these polymorphisms on the beneficial&#xD;
      effects and / or risks associated with caffeine consumption due to their number and&#xD;
      lifestyle, including coffee consumption. In other words, are sleep disorders favored by&#xD;
      polymorphism and / or habitual consumption of caffeine? Are there profiles of high&#xD;
      vulnerability to sleep deprivation and sensitivity to caffeine? Do these polymorphisms have a&#xD;
      link with burnout, work stress, diseases?&#xD;
