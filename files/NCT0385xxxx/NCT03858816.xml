      The management protocols, clinical practices, equipment, infrastructure, and key personnel in&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the years, preterm very low birth weight (PVLBW) infants (&lt;32 weeks gestation) have&#xD;
      better survival rates and improved outcomes. Nonetheless, It is of concern that there are&#xD;
      increased risk of psychiatric problems reported in PVLBW infants, 11.5% to 31% of them are&#xD;
      reported to be at increased risk of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and&#xD;
      25 % of them would develop autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many VLBWs experience rapid vaginal or Caesarean births that increased relative risk of&#xD;
      developing ASD and possibly ADHD when compared to vaginal delivery. Further, PVLBW infants&#xD;
      often experience delays in enteral feeding, and many receive little or no mother's own milk,&#xD;
      use of antibiotics, invasive procedures and maternal separation can contribute to dysbiosis&#xD;
      and dysbiosis in early life may prone to develop ASD and ADHD There is growing body of&#xD;
      evidence demonstrates that gut microbiota is involved in communication, and may impact brain&#xD;
      development and modulate behavior. Evidences have showed that there were increased intestinal&#xD;
      permeability, altered gut microbiota and activity in autism and ADHD. Studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that early postnatal phase of microbial development is a primer for future&#xD;
      health. Giving all the evidence, it is reasonable to speculate that probiotics could reduce&#xD;
      the ASD and ADHD in preterm VLBW infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Aug 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020, a prospective, double blind, randomized, controlled trial&#xD;
      will be conducted in five NICUs at Taiwan. The study protocol will be approved by the&#xD;
      institutional review board of each hospital. Preterm infants ≧ 23 weeks and ≦ 32 weeks&#xD;
      gestational age and birth weight below 1500 gm and who survive to NICU are eligible for the&#xD;
      trial. They will be assigned randomly to either group A: multiple strian probiotics or group&#xD;
      B: control group received 1 mL of a 5% glucose solution. Study is continuous until preterm&#xD;
      infants grow up to 4 months postnatal age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management protocols, clinical practices, equipment, infrastructure, and key personnel in&#xD;
      NICU are unchanged during the study period. The data collected by each center are transmitted&#xD;
      to the office of the principal investigator (Dr Lin) at China Medical University Hospital.&#xD;
      Primary outcome is death or attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality is defined as death prior to discharge. Secondary outcomes are NEC ≧ stage 2,&#xD;
      sepsis, severe (grade 3-4) IVH, BPD, alteration of liver function, and adverse effects or&#xD;
      intolerance and neurodevelopment impairment. Objection of the first two years is to enroll&#xD;
      cases, ASD and ADHD will be assessed by two independent neurologists at third year of life;&#xD;
      no examiner is aware of treatment assigned to any infant.&#xD;
