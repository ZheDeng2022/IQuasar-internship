  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterized by the presence in the polysomnogram test of&#xD;
      more than five apnoea-hypopnoea episodes per hour of sleep (apnoea-hypopnoea index, AHI &gt; 5),&#xD;
      each episode lasting more than 10 seconds and being accompanied by oxygen desaturation or&#xD;
      arousal. The prevalence of this syndrome is worryingly high (9% to 38%), affecting more men&#xD;
      than women. OSA has an important negative impact on physical/psychological health and on&#xD;
      these patient's quality of life. The gold-standard treatment for OSA is the continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, CPAP compliance is really low, this device&#xD;
      requiring a continuous chronic use in order to improve OSA and to avoid the relapse.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it does not address OSA risk factors such as obesity and unhealthy lifestyle&#xD;
      habits. Consequently, non-surgical and non-pharmacological interventions such as weight loss&#xD;
      and lifestyle interventions are necessary and recommended by the American Academy of Sleep&#xD;
      Medicine (AASM). The objective of this project, therefore, is the development and evaluation&#xD;
      of a cognitive-behavioural treatment program for patients with moderate-severe OSA. The&#xD;
      treatment will pursued weight loss through hypocaloric diet and moderate exercise, smoking&#xD;
      and alcohol avoidance, and sleep hygiene. The efficacy of this treatment will be assessed in&#xD;
      comparison with CPAP, in a short and medium term. This intervention could be considered a&#xD;
      good alternative/combined management to the usual treatment of OSA (CPAP) once its efficacy&#xD;
      to reduce and even cure OSA symptoms is demonstrated, especially if it is still effective in&#xD;
      the long-term.&#xD;

    <description>Change in the difficulty in maintaining a desired level of wakefulness, measured by the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) from baseline to post-intervention. ESS is a 4-point scale (0 = no chance of dozing, 1 = slight chance of dozing, 2 = moderate chance of dozing, 3 = high chance of dozing) that measures the usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. An ESS total score from 0 to 9 is considered to be normal while an ESS total score &gt; 9 indicates high daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <description>Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) from baseline to post-intervention. This scale includes a total of 19 self-rated items combined to form seven component scores i.e., subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction), each of which has a range of 0-3 points. The sum of these seven PSQI component scores is considered to obtain a global PSQI score (ranging from 0-21), with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality.</description>
