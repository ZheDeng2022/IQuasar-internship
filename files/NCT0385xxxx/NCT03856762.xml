  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind, randomized trial. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 253&#xD;
      eligible volunteers, who were 25-60 years old, with overweight/obese and prediabetes are&#xD;
      assigned to one of three dietary patterns: healthy Jiangnan, restricted-calorie;&#xD;
      Mediterranean, restricted-calorie; or typical Shanghai, restricted-calorie.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS)&#xD;
      cooperated with Ruijin Hospital to conduct the study which is funded by the CAS. The study'&#xD;
      protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Institutes for Biological&#xD;
      Sciences. The main purpose of this study is to clarify: the efficacy of traditional Jiangnan&#xD;
      dietary pattern, Mediterranean dietary pattern and the current Shanghai dietary pattern in&#xD;
      improving overweight/obesity, glucose homeostasis, other cardiovascular metabolic risk&#xD;
      factors and their main regulatory factors in Chinese.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and its related metabolic diseases is rapidly&#xD;
      rising in China. Obesity and early pathoglycemia will increase the risk of diabetes and&#xD;
      related cardiovascular diseases severely. Therefore, more effective methods and strategies&#xD;
      need to be found to reduce body weight, improve pathoglycemia, and control the development of&#xD;
      this high-risk group to type 2 diabetes. As the most popular healthy dietary pattern in the&#xD;
      world, the role of Mediterranean diet in the prevention of type 2 diabetes remains unclear.&#xD;
      In addition, the protective role of Chinese traditional dietary pattern with lots of&#xD;
      plant-based foods in the region of Jiangnan has not been clarified through intervention&#xD;
      studies. Therefore, it is urgent to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of traditional&#xD;
      Jiangnan diet and Mediterranean diet through dietary intervention studies in Chinese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of healthy dietary patterns can be further enhanced by limiting dietary&#xD;
      intake to achieve weight loss. Recently, the Spainish study found that energy-restricted&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet + physical activity + behavioral interventions are more conducive to&#xD;
      weight loss in overweight/obesity with prediabetes/type 2 diabetes compared with conventional&#xD;
      Mediterranean dietary interventions. The 2019 Diabetes Management Standard of American&#xD;
      Diabetes Association re-emphasizes the importance of moderate weight loss for delaying the&#xD;
      progression of type 2 diabetes, and recommends that a reduction in dietary intake is 500-750&#xD;
      kcal/day to reach 1-2 pounds per week is suitable. At the same time, the American Clinical&#xD;
      Endocrine Society and the American Endocrine Society have also updated the 2019 Comprehensive&#xD;
      Management Guide for Type 2 Diabetes. The new guidelines point out that all overweight or&#xD;
      obese patients with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes should pay attention to weight loss. And&#xD;
      weight loss treatment should include specific lifestyle interventions, including&#xD;
      calorie-restricted healthy dietary plan, physical activity and behavioral interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intervention studies in the past mainly relied on dietary education. However, this&#xD;
      study now provides a healthy and reasonable dietary model for the Chinese population through&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention to clarify the improvement of cardiovascular metabolic risk such as&#xD;
      overweight/obesity, glucose homeostasis, and the scientific basis for establishing a healthy&#xD;
      dietary model which is suitable for Chinese population.&#xD;
