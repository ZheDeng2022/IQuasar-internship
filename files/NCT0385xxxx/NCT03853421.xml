  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential cohort, single escalating&#xD;
      dose study to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      sevuparin in healthy volunteer adult male and female subjects. The study will consist of&#xD;
      three subcutaneous dose cohorts (3, 6 and 9 mg/kg sevuparin). Each dosing cohort will consist&#xD;
      of 8 subjects who will be randomized to receive either a single dose of sevuparin or matching&#xD;
      placebo in a 3:1 ratio (6 active/2 placebo).&#xD;
