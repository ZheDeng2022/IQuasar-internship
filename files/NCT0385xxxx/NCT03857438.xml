    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to show the physiological changes during manic episode in bipolar&#xD;
      mania how much they differentiate from remission and healthy control. Relation of&#xD;
      audio-visual features as physiological changes and cognitive functions and clinical variables&#xD;
      will be searched. The aim is to find biologic markers for predictors of treatment response&#xD;
      via machine learning techniques to be able to reduce treatment resistance and give an idea&#xD;
      for personalized treatment of bipolar patients.&#xD;

      The objective of this research protocol is to find audio-visual features which differentiates&#xD;
      bipolar mani/ remission/ health/ simulation and predicts treatment response earlier and&#xD;
      detect neurocognitive changes during mania/ remission and difference from the healthy&#xD;
      control. During hospitalization in every follow up day (0th- 3rd- 7th- 14th- 28th day) and&#xD;
      after discharge on the 3rd month, presence of depressive and manic features for patients was&#xD;
      evaluated using Young Mania Rating Scale(YMRS) and Montgamery- Asberg Depresyon Scale&#xD;
      (MADRS). Audiovisual recording is done by a video camera in every follow up day for patients&#xD;
      and for healthy controls which includes also depression and mania simulation. Cambridge&#xD;
      Neurophysiological Assessment Battery (CANTAB) were administered to both groups( for patients&#xD;
      both in the manic phase and in the remission) to assess neurocognitive functions.&#xD;
