  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to either receive virtual reality headsets in the post anesthesia&#xD;
      recovery unit (PACU) as an adjunct therapy or undergo routine postoperative management. Pain&#xD;
      scores will be recorded at standardized intervals in the PACU. The patient will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a survey at their two week post op visit assessing their satisfaction with their&#xD;
      post op recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a virtual reality relaxation program used&#xD;
      in the immediate postoperative period after laparoscopic hysterectomy will decrease pain&#xD;
      scores and reduce both oral and intravenous opioid consumption.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the CDC, 115 Americans die every day due to opioid overdose. Prescription opioid&#xD;
      related overdose deaths accounted for 40% of all opioid deaths in the US in 2016. In surgery,&#xD;
      opioids are an effective tool in reducing pain in the postoperative state. However, this may&#xD;
      lead to dependence if pain control is poorly managed. A study examining analgesic use after&#xD;
      low risk surgery found that patients requiring a second prescription for opioids within 7&#xD;
      days of their surgery were 44% more likely to become long-term opioid users one year after&#xD;
      their surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n order to combat this issue, the concept of multi-modal analgesia has been promoted to&#xD;
      reduce the use of opioids for postoperative pain. This modality includes medications (e.g.&#xD;
      NSAIDS), regional anesthesia, and adjunct therapies such as meditation and acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology in which a person is immersed in an&#xD;
      environment through visual and audio cues that effect the senses. These effects can lead to&#xD;
      all types of reactions based on the content and as such, virtual reality is used as a&#xD;
      platform for, amongst other things, entertainment, education and patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In health care, virtual reality has been used to desensitize patients with various phobias,&#xD;
      provide surgical training and as an effective tool for pain control. At this time, there are&#xD;
      no studies demonstrating the use of virtual reality for pain control after gynecologic&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study to asses if VR can be used for postoperative pain control and&#xD;
      whether a VR relaxation program used in the immediate post operative period after&#xD;
      laparoscopic hysterectomy will decrease pain scores and reduce both oral and intravenous&#xD;
      opioid consumption. If this study is feasible the investigators would then be able to perform&#xD;
      a larger study, which could show if VR does or does not reduce postoperative pain. Possible&#xD;
      benefits from this study include improved pain control requiring less narcotic medications&#xD;
      during the time spent in the PACU after laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign indication. It&#xD;
      could also provide improvement of anxiety associated with the postoperative period. This&#xD;
      intervention could be a benefit for all women who desire to use non-pharmacologic measures&#xD;
      for pain control during the immediate postoperative period. Alternatively, the patient can&#xD;
      proceed without the intervention if desired. There are many other pain control methods that&#xD;
      the patient can still use during the study. Nothing will be withheld from the patient due to&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place in the outpatient clinic and the preoperative area of the Main&#xD;
      Operating Room or Same Day Surgery Once a potential study patient has been identified, a&#xD;
      written informed consent form will be provided by a member of the research team to the&#xD;
      patient. The member of the team will review the consent form with the patient and she will&#xD;
      have the opportunity then to chose to voluntarily participate or decline with the&#xD;
      understanding, should she decline, this will in no way affect her care. After all her&#xD;
      questions have been answered and she elects to participate in the study, she will sign the&#xD;
      consent and a signed copy of the consent will be provided to her for her records. This will&#xD;
      be at not cost to the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks include exacerbation of claustrophobia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting due to how the VR&#xD;
      works. There are very few risks associated with the intervention. There is a 0.025% risk of&#xD;
      seizures, particularly in patients with a known seizure disorder. Theoretically patients with&#xD;
      claustrophobia could have exacerbated symptoms, however, these symptoms have not been seen&#xD;
      and recorded. Patients with these risk factors will be excluded from the study. There is&#xD;
      another theoretical risk of increased nausea, although this has not been shown to occur in&#xD;
      previous studies site them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our exclusion criteria helps to reduce the possibility of adverse effects from experiencing&#xD;
      VR. Once consent forms are signed, they will be kept in a locked drawer of the fellow&#xD;
      involved. All data will be collected via RED cap, which is a secure website. When the patient&#xD;
      is randomized, they will be given a subject number. This will be used to de-identify the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events/reactions will be reported to the UA IRB. In the case of injury or illness&#xD;
      resulting from this study, emergency medical treatment is available from Banner University&#xD;
      Medical Center Phoenix but will be provided at the usual charge. No funds have been set aside&#xD;
      to compensate the participant in the event of injury. Their insurance company will be charged&#xD;
      for continuing medical care and/or hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assure their study-related costs are paid for, all study-related procedures/tests must be&#xD;
      conducted at a Banner Health facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      he data collection sheets will be stored in the fellows office (Room 3113, 1441 N 12th St.&#xD;
      Phoenix, AZ 85006). Information from these forms, and demographic data collected from the&#xD;
      patient's chart will be stored in REDcap and only be accessible by members of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects can decide to be removed from the study at any time from when they first consent to&#xD;
      the study to when they fill out the survey at the two week postoperative visit. Their&#xD;
      withdrawal will be noted in RED cap. The paper forms used to collect data will be destroyed&#xD;
      and their virtual data collection sheets will be deleted from REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consents will be done in either private exam rooms within the Women's Institute clinic in&#xD;
      the 1441 Building of Banner University Medical Center or the private preoperative bay on the&#xD;
      day of surgery. Only those involved in consenting and data collection will be allowed to&#xD;
      access the consent forms and place data in REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient would be committed to the study during the postoperative recovery period in the&#xD;
      PACU, which is approximately 4 hours. They will also be asked to complete a brief survey at&#xD;
      the time of their 2 week postoperative visit. If not, they will be mailed the survey to&#xD;
      complete and return.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will have no changes to routine PACU protocol. They will be asked to rate&#xD;
      their pain at defined intervals that can later be compared to the pain scores of the&#xD;
      intervention group. Morphine equivalents during PACU stay will be calculated for the control&#xD;
      group. The intervention group will also be offered the routine PACU protocol. The only change&#xD;
      being the addition of offering the VR intervention which includes the Samsung VR Innovator&#xD;
      edition goggle set, fitted with Samsung Galaxy Note 4 mobile phone. The module options are&#xD;
      provided from Applied VR and include Guided relaxation (30 minutes), a tour of Iceland (3&#xD;
      minutes), Dream Beach (30 minutes), Dolphin Swim (15 minutes), Farm Sanctuary (5 minutes),&#xD;
      Seal Hospital (10 minutes), and Wild West (5 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to each new subject use, fabric surfaces of the Samsung Gear set will be cleaned with&#xD;
      VIrex, Sani-Wipes will be used to clean the plastic housing, and the glass lenses will be&#xD;
      cleaned with an alcohol-based lens cleaner. Each headset will be fitted with a sanitary&#xD;
      disposable fabric cover on the VR goggles for new users. Each subject will also wear fitted&#xD;
      head caps that minimize direct contact with the devices. At time of recruitment, patients&#xD;
      will be given the opportunity to try on the VR goggles and watch the four chosen VR modules&#xD;
      that will be offered during their PACU recovery period. At that time, subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed on how to apply the head gear. Subjects will apply and remove the headgear&#xD;
      themselves, while their trained PACU nurses will be able to assist them in adjusting head&#xD;
      straps once the VR goggles have been placed. Subjects will be able to discontinue use of the&#xD;
      VR goggles at any time they wish, including before the conclusion of their chosen VR module.&#xD;
      There is no minimum or maximum amount of time patients will be allotted to participate in VR&#xD;
      modules during their PACU stay. The total amount of time using the VR system and number of&#xD;
      separate uses will be recorded. After each patient completes the study, the disposable head&#xD;
      cap, fabric covers and foam backing from the devices will be discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is routine for patients to follow up two weeks after their surgery for a postoperative&#xD;
      visit. At that time, they will be asked to complete a survey addressing their satisfaction&#xD;
      with the postoperative recovery process in the PACU. If they are not seen in 2 weeks, the&#xD;
      survey will be mailed, or the subjects will be contacted via phone to complete the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients will be recruited for this pilot study. A Master Log will be created that&#xD;
      includes patient ID number, patient name, MRN, and date of surgery. The data collection form&#xD;
      will be created that includes patient ID number, age, height, weight, BMI, VR Y/N,&#xD;
      preoperative diagnosis, past medical history, ASA classification, initial pain score, final&#xD;
      pain score, total morphine equivalents used during post-anesthesia recovery unit (PACU) stay,&#xD;
      length of time from admission to discharge from PACU, number of uses of VR, total VR use&#xD;
      time, and other medications given also include if/when local analgesic was used, what type&#xD;
      and where. RedCap is an online data tool that will be used as to collect and store data. At&#xD;
      the end of the study, the Master Log, which will be the only document containing patient&#xD;
      identifiers will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of the study will be performed half way through the process (when 15 subjects have&#xD;
      participated) to assess the safety of the study. The investigators will assess how many, if&#xD;
      any, of the participants in the study had adverse effects to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that this study will take 6 months to complete, and therefore around the 3&#xD;
      month mark or at 15 subjects (whichever comes first) will be the point at which a preliminary&#xD;
      safety study will be done by the research team.&#xD;
