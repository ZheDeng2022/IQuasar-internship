  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intellectual disability (ID) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition that&#xD;
      often results in a diagnostic odyssey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deployment of high throughput sequencing (HTS) and in particular exome sequencing (WES)&#xD;
      has made it possible to identify many genes responsible for ID. However, the WES does not&#xD;
      identify the cause of ID in about two-thirds of patients, due to, for example, the uneven&#xD;
      depth and coverage of all exons, or the location of variants in non-exonic areas. It has thus&#xD;
      been shown that genome sequencing (WGS), which is still rarely used because it is more&#xD;
      complex and costly, would be more efficient, with an expected diagnostic rate of around 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to the massive contribution of HTS in the diagnosis of patients suffering from&#xD;
      rare diseases, France has launched the France Plan Médecine Genomique 2025 (PFMG2025) to&#xD;
      deploy HTS platforms, which will be able to carry out WGS, WES and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),&#xD;
      and pilot studies to define the modalities for prescribing these examinations. Two&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness evaluations of these technologies, in comparison with the current strategy&#xD;
      for diagnosis of ID, are currently underway or planned in the short term in France: 1) PRME&#xD;
      DISSEQ, comparing the large DI459 panel versus WES, 2) the DEFIDIAG pilot study of the&#xD;
      PFMG2025 comparing WGS, in trio versus solo, versus current strategy. However, there are no&#xD;
      studies examining the place of the RNA-seq in the ID diagnostic decision tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, some pathogenic variations are likely to have an effect on transcription. WES/WGS&#xD;
      can detect them but are not able to affirm their pathogenicity because it focuses on genomic&#xD;
      DNA. Only the RNA-seq makes it possible to study the transcription of candidate genes on a&#xD;
      large scale, providing an additional level of evidence on both known genes in human pathology&#xD;
      (OMIM) and candidate genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RNA-seq would increase the diagnostic rate from 10% to 35% in addition to the WGS in&#xD;
      negative patients with first-line approaches (including WES) and thus optimize management by&#xD;
      reducing diagnostic delays as part of a personalized care pathway.&#xD;
