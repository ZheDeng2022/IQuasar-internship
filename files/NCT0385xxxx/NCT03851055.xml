  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta-thalassemia represents a group of recessive inherited hemoglobin disorders characterized&#xD;
      by reduced synthesis of β-globin chain. The homozygous state (β-thalassemia major) &quot;TM&quot;&#xD;
      results in severe anemia, which needs regular blood transfusion . The life expectancy in&#xD;
      patients with TM has increased due to therapeutically management, such as frequent&#xD;
      transfusion, desferal administration and bone marrow transplantation. Diabetes is clinically&#xD;
      characterized by hyperglycemia due to either low circulating concentrations of, or decreased&#xD;
      sensitivity to, insulin. Patients with TM typically exhibit β-cell or insulin insufficiency,&#xD;
      and may develop diabetes due to toxic levels of iron in their pancreas, one of the strongest&#xD;
      predictors of β-cell destruction. By contrast, hyperinsulinemia, secondary to insulin&#xD;
      resistance, with normal glucose tolerance has also been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenic mechanisms leading from siderosis to diabetes are poorly understood.&#xD;

      Zinc(Zn) is a critical trace element in human health. Zinc has a potential to be utilized for&#xD;
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes; however, evidence suggests that the effect of Zn on type 2&#xD;
      diabetes remains unclear. Up to 85% of the whole body Zn content is found in muscle and&#xD;
      bones, with 11% in the skin and liver .Zn is an indispensable co-factor for more than 300&#xD;
      enzymes involved in metabolism and also reportedly plays a role in aging, immune system,&#xD;
      apoptosis, and oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the effect of zinc supplementation in the improvement of oxidative stress is&#xD;
      controversial, one of the causes that the oxidative stress is present in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes is the change in zinc metabolism. Recent studies have demonstrated that the&#xD;
      islet-restricted zinc transporter, ZnT8 (SLC30A8), regulates insulin secretion and hepatic&#xD;
      insulin clearance, suggesting that Zn is a key biological factor in glucose homeostasis and&#xD;
      the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients without thalassemia, there is a rich body of literature focused on the&#xD;
      &quot;diabetogenic effects&quot; of altered zinc status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc supplementation has even been suggested as an adjunct therapy in the management of&#xD;
      non-thalassemia related diabetes .Functional zinc deficiency exists in a contemporary sample&#xD;
      of healthy β-thalassemic patients. An estimated 20% to 30% of patients with β-thalassemia are&#xD;
      zinc deficient. The high prevalence is thought to be related to a combination of increased&#xD;
      urinary losses compounded by elevated requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose homeostasis and its relation to Zinc status has not been widely studied especially in&#xD;
      Egyptian children and adolescents with β-thalassemia major.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess zinc status in patients with β-thalassemia major and diabetes mellitus and its&#xD;
           relation to clinical and laboratory parameters of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effect of zinc supplementation on glucose homeostasis in patients with β-thalassemia&#xD;
           major and diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
