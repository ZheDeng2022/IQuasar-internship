  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) is the gold standard treatment for&#xD;
      patients with acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) who develop respiratory acidosis, failure&#xD;
      rate are still high ranging from 5% to 40%. Recent studies have shown that the onset of&#xD;
      severe diaphragmatic dysfunction (DD) during AECOPD increases risk of NIV failure and&#xD;
      mortality in this subset of patients. Although the imbalance between the load and the&#xD;
      contractile capacity of inspiratory muscles seems the main cause of AECOPD-induced&#xD;
      hypercapnic respiratory failure, data regarding the influence of mechanical derangement on&#xD;
      diaphragmatic performance in this acute phase are lacking. With this study we aim at&#xD;
      investigating the impact of respiratory mechanics on diaphragm function in AECOPD patients&#xD;
      who experienced NIV failure. AECOPD with respiratory acidosis admitted to the ICU of the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Modena from 2017-2018 undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV) due to&#xD;
      NIV failure were enrolled. The study protocol consisted of two consecutive phases; in the&#xD;
      first step measurements of static respiratory mechanics and end expiratory lung volume (EELV)&#xD;
      were performed after 30 minutes of MV in volume control mode. In the second step&#xD;
      transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) was calculated by means of a sniff maneuver (Maximal Pdi)&#xD;
      after 30 minutes of spontaneous breathing trial. Linear regression analysis and Pearson's&#xD;
      correlation coefficient was used to asses the association between Maximal Pdi values and&#xD;
      static and dynamic mechanical features and the association between Maximal Pdi and&#xD;
      Pdi/Maximal Pdi.&#xD;
