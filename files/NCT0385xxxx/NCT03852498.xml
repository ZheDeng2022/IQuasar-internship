    <textblock>
      Study ALD-104 is an international, non-randomized, open-label, multi-site study in male&#xD;
      participants (&lt;or=17 years of age at enrollment) with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD).&#xD;
      Approximately 35 participants will be infused with Lenti-D Drug Product after myeloablative&#xD;
      conditioning with busulfan and fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous cluster of differentiation 34&#xD;
      (CD34+) hematopoietic stem cells, transduced ex-vivo with Lenti-D lentiviral vector, for the&#xD;
      treatment of CALD. A subject's blood stem cells will be collected and modified (transduced)&#xD;
      using the Lenti-D lentiviral vector encoding human adrenoleukodystrophy protein. After&#xD;
      modification (transduction) with the Lenti-D lentiviral vector, the cells will be&#xD;
      transplanted back into the subject following myeloablative conditioning.&#xD;

    <description>The NFS is a 25-point score used to evaluate the severity of gross neurologic dysfunction in CALD by scoring 15 symptoms (functional domains) across 6 categories. Listed here are the 15 symptoms followed by their maximal score out of 25 points: a) Hearing / auditory processing problems-1, b) Aphasia / apraxia-1, c) Loss of communication-3, d) Vision impairment /field cut-1, e) Cortical blindness-2, f) Swallowing / other CNS dysfunctions-2, g) Tube feeding-2, h) Running difficulties / hyperreflexia-1, i) Walking difficulties / spasticity / spastic gait (no assistance)-1, j) Spastic gait (needs assistance)-2, k) Wheelchair dependence-2, l) Complete loss of voluntary movement-3, m) Episodes of incontinence -1, n) Total incontinence-2, o) Nonfebrile seizures-1. A score of &quot;0&quot; denotes absence of clinical signs of cerebral disease. Maximal signs within a domain score the total of all grades within that domain.</description>
