  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of a diet based on ITF-rich vegetables in&#xD;
      combination with purified ITF supplementation on weight management, metabolic alteration and&#xD;
      gut microbiota composition. Obese patients were treated for 3 months and several parameters&#xD;
      were measured before and after the study period.&#xD;

    <description>IPAQ questionnaire (The IPAQ long form asks details about the specific types of activities undertaken within the four main domains (leisure time PA, domestic and gardening (yard) activities, work-related PA and transport-related PA).

Results allowed us to classify different levels of PA proposed by the questionnaire (total, low-moderate or high-intensity physical activities)</description>
