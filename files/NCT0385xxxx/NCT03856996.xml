      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      CH505TF gp120 produced from stably transfected cells to CH505TF gp120 produced from&#xD;
      transiently transfected cells in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adult participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of two experimental HIV&#xD;
      vaccines in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adult participants. The study vaccines are called&#xD;
      Stable CH505TF gp120 and Transient CH505TF gp120. The vaccines are mixed with an adjuvant&#xD;
      called GLA-SE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive&#xD;
      Stable CH505TF gp120; participants in Group 2 will receive Transient CH505TF. Depending on&#xD;
      their group, participants will receive Stable CH505TF gp120 or Transient CH505TF gp120 by&#xD;
      injection at Months 0, 2, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional study visits will occur at Months 0.5, 2.5, 6.5, 9, and 12. Study visits may&#xD;
      include physical examinations, medical history, vaccine injections, blood and urine&#xD;
      collection, risk reduction counseling, and questionnaires. Participants will also be&#xD;
      contacted for health information at Month 18.&#xD;
