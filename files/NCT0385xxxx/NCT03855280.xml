      Study APVO101-903 is a Phase 3/4, single arm, open-label clinical trial. The purpose of the&#xD;
      study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of APVO101 prophylaxis in&#xD;
      severe or moderately severe hemophilia B subjects &lt; 12 years of age. The study is designed to&#xD;
      gather information in two age groups of previously treated (with a minimum of 50 previous ED&#xD;
      to factor IX replacement therapy) pediatric patients, specifically those &lt; 6 years of age and&#xD;
      6 to &lt;12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study APVO101-903 consists of three distinct phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK Phase - PK evaluation will consist of administration of a single 75 ± 5 IU/kg dose,&#xD;
           followed by factor IX activity and safety assessments up to 50 hours post-infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Phase - subjects will receive APVO101 prophylaxis (starting prophylaxis dose&#xD;
           to be determined based on APVO101 recovery; ideally within the recommended dose range:&#xD;
           35 - 75 IU/kg; twice weekly) for 50 ED (approximately 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuation Phase - subjects may continue to receive APVO101 prophylaxis (recommended&#xD;
           dose range: 35 - 75 IU/kg; twice weekly) for an additional ≥ 50 ED.&#xD;

          4. Documented severe or moderately severe hemophilia B diagnosis (factor IX activity ≤ 2&#xD;
             IU/dL); in addition, severity may be indicated by the occurrence of one or more joint&#xD;
             bleeding episode(s) at any point in the child's medical history requiring infusion(s)&#xD;
             to replace factor IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must be on prophylaxis or switch to a prophylaxis regimen for the duration of&#xD;
