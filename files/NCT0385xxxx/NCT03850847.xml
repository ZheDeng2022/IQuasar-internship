  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given how central Substitute Decision Makers (SDMs) are to the process leading to end of life&#xD;
      decisions and sometimes, organ donation, it is striking how poorly understood this&#xD;
      decision-making process is. A 2017 scoping review on the topic of soliciting SDM consent to&#xD;
      organ donation reported on more than 168 studies covering a broad range of topics, including:&#xD;
      SDM characteristics and predictors of consent; the process of soliciting consent; and the&#xD;
      effect of the decision on subsequent process of care and on family well-being. An unexplored&#xD;
      area, however, is factors - including modifiable factors - that influence SDM decision making&#xD;
      at the end of life, which organ donation is part of, such as: responses to stress, support&#xD;
      from extended families and friends, and personal beliefs about the ongoing medical&#xD;
      conditions. This project seeks to fill this clear and important gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ICU, at the end of life, SDMs are under incredible emotional distress, have often not&#xD;
      eaten or slept properly for days preceding discussions about end of life and organ donation,&#xD;
      and are also in the midst of grieving for their loved one. The time pressure poses challenges&#xD;
      for SDMs' decision making. Thus, this study will investigate novel, potentially modifiable&#xD;
      reasons for end of life decision so that we may better support this personally challenging&#xD;
      and important decision, especially if organ donation decision interferes with the decision&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To investigate beliefs and experiences of SDMs involved in the&#xD;
      decision-making process around withdrawal of life sustaining therapies .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To inform efforts to improve support for SDMs with the aim of improving&#xD;
      the decision-making process end-of-life decisions, including when organ donation is involved.&#xD;

      A national multicenter multi-methods study with SDMs will be conducted in two steps. In Step&#xD;
      1, a semi-structured interviews with SDMs will be conducted. The sampling frame will balance&#xD;
      interviews with those that were approached or not for organ donation, and consented or not to&#xD;
      organ donation. Interviews will be informed by two complementary theoretical frameworks.&#xD;
      Building on Step 1 results, in Step 2 a national telephone survey of SDMs will be conducted&#xD;
      to test which factors are associated with end-of-life decisions.&#xD;

The responses obtained from the interviews will be analysed and classified based on the Leventhal's Common Sense Self-Regulation Model and the theoretical domain Framework. The most significant domains will help inform the creation of a larger scale national survey to help investigate what domains affect decision-making around end of life.</description>
