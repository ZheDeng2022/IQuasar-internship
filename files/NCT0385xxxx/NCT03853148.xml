  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Overall Aim of the present proposal is to evaluate the feasibility of an integrated&#xD;
      mind-body intervention, Activate for Life, to improve overall physical activity and mental&#xD;
      health and reduce pain and fatigue, resulting in increased likelihood of Aging in Place. Both&#xD;
      subjective self-report (i.e., NIH PROMIS measures of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety)&#xD;
      and objective accelerometer data will be collected, along with standardized measures of&#xD;
      balance, strength, and stability. In addition, the measures will be complemented with&#xD;
      biomarker-based measures of stress, including cortisol based and 1,5-AG assays before,&#xD;
      during, and after treatment that are correlated with stress, and fatigue symptoms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of supplement study is to test the feasibility of a self-managed (SM),&#xD;
      electronic/mobile Health (e/mHealth) yoga intervention for reducing stress symptoms (burden)&#xD;
      in older caregivers (CG) of people with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementia's (PWD). CG&#xD;
      burden can exacerbate a myriad of physical and psychosocial comorbidities in CGs as well as&#xD;
      PWD neuropsychiatric symptoms. These effects may be further amplified in older CG with&#xD;
      underlying health concerns or those who are not able to access programs for effective&#xD;
      management of their own medical or self-care needs. Low-impact physical activities such as&#xD;
      gentle Yoga (GY) have shown positive effects on mood and symptoms of pain and fatigue in&#xD;
      older community dwellers, and digital e/mHealth platforms have a great deal of potential to&#xD;
      overcome financial and medical barriers for the delivery SM stress interventions across&#xD;
      demographic boundaries. In this study, we will examine the feasibility of a 12-week e/mHealth&#xD;
      gentle yoga+yogic breathing (GYYB) intervention for alleviating symptoms of burden in aging&#xD;
      CG of PWD (Aim 1); measure initial changes in stress and QoL indicators in CG and PWD (post-&#xD;
      vs. pre-intervention) to inform an adequately-powered, future efficacy trial (Aim 2), and;&#xD;
      establish a Dyadic Analysis Training Program for MUSC faculty within the College of Nursing&#xD;
      and P20 Symptom Self-Management Center (SSMC) to support future research evaluating the&#xD;
      influence of care-recipient interactions on health outcomes (Aim 3). Feasibility will be&#xD;
      assessed using the RE-AIM framework, and will include measures such as recruitment,&#xD;
      adherence, treatment satisfaction, attrition, and feedback for intervention refinement. Data&#xD;
      related to CG physical function, fatigue, depression, social isolation, loneliness,&#xD;
      relationship quality, burden, and stress biomarkers, as well as PWD and CG QoL, will be&#xD;
      collected via daily electronic practice logs and interviews at study beginning and end. Older&#xD;
      (45 yrs. old and older) male and female CG (N=20) of PWD regularly attending respite care&#xD;
      (RCC) programs will be recruited from an existing study population (R01 NR016466)&#xD;
      participating in CG-RCC mealtime partnerships for improved PWD nutritional outcomes. The&#xD;
      HIPAA-compliant GYYB intervention will employ 'tablets' that allow CG to practice GYYB at&#xD;
      home by following along with recorded lessons. CG will initially be trained on the use of the&#xD;
      tablet and proper GYYB practices by the study coordinator (in-home), with weekly follow up&#xD;
      (Skype/phone) for the duration of the study. This investigation is ideally aligned with the&#xD;
      aims of the parent SSMC (P20 NR016575) that are focused on providing infrastructure and&#xD;
      community-based resources for design and ecologically-valid testing of SM interventions for&#xD;
      individuals with chronic conditions.&#xD;

    <measure>Older Adult Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean pain scores as measured with PROMIS Pain Intensity short form 3a, which allows for individuals to report how much a person hurts. The lowest possible raw score is 4; the highest possible raw score is 20. Raw summed scores are converted to T-score values (using conversion tables provided at http://www.healthmeasures.net/score-and-interpretscores/promis) that are standardized such that 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and a standard deviation of 10 points. A higher T-score represents more of the concept being measured, meaning the higher above 50 the more pain interferes with aspects of one's life compared to the general population.</description>

    <measure>Older Adult Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean fatigue score as measured by PROMIS Fatigue short form 6a, 6 items that assess a range of self-reported symptoms, from mild subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases one's ability to execute daily activities and function normally in family or social roles. The lowest possible raw score is 6; the highest possible raw score is 30. Raw summed scores are converted to T-score values (using conversion tables provided at http://www.healthmeasures.net/score-and-interpretscores/promis) that are standardized such that 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and a standard deviation of 10 points. A higher T-score represents more of the concept being measured, meaning the higher above 50 the worse the fatigue the individual has compared to the general population.</description>

    <measure>Older Adult Pain Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean pain score as measured with PROMIS Pain Behavior short form 7a, which allows for self-reported external manifestations of pain: behaviors that typically indicate to others that an individual is experiencing pain. These actions or reactions can be verbal or nonverbal, and involuntary or deliberate. The lowest possible raw score is 7; the highest possible raw score is 42. Raw summed scores are converted to T-score values (using conversion tables provided at http://www.healthmeasures.net/score-and-interpretscores/promis) that are standardized such that 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and a standard deviation of 10 points. A higher T-score represents more of the concept being measured, meaning the higher above 50 the worse or more pain behavior the individual has compared to the general population.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean quality of life scores measured with the Euroqol-EQ-5D which compromises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and how good/bad one's health, assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 worst health to 100 best health you can imagine) and divided into 3 levels of perceived problems. An EQ-5D summary index is derived by applying a formula that attaches values (weights) to each of the levels in each dimension. The index is calculated by deducting the appropriate weights from 1, the value for full health. Higher values (scores of 3) indicate extreme pain, depression/anxiety, inability to perform usual activities, unable to wash or dress self, or confined to bed. High VAS scores indicate good perceived health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Relationship Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean relationship quality score measured with the Mutuality Scale, a 15-item instrument that measures mutuality (love, shared pleasurable activities, shared values, and reciprocity) from the caregiver perspective. Examples of items are: &quot;How close do you feel to the person you care for?&quot; or &quot;How much do you confide in theperson you care for?&quot;. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all), 1 (a little), 2 (some), 3 (quite a bit) to 4 (a great deal). The total scale score, a mean of all item scores, ranges from 0 to 4: higher scores means greater mutuality.</description>

    <measure>Person with Dementia Activities of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean score on functional activities of daily living measured with the Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire which is completed by the caregiver and consists of 46 items for 3 domains: initiation, planning and organization, and performance. The total score, which has a range of 0 to 100. The denominator represents the score that would have been obtained if the most severe level of impairment had been indicated for all items rated (excluding those rated ''9''). The numerator represents the total of the actual ratings for all items rated (excluding those rated ''9''). The resultant score representsthe level of severity of impairment in ADL. The amount of functional impairment is then rated as ''none to mild'' (0-33),''moderate'' (34-66%), or ''severe'' (.66%). Functional impairment scores are calculated for each subscale individually and for the total of all items.</description>

    <description>The GYYB is a one-hour program containing gentle physical Yoga postures that participants could practice sitting on a chair for 30 minutes. These exercises are designed based on improving the overall flexibility, bodily control and mindfulness in movements. Following the gentle yoga postures, the participants will perform Yogic breathing exercises for 30 minutes. These exercises are known to promote relaxation, mood, pain and anxiety scores that are highly relevant to the target population and are reported to stimulate measurable biomarker changes in the saliva. During the in-person session the Yoga instructor will explain the GYYB program to participants in the Otago+GYYB group each exercise and their perceived benefits.</description>

    <description>This condition will incorporate OEP and GYYB as above and will also include behavioral activation to address motivation and affect. Behavioral Activation incorporates daily planners and worksheets to identify and rate reinforcing behaviors and is often used in conjunction with other interventions because components of these interventions are easily incorporated into the daily planner based activities. Each participant outlines general values and specific behaviors that 'demonstrate' each value, compiling a list of the latter. This list is then used to generate 10 to 20 highly defined values-based, reinforcing activities. Next, this list is combined with the activities outlines in Otago and GYYB and this master list is used to schedule these values-based activities for the next two days.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The GYYB is a one-hour program containing gentle physical Yoga postures that participants could practice sitting on a chair for 30 minutes. These exercises are designed based on improving the overall flexibility, bodily control and mindfulness in movements. Following the gentle yoga postures, the participants will perform Yogic breathing exercises for 30 minutes. These exercises are known to promote relaxation, mood, pain and anxiety scores that are highly relevant to the target population and are reported to stimulate measurable biomarker changes in the saliva. During the in-person session the Yoga instructor will explain the GYYB program to participants in the GYYB group each exercise and their perceived benefits.</description>
