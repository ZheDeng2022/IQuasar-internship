  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Altered waking states of consciousness and its underlying functional organization have gained&#xD;
      increasing interest in recent years, i.e. in identifying the neural basis of consciousness.&#xD;
      To overcome fundamental shortcomings of current methods to objectively assess the level of&#xD;
      consciousness, the investigators propose here to apply a novel and empirically validated&#xD;
      measure called 'perturbational complexity index' (PCI) based on the integrated information&#xD;
      theory (IIT). This involves a combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and&#xD;
      highdensity electroencephalography (hd-EEG) to measure electrocortical responses as&#xD;
      distributed cerebral interactions ('integration') and spatiotemporal pattern ('information').&#xD;
      Given the finding of subjectively expanded consciousness as induced here by psilocybin, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the PCI may be higher in such states. This will be the first&#xD;
      TMS/hd-EEG study to investigate quantitatively the level of consciousness in a&#xD;
      pharmacologically altered waking state of consciousness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will apply navigated TMS/high-density(hd)-EEG to directly&#xD;
      stimulate defined cortical areas and investigate quantitatively the level of consciousness in&#xD;
      psilocybin-induced altered brain states. For this purpose, PCI is the primary outcome in&#xD;
      psilocybin versus placebo condition. Given the findings and the subjective feeling of an&#xD;
      'expanded' consciousness in such states, the investigators primarily hypothesize that&#xD;
      psilocybin will induce a higher PCI as compared to placebo in TMS/hd-EEG measurements over&#xD;
      all targeted cortical areas in the acute phase of treatment (80 minutes after substance&#xD;
      intake). Measurements will be done over the premotor cortex (Brodmann-Areal BA06), the&#xD;
      midline sensorimotor cortex (BA04) and the superior occipital gyrus/cuneus (BA19) and may be&#xD;
      related to the experience of an altered sense of self, e.g. measures of selflessness and&#xD;
      egodissolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study further seeks to characterize the effects of psilocybin compared to placebo on&#xD;
      resting state EEG. To this aim, the current source density and the lagged phase&#xD;
      synchronization of neuronal oscillations across distributed brain regions will be computed&#xD;
      and correlated to reproduce interesting results in a recent work of Kometer and colleagues.&#xD;
      More specifically, psilocybin decreased the current source density of neuronal oscillations&#xD;
      within a neural network comprising the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices and&#xD;
      parahippocampal regions. Even more, psilocybin-induced insightfulness and spiritual&#xD;
      experience correlated with the lagged phase synchronization of delta oscillations between the&#xD;
      retrosplenial cortex, the parahippocampus and the lateral orbitofrontal area, showing&#xD;
      evidence for a direct association of spatiotemporal neuronal mechanism with enhanced insight&#xD;
      into life and existence. The investigators therefore hypothesize that current source density&#xD;
      of neuronal oscillations within the cingulate cortices and the parahippocampal regions&#xD;
      (1.5-20 Hz) will be decreased and the lagged-phase synchronization of delta oscillations&#xD;
      (1.5-4 Hz) between the retrosplenial cortex, the parahippocampus and the lateral&#xD;
      orbitofrontal area will be correlated to insightfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, psychometric assessment of the sense of self, of perceptual alterations and of&#xD;
      mood will be conducted before and after each TMS session (Hood's Mysticism-Scale;&#xD;
      5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale; Positive and Negative Affect&#xD;
      Schedule). the investigators expect to find a relationship between substance induced changes&#xD;
      in perception and mood as indexed by these questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will be conducting a probabilistic learning task (emotLearn)&#xD;
      to examine the computational processes behind the interaction between reward learning and&#xD;
      subconscious versus conscious emotional processing to estimate how emotional stimuli affect&#xD;
      the learning rate in psilocybin compared to placebo condition. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that psilocybin decreases the conscious and subconscious learning rate by attenuating the&#xD;
      processing of emotional cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will be randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled with one-time&#xD;
      application of a single dose for each substance (moderate psilocybin dose of 20mg versus&#xD;
      mannitol), within-subject and single center at the Psychiatrische Universit√§tsklinik Zurich.&#xD;
      The number of participants is 25 healthy subjects as determined by power analysis. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria are healthy male or female volunteers aged 18-40 years. Exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      personal and family history of major psychiatric disease (e.g. major depression, bipolar&#xD;
      disorder, psychotic disorder) as defined in the DSM-V, any major medical condition (e.g.&#xD;
      neurologic, cardiovascular, metabolic disease), family history of seizure disorder, current&#xD;
      psychopharmacological treatment or pregnant respectively breastfeeding women. The study&#xD;
      comprises a total of 3 visits in 3 weeks - 1 screening visit and 2 investigational visits and&#xD;
      a written follow-up 12 weeks after the last investigational visit per participant. On the&#xD;
      investigational visits participants will receive placebo or psilocybin in a randomized and&#xD;
      counterbalanced order. The screening visit consists of a psychiatric assessment, physical&#xD;
      examination, routine lab/toxicology, electrocardiogram (ECG), EEG and cranial T1 weighted&#xD;
      magnetic resonance tomography (MRT). Study duration will be 2-3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research project was approved by the local ethics committee (KEK Zurich) in December 2018&#xD;
      as &quot;Other clinical trial&quot; as specified in the &quot;Ordinance on Clinical Trials in Human&#xD;
      Research&quot; (KlinV, Chapter 2) without health-related intervention or investigational Medical&#xD;
      Product (IMP) [25], Category B.&#xD;

    <description>Application of the 'Hood's Mysticism-Scale' (MS) before and after TMS/EEG sessions. The revised and validated Hood's Mysticism-Scale describes a measure of reported mystical experience.

    <description>Application of the '5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale' (5D-ASC) before and after TMS/EEG sessions. It is a retrospectively assessed questionnaire to measure subjective experiences of altered states of consciousness. It contains 94 items which are formulated as a visual analog scale. It contains five primary dimensions a global dimension of altered states of onsciousness: Oceanic boundlessness (OSE), Dread of Ego dissolution (AIA), Visionary restructuralization (VUS), Auditive alteration (AVE) and Vigilance reduction (VIR). The first-mentioned three dimensions correlate with each other and form a global dimension (G-ABZ). The visual analog scale (VAS) ranges from 0 (not perceived) to 10 (very strongly perceived)</description>

    <description>Application of the 'Positive and Negative Affect Schedule' (PANAS) before and after TMS/EEG sessions. This is a questionnaire with 20 items about positive and negative affect.

Positive affect represents the extent to which an individual experiences pleasurable engagement with the environment. The scale ranges from +2 (very strong) to -2 (very weak)</description>
