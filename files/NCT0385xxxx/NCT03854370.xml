      This is a randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of 4 vaginal prep solutions (betadine,&#xD;
      baby shampoo, TechniCare and Peridex) on reducing bacterial colony counts during surgery&#xD;
      preparation. Women undergoing a vaginal surgery will be enrolled into the trial prior to&#xD;
      surgery. Target sample size per group is 15 patients. During standard surgical prep, a&#xD;
      vaginal swab will be taken to assess the initial colony counts for aerobic and anaerobic&#xD;
      bacteria. After the initial swab, the incision point will be prepared using one of the prep 4&#xD;
      solutions (betadine, baby shampoo, TechniCare or Peridex). After a predefined 10 minutes, the&#xD;
      area will be re-swabbed to determine pre-incision colony counts. A third swab will be&#xD;
      collected after incision closure. Laboratory analyses for raw colony counts, sensitivities,&#xD;
      identification (using MALDI-TOF) will be performed. The results are expected to show that&#xD;
      there will be reduced colony counts at the pre-incision point with baby shampoo having the&#xD;
      least reduction, followed by betadine and TechniCare, then Peridex. Patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      for vaginal itching and burning as well as patient report of any treatment for vaginal&#xD;
      infection will be collected by telephone at 2 days, 2 weeks and 1 month post-surgery.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW Antiseptic preparation for surgical incision sites has&#xD;
      greatly reduced postoperative infections. However, surgical site infections (SSI) are still&#xD;
      the leading cause of hospitalizations after surgery. With the application of antiseptic&#xD;
      preparation, a reduction in bacterial counts follows. The rate at which the bacterial counts&#xD;
      rise between preparation and incision may be of variation depending on the surgical&#xD;
      antiseptic scrub.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Betadine (Povidone- iodine), Peridex (Chlorhexidine), baby shampoo and TechniCare&#xD;
      (chloroxynel) are all surgical scrubs approved for the preparation of vaginal access&#xD;
      surgeries. While there has been controversy on the use of Chlorohexidine for vaginal&#xD;
      preparation surgery, due to its labeling as a cause for irritation, studies have shown that&#xD;
      when 2-4% Chlorhexidine is used in the vaginal area there are little to no signs of&#xD;
      irritation and the bacteria counts post incision are less than the bacterial counts for&#xD;
      povidone iodine1,2. Baby shampoo can also be used as an effective antiseptic scrub with no&#xD;
      irritation and no statistical difference in bacterial count reduction as compared to&#xD;
      povidone-iodine3. Little research has been done to look at the antiseptic power of&#xD;
      Chloroxynel in vaginal surgeries. However, when used as a root canal antiseptic it can reduce&#xD;
      bacteria counts by 99.9%4. This is illustrative of its capability to reduce bacteria on a&#xD;
      mucus membrane similar to the vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is literature that shows the antiseptic power of Betadine, Peridex, Baby shampoo and&#xD;
      TechniCare for post-incisional bacteria counts, but little is known about the pre-incisional&#xD;
      power of these scrubs for vaginal access surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS OR OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to understand the power of vaginal&#xD;
      surgical scrubs before incision. This will be done by collecting bacterial samples both&#xD;
      before and 10 minutes after antiseptic preparation and after incision closure, along with&#xD;
      follow-up data of irritation, infection post-surgery, and infection risk factors of each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE TO PATIENT, INSTITUTION, PROFESSION, OR ALL Vaginal preparation research&#xD;
      provides benefitted knowledge to hospitals and physicians in the prevention of surgical site&#xD;
      infections (SSI). This specific project will provide insight regarding the&#xD;
      bacteria-eliminating power of four different surgical scrubs used on the vaginal mucous&#xD;
      membrane, pre-incision. There is potential for this study to determine the most effective&#xD;
      scrub for vaginal surgeries, as well as correlate pre-incisional bacterial counts and the&#xD;
      post-procedure bacterial counts with likelihood of surgical site infections. The information&#xD;
      collected from this study could benefit future patients and hospitals alike in terms of&#xD;
      reducing the risk of SSI's. The risks of this study could be unidentified allergies to any of&#xD;
      the surgical scrubs, or a loss of patient data. These are unlikely risks due to the protocol&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This study will use block randomization. There will be four arms of the study one for&#xD;
      each of the four surgical scrubs. There will be approximately 15 patients per arm. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing vaginal surgeries will be recruited from Wright State Physicians Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology. All procedures that require a vaginal incision will be included in the study,&#xD;
      these being procedures like hysterectomies and reconstruction surgery. Non-incisional&#xD;
      procedures like dilation and curettage will be excluded. Revision surgeries will also be&#xD;
      excluded to decrease any complications. Patients who consent to the study will be given a ID&#xD;
      and will be randomly assigned to one of the four arms. Patients will be excluded if an&#xD;
      allergy to any of the scrubs is listed or found. Each recruited patient will be over the age&#xD;
      of 18 with ability to provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be given a standard prophylaxis 30 minutes before surgery. After&#xD;
      prophylaxis administration and before surgical antiseptic preparation, a one minute swab will&#xD;
      be taken of the vagina making sure to span the surface area of the vaginal canal with&#xD;
      avoidance of the cervix. The swab will then be broken off into a tube labeled with the&#xD;
      patient ID, date, and &quot;pre-scrub&quot;. The patient will then undergo antiseptic preparation with&#xD;
      the assigned surgical prep. A standard procedure of application will be done for each of the&#xD;
      arms. Ten minutes after application, another swab will be taken using the same procedure as&#xD;
      the &quot;pre-scrub&quot; swab. This swab will be broken off in a tube labeled with the patient ID,&#xD;
      date, and &quot;post-scrub&quot;1. After incision closure, a third swab will be taken and will be&#xD;
      labeled 'post-procedure'. The swabs will then be transported to CompuNet for analysis of&#xD;
      aerobic, anaerobic bacteria and fungal colonies using Matrix Assisted&#xD;
      Depolarization/Ionization Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MADI-TOF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of colony counts will be collected from CompuNet. BMI, age, prophylaxis,&#xD;
      postmenopausal information, diabetic information, smoking history, surgical duration,&#xD;
      complication in surgery, and length of hospital stay will all be collected from patient&#xD;
      records. No patient identifiers will be collected5. Patients will be followed up after&#xD;
      surgery approximately two days, two weeks and a month after surgery to get information on&#xD;
      irritation and/or surgical infection. This data will be collected either be phone call or at&#xD;
      post-surgical follow-up appointment at Wright State Physicians. The South Hampton Grading&#xD;
      Scheme for Surgical Wounds will be used to Quantify Each patients level of irritation and/or&#xD;
      infection. The scale is a Zero to Five score, with Zero being no irritation or infection and&#xD;
      Five being severe irritation or infection15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential obstacle of this study could be recruitment of patients. Patients will not be&#xD;
      given incentive for participation and will not acquire any direct benefit from the study.&#xD;
      Another potential issue may arise from the size of the study; there may not be enough&#xD;
      subjects recruited for each arm of the study to find a detectable and significant difference&#xD;
      in the use of one surgical scrub over another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precautions will need to be taken for allergies. A recruited patient may not be aware of&#xD;
      personal allergies to the surgical scrubs. This would put the patient at risk of harm if&#xD;
      there was the potential for having an allergy to the assigned scrub. Since data will be&#xD;
      collected from the patient's medical records, precautions will be taken to avoid loss of&#xD;
      patient identifiers. All research investigators will only utilize the patients assigned&#xD;
      research ID. This will both protect the patient and avoid bias.&#xD;
