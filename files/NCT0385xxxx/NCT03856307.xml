  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the study aims to assess the reliability of ultrasound findings measured by hand held&#xD;
      ultrasound probes used by operators with variable experience in a low resource hospital.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The majority of obstetric emergencies are identified through clinical examination,&#xD;
      which cannot be substituted by ultrasound. However, just as a laboratory exam, ultrasonograpy&#xD;
      can provide swift point of care information on fetus presentation, viability, placenta&#xD;
      position, quantity of amniotic fluid and presence of abdominal fluid to inform the clinical&#xD;
      reasoning and therapeutic escalation. Ultrasound literature in low-resource settings has&#xD;
      favoured antenatal care (ANC) rather than the emergency setting. Also, hand-held ultrasound&#xD;
      machines may not be as performant as traditional machines used by expert operators but to&#xD;
      date is still to be tested in a low resource setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to assess the reliability of ultrasound findings measured by hand held ultrasound&#xD;
      probes used by operators with variable experience in a low resource hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There is substantial agreement between simple ultrasound findings identified&#xD;
      using hand held ultrasound devices and the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: a prospective observational diagnostic accuracy study. Study population:&#xD;
      parturients admitted to the Princess Christian Maternity Hospital (PCMH) in Freetown, Sierra&#xD;
      Leone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: no formal sample size calculation is performed. Based on current rates of&#xD;
      admissions to the PCMH we expect to perform obstetrical ultrasound scan in at least 300&#xD;
      patients during a 2-months study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 4 trained physicians (3 naive and 1 intermediate ultrasound users) will perform the&#xD;
      ultrasound investigations using the hand held device and complete a structured predefined&#xD;
      report form of obstetric ultrasound findings at patient admission or according to clinical&#xD;
      indications after admission. These will be compared with the reference standard, i.e. an&#xD;
      ultrasound examination performed by a specialist gynecologist/obstetrician using a&#xD;
      conventional apparatus in the hospital ultrasound room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/primary endpoints: The mean diagnostic accuracy among nine ultrasound&#xD;
      obstetric findings collected with hand held devices versus the reference standard.&#xD;
