  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of a catheter-based local delivery&#xD;
      of paclitaxel into the peripheral arterial vessels in patients with peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease (PAD) and subsequent restenosis of the femoropopliteal region would benefit from this&#xD;
      type of investigational intervention with a known antiproliferative agent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower extremities is an extremely prevalent, and&#xD;
      often times, disabling disorder reaching roughly 8 million people in the United States, and&#xD;
      up to 20 percent of the population over the age of 60 to 70. Atherosclerosis commonly occurs&#xD;
      in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and the popliteal artery limiting blood flow to the&#xD;
      affected vessels, as well as, the distal lower extremities. PAD of this type causes&#xD;
      claudication in up to 35% of patients which may progress to critical limb ischemia in up to&#xD;
      2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular treatment options have significantly improved over the past decade, allowing a&#xD;
      multitude of treatment alternatives. In the US, the number of endovascular treatments now&#xD;
      exceed bypass surgery. Procedural success rates of greater than 90 percent can be achieved by&#xD;
      stenting, atherectomy, and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; however, long term patency&#xD;
      rates have been troubled by elastic recoil or neointimal hyperplasia. Two year patency rates&#xD;
      have been documented to range from 40-50% following balloon angioplasty. Stenting in the&#xD;
      femoropopliteal region in attempts to improve restenosis fall short with a primary patency&#xD;
      rate of 70-80% as seen in the FAST trial. Atherectomy is promising, but has not been studied&#xD;
      extensively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inability to obtain long term patency has led us to look at our success in the coronary&#xD;
      field where drug-eluting stents (DES) are often used. Antiproliferative drugs such as&#xD;
      paclitaxel prevent neointimal growth and have proven patency and long term success. There&#xD;
      have been initial animal and human studies which have shown potential in preventing&#xD;
      restenosis by using drug coated balloons and DES. Currently, there is no FDA approved drug&#xD;
      eluting balloon for use in femoropopliteal disease, leading us to search for alternative&#xD;
      therapies following femoropopliteal interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel inhibits microtubule disassembly and disrupts normal cellular processes such as&#xD;
      protein signaling, mitosis, and migration. It is highly lipogenic and poorly water soluble.&#xD;
      Paclitaxel has been stated to prevent restenosis through several mechanisms in vitro. These&#xD;
      mechanisms include inhibiting proliferation and migration of human smooth muscle cells. Use&#xD;
      of the antiproliferative agent in the peripheral arena has been conducted, but no definitive&#xD;
      results have been achieved to date. One internal animal study showed promise in the&#xD;
      deliverability of localized paclitaxel into targeted segments of the vessel using the TAPAS&#xD;
      device. Concentrations of 0.67 mg/mL, 1.2 mg/mL, and 2.0 mg/mL were infused locally at a&#xD;
      duration of 2-5 minutes within the iliofemoral segment in pigs, then aspirated from the&#xD;
      vessel using the device. No differences in drug absorption were found among the three&#xD;
      concentrations. Drug retention remained greater than 50% in all groups at 3 and 24 hours. The&#xD;
      average drug concentration in the vessel wall of all groups was 1.73 ± 0.85 µg/g at 3 hours,&#xD;
      and 1.29 ± 0.47 µg/g at 24 hours after treatment. Approximately 77% of the total drug&#xD;
      administered was aspirated, with the assumption that the remaining drug was either absorbed&#xD;
      in the tissue, remained in the catheter, or lost systemically. On average, plasma paclitaxel&#xD;
      levels after treatment measured 22.5 ± 21.07 ng/mL at 2 minutes, 2.7 ± 0.85 ng/mL at 3 hours,&#xD;
      and less than 1.2 ng/mL at 24 hours. Histology showed no inflammation, injury, or other&#xD;
      adverse effect when compared with the contrast group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newly available Targeted Adjustable Pharmaceutical Application System (TAPAS)-TAPAS&#xD;
      Catheter Therapeutic System (Spectranetics, Colorado Springs, CO, USA)-has a proximal and&#xD;
      distal occlusion balloon with an adjustable length that allows local drug delivery to a&#xD;
      targeted arterial segment preventing systemic effects by allowing aspiration following&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ResTAP study is a prospective, open label, observational study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the delivery of paclitaxel to prevent recurrent restenosis after percutaneous&#xD;
      intervention including atherectomy with or without stenting in patients who have restenosis&#xD;
      after a prior endovascular revascularization.&#xD;
