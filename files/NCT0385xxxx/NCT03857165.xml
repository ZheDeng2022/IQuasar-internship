  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo controlled, Dose-escalation&#xD;
      study to evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Efficacy of&#xD;
      SAP-001 in Gout Patients with Hyperuricemia. The study will be single dose ascending cohorts&#xD;
      across three doses with a placebo control arm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 24 eligible adult subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 randomization ratio into&#xD;
      two blinded treatment groups in the three dose cohorts with matching placebo arm. The&#xD;
      duration of the observation would be 5 days for each subject with a single SAP-001 dosing to&#xD;
      evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy of&#xD;
      oral SAP-001 (once daily) in adults gout patients with hyperuricemia.&#xD;
