  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RTS, S/AS01E vaccine has been developed for routine immunization of children living in&#xD;
      malaria- endemic countries of sub-Saharan Africa. This study is intended as a&#xD;
      post-implementation safety study (after vaccine implementation), with the primary objective&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety of vaccine after its administration. In addition to the primary&#xD;
      objective, the study will also evaluate the impact and effectiveness of the vaccine.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Active surveillance refers to prospective cohort monitoring of the AESI and other diseases&#xD;
      during study follow-up visits at the community level as well outpatient and inpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced hospitalisation surveillance (EHS) is defined as case detection during&#xD;
      hospitalisation through monitoring of medical records and registries for the study&#xD;
      participants not enrolled in active surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study targets enrolling at least 45,000 children in active surveillance (AS), including&#xD;
      22,500 in the exposed clusters and 22,500 in the unexposed clusters for evaluation of the&#xD;
      vaccine safety, effectiveness and impact. In the exposed clusters are included a minimum of&#xD;
      20,250 children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01E for evaluation of the vaccine safety, and a&#xD;
      minimum of 2,250 unvaccinated children for evaluation of effectiveness and impact assuming&#xD;
      that 80% of the 22,500 study participants will receive three doses of RTS,S/AS01E, 10% will&#xD;
      receive one or two doses and 10% will not have any dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) is considering implementing the malaria&#xD;
      vaccine in unexposed clusters as from 2023. This decision will directly impact the temporal&#xD;
      (before/after) and concurrent (exposed versus unexposed clusters) comparisons. Based on this,&#xD;
      the EHS recruitment will be stopped as from 01 January 2023 in sites that were not involved&#xD;
      in the NCT02374450 study and study conclusion will be conducted in a timely manner for&#xD;
      already enrolled subjects in those sites (EHS will stop in all sites in Malawi, Siaya and&#xD;
      Nyando sites in Kenya and unexposed sites in Ghana).&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence rates of adverse events of special interest (AESI)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study period (From Day 0 up to Month 62)</time_frame>
    <description>AESI are predefined list of adverse events that have historically been associated with vaccines other than RTS,S/AS01E, or may hypothetically be associated with RTS,S/AS01E due to the fact that this vaccine has components which are new compared to current widely used vaccines.&#xD;
The incidence rate will be calculated by dividing the number of study participants reporting at least one event over the follow-up period by the total person-time. The person-time for an event of interest will be calculated as the time between the reference date (date of first RTS,S/AS01E vaccination for the vaccinated study participants and virtual vaccination corresponding to the week before first visit for the unvaccinated study participants) and the end of the at-risk period or the earliest of the followings: Date of first diagnosis of event of interest, Date of end of study period, Date when child reaches 5 years, Date of last contact or Date of death.</description>
