  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative CTRT is considered the standard of care in the management of LARC. Preoperative&#xD;
      CTRT approach results in significant tumor downstaging and local control with a complete&#xD;
      pathological response rate of about 15% even if additional therapeutic strategies should be&#xD;
      explored to improve outcomes, expecially for T4 cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 immunocheckpoint blockade (ICB), turned out a breakthrough in&#xD;
      cancer treatment among different tumor types, including CRC. An ICB strategy could lead up to&#xD;
      a 40% of response in metastatic CRC with deficient mismatch repair (MMR) status.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the activity of ICBs in MMR proficient mCRC is extremely low but it might be&#xD;
      improved using immunomodulatory strategies as demonstrated by Bendell et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the role of RT in revert the tolerance to a low neoantigen-burden (such as&#xD;
      in MMR proficient CRCs) by the induction of antigen release from the tumour and activation of&#xD;
      dendritic cells leading to a CD8+ T lymphocyte-mediated anticancer immune response has been&#xD;
      widely elucidated. Moreover, antineoplastic agents can be exploited to target other crucial&#xD;
      cellular effectors of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (i.e. regulatory T cells and&#xD;
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with these evidences, Hecht et al. have recently reported that in rectal cancer&#xD;
      patients, neoadjuvant CTRT increases PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, strongly suggesting a&#xD;
      neoadjuvant combinatory strategy with RT and PD-1/PD-L1 pathway blockade. The integration of&#xD;
      immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting (instead of adjuvant one) for the management of LARC&#xD;
      is also supported by preclinical findings showing that in metastatic breast cancer mice&#xD;
      models, neoadjuvant immunotherapy is superior in inducing long-term survivors, compared with&#xD;
      adjuvant strategy with a greater magnitude of tumor-specific T cell expansion in neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treated mice and a better anti-tumor T cell-mediated immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of such considerations, there is a strong biological and clinical rationale for&#xD;
      testing the addition of avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 moab, to capecitabine-based CTRT in patients&#xD;
      with technically resectable, LARC. The aim of this strategy is to lead to significant&#xD;
      improvements of pCR and, ultimately, patients' survival.&#xD;
