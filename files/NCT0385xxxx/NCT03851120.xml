  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics is suggested to play several roles in promoting health, including alleviating&#xD;
      disease symptoms, protection against atopic disease, and modulating the immune system by&#xD;
      improving the beneficial gut microbiota colonization. The discovery of the gut&#xD;
      microbiota-brain axis suggested that there is a reciprocal influence between the brain and&#xD;
      the gut through a constant communication. This bi-directional axis enables signals to be&#xD;
      transferred from brain to influence sensory, motor, and secretory modalities of the GI tract,&#xD;
      also permits signal from the gut to influence brain function. The establishment of intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota during early neurodevelopmental period suggests the colonization and maturation of&#xD;
      gut microbiota may influence brain development. Several studies have shown there is an&#xD;
      association between shifts in the gut microbiota composition in children with&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders. This study aims to investigate how maternal probiotic + LC-PUFA&#xD;
      supported with government program supplements, healthy eating, and psychosocial stimulation&#xD;
      could affect fetal brain development and later child brain functions and cognitive&#xD;
      development. Intervention would be delivered to pregnant women for 9 months, starting at the&#xD;
      end of second trimester of gestational period.&#xD;

      Health and well-being at all ages is one of the goal set in the Sustainable Development&#xD;
      Goals. Starting as early as possible has been considered to be an effective strategy for&#xD;
      better investation in achieving healthy population. Therefore, the prevention and promotion&#xD;
      of health and well being is starting to target population at younger age, starting as early&#xD;
      as possible. Accordingly, the early life period of individuals has been considered as a&#xD;
      critical period, especially in terms of the brain and cognitive development. The phases of&#xD;
      brain development starts very early, starting from the fetal development in the uterus. The&#xD;
      development process extends from early in the beginning of fetal development and lasted to&#xD;
      the end, finishing last. The brain undergoes a period of rapid growth during the last&#xD;
      trimester of fetal life and the first 2 years of childhood. Therefore, quality of pregnancy&#xD;
      as well as quality of early life is important to the fetal brain development as well as later&#xD;
      child brain function and cognitive development. In line with that notion, there are many&#xD;
      studies suggesting that gut microbiota could affect CNS development through several ways,&#xD;
      i.e. alteration of microbial composition, activation of immune system, changes in signaling&#xD;
      via neural pathways, affecting tryptophan metabolism, modulating gut hormonal response and&#xD;
      affecting hormonal signaling pathway, and releasing metabolites that could stimulate&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system. In particular, these studies have found bi-directional&#xD;
      communication between the brain and the gut microbiota, referred to as the&#xD;
      microbiota-gut-brain axis. The animal study showed that the gut microbiota regulates the&#xD;
      development and function of the brain. Unfortunately, the study on human was still lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) and placebo parallel controlled study. The&#xD;
      research will be conducted in eight public hospitals / health care facilities in Indonesia,&#xD;
      Jakarta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of COVID-19 outbreak, if face-to-face activities are permitted by (1) national&#xD;
      government (Indonesian Ministry of Health), (2) local government (DKI Jakarta), (3) the&#xD;
      university, (4) Data Safety Monitoring Board, and (5) by consent of the subject, then the&#xD;
      activities need to be strictly adjusted with the COVID-19 prevention measures for both&#xD;
      personnel and subjects. All personnel and subjects who will be involved in the activities are&#xD;
      required to fill out the COVID-19 symptom screening form prior to the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some adjustments for the project field implementation have been conducted during the&#xD;
      outbreak, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Following Good Clinical Practice, for the safety of the subjects and all the team&#xD;
           members, we are now ensuring that the subjects gain benefits from their involvement in&#xD;
           the BRAVE project by implementing routine COVID-19 screening, providing adequate PPE for&#xD;
           the fieldworkers, and educating them about the prevention measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Supplement delivery: Because we could not visit to the houses anymore due to staff&#xD;
           restriction regulations, the bottles of the supplement are delivered using online&#xD;
           motorcycle taxi services, and this includes the weighing scale for monthly monitoring.&#xD;
           We have also developed a protocol to ensure the safety of supplement bottle transfer&#xD;
           from the research personnel to the motorcycle taxi driver, and from the driver to the&#xD;
           mothers, including safe distancing and disinfection procedures. We will also educate,&#xD;
           provide a thermometer for self-temperature screening and provide the disinfectant to the&#xD;
           mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Outcome assessment: As per March 19, MRI assessment and blood sample collection remained&#xD;
           implemented at a non-COVID-19 referral hospital and laboratory, with strict safety&#xD;
           procedures for the subjects and personnel. For mothers who do not feel comfortable&#xD;
           visiting the hospital/laboratory, they are free to refuse these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compliance: Online system to promote and assess compliance. To maintain the quality, we&#xD;
           cross-check mothers' activities by online assessment, interactive short message service&#xD;
           (sms), and phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. New Subject Recruitment are less priority right now or potentially stop for the time&#xD;
           being until the situation is getting better.&#xD;
