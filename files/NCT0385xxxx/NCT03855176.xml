  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though HAV is mainly transmitted through the fecal-oral route, infection by sexual&#xD;
      intercourse and blood transfusion is also possible. Injection drug users (IDUs) and men who&#xD;
      have sex with men (MSM) have a higher risk of acquiring HAV due to their behaviors.&#xD;
      Reemerging threat of hepatitis A among MSM in Taiwan has been reported recently. Based on the&#xD;
      guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HIV/AIDS and the Advisory Committee on&#xD;
      Immunization Practices (ACIP), Taiwan, vaccination of individuals against HAV with any of the&#xD;
      following indications is recommended: HIV patients, adults with chronic hepatic disease,&#xD;
      hemophilia, liver transplantation, occupational exposure, MSM, persons who use injection or&#xD;
      noninjection illicit drugs, or persons traveling to or working in countries that have&#xD;
      endemicity of HAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In HIV-infected patients, the immunogenicity to HAV vaccination is sub-optimal in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients and the seroconversion rate is estimated 68-90% after administration of&#xD;
      2 or 3 doses of HAV vaccine. Furthermore, the antibody titers of HIV-infected patients&#xD;
      following HAV vaccination are significantly lower compared to those of HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      persons. The sub-optimal response among HIV-infected subjects remains an unresolved problem.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to determine the to conduct a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      to compare the immunogenicity of 2 different doses of HAV vaccination (1 dose versus 2 doses)&#xD;
      in HIV-infected patients who failed to achieve serologic response in the primary vaccination.&#xD;
      This proposal will provide the solid evidence to elucidate the role of booster HAV&#xD;
      vaccination in HIV-infected patients without response to primary HAV vaccination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Though HAV is mainly transmitted through the fecal-oral route, infection by sexual&#xD;
      intercourse and blood transfusion is also possible. Injection drug users (IDUs) and men who&#xD;
      have sex with men (MSM) have a higher risk of acquiring HAV due to their behaviors. Acute&#xD;
      hepatitis A outbreaks have been reported among these groups of patients in the USA, Europe&#xD;
      and Australia. Reemerging threat of hepatitis A among MSM in Taiwan has been reported&#xD;
      recently. HAV is generally a self-limited disease with marginal public health impact in&#xD;
      countries with low HAV endemicity. HAV infection does not progress to chronic hepatitis and&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis, but acute HAV infection poses a risk of acute liver failure or even death,&#xD;
      particularly the persons with chronic HBV or HCV infection who develop super-infection with&#xD;
      HAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In HIV-infected patients, liver disease is one of the three most common causes of death, and&#xD;
      acute HAV infection is one cause of liver damage in HIV-infected patients. HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients may experience prolonged HAV viremia, which can increase the risk of transmission to&#xD;
      others. Furthermore, given that drug-induced liver injury associated with highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and that HIV-infected subjects are frequently coinfected with&#xD;
      HBV and HCV, these patients are considered especially susceptible to severe complications&#xD;
      when they become infected by HAV. Risk factors for HIV infection, including MSM, IDUs,&#xD;
      persons with multiple heterosexual contacts, and persons frequently exposed to blood and&#xD;
      blood products, are also risk factors for HAV infection, since infection may occur through&#xD;
      shared transmission routes. Based on the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Taiwan, vaccination of&#xD;
      individuals against HAV with any of the following indications is recommended: HIV patients,&#xD;
      adults with chronic hepatic disease, hemophilia, liver transplantation, occupational&#xD;
      exposure, MSM, persons who use injection or noninjection illicit drugs, or persons traveling&#xD;
      to or working in countries that have endemicity of HAV. The number of people living with HIV&#xD;
      had grown to &gt;28,000 persons by 2014 in Taiwan and MSM accounted for more than 50 % among all&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients. Therefore, protection against HAV infection is essential in the care&#xD;
      of HIV-infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response rate to HAV vaccination is almost 100% among HIV-uninfected persons who receive&#xD;
      2 standard doses of HAV vaccine. However, the immunogenicity to HAV vaccination is&#xD;
      sub-optimal in HIV-infected patients and the seroconversion rate is estimated 68-90% after&#xD;
      administration of 2 or 3 doses of HAV vaccine. Furthermore, the antibody titers of&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients following HAV vaccination are significantly lower compared to those of&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected persons. Though one randomized clinical trial in HIV-infected patients&#xD;
      suggested the 3-dose schedule of HAV vaccination tended to achieve a higher seroconversion&#xD;
      rate than the 2-dose schedule at week 72 (78.3% versus 61.2%; P = 0.07), the optimal doses of&#xD;
      HAV vaccine in these subjects remained unclear. Recently, the research group from National&#xD;
      Taiwan University Hospital leaded by the principle investigator in this proposal published&#xD;
      the findings in Hepatology that the serologic response rate to 2 and 3 doses of HAV vaccine&#xD;
      was similar in HIV-infected MSM (75.7 % and 77.8 % seroconversion rate at week 48 for 2 doses&#xD;
      and 3 doses, respectively). Administration of HAV vaccine in HIV-infected patients with&#xD;
      higher CD4 counts (preferably &gt;200 cells/Î¼L) and suppression of HIV replication increased the&#xD;
      seroconversion rate. This study provided the evidence that 2 doses of primary HAV vaccine was&#xD;
      appropriate regimen in HIV-infected subjects. However, this study also found that the&#xD;
      seroconversion rate (75.7 % and 77.8 % in 2 doses and 3 doses, respectively) in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients was lower than that in two-dose HIV-uninfected MSM (88.5 %). Around 20 patients&#xD;
      receiving 2 doses of HAV vaccine and 30 patients with 3 doses of HAV vaccine did not have&#xD;
      achieve seroconversion. This study based on Taiwanese population is the milestone for the&#xD;
      research regarding HAV vaccination in HIV-infected patients. It not only demonstrates the&#xD;
      safety of 2 or 3 doses of HAV vaccine among HIV-infected patients, but also gives as insight&#xD;
      about the doses of primary vaccination. It is notable that the sub-optimal response among&#xD;
      HIV-infected subjects remains an unresolved problem. The role of booster vaccination in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients without response to primary HAV vaccination has rarely been addressed&#xD;
      in the literature. In one recent study conducted in Brazil, 23/29 (79.3%) from HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients maintained HAV antibodies 7 years after primary HAV vaccination. The group that lost&#xD;
      HAV seropositivity was revaccinated and 83.3% (5/6) responded with antibodies &gt;20 mUI/mL&#xD;
      after 2 doses of HAV vaccine. Though the limited numbers in this study, the data suggest that&#xD;
      antibody titer monitoring is necessary in HIV-infected patients and revaccination is&#xD;
      advisable to maintain protective levels of antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although vaccination against HAV is essential for HIV-infected patients, the uptake of HAV&#xD;
      vaccine is reported to be low. Studies of HAV vaccination coverage and screening rate for&#xD;
      exposure to HAV in HIV patients are also limited. It is obvious that physicians interested in&#xD;
      HIV care and vaccination planning is crucial to deal with this problem. In this study, we aim&#xD;
      to determine the seroprevalence of HAV infection, the vaccine coverage rate and the factors&#xD;
      associated with seropositivity in persons with HIV infection who sought HIV care over the&#xD;
      past 6 years (2010-2016). Furthermore, the investigators aim to conduct a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial to compare the immunogenicity of 2 different doses of HAV vaccination (1 dose versus 2&#xD;
      doses) in HIV-infected patients who failed to achieve serologic response in the primary&#xD;
      vaccination. This proposal will provide the solid evidence to elucidate the role of booster&#xD;
      HAV vaccination in HIV-infected patients without response to primary HAV vaccination.&#xD;
