  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background : Surgery is needed in order to flatten and position a detached retina onto the&#xD;
      choroid, to allow sealing of the tears and to prevent or reverse vision loss. In case of&#xD;
      complex retinal detachment vitrectomies followed by ocular endotamponade - non-solid implants&#xD;
      used in ophthalmology - is the most common treatment. Despite several options used by&#xD;
      surgeons were not entirely satisfactory, no innovation were marketed in the ocular&#xD;
      endotamponade field since decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose : Regarding comparative physico-chemical properties of medium-chain triglycerides&#xD;
      (MCT) with current tamponading agents (silicone oil or gases), it will be proposed to&#xD;
      evaluate the MCT as an ocular endotamponade product.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previously a nonclinical study has provide an assessment of the safety and the local tissue&#xD;
      effects of the Medium-Chain Triglyceride (MCT) tamponade agent manufactured by the company&#xD;
      Arcadophta : There were no histopathologic findings or irritation events that were directly&#xD;
      attributable to the MCT device. In conclusion, under the conditions of the study, the MCT&#xD;
      device did not induce any adverse local tissue effects compared to a control tamponading&#xD;
      agent silicone oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical study is the first use of MCT tamponade agent which assigns human&#xD;
      participants. The MCT tamponade agent studied is manufactured by the company Arcadophta and&#xD;
      designed as a Class IIb medical device in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tamponment efficacy and human eye safety of the device are supported by a flatten retina&#xD;
      observation and a healthy eye fundus exam respectively as long as the tamponade agent is&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient treatment is the classical surgical procedure which is used for retinal&#xD;
      detachment with silicone oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitrectomy, then flattened retina, and finally MCT injection in place of the vitreous.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MCT ablation after 4 to 6 weeks (after effective retinopexy) The patient follow-up&#xD;
           begins 4 days before treatment , then 3 time-points exams are performed before MCT&#xD;
           ablation and 4 time-points exams are performed after MCT ablation for a total patient&#xD;
           follow-up duration of 6 months.&#xD;
