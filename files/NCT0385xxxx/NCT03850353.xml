    <textblock>
      A total of 400 participants will be recruited: 200 patients with suspected OSAS will be&#xD;
      recruited from the sleep clinic (OSAS group), 100 patients diagnosed with dizziness will be&#xD;
      recruited from the ENT clinic (Dizziness group). In addition, 100 patients with no dizziness&#xD;
      and no evidence for OSAS will be recruited from both the sleep clinic and the ENT clinic&#xD;
      (controls). Informed consents will be completed by all participants. ). In order to assess&#xD;
      the effect of treatment of OSAS on dizziness -patients with the diagnosis of OSAS will&#xD;
      complete validated questionnaires regarding sleep, dizziness and eustachian tube function 3&#xD;
      months following initiation of treatment with CPAP&#xD;

      Group 1 - 200 patients with OSAS based on sleep study will be recruited from the sleep clinic&#xD;
      (OSAS group) Group 2 - 100 patients diagnosed with dizziness will be recruited from the ENT&#xD;
      clinic (Dizziness group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 - 100 patients with no dizziness and no evidence for OSAS will be recruited from both&#xD;
      the sleep clinic and the ENT clinic (controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consents will be completed by all participants. All participants will undergo&#xD;
      thorough physical examination with particular attention to the vestibular system, otoscopy,&#xD;
      examination of the pharynx including with a flexible endoscope (that is part of the standard&#xD;
      ENT examination). The examiner will photo-document the nasopharynx as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and complete medical history will be recorded for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete the following validated questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Berlin questionnaire for OSAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Epworth sleepiness scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dizziness Handicap Inventory - Hebrew version (DHI-H)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Eustachian tube dysfunction questionnaire Subjects from Group 1 that will have positive&#xD;
           dizziness/eustachian dysfunction will be referred for the ENT clinic for further&#xD;
           evaluation. Participants with dizziness will be treated, if indicated, based on their&#xD;
           diagnosis and according to clinical guidelines with symptoms relievers in the acute&#xD;
           phase (medications such sulpiride; fluids, metoclopramide) , physiotherapy and thiazide&#xD;
           diuretics for chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from Group 2 that will have a positive Berlin questionnaire will undergo ambulatory&#xD;
      sleep study with WatchPAT (Itamar Medical, Israel). The Berlin questionnaire consists of 10&#xD;
      items divided into 3 categories (category 1: items 1-5, category 2: items 6-9, category 3:&#xD;
      item 10). A positive Berlin question (high risk for OSA) is when 2 out of the 3 categories&#xD;
      are positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient will be diagnosed with OSAS if the Apnea-Hypopnea Index in the sleep study will be&#xD;
      greater than 5 per hour of sleep. Patients with moderate-severe OSA (AHI greater than 15 per&#xD;
      hour of sleep) will be treated with CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from Group 3 with positive Berlin questionnaire will be referred for a sleep study&#xD;
      as indicated in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors associated with OSAS will be recorded: Age, gender, smoking, BMI, neck&#xD;
      circumference. In addition, comorbidities associated with OSAS will be recorded such as&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect 15% of the patients referred to the sleep study to be diagnosed with&#xD;
      OSAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the effect of treatment of OSAS on dizziness -patients with dizziness and&#xD;
      diagnosis of moderate severe OSAS (AHI &gt;15) who will be treated with CPAP will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the 4 validated questionnaires 3 months following initiation of treatment with CPAP.&#xD;
      CPAP use of 80% or more of total sleep time (T.S.T) will be considered as full compliance.&#xD;
      60-80% of T.S.T- partial compliance. &lt;60% - no compliance.&#xD;
