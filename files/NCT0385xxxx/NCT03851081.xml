    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies side effects and best dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin and how&#xD;
      well it works when given together with vincristine sulfate liposome in treating patients with&#xD;
      CD22 positive (+) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back or dose not respond&#xD;
      to treatment. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called inotuzumab, linked to a&#xD;
      toxic agent called ozogamicin. Inotuzumab attaches to CD22+ cancer cells in a targeted way&#xD;
      and delivers ozogamicin to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine sulfate&#xD;
      liposome, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving inotuzumab&#xD;
      ozogamicin and vincristine sulfate liposome together may work better in treating patients&#xD;
      with CD22+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared to giving inotuzumab ozogamicin or&#xD;
      vincristine sulfate liposome alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of vincristine sulfate liposome (liposomal&#xD;
      vincristine) and inotuzumab ozogamicin combination therapy in adult patients with relapsed&#xD;
      and/or refractory B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR consisting of complete remission [CR],&#xD;
      morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi], of combination therapy with&#xD;
      liposomal vincristine and inotuzumab ozogamicin in adult patients with relapsed and/or&#xD;
      refractory B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated&#xD;
      with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the number of patients able to proceed onto subsequent hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (HSCT) following combination therapy following combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the overall incidence of unique toxicities associated with these agents,&#xD;
      specifically peripheral neuropathy following vincristine sulfate liposome and veno-occlusive&#xD;
      disease of the liver (VOD) following inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore minimal residual disease (MRD) as a potential correlative biomarker of response&#xD;
      to combination vincristine sulfate liposome and inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore potential biomarkers of response to vincristine sulfate liposome and&#xD;
      inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To perform an analysis of the estimated cost of outpatient administration of vincristine&#xD;
      sulfate liposome and inotuzumab ozogamicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) of patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL treated with&#xD;
      vincristine sulfate liposome and inotuzumab ozogamicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of inotuzumab ozogamicin followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION/RE-INDUCTION: Patients receive vincristine sulfate liposome intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      1 hour and inotuzumab ozogamicin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients who achieve clinical benefit, defined as stable disease (SD), PR or CR, or CRi after&#xD;
      1-2 cycles, will continue on to maintenance therapy for up to 4-5 cycles. Patients who do not&#xD;
      achieve clinical benefit after cycle 1 but do not experience dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)&#xD;
      receive a second cycle of vincristine sulfate liposome and inotuzumab ozogamicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive vincristine sulfate liposome IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15&#xD;
      and inotuzumab ozogamicin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 4-5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 12 months.&#xD;
