  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the existence of an effective screening test (pap smear), cervical cancer is, every&#xD;
      year in France, the cause of more than 3,000 new cases and 1,100 deaths. But, in France, 4 in&#xD;
      10 women are not screened or not often enough (nearly 7 millions women). It is therefore&#xD;
      necessary to develop new strategies to reach these women. The etiological factor of this&#xD;
      cancer is persistent infection with High-Risk Human PapillomaVirus (HR-HPV). Thereby,&#xD;
      HPV-based tests could be alternative screening tests. Vaginal self-sampling with HR-HPV test&#xD;
      is simpler and less intrusive than the pap smear. It has been shown that sending vaginal&#xD;
      self-sampling kit (with HPV test) to unscreened women's home is a powerful means to increase&#xD;
      the participation rate of cervical cancer screening. It seems interesting to explore methods&#xD;
      to increase the efficiency of this strategy by optimizing the ratio of the number of kits&#xD;
      used compared to the number of kits sent. Two approaches will be tested: a system &quot;available&#xD;
      on request&quot; of the kit and / or the addition of an SMS (Short Message Service) reminder.&#xD;
