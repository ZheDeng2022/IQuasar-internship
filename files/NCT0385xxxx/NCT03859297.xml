      This study will evaluate whether a newer treatment, rumination-focused cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      treatment, which includes mindfulness and can be used to reduce ruminative habits, change&#xD;
      ways in which key brain regions interact with each other (e.g.., often called connectivity),&#xD;
      and whether these changes in habits and brain connectivity can reduce the risk for recurrence&#xD;
      of depression in the next two years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a disease that has it's onset in childhood and early&#xD;
      adolescence for many. Treatments in adolescence tend to be acute and short-term.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, between half and three quarters of adolescents who have a first episode of MDD&#xD;
      will go to have a second episode within the next two years. Studies in adults suggest that&#xD;
      maintenance treatments or preventative treatments can lower these risks and delay or stop&#xD;
      recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will use a preventative strategy, rumination-focused CBT (RF-CBT) to delay&#xD;
      or stop the onset of another MD episode for at least two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first 2 years of the study, adolescents with a history of MDD who are currently well&#xD;
      will be randomly selected for either treatment with RF-CBT or just treatment as usual in the&#xD;
      first two years of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last 3 years of the study, these adolescents will be randomized to either RF-CBT or&#xD;
      Relaxation Therapy above and beyond TAU (Treatment as Usual). Brain, cognitive, and&#xD;
      self-report measurements are collected before during and after the intervention to evaluate&#xD;
      what brain and rumination changes occur, and which adolescents benefit the most from the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What will happen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Investigators determine if the child is eligible (see criteria below for 14-17 year&#xD;
           olds with history of MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Investigators complete pre-intervention assessments with the child that include&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. brain imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. tests of cognitive skills and emotion processing, including rumination&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. questionnaires about how the adolescent thinks and responds to situations, similar&#xD;
                questionnaires in at least one parent/guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. measurement of sleep using a handheld wristwatch (called an actigraph - optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. randomization (chance assignment) in years 1-2 to either rumination focused cognitive&#xD;
           behavioral therapy (RF-CBT) or assessment only for a 10-session intervention. Treatment&#xD;
           as usual continues for all adolescents. In years 3-5, chance assignment is to RF-CBT or&#xD;
           Relaxation Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. repeat assessments after the intervention period. The cognitive skills and emotion&#xD;
           processing are also assessed during the middle of the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>RRS is a scale developed by Dr. Susan Nolan-Hoeksema that is used to determine pre-post reductions in rumination after RF-CBT.&#xD;
The RRS is the Rumination Responsiveness Scale. Scores range from a low of 22 to a high of 88 on the 232 item scale. Higher scores indicate more difficulties with rumination. Higher rumination has been reported in a number of samples of both active and remitted MDD.&#xD;
The outcome is a reliable change index decline of at least 1/2 standard deviation in the RF-CBT group relative to the AO and RelaxT arms.&#xD;
In our preliminary study, the RRS declined from 52.88 to 43 (Jacobs et al., 2016). An age matched control group had a mean score of 30.4 (7.1), Burkhouse et al., 2016.</description>

    <description>RF-CBT targets rumination and other maladaptive forms of emotion regulation such as suppression and avoidance and provides skills training in effectively coping with rumination. RF-CBT specifically targets rumination through psychoeducation, adopting a functional analytic approach to the learned habitual behavior of rumination, and a focus on shifting process style. The adolescent is taught to notice triggers to ruminate as well as the consequences of rumination and to shift into practicing a more adaptive strategy such as an attention training exercise, behavioral activation, thinking in a concrete way, or active problem-solving. RF-CBT directly teaches adolescents to recognize rumination or &quot;when the participant gets stuck in their head&quot; and to notice the influence this has on their mood.</description>
