  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. The main risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is&#xD;
      cirrhosis of any etiology, with an annual risk between 1 and 6%, being currently the leading&#xD;
      cause of death in patients with cirrhosis and the third cause of death for cancer in the&#xD;
      world. In our country there is little information about the incidence of HCC in this&#xD;
      population. It has been shown that there is a change in the gut microbiome (set of genetic&#xD;
      material of microorganisms that make up the intestinal bacterial flora) as the severity of&#xD;
      the cirrhosis progresses. This change in the microbiome has been associated with clinical&#xD;
      decompensation events of cirrhosis. However, there are no previous studies in the world that&#xD;
      demonstrate an impact of the change of the microbiome in cirrhosis as a precursor to the&#xD;
      development of HCC. Our team has compared the profile of the microbiome in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis with and without HCC. We observed that patients with HCC present changes in the&#xD;
      phylum Firmicutes, genus Fusobacterium and change in the bacteroides / prevotella ratio. This&#xD;
      pattern was associated with a pro-inflammatory profile. In murine models, it has been&#xD;
      postulated that modulation of the gut microbiome through the use of probiotics could have a&#xD;
      clinical role in the prevention of HCC development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project aims to answer the following question: in patients with cirrhosis, does&#xD;
      the nutritional supplement with probiotics prevent HCC development? Objective: To compare the&#xD;
      incidence of HCC through intervention with probiotics in cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of probiotics in patients with&#xD;
      Child Pugh A-B cirrhosis at 3-year follow-up. Likewise, the type of microbiome found as a&#xD;
      predictor of the risk of HCC development will be evaluated. It will include 280 patients, 140&#xD;
      in each branch. Basal blood and stool samples will be obtained and every 6 months. The typing&#xD;
      and quantification of the microbiome in samples of fecal matter will be carried out by&#xD;
      amplifying a specific region (V3-V4) of the bacterial 16s rRNA gene. Likewise, the presence&#xD;
      of endotoxins (LPS) and cytokines (IL6, TNF alpha) in plasma will be determined to analyze&#xD;
      the immune environment and the expression of the TLR4 receptor in mononuclear cells.&#xD;

      Research question Does the modulation of gut microbiome with probiotics prevents the&#xD;
      development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis? The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      in patients with Child Pugh A-B cirrhosis with portal hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design. Phase III interventional, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study will be carried out following CONSORT guidelines. Scenario and&#xD;
      temporality. The study will be developed in Argentina including patient care centers with the&#xD;
      following inclusion and exclusion criteria, from April 1/2019 (recruitment phase of 12&#xD;
      months) until the last enrolled patient completes the follow-up of 3 years from&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. Test drug (s). Both probiotic and placebo will be presented in the same&#xD;
      container, shape and color.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name of the active substance Each 50 ml bottle contains Lactobacillus casei 3.3 x 107 CFU /&#xD;
      day, Lactobacillus plantarum 3.3 x 107 CFU / day, Streptococcus faecalis 3.3 x 107 CFU / day&#xD;
      and Bifidobacterium brevis 1.0 x 106 CFU / day (BIOFLORA®, BIOSIDUS SA, Argentina) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration way: Oral 5 ml orally every 12 hours for 10 consecutive days per month.&#xD;
      Duration of treatment: 2 cycles of continuous treatment per year during a 3-year period (6&#xD;
      cycles). Each cycle includes three months of treatment, followed by an off period of three&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference intervention. Name of the active substance: Placebo. Administration way: Oral 5 ml&#xD;
      orally every 12 hours for 10 consecutive days per month. Duration of treatment: 2 cycles of&#xD;
      continuous treatment per year during a 3-year period (6 cycles). Each cycle includes three&#xD;
      months of treatment, followed by an off period of three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Likewise, both arms will explicitly request the non-consumption of alcohol and the&#xD;
      consumption of a non-hypercaloric Mediterranean diet throughout the study for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. Patients who meet the aforementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria, and have&#xD;
      successfully completed all screening tests, will be treated with the standard test or&#xD;
      treatment medication according to clinical practice guidelines through a 1: 1 randomization&#xD;
      scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be in stratified in blocks according to previously identified&#xD;
      prognostic variables and in order to avoid potential confounding variables and or effect&#xD;
      modifiers distributed by chance in an unbalanced way: Child Pugh score B and platelet count&#xD;
      &lt;100,000/mm3. The randomization will be carried out according to the assignment by means of&#xD;
      numbers previously made by a blinded researcher and independent from clinical characteristics&#xD;
      and contact with the patients. All numbers of the randomization will be stored in closed&#xD;
      opaque envelopes and will be assigned consecutively according to the order of inclusion in&#xD;
      the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *All the events developed, both primary and secondary throughout the study, will be evaluated&#xD;
      by a blinded and independent committee from baseline variables and randomization allocation.&#xD;
      Clinical events will be monitored and re-evaluated by this committee, which will consist of 3&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral blood samples for the measurement of cytokines, LPS and expression of TLR 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cytokines: The measurement of cytokines will be made from plasma of peripheral&#xD;
                blood samples. The levels of the following cytokines will be quantified in pg/ml:&#xD;
                IL-6, TNF-α and endotoxemia or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The operators of&#xD;
                this measurement will be blinded to any clinical, microbiome and treatment&#xD;
                allocation. Samples to be obtained from each individual: two 10ml tubes of whole&#xD;
                blood, one with EDTA (sodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate) and another without&#xD;
                anticoagulant, to be used in routine laboratory studies and in the measurement of&#xD;
                cytokines (IL6 and TNF alpha) and endotoxins (LPS). Quantification of plasma&#xD;
                cytokines: Commercial reagents of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be&#xD;
                used to measure the levels of cytokines present in the plasmas of patients. The&#xD;
                concentrations of TNF alpha and IL-6 will be measured with commercial reagents of&#xD;
                eBioscience, affymetrix, or a similar commercial reagent available in the market,&#xD;
                strictly following the instructions of the respective manufacturers. For the&#xD;
                quantification of the cytokines, the curves will be made with the corresponding&#xD;
                concentration standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quantification of endotoxins in plasma or serum: Measurement of bacterial LPS will&#xD;
                be performed by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Assay (LAL), Biosafe Srl chromogenic&#xD;
                endpoint reagent or similar, in parallel with the concentration curve of the&#xD;
                standards. The manufacturer's instructions will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Expression of TLR 4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells: the expression of TLR 4&#xD;
                in mononuclear cells will be quantified by real-time PCR technique, using specific&#xD;
                primers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stool samples for gut microbiome evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Method of Collection: A sample of spontaneous fecal stool will be collected at&#xD;
                     any time of the day in a supplied manifold avoiding contact with&#xD;
                     lavatory/odorless materials. Once the sample is collected, the appropriately&#xD;
                     capped collector will be placed inside a safety bag and inside a kit box.&#xD;
                     These samples will be stored frozen at -70º. Each fecal sample must be&#xD;
                     properly labeled. Later, samples will be aliquoted for final processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Analysis: Fecal stools will be collected to analyze the gut microbiome using&#xD;
                     the PCR technique, Ilumina, analyzing the V3-V4 regions of 16sRNA at the&#xD;
                     biotechnology Institute of Rosario (INDEAR, Rosario, Argentina). The 16S&#xD;
                     ribosomal subunit of rRNA will be analyzed bacterial, amplifying using PCR&#xD;
                     method (20 cycles) and then a second round of amplification to incorporate&#xD;
                     multiplex adapters (Barcodes) (10 cycles). In each procedure, two measurements&#xD;
                     will be made to avoid amplification information biases. The massive sequencing&#xD;
                     will be carried out on an illumina MiSeq team from HERITAS institute (CIBIC +&#xD;
                     INDEAR) in 2x300 mode to finally obtain a minimum of 40,000 sequences per&#xD;
                     individual. The quality of the raw data will be evaluated by FastQC and the&#xD;
                     information of pair-ends of Illumina will be combined using PEAR (v0.9.10).&#xD;
                     The readings are then filtered by Q30 quality and the duplicates and PCR&#xD;
                     chimeras are eliminated using UCHIME. The filtered sequences will be clustered&#xD;
                     in Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at 97% similarity with their own&#xD;
                     strategy implemented in QIIME (v1.91). The operators of this measurement will&#xD;
                     be blind to the clinical, microbiome, and primary event variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following measurements will be performed every 6 months in each subject enrolled&#xD;
           until the end of the study or development of the primary event: weight and height,&#xD;
           concomitant medication, complete physical examination, laboratory tests, Child Pugh&#xD;
           score, abdominal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Longitudinal sampling of gut microbiome and cytokines. A second cytokine measurement&#xD;
           will be made from serum from peripheral blood and gut microbiome samples in fecal&#xD;
           samples in all patients included in the study at the end of the first treatment cycle&#xD;
           (3rd month since randomization or 12 weeks) and at the end of the study (last cycle)&#xD;
           using the same methodology described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence and Follow-up: All the patients will continue in the protocol until the development&#xD;
      of the primary event or until the end of it, having completed a post-randomization follow-up&#xD;
      of 3 years. Several measures will be carried out to reinforce adherence to treatment in both&#xD;
      arms and strategies to avoid loss of follow-up. Adherence to treatment compliance will be&#xD;
      defined in 80% of the tablets delivered for both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation and statistical analysis: A two-tailed statistical value will be&#xD;
      taken, α or type I error of 5% (p value &lt;0.05) and a power or error type II or β of 0.20&#xD;
      (power of 80%). The risk of HCC in each arm will be compared using Cox regression analysis&#xD;
      with Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals and the number needed to treat to&#xD;
      prevent a clinical outcome will be calculated, done according to the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle. Since the cumulative incidence of HCC from previous data from the literature is&#xD;
      1-6% per year, a relative risk reduction of HCC development during a 3-year period in the&#xD;
      intervention arm was estimated to be clinically relevant with a 30% relative difference,&#xD;
      equivalent to a HR of 0.7. For each arm, a sample size of 140 subjects, with a total&#xD;
      population to enroll of 280 patients, estimated number of primary events in 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyzes will be carried out using STATA version 14.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of microbiome metadata. The bioinformatic analysis of the data will be done using a&#xD;
      customized QIIME pipeline. For the estimation of differential abundance between the groups we&#xD;
      use the DESeq2 package.&#xD;
