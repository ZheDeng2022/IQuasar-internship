  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to develop an assessment protocol that can be used to study&#xD;
      the effect of different intensities of exercise on executive functions (EF: attention,&#xD;
      working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility). It has been shown that exercise has&#xD;
      the potential to improve the development of EF in healthy and special needs children.&#xD;
      However, many exercise interventions in the literature lack rigorous control of critical&#xD;
      components, such as intensity, making it difficult to draw conclusions about what type and&#xD;
      how much exercise might be most beneficial for EF. In addition, to date, no studies have been&#xD;
      able to demonstrate the engagement of EF during exercise. This study will focus on developing&#xD;
      an assay that measures important self-regulation or EF sub-processes (e.g., attention and&#xD;
      inhibitory control) as well as examining engagement of these targets during different&#xD;
      exercise intensities. Participants will exercise in different intensities on a cycle&#xD;
      ergometer and perform cognitive assessments before, during, and after exercise to evaluate&#xD;
      EF. This research will allow us to develop an assessment protocol that can be used in future&#xD;
      research to understand the underlying mechanisms underpinning the effects of exercise on EF.&#xD;

      Self-regulation, self-control, and executive functioning are umbrella constructs that&#xD;
      encompass processes involved in exerting control over cognitive and behavioral processes.&#xD;
      Self-regulation was described as an ability reflecting mature cognition: Mature cognition is&#xD;
      characterized by abilities that include being able: (a) to hold information in mind,&#xD;
      including complicated representational structures, to mentally manipulate that information&#xD;
      and to act on the basis of it, (b) to act on the basis of choice rather than impulse,&#xD;
      exercising self-control (or self-regulation) by resisting inappropriate behaviors and&#xD;
      responding appropriately, and (c) to quickly and flexibly adapt behavior to changing&#xD;
      situations. These abilities are referred to respectively as working memory, inhibition, and&#xD;
      cognitive flexibility. Together they are key components of both &quot;cognitive control&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;executive functionsâ€¦&quot; Some researchers have proposed an integrative framework of&#xD;
      self-regulation than encompasses executive functions and self-control. Thus, in this&#xD;
      proposal, we have adopted such an integrative framework whereby self-regulation encompasses&#xD;
      executive functions, self-control, and other sub-processes. As noted in the specific aims,&#xD;
      our meta-analysis and narrative review examining the impact of 28 physical activity (PA) and&#xD;
      exercise interventions on EF outcomes in healthy children reported that the targets often&#xD;
      shown to improve after exercise were attention, working memory, inhibition, and cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility, and preliminary research suggests the strongest effects are on attention and&#xD;
      inhibition. The goal of this project is to develop an assay to examine engagement of&#xD;
      attention and inhibitory control across several rigorously controlled exercise conditions.&#xD;
      This proposal is built on an integrative framework whereby self-regulation encompasses&#xD;
      executive functions (EF), self-control, and other sub-processes. Although there is a growing&#xD;
      awareness of the benefits of exercise on self-regulatory processes in children including EF,&#xD;
      there are still many critical gaps in the research. A recent publication which is a&#xD;
      meta-analysis and narrative review examining the impact of 28 physical activity and exercise&#xD;
      interventions on EF outcomes in healthy children that highlights some of these gaps. Although&#xD;
      earlier results showed that interventions had a significant, small to moderate positive&#xD;
      effect on EF, the effects varied widely across studies. This research informed this&#xD;
      application in several ways. First, no study demonstrated how or why the interventions&#xD;
      improved EF outcomes. Additionally, the behavioral assays or measures varied widely targeting&#xD;
      numerous components of EF. The EF targets most often shown to improve after exercise were&#xD;
      attention, working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility (each improved in at least&#xD;
      five of the included studies). These findings are consistent with recent work at the UC&#xD;
      Irvine Pediatric Exercise and Genomics Research Center (PERC); in studies with healthy&#xD;
      children and children with special needs, improvements were found after exercise in all four&#xD;
      components. Few, if any, studies have been able to demonstrate empirically why participants&#xD;
      exhibit improvements in EF after exercise, and studies have not yet demonstrated engagement&#xD;
      of EF during exercise. Thus, there is a need to understand why exercise seems to improve&#xD;
      these targets. However, the tools used in exercise research to date are limited. Many have&#xD;
      been adopted from developmental or educational research, rather than developed specifically&#xD;
      to test targets in exercise research; our search yielded only one published measure of&#xD;
      self-regulation (cognitive, affective, and motor self-regulation) that has been administered&#xD;
      during physical activity. This proposal begins to address these gaps in the literature, by&#xD;
      focusing on the development of an assay for important EF targets are improved through&#xD;
      exercise and by testing engagement of these targets during exercise of varying intensity&#xD;
