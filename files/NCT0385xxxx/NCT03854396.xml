  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are bothersome and more likely to occur in postmenopausal&#xD;
      women. Frequent UTIs, as well as other problems with the urinary and genital systems such as&#xD;
      painful sex and urinary frequency/urgency, are part of a symptom complex called genitourinary&#xD;
      syndrome of menopause (GSM). Prasterone (Intrarosa®) is a man-made steroid that helps with&#xD;
      painful sex in postmenopausal women. Because previous studies have shown prasterone to help&#xD;
      with other GSM problems, this study was designed to investigate if prasterone used in the&#xD;
      vagina decreases the number of UTIs in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are costly contributing to more than 8 million ambulatory&#xD;
      visits (84% women) in the United States in 2007. Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs)&#xD;
      are UTIs diagnosed on at least 2 urine cultures in 6 months, or at least 3 in 1 year. The&#xD;
      incidence of rUTIs increases in menopause with an estimated 10-15% of women &gt; 60 years old&#xD;
      having rUTIs. rUTIs contribute to a constellation of bothersome genitourinary symptoms in&#xD;
      some postmenopausal women called genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Thus, menopause,&#xD;
      rUTIs, and GSM are intimately linked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prasterone (Intrarosa®) is a synthetic version of the steroid, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),&#xD;
      approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2016 for the treatment of moderate to&#xD;
      severe dyspareunia due to GSM. Large, prospective studies have shown prasterone to safely&#xD;
      decrease vaginal pH, decrease parabasal cells, increase superficial cells, and decrease&#xD;
      symptoms related to atrophy like dyspareunia in women with GSM. Given prasterone's favorable&#xD;
      treatment effects on some GSM symptoms, investigation of prasterone as a possible treatment&#xD;
      option for rUTIs in the setting of GSM is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial comparing the&#xD;
      efficacy of nightly intravaginal prasterone for 24 weeks to intravaginal placebo in&#xD;
      decreasing rUTIs in women with GSM. The study hypothesis is that intravaginal prasterone&#xD;
      decreases UTI incidence in women with GSM compared to placebo.&#xD;
