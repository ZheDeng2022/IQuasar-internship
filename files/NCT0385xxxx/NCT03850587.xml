    <measure>100mm Pain VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1,4,8,12 weeks after randomization after administration of YYC301(Experimental drug).</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects who have severe pain at one-or both sided knee osteoarthritis directly assess the degree of pain (within 24 hours) with a straight line which has 0mm to 100mm. 0 mm means 'doesn't have pain' and 100 mm means 'maximum pain who can imagine'.In order to investigate the degree of subject's pain change from administration of YYC301(Experimental drug).</description>

    <measure>KOOS(Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4,8,12 weeks after randomization after administration of YYC301(Experimental drug).</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS survey is consisted of total 42 questions at 5 groups. 7 questions about symptoms, 9 questions about pain, 17 questions about Function in daily,5 questions about function in sport and recreation(sport/Rec), 4 questions about the knee related quality of life(QoL). Subjects who are participated in this clinical trial, they directly assess these survey with 5 point Likert scale(0~4, 0 means 'nothing' and 4 means 'most severe') and KOOS results are converted to WOMAC score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Assessment(PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4,8,12 weeks after randomization after administration of YYC301(Experimental drug).</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects who have been admistrated YYC301 have to directly perform the patient global assessment with 5 point Likert Scale. It has 0 to 5 scales. 0 means 'very poor' and 5 means' very good' In order to investigate the Patient Global point assessment at specific weeks.</description>
