      planned indication for use within the United States for LUMINIZE RF Balloon Catheter System&#xD;
      is for the treatment of drug refractory, recurrent, symptomatic, Paroxysmal Atrial&#xD;
      Fibrillation (PAF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects fitting the enrollment criteria, signing the consent and undergoing the index&#xD;
      procedure with the study devices will be followed up for one year.&#xD;
