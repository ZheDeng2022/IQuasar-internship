        The selection of sites and investigators will be made with the aim to achieve&#xD;
        representativeness in the way asthma is managed in each participating country. The study&#xD;
        will include patients from either primary care centres, or specialist centres involved in&#xD;
        the management of asthma, or a mix of both within a country to ensure representativeness.&#xD;
