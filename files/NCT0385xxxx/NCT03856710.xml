  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal (groin) hernias are common and occur when an internal part of the body pushes&#xD;
      through a weakness in the surrounding tissue wall of the groin. They are more likely to occur&#xD;
      in men and affect people's quality of life by causing pain that is worse after any strenuous&#xD;
      activity. If untreated they can cause serious problems such as strangulation when too much&#xD;
      bowel comes through the weakness and becomes squeezed with the risk of losing blood supply&#xD;
      requiring emergency surgery. To prevent such complications, elective surgery for symptomatic&#xD;
      inguinal hernias is undertaken either in the conventional open method which involves a cut in&#xD;
      the groin, or the keyhole surgery, when the surgery is undertaken via three small incisions&#xD;
      in the abdomen (instead of a single, larger groin incision), a thin tube containing a light&#xD;
      source and a camera (laparoscope) is inserted through one of these incisions, so the surgeon&#xD;
      can see inside the abdomen. Special surgical instruments are inserted through the other&#xD;
      incisions, so the surgeon can pull or push the hernia back into place and a piece of mesh is&#xD;
      then stapled or glued to secure it to the weakened area in the abdomen wall. Securing the&#xD;
      mesh with staple has been associated with increased post-operative pain and analgesia&#xD;
      requirement; whereas not doing so has been thought to increase the chances of recurrence-&#xD;
      more so in large sized weakness. A newer mesh appears to offer benefit over conventional&#xD;
      meshes as it grips the tissues around the weakness without requiring staples or glue to fix&#xD;
      it in place, and has shown to cause lesser post-operative pain and recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is going to compare the newer self-gripping mesh with the conventional mesh&#xD;
      requiring fixation to see which is best for patients undergoing keyhole repair to fix&#xD;
      inguinal hernias.&#xD;

      Design: Double Blinded Randomised Controlled Trial This is a multicentre randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial in the setting of two district general teaching hospitals serving an&#xD;
      aggregate population of over 750 000. There are already established general surgical clinics&#xD;
      and operating sessions available for and including study patients. Both units undertake&#xD;
      conventional open and laparoscopic treatments for inguinal hernias on a regular basis in&#xD;
      keeping with the national average numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology; Patients with symptomatic unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernias diagnosed&#xD;
      clinically &amp;/or radiologically will be identified at general surgical clinics and the primary&#xD;
      investigator, will arrange the following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess inclusion / exclusion criteria for participation in study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed written consent for participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline clinical severity and quality of life analysis using:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Euroqol (EQ5D)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Core Outcome Measures Index adapted for patients with hernia (COMI-hernia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed written consent for intervention (the patient will be blinded as to the&#xD;
           intervention group) Subjects; Patients will be identified during attendance to our&#xD;
           general surgical clinics. Patients will be clearly informed that participation in the&#xD;
           study is entirely voluntary and that refusal to participate will in no way disadvantage&#xD;
           them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (within 3 months of randomization);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-assess inclusion / exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ensure informed written consent for surgery / participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention; The initial laparoscopic approach will be the same for both groups until&#xD;
           the process of selection and placement of the mesh (ProGripTM self-gripping mesh versus&#xD;
           standard 'lightweight' (large pore) polypropylene mesh fixed with SecurestrapTM) which&#xD;
           would be decided by randomization by sealed envelope into one of the 2 intervention&#xD;
           groups: Group 1 (Self-gripping Mesh), Group 2 (Stapled Mesh). The surgeon will have a&#xD;
           choice of Transabdominal Preperitoneal (TAPP) or Total Extraperitoneal (TEP) to perform&#xD;
           the laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Both TAPP and TEP are standard laparoscopic&#xD;
           techniques used for treatment of inguinal hernias both within the National Health&#xD;
           Service (NHS) and across the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Care Since most laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs are performed as day&#xD;
      cases, patients may be discharged on the same day of surgery after recovery with simple&#xD;
      analgesia. Diet can be resumed immediately and the convalescent period is expected to be 1-2&#xD;
      days with routine activities expected to resume at 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding precautions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be unaware of the type of mesh received as the randomisation process will be&#xD;
      carried out intraoperatively when the patient is under general anaesthesia. Subsequently,&#xD;
      over the follow-up period every possible effort will be made to continue the blinding process&#xD;
      in order to minimise any bias in patient reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time taken for procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission / 30-day readmission rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure-specific complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Direct (marginal) costs Post-operative assessments Performed at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
           months and 12 months (by Surgical Registrar blinded to the intervention received by the&#xD;
           patient). 1 Week and 3 month follow-up will be over telephone (with a view to review&#xD;
           patient in the Hospital, should any concerns be expressed or elicited from the patient);&#xD;
           6 weeks and 12 month follow-up will be face-to-face in an out-patient clinic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each assessment the following will be analysed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain - recorded prospectively in a diary by the patient independently. Recorded daily&#xD;
           for the first week on an un-marked 100mm long scale, from absolutely no pain to the&#xD;
           worst imaginable pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analgesia requirements - recorded daily for the first week in a diary by the patient&#xD;
           independently&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Extent of ecchymosis, seroma/haematoma - The registrar will assess for any signs of&#xD;
           ecchymosis, seroma or haematoma and measure the magnitude of surface area(s) affected at&#xD;
           6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Time to return to work and normal activities - reported by the patient. (Post-op all&#xD;
           patients will be advised to mobilise and return to normal activities as soon as they&#xD;
           feel able)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Procedure-specific complications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Clinical efficacy and effectiveness; using&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Euroqol (EQ5D)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Core Outcome Measures Index adapted for patients with hernia (COMI-hernia)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient satisfaction rating scales&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Cost effectiveness and cost benefit; using&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Direct costs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Indirect costs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Willingness to pay data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life and economic analysis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generic Euroqol (EQ5D) instrument&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Core Outcome Measures Index adapted for patients with hernia (COMI-hernia) The&#xD;
           combination of these generic EQ5D and disease specific COMI-hernia tools are thus&#xD;
           sensitive to assess &amp; compare both multidimensional and cost-effectiveness outcomes in&#xD;
           patients undergoing surgical treatment for inguinal hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure-specific complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction rating scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost effectiveness analysis; will be analysed in terms of&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cost / symptom-free patient&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cost / QALY (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) calculated from the EQ5D and COMI-hernia&#xD;
                indices Direct hospital costs will be collected prospectively with the help of the&#xD;
                hospital finance department; whilst indirect patient cost data (income loss,&#xD;
                domestic support etc.) will be assessed and calculated at interview at 3 and 12&#xD;
                months. Direct &amp; indirect costs will provide total costs for use in the cost/QALY&#xD;
                calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost benefit analysis; outcomes, expressed as monetary units assessed by direct&#xD;
           willingness to pay (WTP) questioning, at 3 and 12 months will be used for cost benefit&#xD;
           analysis e.g. cost / £ willing to pay and cost / percent of weekly income willing to&#xD;
           pay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and analysis Data will be collected and entered onto a specifically designed&#xD;
      Microsoft Access database Data distribution will be studied and analysed appropriately.&#xD;
      Intergroup analysis will be performed using Mann-Whitney U test and intragroup analysis will&#xD;
      be performed using the Friedman test across time points and Wilcoxon's ranked sum test&#xD;
      between two time points. Regression techniques and multivariate analysis will then be&#xD;
      utilised for a more thorough interrogation of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the economic analysis, the incremental cost per QALY of the intervention will be&#xD;
      assessed. This follows the example of National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) who&#xD;
      use a threshold of £20 000 to £30 000 per QALY gained. However, cost-effectiveness analysis&#xD;
      is conducted under conditions of uncertainty. Cost effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs)&#xD;
      will be generated to demonstrate the uncertainty around the decision. Given the data&#xD;
      available within the model, the CEAC will plot the probability of one strategy being more&#xD;
      cost-effective than the others for a range of threshold values of an additional QALY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be carried out after recruitment of 25 patients per group. The goal&#xD;
      of this analysis is to evaluate recruitment rates, adverse events and serious adverse events&#xD;
      if any, as well as the overall viability and conduct of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reported rates of moderate to severe chronic groin pain affecting QoL after elective&#xD;
      hernia repair ranges between 0 to 36%8-11. The variation is also attributed to the&#xD;
      inconsistencies in the definition of chronic pain. Investigators have taken the chronic pain&#xD;
      rates from one of the larger reported series (Garg et al 200937) to calculate the sample size&#xD;
      as their rates may be similar to the predicted chronic pain rates when fixing moderate to&#xD;
      large sized defects with permanent fixation devices. The sample size of 47 per group&#xD;
      (allowing for a dropout rate of 15%) will therefore be a pragmatic number to achieve&#xD;
      recruitment, follow-up and completion of the trial within the anticipated time period.&#xD;
      However the sample size derived from the meta-analysis (Sajid et al 201338) will be&#xD;
      considered for a future multi-centre trial that is planned by investigators' group based on&#xD;
      the outcomes from this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be given adequate time to read the patient information sheet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No undue pressure will be exerted on any individual to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient consent form will be signed by the patient and the researcher, only when&#xD;
           both are happy that the patient has understood the information sheet and is willing to&#xD;
           give informed written consent to participate in the study, and that the patient&#xD;
           understands that it is their right to withdraw from the trial at any time without&#xD;
           prejudice to their future treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project milestones Based upon the average number of patients seen in general surgical clinics&#xD;
      with symptomatic inguinal hernias requiring surgical intervention, we envision recruitment&#xD;
      taking 6-8 months across both sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking an average waiting time of 3 months from clinic appointment to date of operation, most&#xD;
      patients in the trial should have their planned intervention by 9-12 months from start of&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the key outcomes will be collected within 6 weeks post procedure. The most important&#xD;
      outcomes of chronic pain and early recurrence will be evaluated at 3, 12 month follow-up post&#xD;
      procedure, hence taking between 18-24 months for completion of trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect sizes used for sample size calculation were conservative and the true required&#xD;
      sample may be lower. An interim analysis will be performed after recruitment of 25 patients&#xD;
      per group. This data will help to guide the requirement for further recruitment and establish&#xD;
      if intergroup differences are larger than expected. It may be possible to curtail recruitment&#xD;
      with a lower sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Profile It is not likely that there should be any reason to stop this trial prematurely,&#xD;
      as the interventions in question are currently in regular clinical practice both in the NHS&#xD;
      and worldwide without any added risks reported by the manufacturers or in the scientific&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention; Both treatment techniques of laparoscopic fixation of mesh with stapling device&#xD;
      and use of self-gripping mesh not requiring fixation are used already for treatment of&#xD;
      inguinal hernias, both within the NHS and across the world. They have been shown to be safe&#xD;
      and effective, with no more increase in complications. Treatment related risks will be&#xD;
      covered by NHS indemnity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications are classed as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-specific: Acute post-operative pain, infection, haematoma, recurrence, port site hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific complications: Chronic post-operative pain, shrinkage; dislocation; migration;&#xD;
      erosion of mesh All procedures will be planned and performed by Consultant Surgeons skilled&#xD;
      and experienced in the performance of laparoscopic inguinal hernia mesh repair. Complications&#xD;
      and adverse events will be reported to the Principal Investigator and each incidence&#xD;
      individually investigated. Any concerns over outcomes will be discussed with all of the&#xD;
      co-investigators and clinicians involved in the trial. Any safety concerns will result in&#xD;
      suspension of the trial pending further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Process; All of the trial outcomes are non-invasive and offer no significant risk to&#xD;
      patients; in fact the enhanced follow-up will allow closer monitoring of patients for&#xD;
      procedure or product related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will have given their informed consent, prior to taking part in this study.&#xD;
      All participant details will be number coded and kept securely. Participants are unlikely to&#xD;
      be identified from digital images, which will be numbered to ensure anonymity and archived&#xD;
      securely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim is to observe and compare outcomes in patients undergoing standardised,&#xD;
      established treatment protocols currently in wide utilisation, with no deviation from&#xD;
      standard practice. As such investigators do not envisage patients being placed at undue risk.&#xD;
