  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects and safety of OPS-2071 (150, 300, or 600&#xD;
      mg twice a day [BID]) versus placebo, as add-on therapy in participants with Crohn's disease&#xD;
      who show symptoms of active inflammation despite being on ongoing treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OPS-2071 is a novel agent that is currently being developed for the treatment of Crohn's&#xD;
      disease and was previously investigated for the treatment of enteric infection, including&#xD;
      those caused by Clostridium difficile. OPS-2071 belongs to the fluoroquinolone family of&#xD;
      compounds and has shown anti-inflammatory and potent antibacterial activity in in vitro and&#xD;
      in vivo assays. OPS-2071 is anticipated to be effective in the treatment of Crohn's disease&#xD;
      due to its unique mode of action. In vitro investigations of OPS-2071 showed a dual mechanism&#xD;
      of action, including a potent, broad spectrum antibacterial effect and a strong&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect that translated into significant attenuation of numerous cytokines,&#xD;
      including TNF-alpha (TNF-Î±) screening.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Remission Based on Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission was defined as CDAI score &lt;150 at Week 12. The CDAI evaluated severity of signs and symptoms of Chron's Disease. Some components of the CDAI were reported by the investigator (physical examination for the presence of an abdominal mass and extraintestinal complications, laboratory results for hematocrit levels, and weight) while other components were determined with data collected in a participant diary (number of liquid or soft stools, number of antidiarrheal medications, abdominal pain score, and general well-being). The index values of 150 and below were associated with quiescent disease; values above that indicated active disease, values &gt;=220 indicated moderate to severe disease, and values above 450 were seen with extremely severe disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Endoscopic Response Based on Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic response was defined as a reduction of the SES-CD by at least 50%, at Week 12. The SES-CD is a total score that indicates endoscopic disease activity status based on endoscopy results regarding the size of ulcers, surface ulceration, affected surface size, and presence of luminal narrowing. Each item is scored from 0-3, with total score from 0-60 . Higher score indicates more severe endoscopic activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the SES-CD Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SES-CD is a total score that indicates endoscopic disease activity status based on endoscopy results regarding the size of ulcers, surface ulceration, affected surface size, and presence of luminal narrowing. Each item is scored from 0-3, with a total score from 0-60. A higher score indicates more severe endoscopic activity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Two-item Participant Reported Outcome (PRO-2) Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PRO-2 remission was defined as stool frequency =&lt; 3 times per day and abdominal pain =&lt; 1 at Week 12. The PRO-2 is a symptom control measure based on 2 participant-reported components (stool frequency and abdominal pain) of the CDAI (on an 11-point scale where 0=no pain to 10=worst imaginable pain). A weekly score was calculated for the liquid or soft stool frequency and a separate weekly score was calculated for abdominal pain, in each case based on daily symptom reporting. PRO2 is a composite index consisting of weighted scoring of both variables. PRO2 scores ranges from 0 to approximately 45, higher score indicates higher disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Response Based on CDAI Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was defined as at least a 25% decrease in the CDAI score at Week 12. The CDAI evaluated the severity of signs and symptoms of Chron's Disease. Some components of the CDAI were reported by the investigator (physical examination for the presence of an abdominal mass and extraintestinal complications, laboratory results for hematocrit levels, and weight) while other components were determined with data collected in a participant diary (number of liquid or soft stools, number of antidiarrheal medications, abdominal pain score, and general well-being). The index values of 150 and below were associated with quiescent disease; values above that indicated active disease, values &gt;=220 indicated moderate to severe disease, and values above 450 were seen with extremely severe disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Endoscopic Remission Based on SES-CD</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic remission was defined as an SES-CD total score of 0 to 2; or a score of 0 to 4, with no individual subscore greater than 1 at Week 12. The SES-CD is a total score that indicates endoscopic disease activity status based on endoscopy results regarding the size of ulcers, surface ulceration, affected surface size, and presence of luminal narrowing. Each item is scored from 0-3, with a total score from 0-60. A higher score indicates more severe endoscopic activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Decrease in the CDAI Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who had a decrease of at least =&gt; 100 points in CDAI scores were to be reported. The CDAI evaluated the severity of signs and symptoms of Chron's Disease. Some components of the CDAI were reported by the investigator (physical examination for the presence of an abdominal mass and extraintestinal complications, laboratory results for hematocrit levels, and weight) while other components were determined with data collected in a participant diary (number of liquid or soft stools, number of antidiarrheal medications, abdominal pain score, and general well-being). The index values of 150 and below were associated with quiescent disease; values above that indicated active disease, values &gt;=220 indicated moderate to severe disease, and values above 450 were seen with extremely severe disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least One Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the signing of the informed consent form up to early termination (up to approximately 9 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An SAE is defined as any fatal; life-threatening; persistently or significantly disabling or incapacitating; required in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization; a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or other medically significant event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may have jeopardized the subject and may have required medical or surgical intervention. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurred after the administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP).</description>

        <description>Clinical remission was defined as CDAI score &lt;150 at Week 12. The CDAI evaluated severity of signs and symptoms of Chron's Disease. Some components of the CDAI were reported by the investigator (physical examination for the presence of an abdominal mass and extraintestinal complications, laboratory results for hematocrit levels, and weight) while other components were determined with data collected in a participant diary (number of liquid or soft stools, number of antidiarrheal medications, abdominal pain score, and general well-being). The index values of 150 and below were associated with quiescent disease; values above that indicated active disease, values &gt;=220 indicated moderate to severe disease, and values above 450 were seen with extremely severe disease.</description>

        <description>PRO-2 remission was defined as stool frequency =&lt; 3 times per day and abdominal pain =&lt; 1 at Week 12. The PRO-2 is a symptom control measure based on 2 participant-reported components (stool frequency and abdominal pain) of the CDAI (on an 11-point scale where 0=no pain to 10=worst imaginable pain). A weekly score was calculated for the liquid or soft stool frequency and a separate weekly score was calculated for abdominal pain, in each case based on daily symptom reporting. PRO2 is a composite index consisting of weighted scoring of both variables. PRO2 scores ranges from 0 to approximately 45, higher score indicates higher disease activity.</description>

Some components of the CDAI were reported by the investigator (physical examination for the presence of an abdominal mass and extraintestinal complications, laboratory results for hematocrit levels, and weight) while other components were determined with data collected in a participant diary (number of liquid or soft stools, number of antidiarrheal medications, abdominal pain score, and general well-being). The index values of 150 and below were associated with quiescent disease; values above that indicated active disease, values &gt;=220 indicated moderate to severe disease, and values above 450 were seen with extremely severe disease.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An SAE is defined as any fatal; life-threatening; persistently or significantly disabling or incapacitating; required in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization; a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or other medically significant event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may have jeopardized the subject and may have required medical or surgical intervention. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurred after the administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP).</description>
