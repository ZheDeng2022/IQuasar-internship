    <textblock>
      The primary outcome of the Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) program at St Joseph's Hospital is&#xD;
      change in performance on an exercise stress test. Patients complete an exercise stress test&#xD;
      when they enter and exit the CR program. An improvement in stress test performance reflects&#xD;
      an improvement in physical fitness, but is also associated with better long-term health&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g. reducing the chance of having to go back to hospitalÍ¾ lower likelihood of&#xD;
      dying). While physical fitness has the strongest impact on stress test performance, other&#xD;
      factors can also affect the test result. We expect that informing patients about their&#xD;
      baseline stress test result will improve their exit treadmill performance. This intervention&#xD;
      may be a simple and cost-effective method of increasing motivation among patients to do their&#xD;
      best on the exit test&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a class 1 or &quot;strong&quot; recommendation in contemporary clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass grafting (CABG) after a myocardial infarction (MI)[1-6]. The CR program at St.&#xD;
      Joseph's Hospital is a 6 month intensive program focusing on education, exercise and&#xD;
      lifestyle changes [7, 8] with the goal of helping the patient improve their functional&#xD;
      capacity. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society has set a benchmark of a 0.5 MET increase in&#xD;
      functional capacity as one of 5 Quality Indicators (QIs) of CR programs [7, 8]. Quality&#xD;
      indicators seek to quantify the quality of CR in a well-defined and evidence based manner. To&#xD;
      measure the improvement in functional capacity, CR participants complete an exercise stress&#xD;
      test at intake to and exit from the CR program. The improvement on this test is one of the&#xD;
      main outcomes of a CR program while illustrating the impact of the CR program on the&#xD;
      individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance on the exercise stress test can be used to predict coronary heart disease and&#xD;
      all-cause mortality risk levels in patients [9]. Patients with higher aerobic fitness have a&#xD;
      favourable cardiovascular risk factor profile [9]. Obtaining an accurate measure of the&#xD;
      patient's fitness levels during the exit stress test is essential to creating an appropriate&#xD;
      future care plan. In order to optimize results on the exit stress test, the other&#xD;
      contributing factors to performance must be optimized as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past studies suggest that patients may exercise at a lower metabolic intensity without&#xD;
      feedback [10]. This result shows the potential increase in performance on the exercise stress&#xD;
      test if patients are given feedback. Given that participant feedback, knowledge of results&#xD;
      and motivation can all have an effect on performance, we are interested to see if providing&#xD;
      additional information to our patients about their performance on their previous (intake)&#xD;
      stress test will have an impact on their performance at the exit test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient learns about their previous performance, they will be better informed of&#xD;
      their capacity and should be inclined to improve results at their exit test. If the other&#xD;
      contributing factors surrounding one's performance on the treadmill are optimized, the&#xD;
      cardiac care team will have a better understanding of the patient's true fitness. This will&#xD;
      help the team propose an accurate plan for the future direction of the patient's care&#xD;
