  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial with 6-month intervention period and&#xD;
      follow-up at 6, 12 and 24 months among blue-color workers of Nokia City with reduced work&#xD;
      ability and high number of musculoskeletal problems. The participants (n=190) will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to intervention-arm providing face-to-face Personalized Exercise Counseling&#xD;
      combined with interactive accelerometer (PEC-arm) or a non-intervention Control-arm. The&#xD;
      study aims at improving workability (main outcome) and reducing musculoskeletal pain by&#xD;
      counseling and motivating the workers to increase physical activity and exercise according to&#xD;
      self-selected modes. Exercise instructors of Nokia City are responsible for providing the&#xD;
      face-to-face part of PEC. The Urho Kaleva Kekkonen (UKK) Institute is responsible for&#xD;
      providing online feedback of the data collected by the interactive ExSed® accelerometer,&#xD;
      stored and analyzed in the Cloud, from where the participants in the PEC-arm receive daily&#xD;
      feedback thru a smart phone application. Cost-effectiveness of the PEC-intervention compared&#xD;
      to the Control-arm in terms of quality adjusted life-years (QALY) and days of sickness&#xD;
      absence are also investigated. The following measurements will be taken at baseline and the&#xD;
      three follow-up timepoints: work-, health- and physical activity related factors collected by&#xD;
      two electronic questionnaires, objective measurements of movement continuum (sleep, sedentary&#xD;
      behavior, standing-ups, standing, light activity, moderate activity, vigorous activity) for&#xD;
      24/7 (RM42 research accelerometer), 3 tests of physical fitness and blood samples related to&#xD;
      blood sugar and lipid profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sick-leaves due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among municipal workers of Nokia City&#xD;
      increased notably during the year 2017, which was noticed as increased call and burden in&#xD;
      occupation healthcare settings. According to the disease grading statistics of early&#xD;
      retirement, MSDs were the leading cause. Due to the afore facts Nokia City composed a novel&#xD;
      model of co-operation between the personnel administration and exercise facilities of Nokia&#xD;
      City: The coordinator of wellbeing (occupational nurse) now prescribes exercise referrals for&#xD;
      patients to directly contact the sports sector for personalized exercise counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of the afore described novel operations model of exercise referral in the Nokia City.&#xD;
      Personalized Exercise Counseling (PEC) intervention guides and motivates the workers to set&#xD;
      and achieve personal exercise/physical activity goals. The hypothesis is that the PEC&#xD;
      improves workability (main outcome) and reduces musculoskeletal pain, and thus improves&#xD;
      quality of life and reduces days of sickness absence. Regarding cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      PEC-arm is expected to be cost-effective in terms of quality adjusted life-years (QALY) and&#xD;
      days of sickness absence compared to the Control-arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population of the PEC-Nokia study is practical nurses, personnel of kitchen and&#xD;
      cleaning service and janitorial service. In case that the number of participants fulfilling&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria of these occupational groups is not adequate to reach the number&#xD;
      needed to be randomized (n=190), other occupations may be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated based on the work ability score (WAS) i.e. current work ability&#xD;
      compared to lifetime best on numeric rating scale from 0 (completely unable to work) to 10&#xD;
      (work ability at its best). Thus, to detect a difference in main effects (i.e., Personalized&#xD;
      Exercise Counselling (PEC) group vs. non-treatment group (Control) with a significance level&#xD;
      of 0.05 and a power of 90%, the study required at least 150 participants (75 in each&#xD;
      study-arm). For compensation of probable loss of participants to follow-up, the aim is to&#xD;
      recruit 190 participants. We expect that there would be a minimal difference of 15% between&#xD;
      the PEC-arm and Control-arm among those with improved WAS-score to the good level (i.e. at&#xD;
      least 8). We expect that 5% of the participants in the Control-arm and 20% in the PEC-arm&#xD;
      will reach the afore target. Reductions of 30% or 15mm (0-100) in intensity of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain levels at neck-shoulder, lower back, and knee would meet the criteria of&#xD;
      clinically important change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants (n=190) will be randomly assigned into 6-month Personalized Exercise&#xD;
      Counseling combined with interactive accelerometer (PEC-arm) or a non-intervention&#xD;
      Control-arm. Statistician KT will randomly assign about 200 persons to one of the two&#xD;
      parallel groups in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated procedure. The codes of the study&#xD;
      group will be provided to the participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria, using the&#xD;
      method of sealed envelopes, immediately after the person has given his/her written consent to&#xD;
      participate to the well-being coordinator (specialist nurse of occupational health employed&#xD;
      by Nokia City). Only the investigators (i.e. the research group) will be blinded to group&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic questionnaires have been prepared to cover the following: Work-related factors&#xD;
      include perceived physical strain, perceived exertion after typical work day at different&#xD;
      body sites of musculoskeletal structures and work stress; Health-related factors include&#xD;
      perceived health, depression, sleep and recovery, quality of life and days of sickness&#xD;
      absence; Physical activity related factors include preferred activity modes and motivation,&#xD;
      Fear Avoidance Beliefs related to physical activity at work and leisure-time. In addition,&#xD;
      the following physical tests will be used to measure health-related fitness: Neck-shoulder&#xD;
      mobility for flexibility, Modified push-ups for upper body strength and trunk stability and 6&#xD;
      minutes' walk test for cardiorespiratory fitness in terms of distance walked and predicted&#xD;
      maximal oxygen uptake.&#xD;

    <description>At the first counseling appointment, PEC-participants answer the physical activity (PA) questionnaire, perform fitness tests and discuss with their exercise instructor. The target is a personalized short-term PA plan including where and when the PA/exercise takes place and what is the mode. Participants may choose instructed group-exercise sessions provided by the municipal sports/leisure sector or exercising alone as preferred. The exercise instructors utilize the fitness test results and feedback data of the research accelerometers by the UKK Institute to guide the participants. The PEC includes 2 more face-to-face sessions and 4-6 phone calls by the instructors aimed at checking the realization of exercise plans and discussing the outcomes provided by the interactive accelerometer.</description>
