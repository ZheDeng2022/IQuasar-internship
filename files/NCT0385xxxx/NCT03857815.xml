    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is an acceptable option for HCC patients not&#xD;
      amenable to surgery or transplantation or manifested with oligometastasis. Recent studies&#xD;
      have shown that SBRT plus immune checkpoint inhibitors may potentiate the effect of RT on&#xD;
      tumor cell killing. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Combined With Anti-PD-1 Antibody in Patients in&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;

             diagnosis should be taken from recurrent and metastasis sites.&#xD;
