  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fractionated ablative&#xD;
      10,600nm CO2 laser assisted delivery of 2% minoxidil solution in the treatment of MPHL. In&#xD;
      this cohort study, patients will randomly be assigned stand-alone laser treatment, laser&#xD;
      assisted drug delivery of minoxidil 2% solution, and laser assisted drug delivery of&#xD;
      minoxidil 2% solution plus at home 5% minoxidil treatment. The primary endpoints will be to&#xD;
      assess the change from baseline in investigator and subject Hair Growth Assessments (HGA),&#xD;
      Hair Growth Index (HGI) and the Hair Growth Satisfaction Scale (HGSS) over 8-12 weeks in each&#xD;
      of the three groups. The secondary endpoints will be expert assessment of hair density from&#xD;
      baseline and evaluation of safety and adverse events, and pharmacokinetic (PK) data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male pattern hair loss (MPHL) is a common, frustrating, and difficult to manage scalp disease&#xD;
      with few treatment options available. Though the mechanism remains unclear, minoxidil is a&#xD;
      well-established treatment for MPHL. With the advent of laser assisted drug delivery, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to investigate the use of laser assisted minoxidil delivery to improve&#xD;
      bioavailability, and subsequent hair growth for subjects MPHL. With an improved clinical&#xD;
      outcome and increased treatment efficiency, patient quality of life would be enhanced and&#xD;
      fewer at home topical treatments with minoxidil may be required. Additionally, this study&#xD;
      will assist in understanding the effects of stand-alone laser therapy on hair growth and may&#xD;
      also be used as a background or framework for a growing number of studies investigating this&#xD;
      technology as a drug delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPHL, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is a non-scarring alopecia resulting in gradual&#xD;
      hair loss localized to the scalp. In men, this progressive hair loss disorder results in&#xD;
      characteristic thinning of hair over the vertex and frontal regions.1 The Hamilton-Norwood&#xD;
      scale categorizes this typical clinical progression.2 While the pathogenesis of MPHL is not&#xD;
      entirely elucidated, it has been proposed to be an age and hormone dependent process with&#xD;
      dihydrotestosterone playing a significant role.2,3 Genetic factors may also contribute to the&#xD;
      disease.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical minoxidil is an FDA approved treatment for MPHL. Minoxidil 2 and 5% solution are&#xD;
      known to increase hair regrowth in men with androgenetic alopecia.7 While the mechanism&#xD;
      remains unknown, it has been proposed minoxidil increases the duration of anagen and vascular&#xD;
      supply to the follicular structure.8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical treatments for MPHL such as minoxidil have limited efficacy, as topical delivery of&#xD;
      medication has low bioavailability.9 With the advent of fractionated ablative and&#xD;
      non-ablative laser technologies, more efficient drug delivery to the level of the superficial&#xD;
      epidermis and dermis is now possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outermost layer of skin, the stratum corneum, impedes the diffusion of topical&#xD;
      medications to follicular structures in the dermis and hypodermis. 9 Ablative fractionated&#xD;
      laser devices create vertical channels, permitting topical medication to breach the skin's&#xD;
      top layer, the stratum corneum, and reach deep skin layers where hair follicles reside.9&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both ablative and non-ablative fractionated laser treatments augment collagen deposition and&#xD;
      cause growth factor mediated changes to skin ultrastructure.10 Non-ablative fractionated&#xD;
      laser therapy in MPHL patients improves hair density with and without topical administration&#xD;
      of growth factor.10 Our proposed study confers an additional mode of treatment beyond&#xD;
      laser-only therapy by using an ablative fractionated laser to deliver minoxidil 2% solution&#xD;
      percutaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herein, the investigators seek to further optimize patient treatment by investigating a&#xD;
      combination of these treatment modalities for management of MPHL. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that fractionated ablative 10,600nm CO2 laser treatment and laser assisted drug&#xD;
      delivery of minoxidil 2% solution will result in increased hair growth. With this improved&#xD;
      clinical outcome and increased treatment efficiency, patient quality of life will be enhanced&#xD;
      and fewer at home topical treatments may be required.&#xD;
