  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will develop, refine, and pilot test the Pain Identification and&#xD;
      Communication Toolkit (PICT), an intervention to help family caregivers of community-dwelling&#xD;
      persons with dementia identify pain symptoms and communicate those symptoms to health care&#xD;
      providers. Informed by self-efficacy theory, PICT will include: a) training in administering&#xD;
      an observational assessment tool to identify pain in persons with dementia, b) coaching in&#xD;
      effective communication about the person with dementia's pain symptoms, c) future planning&#xD;
      for steps to take when pain is detected, and d) updating caregivers' skills through routine&#xD;
      practice with the pain assessment tool. All components will be vetted and iteratively&#xD;
      field-tested with a sample of racially and ethnically diverse caregivers of&#xD;
      community-dwelling persons with dementia and health care providers. A two-group pilot&#xD;
      randomized trial will examine the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary impact of PICT&#xD;
      on caregivers' initiation of pain-related communication with health care providers.&#xD;

    <description>The length of PICT and the delivery model will be informed by observational research that has been approved as part of this protocol (the first participant in the observational phase of this work will be enrolled on March 7, 2019). Lacking knowledge from the information gleaned from the observational and field-testing phases of this study we cannot specify with 100% certainty what the intervention will look like. However, it is likely that PICT will consist of 4-5 weekly 30-minute sessions); the expected delivery model will likely include a combination of online (video observation) and telephone coaching.</description>
