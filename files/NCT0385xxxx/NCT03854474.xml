  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of tazemetostat and how well it&#xD;
      works when given together with pembrolizumab in treating patients with urothelial carcinoma&#xD;
      that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or other places in the body (locally&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic). Tazemetostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving tazemetostat and pembrolizumab may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with urothelial carcinoma compared to pembrolizumab without&#xD;
      tazemetostat.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct a safety lead-in phase that identifies the safe recommended phase II dose for&#xD;
      combination tazemetostat and pembrolizumab (MK-3475).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with&#xD;
      tazemetostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the objective disease response rate of combination tazemetostat and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma that is cisplatin&#xD;
      resistant (Arm A) or cisplatin ineligible (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the progression free survival to combination tazemetostat and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (MK-3475) inhibitor in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma that is cisplatin&#xD;
      resistant (Arm A) or cisplatin ineligible (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate immune-related response using tumor response by immune-related Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (irRECIST) in combination tazemetostat and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (MK-3475) inhibitor in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma that is cisplatin&#xD;
      resistant (Arm A) or cisplatin ineligible (Arm B) based on irRECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if EZH2 and H3K27me3 chromatin methylation determines disease response to&#xD;
      EZH2 and PD1 inhibition in metastatic urothelial carcinoma by analyzing baseline tissue&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if mutations in genes associated with histone methylation determine disease&#xD;
      response to EZH2 and PD1 inhibition in metastatic urothelial carcinoma by analyzing baseline&#xD;
      tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify the immune response (T cell phenotypes), T-cell clonality with comparison to&#xD;
      T-cell infiltrating lymphocytes and neoantigen profile of responsive and resistant urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma treated with combination anti-PD1 and EZH2i by analyzing blood and tissue samples&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tazemetostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.&#xD;

             are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Female patients of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72&#xD;
             hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is&#xD;

                  is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male patients of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
                  contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days&#xD;
                  after the last dose of study therapy. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is&#xD;

             past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive drugs) are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic&#xD;
                  corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.)&#xD;
                  is not considered a form of systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or&#xD;
             current pneumonitis are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prolongation of corrected QT interval (Fridericia's correction formula&#xD;
             [QTcF]) of &gt; 450 msec are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with major surgery within 3 weeks before the first dose of study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: minor surgery (e.g. minor biopsy of an extracranial site, central venous&#xD;
                  catheter placement, shunt revision) has no restriction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with&#xD;
             the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best&#xD;
             interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A =&lt; 14 days prior to study treatment are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: The study team should check a frequently-updated medical reference for a&#xD;
                  list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of. As part of the enrollment/informed&#xD;
                  consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions&#xD;
                  with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if&#xD;
                  the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to take oral medication OR have malabsorption syndrome or any&#xD;
             other uncontrolled gastrointestinal condition (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) that&#xD;
             might impair the bioavailability of tazemetostat are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis,&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,&#xD;
             uncontrolled arterial hypertension, stroke within 6 months prior to starting study&#xD;
             treatment, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and&#xD;
             tazemetostat are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and tazemetostat,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pembrolizumab&#xD;
             (MK-3475) or tazemetostat&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.&#xD;
                  Furthermore, it is not known if pembrolizumab (MK-3475) has transient adverse&#xD;
                  effects on the composition of sperm. Patients are excluded from this study if&#xD;
                  pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
                  projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 6&#xD;
                  months after the last dose of trial treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
             [HBsAg] reactive) or known hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA]&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected) infection are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: no testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by&#xD;
                  local health authority&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned treatment start&#xD;
             are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PD-L1 ELIGIBILITY (ARM B ONLY):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in Arm B must have positive PD-L1 status as confirmed by central analysis&#xD;
             prior to second step registration and treatment initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: positive PD-L1 expression is defined as a combined positive score (CPS) &gt;=&#xD;
                  10 and will be confirmed in a report from HistoGeneX.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Alternatively, patients who previously have had PD-L1 testing performed as standard of care&#xD;
        via the FDA-approved Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 PharmDx Assay companion diagnostic test and who&#xD;
        have a combined positive score (CPS) of &gt;= 10 may be eligible. In these cases, PD-L1&#xD;
        testing does not need to be repeated, and tissue does not need to be sent for central&#xD;
        analysis&#xD;
