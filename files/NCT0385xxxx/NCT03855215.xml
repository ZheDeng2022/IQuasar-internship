    <textblock>
      The proposed study will monitor and evaluate a quality improvement project - the introduction&#xD;
      of commercially available lateral flow CRP tests with international regulatory approval, as a&#xD;
      routine care service to improve the management of patients with acute respiratory infection&#xD;
      (ARI) and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. No research staff will be present, and&#xD;
      to minimise disruption and alteration of routine care, a waiver of written patient informed&#xD;
      consent will be requested from the relevant ethical review boards, in accordance with the&#xD;
      2016 WHO/CIOMS International Guidance for Health-related Research Involving Humans8. Instead,&#xD;
      patients in intervention clusters will be provided with information concerning how the test&#xD;
      can assist healthcare workers in identifying when antibiotics are required, after which they&#xD;
      will be free to refuse its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test selected for use in the study is the ActimÂ® CRP test from Medix Biochemica (Finland;&#xD;
      ISO certification ISO13485:2016). The test is a simple lateral flow device that uses&#xD;
      capillary blood, obtained through a finger/heel puncture. The test provides a&#xD;
      semi-quantitative indication of whether CRP concentrations are &lt;10mg/L, between 10-40mg/L,&#xD;
      between 40-80mg/L, or above 80mg/L, in under 5 minutes with minimal training requirements.&#xD;
      The test has been approved by the European regulatory body (CE-marking) as well as in 13&#xD;
      other countries around the world (including Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Israel and&#xD;
      Thailand) and has been validated for accuracy in previous publications.9,10 Our own research&#xD;
      group has also confirmed the tests' accuracy in both laboratory and field environments,&#xD;
      including their thermos-stability in a tropical climate (see annex). Neither Medix Biochemica&#xD;
      nor any of its distributors, have had involvement with the design of the evaluation and our&#xD;
      group has no conflict of interest with respect to the choice of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main research question: Can point of care CRP tests introduced in routine primary healthcare&#xD;
      reduce prescription of antibiotics for patients with acute respiratory infections, outside of&#xD;
      the research context?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief description of the intervention: The implementation of CRP point of care tests will be&#xD;
      conducted at commune health centres (CHCs), the primary access point for public health&#xD;
      services in Vietnam (CHC details are described in the Location section below). Prior to&#xD;
      introduction of the tests, an educational session will be provided for local healthcare&#xD;
      workers in both intervention and control arms about the role of antibiotics and AMR. After&#xD;
      randomization, further training will be provided for healthcare workers in the intervention&#xD;
      CHCs as to the use of CRP testing to guide antibiotic prescribing decisions. In the&#xD;
      intervention CHCs, healthcare workers will be trained on the use and interpretation of CRP&#xD;
      testing in ARI (detailed in section 5.4). Educational materials will also be developed for&#xD;
      patients and care-givers regarding the value of CRP testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the population to be studied: This study will be conducted in the general&#xD;
      population of Nam Dinh, a rural province in northern Vietnam. The test will be provided at&#xD;
      CHCs and recommended for use in patients presenting with a chief complaint of ARI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening and Recruitment - A list of potential CHCs will be compiled by province-level&#xD;
           officials, and those meeting eligibility criteria will be invited to take part. CHCs&#xD;
           will be randomly allocated to intervention or routine care arms using a&#xD;
           computer-generated random allocation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If baseline variability in antibiotic prescribing practices is identified from reviewing&#xD;
           retrospective routine records, high and low prescription centres will be stratified.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the intervention CHCs, patients with ARIs will be provided leaflets with information&#xD;
           about CRP testing, antibiotics and AMR. Healthcare workers will then decide whether to&#xD;
           use a CRP test as part of routine care of patients with ARI. Patients' autonomy will be&#xD;
           respected and as with any medical procedure this test can be declined. In the control&#xD;
           CHCs patients will be provided with an information leaflet regarding the need for&#xD;
           rational use of antibiotics in ARIs but with no mention of CRP testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical assessment - All patients will have a medical history taken and will be&#xD;
           examined as per normal practice. In the control arm, local guidelines and WHO IMCI&#xD;
           recommendations will guide treatment. In the intervention arm, doctors can choose to use&#xD;
           CRP test results in addition to existing guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. General training and education - Healthcare worker training - Before the study sites&#xD;
           (CHCs) are randomized, an overview of the study will be presented to all local&#xD;
           healthcare workers and provide education about the role of antibiotics, antimicrobial&#xD;
           resistance and identification of clinical signs of severity as well as good clinical&#xD;
           practice (GCP) for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient education - Educational materials will be developed for patients and care-givers&#xD;
           regarding antibiotic use and AMR. These will be available to patients presenting with&#xD;
           ARIs in both arms, with additional information regarding the CRP tests added to the&#xD;
           intervention group leaflets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intervention - CRP test - The ACTIM CRP Rapid Test (Medix, Biochemica) will be made&#xD;
           available to the healthcare workers at the CHCs for use in patients in the target&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Printed guidance will be issued for the performance and interpretation of the CRP test&#xD;
           results in terms of antibiotic guided treatment. The treating healthcare worker will&#xD;
           decide based on their clinical evaluation whether or not to comply with this guideline.&#xD;
           This guidance will also be discussed during the training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As the purpose of the study is to establish whether antibiotic prescription rates can be&#xD;
           reduced by using CRP POC test results, the healthcare workers are recommended to use the&#xD;
           CRP tests in all patients meeting the target population. The CRP cut-offs below are&#xD;
           recommended in the absence of warning signs of severity:&#xD;
&#xD;
           CRP level &lt; 10 mg/L: no antibiotics are recommended CRP level from 10mg/L to 40 mg/L:&#xD;
           antibiotics are unlikely to be needed but should be considered in cases of high clinical&#xD;
           concern CRP level &gt; 40 mg/L: antibiotics are recommended. Based on the previous clinical&#xD;
           trial of CRP testing in ARI in Vietnam in similar CHCs, it's anticipated approximately&#xD;
           75% of patients to have CRP levels below 10mg/L, 20% between 10-40mg/L and 5% above 40&#xD;
           mg/L6.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Healthcare worker training - Additional training will be provided to healthcare workers&#xD;
           in the intervention arm. Findings from previous CRP studies have been used to inform the&#xD;
           training and guidance for the healthcare workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Face-to-face training will be provided on how the test could be used to inform their&#xD;
           prescribing behaviour and a practical session on CRP testing. Content will include which&#xD;
           patients should be offered CRP tests; CRP cut-off values; safety nets and caution in&#xD;
           result interpretation (including danger signs from IMCI13 and IMAI14 guidelines and&#xD;
           patients with co-morbidities). Healthcare workers will be advised that the CRP cut offs&#xD;
           are guidelines and that antibiotics can be prescribed or withheld according to their&#xD;
           clinical judgement. If the healthcare worker feels the patient requires referral to a&#xD;
           higher level facility this should be done without delay and that the CRP tests should&#xD;
           not be used in these cases. The training will be provided by the study team in the local&#xD;
           language.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The CHCs and healthcare workers will be given a telephone number to contact should any&#xD;
           queries arise during the study. Laminated posters and desk reminders with the CRP&#xD;
           cut-off values will be given to the intervention sites.In addition to general&#xD;
           information about rational antibiotic use contained in the patient leaflet, patients in&#xD;
           the intervention arm will have an extra section explaining the role of CRP testing to&#xD;
           guide antibiotic prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient education - Patients with ARIs in all CHCs will be provided with an information&#xD;
           leaflet regarding rational use of antibiotics in ARI and the implications of overuse of&#xD;
           antibiotics for the development of AMR. An additional section for the intervention arm&#xD;
           will explain the role of CRP testing to guide antibiotic prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical/laboratory/other procedures - CRP tests will be available for healthcare&#xD;
           workers to use in ARI patients consulting at intervention CHCs. If patient agree to take&#xD;
           the test, a finger prick blood sample will be taken by the CHC staff and placed on a&#xD;
           semi-quantitative lateral flow CRP test-kit (ActimÂ® CRP, Medix Biochemica, Finland).&#xD;
           Results will be available within 5-10 minutes. Other than the finger prick sample for&#xD;
           the CRP test no samples will be taken or stored. CRP test kits and other consumables&#xD;
           will be re-stocked on a monthly basis provided and checked to confirm they are properly&#xD;
           used for study the study purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Withdrawal of participants from the study - Healthcare workers will be free to refrain&#xD;
           from using the tests and they are not obliged to follow the guidelines in their&#xD;
           antibiotic prescribing. Healthcare workers will also be free to decline the interviews&#xD;
           on the usability and acceptability of the tests. Patients' autonomy will be respected&#xD;
           and they will be free to decline the CRP test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Minimization of Error and Bias - To reduce bias within healthcare providers, cluster&#xD;
           randomisation will be used so that the same doctors will not see patients in both the&#xD;
           intervention and control groups. The study will be conducted for 1 year to allow for&#xD;
           seasonal variation. To measure outcomes, electronic patient record data captured&#xD;
           routinely in health station log books will be used. This information is a requirement&#xD;
           for national health insurance reimbursements, and will be captured in the same way in&#xD;
           each arm. Health-workers in both arms will receive data quality training at the start of&#xD;
           the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Serious adverse events monitoring - As the research poses no more than minimal risks to&#xD;
           participants, a data and safety monitory board (DSMB) will not be required. Based on&#xD;
           previous studies it's anticipated that no serious adverse events associated with the CRP&#xD;
           tests and patients will not be followed up. However, data on admissions for ARI at&#xD;
           hospitals serving this catchment population will be retrospectively requested. Health&#xD;
           insurance numbers will be used to link with primary healthcare records, in order to&#xD;
           identify any study patients who were subsequently hospitalised. This will be done at the&#xD;
           end of the study.&#xD;
