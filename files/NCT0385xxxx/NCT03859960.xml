  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle atrophy may occur in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) as a result of&#xD;
      diminished physical activity and alterations in glucose metabolism and body composition may&#xD;
      be seen. In a few studies, it has been suggested that spasticity may have a positive impact&#xD;
      on glucose metabolism by preventing muscle atrophy and alterations in body composition in&#xD;
      individuals with motor complete SCI. Investigators aimed to assess the effects of spasticity&#xD;
      on glucose metabolism and body composition in participants with complete and incomplete SCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators plan a prospective clinical trial. Participants with SCI were included to study&#xD;
      if times from injury were at least one year. Participants had an AIS grades of A-D with&#xD;
      spasticity. We evaluated that participants with AIS A and B SCI were motor complete group,&#xD;
      AIS C and D SCI were motor incomplete group. Spasticity was assessed with Modified Ashworth&#xD;
      Scale (MAS) and spasms were assessed with Penn Spasm Frequency Scale (PSFS). Hip adductor and&#xD;
      extensor spasticity, knee extensor and flexor spasticity and ankle plantar flexor spasticity&#xD;
      were assessed by using MAS. Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry. All participants underwent a 75 gram (g) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).&#xD;
      Insulin sensitivity was assessed by calculating Matsuda index and HOMA-IR. Investigators&#xD;
      assessed the effects of spasticity on glucose metabolism and body composition in participants&#xD;
      with SCI.&#xD;

    <description>Modified Ashworth Scale is used to assess muscle spasticity on a 6-point scale. 0: No increase in muscle tone 4: Affected part(s) is (are) rigid in flexion or extension. Higher scores mean a worse outcome. HOMA index was used to evaluate insulin resistance. HOMA index is a simple, and inexpensive method used for evaluating insulin sensitivity. In most of the studies, values &gt;2.7 were accepted as insulin resistance. HOMA-IR was calculated by using fasting plasma glucose (mg/dL) X fasting insulin (uIU/mL) /405 formula. Pearson correlation was used to calculate the correlation coefficient (r).</description>

    <description>In the morning after 12 hours overnight fast, all individuals underwent a 75 gram (g) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Blood samples were taken before loading glucose and then 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after taking glucose solution in order to measure serum glucose and insulin levels. Glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured in blood samples taken before the OGTT. We calculated the Matsuda index and Homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA-IR) using glucose and insulin levels.</description>

        <description>The body composition of the individuals was measured by dual-energy absorptiometry (DXA) device. Modified Ashworth Scale is used to assess muscle spasticity on a 6-point scale. 0: No increase in muscle tone 4: Affected part(s) is (are) rigid in flexion or extension. Higher scores mean a worse outcome. Pearson correlation was used to calculate correlation coefficient.</description>
