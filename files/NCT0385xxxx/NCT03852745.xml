      This study will recruit persons with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The investigators will&#xD;
      contact people in an ongoing study (called IMAGINE) to recruit persons with high levels of&#xD;
      stress, anxiety, or depression who are interested in a web-based program focused on skills in&#xD;
      managing stress, anxiety and depression (a self-directed psychosocial intervention). The goal&#xD;
      is to develop an internet-based psychosocial intervention to help persons with inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease to cope with high levels of stress, anxiety or depression.&#xD;

      Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in IBD, with depression rates almost twice as&#xD;
      high for those with IBD compared to the general community, and an estimated 30% overall with&#xD;
      depression or anxiety. Perceived stress is a factor in the development of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. These comorbid conditions complicate management of IBD, adversely impacting&#xD;
      patient outcomes and health, and increasing the resource burden to the health care system.&#xD;
      However, comorbid depression and anxiety in IBD patients is undertreated, paralleling unmet&#xD;
      mental health treatment needs in the general Canadian population. Development of alternate&#xD;
      modes of effective treatment delivery is vital to enhance access, given limited mental health&#xD;
      service availability. CBT has strong clinical evidence for its effectiveness in treating&#xD;
      episodes of depression and anxiety as well as in preventing relapses. CBT may be successfully&#xD;
      delivered as an internet-based intervention. While there are limited data on the efficacy of&#xD;
      CBT tailored to the IBD population, studies targeting comorbid depression in IBD have&#xD;
      resulted in significant mental health improvement. A recent study described an internet-based&#xD;
      CBT for IBD reported modest outcomes (150), but participants were not selected to have&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidity and the primary outcomes were not improvement in mood or anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms. The internet-based program used in this study will involve brief modules focused on&#xD;
      areas important in managing stress, anxiety and depression including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core Topics: 1. About the Program, 2. IBD and Stress 3. Commitment to Living Life Fully, 4.&#xD;
      The Brain-Gut Connection, 5. Understanding Anxiety, 6. Overcoming Avoidance, 7. Depression,&#xD;
      8. Behavioural Activation; Optional Topics: 9. Treatment Options, 10. IBD and the Workplace&#xD;
      11. Mindfulness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Participants will be recruited with the use of a resources informing possible&#xD;
      participants about the project. Patients expressing an interest in the program will receive a&#xD;
      copy of the consent form for the study by email but asked not to sign it. They will be asked&#xD;
      to schedule a time with the study coordinator to review with consent form, discuss any&#xD;
      questions about the consent form or the program, and at the end to indicate verbally whether&#xD;
      or not they provide consent. Those who provide consent will complete a brief psychiatric&#xD;
      interview with the study coordinator to check for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      interview used will be the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for DSM5.&#xD;
      Those who meet the inclusion criteria for the study will be sent a survey link to complete a&#xD;
      the baseline measures for the program.Once participants are accepted into the study&#xD;
      assessments will be completed at baseline, week 6, week 12, and during follow up at week 24.&#xD;
