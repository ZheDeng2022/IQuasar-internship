  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute adenoviral conjunctivitis is a highly contagious, widespread endemic disease associated&#xD;
      with frequent outbreaks, significant patient discomfort, lost productivity, and in some cases&#xD;
      permanent visual compromise from long-term immune mediated sequelae. OKG-0301 is a novel&#xD;
      ophthalmic solution with a potent ribonuclease that has broad-spectrum antiviral properties&#xD;
      relevant for the treatment of acute adenoviral conjunctivitis. This randomized, double&#xD;
      masked, multi-center Phase 2 study is being conducted entirely within Australia and is&#xD;
      designed to support the safety and efficacy of OKG-0301 for the treatment of acute adenoviral&#xD;
      conjunctivitis. The study intends to show superiority of OKG-0301 Ophthalmic Solution&#xD;
      compared to vehicle for the primary efficacy endpoint of mean change from baseline in viral&#xD;
      titre in patients with acute adenoviral conjunctivitis. Secondary efficacy endpoints&#xD;
      including adenoviral eradication, clinical cure of acute adenoviral conjunctivitis,&#xD;
      subepithelial infiltrates, other clinical signs and symptoms, and rate of cross-over&#xD;
      infection to the other eye will also be assessed. Safety will also be evaluated.&#xD;
