  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home blood pressure measurement has been recommended to use in the diagnosis of hypertension.&#xD;
      The investigators have developed diagnostic algorithm of hypertension by using 24-hour and&#xD;
      home blood pressure measurement. However, the diagnostic agreement between home blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement is about 70 - 85%. The&#xD;
      discrepancy of diagnosis between home blood pressure measurement and 24-hour ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure is one of the barriers to introduce home blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis&#xD;
      of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To solve the discrepancy, identifying the characteristic patients showing discrepancy of&#xD;
      hypertension diagnosis between home blood pressure measurement and 24-hour ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study are (1) to validate the diagnostic algorithm of hypertension&#xD;
      by using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and home blood pressure measurement the&#xD;
      investigators have developed, and (2) to identifying the characteristics of patients showing&#xD;
      discrepancy of diagnosis between 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and home blood pressure&#xD;
      measurement, and (3) lastly to improve the diagnostic algorithm of hypertension by using home&#xD;
      blood pressure measurement.&#xD;
