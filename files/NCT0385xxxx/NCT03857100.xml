  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial that uses an audit and feedback intervention to alert&#xD;
      primary care physicians who are outliers in one or more metrics related to high risk&#xD;
      prescribing of participants' outlier status. Primary care physicians will be randomized to&#xD;
      the intervention or control arm, except in California, where all outliers will be notified.&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the impact of the intervention on prescribing patterns.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed five different metrics related to low-value (and/or high&#xD;
      risk) prescribing habits based on guidelines. The five metrics are listed below. The&#xD;
      investigators are using 100% capture Medicare claims data to evaluate the prescribing habits&#xD;
      of all US primary care physicians who prescribed to ten or more Medicare patients. A patient&#xD;
      is attributed to the primary care physician who prescribed the patient the most medications&#xD;
      that year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have calculated the mean, median, and standard deviation for each of the&#xD;
      five metrics based on data from 2016. All primary care physicians who are two or more&#xD;
      standard deviation above the mean of a given metric are considered outliers. In each state&#xD;
      (excluding California), half of the outliers while be randomly assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      group and half will be assigned to the control group, using a random number generator. Those&#xD;
      outliers who are assigned to the intervention group will receive a cover letter signed by a&#xD;
      members from the Physician Engagement Council (PEC), which is composed of physicians from the&#xD;
      Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM) which explains the study. Participants will also&#xD;
      receive a report of participants' status as an outlier which shows in both text and graphic&#xD;
      representation, how participants compare to participants' peers. These communications will be&#xD;
      sent by mail. The control group will not receive any communication. All outliers in&#xD;
      California will receive the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief summary of metrics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metric 1: Average number of concurrent medications per older patient, by physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metric 2: Proportion of older patients who received at least one medication that is a&#xD;
           designated high-risk medication in older patients, by physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metric 3: Proportion of older patients with concurrent use of multiple central nervous&#xD;
           system-active medications, by physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metric 4: Proportion of older patients with chronic use of benzodiazepine sedative&#xD;
           hypnotic medications, by physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metric 5: Proportion of older patients with concurrent use of opioids and&#xD;
           benzodiazepines, by physician&#xD;
