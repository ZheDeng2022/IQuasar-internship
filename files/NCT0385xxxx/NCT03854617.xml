  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel, multi-center study, aims to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of metronomic chemotherapy with oral Navelbine versus intermittent oral Navelbine&#xD;
      in female patients with HER2 negative Metastasis Breast Cancer.&#xD;

      1. The significant efficacy and good safety profile of Vinorelbine in the treatment of&#xD;
           advanced breast cancer are accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Oral NVB presents absolute bioavailability of 40% and oral availability allows to use&#xD;
           different schedules and the endothelial cell functionality and motility are interfered&#xD;
           at very low drug concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Oral NVB at 50 mg three times a week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday) has been tested in phase&#xD;
           Ia/Ib/II trials, highlighting the excellent safety of this scheme combined with an&#xD;
           interesting activity in various European countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of metronomic chemotherapy with oral&#xD;
           Navelbine versus intermittent oral Navelbine in female patients with HER2 negative&#xD;
           Metastasis Breast Cancer.&#xD;

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An interval of less than 3 weeks between the last dose of previous chemotherapy and&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treated by oral NVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days before the beginning of&#xD;
             treatment with study drug. Less than 30 days since receipt of any other&#xD;
             investigational product or device.&#xD;
