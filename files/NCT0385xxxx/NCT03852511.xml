             confined early-stage cancer that has been definitively treated with curative intent,&#xD;
             does not require ongoing treatment, has no evidence of residual disease and has a&#xD;
             negligible risk of recurrence and is therefore unlikely to interfere with the primary&#xD;

             completed at least 2 weeks before first dose of study treatment. There must also be no&#xD;
             requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day&#xD;

&#xD;
         22. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             or the Medical Monitor, may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             study treatment administration, impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol&#xD;
             therapy or interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
