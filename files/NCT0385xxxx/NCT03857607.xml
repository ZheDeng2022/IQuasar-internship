  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational study aiming to study the natural history of a UK-wide patient cohort with&#xD;
      ATP1A3-related disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a rare very disabling neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      syndrome caused by mutations in the gene ATP1A3. AHC is characterized by paroxysmal events&#xD;
      including attacks of hemiplegia (weakness), dystonia (painful stiffening), oculomotor&#xD;
      abnormalities and epileptic seizures. As the condition progresses permanent neurological&#xD;
      symptoms, including unsteadiness and learning problems, emerge. Mutations in ATP1A3 also&#xD;
      cause other related syndromes: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP), less severe and&#xD;
      usually presenting in adulthood, as well as cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic&#xD;
      atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS) syndrome, a severe syndrome of early&#xD;
      childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently therapeutic options are very limited aiming at symptomatic relief with limited&#xD;
      success. As ATP1A3-related syndromes are very rare diseases, with an estimated prevalence of&#xD;
      about 1/1000000, randomised clinical trials of available therapies are not possible due to&#xD;
      lack of a large enough patient cohort. However, the revolution in genetic diagnostics has&#xD;
      made the identification of these patients and the correlation between their phenotypes&#xD;
      possible. At the same time further novel technologies in neuromonitoring and neuroimaging, as&#xD;
      well as videography and sleep monitoring have become available that could help us further&#xD;
      examine and understand the underlying mechanisms especially of the paroxysmal episodes that&#xD;
      characterise all ATP1A3-related syndromes. The investigators believe that based on these&#xD;
      scientific advances they will be able to recruit a UK-wide patient cohort to conduct an in&#xD;
      depth study of the progression of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is particularly relevant at the moment as rapid progress in genetic therapies and other&#xD;
      novel therapeutics makes the availability of new treatment options in the near future a&#xD;
      realistic prospect and, even though we will most probably still not be able to identify a&#xD;
      large enough cohort for randomised clinical trials, our natural history study will act as a&#xD;
      much needed benchmark to which the success of novel treatments can be evaluated.&#xD;
