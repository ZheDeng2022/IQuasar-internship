  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Firstly, this study aims to understand how cardiac fibrosis mediated by inflammatory&#xD;
      microvascular disease evolves during advanced chronic kidney disease and end stage renal&#xD;
      failure and importantly how this changes with commencement on renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) using sequential cardiac MRI imaging. This method of&#xD;
      imaging is non-invasive, provides significantly more data than echocardiography, is&#xD;
      reproducible and accurate, has been validated in numerous studies and does not involve&#xD;
      exposure to ionising radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, this study aims to examine the changes in monocyte subsets and biochemical profile&#xD;
      in peripheral blood prior to, during and after commencement on renal replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis would be that renal failure causes alteration in monocyte subset&#xD;
      phenotype resulting in increased circulating inflammatory monocytes (human CD14high&#xD;
      CD16high), initiating pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and thereby accelerating&#xD;
      inflammatory cardiovascular disease and development of myocardial fibrosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is significant excess of cardiac mortality in patients with end stage renal failure&#xD;
      (ESRF) - 15 to 20% relative increased risk of cardiac death compared to the normal&#xD;
      population. 20-30% of patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) die from a cardiac cause&#xD;
      (UK Renal Registry Data, 2016). However, only 30% have macrovascular disease at the time of&#xD;
      autopsy. There is therefore a significant component of cardiac morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      this population that is mediated by microvascular disease and cardiac fibrosis. This includes&#xD;
      abnormal myocardial remodelling, increased ventricular stiffness and ventricular hypertrophy,&#xD;
      with development of arrhythmia and cardiac failure as well as increased atherosclerotic&#xD;
      disease burden. Renal replacement therapy in itself also induces a pro-inflammatory response&#xD;
      in patients increasing cardiac risk and there is poor understanding as to how to mediate this&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of evidence in how to manage both patients and the RRT process to minimise&#xD;
      the risk of patients developing cardiac disease. The mechanisms underlying this enhanced risk&#xD;
      are not fully understood nor explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to study the mechanism by which this might be mediated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously reported alterations in monocyte subset populations in CKD&#xD;
      patients that importantly predict CVD events. Furthermore, the investigators have shown that&#xD;
      dyslipidaemia influences monocyte/macrophage phenotypes. The investigators propose an&#xD;
      important interaction exists between chronic inflammation in the uraemic state, dyslipidaemia&#xD;
      and the formation of deleterious monocyte/macrophage phenotypes that accelerates&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. Cardiac MRI has been used in recent years to accurately assess the degree of&#xD;
      cardiac fibrosis in end stage renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study builds on previous clinical and non-clinical studies at Imperial College&#xD;
      London by unifying basic science, animal models and imaging studies into the clinical context&#xD;
      of end stage renal failure. Increased understanding of the changes in cardiac function&#xD;
      related to development of end stage renal failure and commencement on renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy will provide significant and novel opportunities to optimise the management of&#xD;
      patients in the pre-dialysis setting and prevent cardiovascular complications caused by long&#xD;
      term renal replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical observational study will involve the recruitment of 30 participants from&#xD;
      general nephrology services at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust at CKD stage 4/5 with&#xD;
      progressive decline in renal function (anticipated start on renal replacement therapy within&#xD;
      6 months). Participants will be divided into two cohorts of haemodialysis and peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis to enable comparison between the renal replacement modalities. As part of&#xD;
      participants recruitment they will undergo comprehensive medical assessment and will remain&#xD;
      under the follow-up of the renal team at frequent intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will undergo cardiac MRI imaging at three time points - First when&#xD;
      initially recruited at CKD4/5, second at the point of commencement on renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy (~6 months) and third after a further 6 months on renal replacement therapy. MRI&#xD;
      results will be analysed at these time points for development of fibrotic and function&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In partnership with MRI imaging patients will have blood samples collected at the same time&#xD;
      intervals for analysis of blood count, biochemical markers, monocyte and lipid phenotypes.&#xD;
