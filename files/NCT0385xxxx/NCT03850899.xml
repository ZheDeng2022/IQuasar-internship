      The purpose of this research study is to create a clinical database and bio-repository. To do&#xD;
      this, we will obtain blood, urine, saliva, and stool samples (e.g., biological samples) and&#xD;
      personal health information from you to use in future research studies related to alcoholic&#xD;
      hepatitis or other diseases. Part of your blood sample will be used to extract your DNA. DNA&#xD;
      is the genetic material that gives us unique characteristics. We are doing this research&#xD;
      study because we are trying to find out more about how and why illnesses related to alcoholic&#xD;
      hepatitis or other diseases occur in people. To do this, we will study the biological samples&#xD;
      and personal health information from healthy and sick people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A &quot;biological sample&quot; is usually blood, but can be any body fluid. &quot;Personal Health&#xD;
      Information&quot; includes such items as your name, age, gender, race, and/or your medical&#xD;
      information. It can also include data from measurements and tests that you had while&#xD;
      participating in another research study or that were done during the course of your regular&#xD;
      medical care or doctor visits.&#xD;

      What should I know about this research?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Someone will explain this research to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taking part in this research is voluntary. Whether you take part is up to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you don't take part, it won't be held against you.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You can take part now and later drop out, and it won't be held against you&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you don't understand, ask questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask all the questions you want before you decide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How long will I be in this research? We expect that your taking part in this research will&#xD;
      last up to 6 months, after the 6 months we will look in your medical records every 180 days&#xD;
      for up to five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is this research being done? The purpose of this research is to create a clinical&#xD;
      database and bio-repository to study alcoholic hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What happens to me if I agree to take part in this research? If you decide to take part in&#xD;
      this research study, the general procedures include: 1) allowing the investigators to review&#xD;
      your medical records, 2) answering questions about you and your health, 3) completing&#xD;
      questionnaires about alcohol use, 4) having a physical exam and blood drawn, and 5) providing&#xD;
      urine and stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Could being in this research hurt me? The most important risks or discomforts that you may&#xD;
      expect from taking part in this research include mild pain from blood draws and a small&#xD;
      chance for a loss of confidentiality (e.g., unauthorized users gain access to sensitive and&#xD;
      protected data about you).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will being in this research benefit me? It is not expected that you will personally benefit&#xD;
      from this research. Possible benefits to others may include understanding specific health&#xD;
      conditions in patients with alcoholic hepatitis or other diseases.&#xD;
