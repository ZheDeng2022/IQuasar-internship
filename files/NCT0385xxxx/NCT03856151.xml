  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of heating device among otherwise stable&#xD;
      patients with intradialytic hypotension&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a common complication during hemodialysis (HD) which&#xD;
      accounts up to 5 to 30 percent of all dialysis treatment and is associated with increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The etiology of IDH is multifactorial, but intravascular volume&#xD;
      depletion, autonomic neuropathy, and decreased cardiac reserve were the main factors. Several&#xD;
      approaches were utilized to prevent IDH including adaptation of dialysis prescriptions,&#xD;
      lengthening in dialysis time, avoiding food intake during dialysis, as well as limiting&#xD;
      interdialytic sodium intake and administration of vasoconstrictor agents. However, it remains&#xD;
      necessary to seek novel effective and safe inventions for IDH. To date, no studies have been&#xD;
      done to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture and traditional moxibustion during HD for&#xD;
      safety reasons (eg: risk of bleeding, burns and unpleasant smell). Therefore, the heating&#xD;
      device appears to be a non-invasive and safe method for treating IDH. The investigators&#xD;
      conduct a clinical trial using infrared heating devices without direct contact to the skin on&#xD;
      low temperatures (56±8℃) in treating patients with IDH. 30 eligible participants diagnosed&#xD;
      with IDH will be enrolled and divided into Group 1 and Group 2. Treatment 1# will be regular&#xD;
      dialysis 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Treatment 2# will be regular dialysis 3 times per week&#xD;
      plus &quot;HEALTHY BOX&quot; Powered heating pad on acupoint CV4 at the abdomen for 1 hour during&#xD;
      dialysis, also for 4 weeks. For Group 1, each subject will receive Treatment 1# first, for&#xD;
      Group 2, Treatment 2# will be received first. Then, it takes 2-week washout period with&#xD;
      regular dialysis 3 times per week and make Group 1 and Group 2 crossover. Outcomes will&#xD;
      include blood pressure changes, nursing intervention frequencies, IDH frequencies, the degree&#xD;
      of cold intolerance, the degree of fatigue after dialysis and recovery time from fatigue&#xD;
      after dialysis, the percentage of target ultrafiltration achieved and blood biochemistry.&#xD;
      Data will be collected at the beginning of the study (baseline), end of Treatment 1 # , and&#xD;
      end of Treatment 2#. Subjective questionnaires will be collected before and after each&#xD;
      treatment period. The difference of evaluation scores between baseline and post-treatment&#xD;
      will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed model. A value of P &lt; 0.05 will be regarded&#xD;
      as statistically significant for the above statistical analyses.&#xD;
