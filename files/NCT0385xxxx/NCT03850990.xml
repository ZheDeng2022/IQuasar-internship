  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the effect of attending to stomach-cues of hunger and fullness on body&#xD;
      weight and any additional benefit provided by open-label placebo.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Students and employees from the University of Alabama at Birmingham will consent to four lab&#xD;
      visits. On the first visit, they will get measured for a BMI, complete surveys about eating&#xD;
      and cognitive styles. They will also get their heart rate and blood pressure taken, and&#xD;
      provide a saliva sample for saliva quantification with dental cotton rolls in the mouth&#xD;
      before and after a food-craving task (rating computer photos of various foods for liking and&#xD;
      desire). They will then see a video explaining the difference between mouth and stomach&#xD;
      hunger and instructing them to use a hunger meter to know when to start eating and when to&#xD;
      stop eating. They will have a chance to ask questions and will receive a hard copy of the&#xD;
      video. They will also receive a satiety tips sheet and will give permission to receive and&#xD;
      start receiving daily motivational text messages for the next 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time all participants will also watch a short video about placebos and the effect&#xD;
      that open-label placebos (non-deceptive placebos; the person knows they are receiving a&#xD;
      placebo) have had on previous studies unrelated to obesity or weight loss. If randomized to&#xD;
      the placebo group they will take 2 capsules of micro-crystalline cellulose, a non-bioactive&#xD;
      ingredient, every day for the duration of the study. Those in the no placebo group will not&#xD;
      receive the pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second visit will take place 2 weeks after the first visit. They will be measured for&#xD;
      another BMI, complete a meal patterns questionnaire, and have a progress interview about&#xD;
      their experience with the new eating instructions. They will receive answers and suggestions&#xD;
      corresponding to their interview responses on any challenges faced. Those in the placebo&#xD;
      group will have a chance to have any questions or concerns addressed. All participants will&#xD;
      then be scheduled for their next visit and will receive the text messages twice a week for&#xD;
      the next 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third visit will take place 3 weeks after the second visit. They will be measured again&#xD;
      for a BMI, complete another meal patterns questionnaire, have another progress interview, and&#xD;
      get scheduled for their last visit. No text messages will go out between this and the fourth&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth visit will take place 3 weeks after the third visit. They will be measured for a&#xD;
      BMI and complete another meal patterns questionnaire. They will also get another heart rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure, and saliva quantification reading before and after the food-craving task as&#xD;
      in the first visit. They will have a final progress interview, followed by a debriefing&#xD;
      meeting to let them know more about the study and answer any questions related to any part of&#xD;
      the study. They will then be asked if they want to know more about their survey and&#xD;
      questionnaire scores. Those in the no placebo group who wish to take placebos will grant&#xD;
      permission to be contacted for any future studies that include a placebo group.&#xD;
