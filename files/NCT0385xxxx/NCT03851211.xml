  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. The majority of&#xD;
      men diagnosed with prostate cancer have early stage disease, which can be managed in a&#xD;
      variety of ways, ranging from monitoring to international treatment. However is it not always&#xD;
      clear which treatment option is best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All men with newly diagnosed localised prostate cancer are assigned a disease risk category&#xD;
      (low/intermediate/high risk). This is based on clinical findings and prostate biopsy results,&#xD;
      but these factors are limited in their ability to distinguish between aggressive and indolent&#xD;
      prostate cancers. The current risk grouping can make it difficult to plan appropriate&#xD;
      treatment tailored and personalised to the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence reporting overtreatment of localised prostate cancer in the UK. However,&#xD;
      many patients with aggressive disease are wrongly assigned a low risk categorisation and are&#xD;
      recommended surveillance when better suited to more interventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myriad Genetics have developed a test, called Prolaris which measures how fast cells in a&#xD;
      prostate cancer are dividing to assess its aggressiveness. The Prolaris test is performed on&#xD;
      routine prostate biopsy tissue, so patients are not subjected to any additional invasive&#xD;
      investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, led by Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, the aim is find out if the&#xD;
      ProlarisÂ® test score helps patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and their clinical&#xD;
      team make better informed treatment choices that are tailored to the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim to achieve a Prolaris risk score for 100 patients and determine the impact it has on&#xD;
      treatment decision making. The research team will look at how the test fits into routine&#xD;
      clinical practice, investigate the clinician and patient views and understanding on the test&#xD;
      report and assess the quality of life of patients in the different risk and treatment groups.&#xD;
