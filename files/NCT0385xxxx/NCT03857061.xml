      Our overall research goal for this project is to create a wearable device and mobile&#xD;
      application, appealing to patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which&#xD;
      provides them with appropriate self-management tools and detects AECOPDs early to permit&#xD;
      prompt treatment and prevent severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization.&#xD;

      Our overall research goal for this project is to create a wearable device and mobile&#xD;
      application, appealing to patients with COPD, which provides them with appropriate&#xD;
      self-management tools and detects Acute Exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) early to permit&#xD;
      prompt treatment and prevent severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization. Currently, the&#xD;
      investigators are developing a second version of this app, WearCOPDv2. This app will&#xD;
      incorporate features identified as being desirable from our patient interviews: 1) new sensor&#xD;
      that was requested by patients - oxygen saturation, and 2) the app will incorporate a&#xD;
      patient-facing interface as patients requested a method to view their data as well as access&#xD;
      to information to learn how to manage their condition better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can an app designed for patients with COPD that includes biosensor feedback improve&#xD;
      self-management of COPD?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the accuracy of our sensor data (heart rate, activity, respiratory rate, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, coughing, and other sounds of interest) in detecting early AECOPDs?&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Can an app designed for patients with COPD that includes biosensor feedback improve self-management of COPD?&#xD;
We will use the Mastery sub-section of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire to measure our research question. Mastery is measured with a 7-point likert scale where higher scores indicate better health-related mastery.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-efficacy as measured by the COPD Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Can an app designed for patients with COPD that includes biosensor feedback improve self-efficacy of COPD?&#xD;
This will be measured by the COPD self-efficacy scale. Participants will determine how confident they are that they could manage breathing difficulty or avoid breathing difficulty in certain situations. Usin the following scale.&#xD;
Very confident&#xD;
Pretty confident&#xD;
Somewhat confident&#xD;
Not very confident&#xD;
Not at all confident&#xD;
A lower score indicates higher self-efficacy.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Can an app designed for patients with COPD that includes biosensor feedback improve health related quality of life?&#xD;
Scoring and Scales&#xD;
Questions 1 - 7 Scale: Most days a week - Not At All&#xD;
Where a patient has ticked a box, a value of 1 is entered for the appropriate question.&#xD;
Question 8 Where a patient has ticked 'Yes' to having a worse wheeze in the morning, a value of 1 is entered for the appropriate question.&#xD;
Questions 9, 10 &amp; 17 Where a patient has ticked a box, a value of 1 is entered for the appropriate question.&#xD;
Questions 11 - 16 Where a patient has ticked 'True' a value of 1 is entered for the appropriate question.&#xD;
In response to question 14, if a patient is not receiving medication, enter the responses as zero.&#xD;
Score = 100 x (Summed weights from positive items in the questionnaire divided by the Sum of weights for all items in the questionnaire)&#xD;
lower scores indicate higher health related quality of life</description>

    <measure>Change in symptom scale as measured by the MRC dyspnea scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Can an app designed for patients with COPD that includes biosensor feedback improve COPD symptoms?&#xD;
The MRC Dyspnea scale asks you to rate your breathlessness on a 5 point likert scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy of our derived prediction algorithm to detect acute exacerbations as measured by the daily symptom score.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will correlate sensor data from the smartwatch to exacerbations defined by the daily symptom score.&#xD;
The daily symptom score asks about daily symptoms of COPD and patients are asked to answer yes or no to whether or not they have experienced a decline of any of the symptoms</description>

        The investigators will recruit patients who have clinically relevant COPD who live at home.&#xD;
        They will be identified in clinics and the wards by members of their care team. Posters&#xD;
        informing people of the study will also be posted at University Health Network (UHN) with a&#xD;
