  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory condition of the small intestine. Environmental and&#xD;
      genetic factors are involved in the development of CD. Apart from environmental and genetic&#xD;
      factors other factors may also be involved, such as alteration in intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
      Probiotic supplementation has been shown to be able to determine the intestinal healing.&#xD;
      Recently the use of a mixture of some specific bacterial strains has shown its effectiveness.&#xD;
      In this study effectiveness of a probiotic &quot;Pentabiocel&quot; which is a mixture of five different&#xD;
      bacterial strains will be evaluated in CD affected children (already on a gluten-free diet)&#xD;
      through a double-blind randomised placebo control trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease (CD) is an intestinal inflammatory condition characterized by permanent&#xD;
      intolerance to gluten, a protein complex present in wheat, barley, and rye, in genetically&#xD;
      predisposed subjects. In the early phase of the disease, specific autoantibodies are&#xD;
      generally present, which is relevant for diagnostic purposes (especially anti-tissue&#xD;
      transglutaminase antibodies (anti TTG) of IgA (immunoglobulin A) class and anti-endomysial&#xD;
      antibodies( EMA), and a duodenal and jejunal mucosal lesion that is characterized by an&#xD;
      increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), hypertrophy of crypts and villous atrophy. The&#xD;
      only accepted and effective treatment for CD so far is a lifelong strict gluten-free&#xD;
      diet(GFD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the clinical level, CD can have an extremely variable expression, from almost silent forms&#xD;
      to cases with more or less striking intestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations. Treatment&#xD;
      with a strict GFD causes gradual normalisation of the intestinal lesion (generally within&#xD;
      12-24 months). The persistence of a minimal intestinal lesion and of mostly gastro-enteric&#xD;
      symptoms, is not rare in adulthood, especially for the difficulty of maintaining a &quot;zero&#xD;
      gluten content&quot; diet over time. The &quot;timing&quot; of recovery induced by the GFD is variable from&#xD;
      patient to patient and depends on numerous factors such as presentation mode (typical,&#xD;
      atypical or silent), the age of onset, adherence to a strict GFD, etc. Among the factors that&#xD;
      may condition the normalisation of the clinical picture. According to some recent data, the&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative typology of the intestinal microbiome may have role. Prospective&#xD;
      studies in healthy infants who are at risk of developing CD have shown that the Human&#xD;
      Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genotype, together with other environmental factors, influences the&#xD;
      composition of the microbiota. In addition, celiac patients have alterations of the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) that do not completely normalize even after starting GFD.&#xD;
      It has therefore been suggested that CD may favor dysbiosis which in turn negatively&#xD;
      influences intestinal mucosal damage and can promote inflammation through the expansion of&#xD;
      harmful bacteria and the reduction of beneficial bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are live microorganisms, that when ingested in appropriate quantities, give to the&#xD;
      host benefits. Some probiotics may digest gluten and are thus able to reduce their toxicity&#xD;
      when used in fermentation processes. For example, a research group (Di Cagno et al.) has&#xD;
      shown that bakery products made using a natural yeast with wheat flour fermented by proteases&#xD;
      of lactobacilli and mushrooms, can be taken with confidence by celiac patients. This data&#xD;
      suggests that the simple administration of a probiotic is capable to provide benefit in&#xD;
      patients with CD leading to an improvement also of intestinal symptoms. However, it is clear&#xD;
      from the literature that not all probiotic strains possess this characteristic. It has been&#xD;
      shown that a mixture of probiotic strains, in particular belonging to the species&#xD;
      Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      animalis subsp lactis, is able to significantly improve the irritable colon-like&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with CD. Pentabiocel is the trade name of the product&#xD;
      containing the above mentioned probiotic mixture: Lactobacillus paracasei (LMG P-17504),&#xD;
      Lactobacillus plantarum (CECT 4528), Bifidobacterium breve Bbr8 (LMG P-17501),&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium breve (BL10 LMG P-17500) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis Bi1 (LMG P&#xD;
      -17,502).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized double blind placebo controlled trial study investigators will investigate&#xD;
      the effect of &quot;Pentabiocel&quot; on children already on GFD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of &quot;Pentabiocel&quot; in the clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory recovery of children with celiac disease&#xD;
