  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of adding beta-glucan (1.5 g, 3 g or 6&#xD;
      g daily) administered three times a day (TID) in divided doses, to atorvastatin (10 mg - 20&#xD;
      mg) once a day or an equivalent dose of another statin on heart disease lipid risk factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male and female subjects ≥ 18 years of age with an elevated LDL-C &gt; 3.37 mmol/L (130 mg/dL)&#xD;
      treated with a stable dose of statin for at least 6 weeks (atorvastatin (10-20mg daily) or&#xD;
      equivalent dose of another statin), including subject with previous cardiovascular (CV)&#xD;
      events, with partial statin intolerance defined as an inability to tolerate statin therapy in&#xD;
      the form and dosages required to achieve treatment goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following signature of informed consent, approximately 264 subjects (66 subjects per&#xD;
      beta-glucan treatment group and 22 subjects per matching placebo group) meeting all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive one of the three doses of&#xD;
      beta-glucan (1.5 g, 3 g or 6 g daily) administered TID in divided doses or a matching placebo&#xD;
      as an add-on therapy to atorvastatin (10- 20 mg administered once daily) or an equivalent&#xD;
      dose of another statin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be assigned to the 3 different doses of beta-glucan or placebo in a tiered&#xD;
      fashion as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first set of 88 subjects randomized will receive either 1.5 g beta-glucan daily (1&#xD;
           tablet of 500 mg TID) or a matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The next set of 88 subjects randomized will receive either 3 g of beta-glucan daily (2&#xD;
           tablets of 500 mg TID) or a matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The last set of 88 subjects randomized will receive either 6 g of beta-glucan daily (4&#xD;
           tablets of 500 mg TID) or a matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period, subjects will return to the study site at Visit 3 (Week 6) and&#xD;
      at the End of Treatment Visit (Week 12) for laboratory tests and clinical assessments,&#xD;
      including Adverse Events (AEs), dietary guidance and study product compliance. At the Safety&#xD;
      Follow-up Visit (Week 14), subjects will be contacted via telephone for an assessment of AEs.&#xD;
