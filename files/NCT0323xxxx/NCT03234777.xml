  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diarrhea and vomiting in children is a common reason to visit the emergency department. There&#xD;
      has been a lot of research on how best to treat children with diarrhea and vomiting who visit&#xD;
      the emergency department; however, the care children receive varies by healthcare provider&#xD;
      and across hospitals. Additionally, there are things parents can do at home to help manage&#xD;
      childhood diarrhea and vomiting and potentially avoid a trip to the emergency department.&#xD;
      This shows an urgent need for knowledge translation, that is, efforts to align research&#xD;
      knowledge and healthcare practice. Actively involving parents in healthcare decisions has the&#xD;
      potential to bridge this gap; however, there is little research on the best ways to&#xD;
      communicate complex health information to parents of sick kids. In 2013, a national needs&#xD;
      assessment was conducted with parents seeking care for their kids in general emergency&#xD;
      departments (trekk.ca). This survey showed that 39% of parents looked for information about&#xD;
      their child's health prior to coming to the emergency department and that 44% of these&#xD;
      parents looked for this information on the internet. This means that the development and&#xD;
      evaluation of digital tools to give parents timely and effective child health information has&#xD;
      the potential to reduce unnecessary emergency department visits, empower parents in health&#xD;
      decision-making, and ultimately improve child health outcomes. In this project, parents will&#xD;
      be actively involved in the evaluation of a digital tool, a whiteboard animation video,&#xD;
      designed to communicate the best research evidence on the treatment and management of&#xD;
      vomiting and diarrhea in children. In this pilot trial, parents in two emergency departments&#xD;
      will be randomized to view the video or a sham video, and then provide quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative data on the potential effectiveness of the video, the perceived benefit and value&#xD;
      of the knowledge translation intervention for pediatric vomiting and diarrhea, the&#xD;
      feasibility of using iPads and an electronic data collection platform to conduct research&#xD;
      with this population, the time required to complete data collection, and parents' willingness&#xD;
      to participate in future, similar research.&#xD;

      STUDY PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot randomized trial is to use quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative approaches to achieve the following objectives in the four key pilot trial&#xD;
      domains:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Scientific domain objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.a.) To determine the potential effectiveness of a digital knowledge translation tool for&#xD;
      parents/caregivers about pediatric acute gastroenteritis (AGE). KT tools are intended to&#xD;
      impact end-user experience, including increasing knowledge, influencing healthcare decision&#xD;
      making, and use of healthcare resources/services. Comprehension and retention of health&#xD;
      information is a key component of the patient experience, a determinant of care instruction&#xD;
      follow-through, and the cornerstone of health literacy; therefore, parental knowledge over&#xD;
      time will be assessed. In addition to comprehension, educational materials may also influence&#xD;
      health decision making; therefore, parental decision regret over time will be assessed to&#xD;
      examine this impact in light of the decision to bring their child to the ED for care.&#xD;
      Additionally, minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) will be identified for both&#xD;
      knowledge and decision regret outcome measures. Finally, healthcare utilization post-ED visit&#xD;
      will be explored as a potential future outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. b.) To understand the perceived benefit and value of KT tools for parents/caregivers of&#xD;
           a child with pediatric AGE, including important components that enhance knowledge and&#xD;
           decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Process domain objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.a.) To examine the feasibility of using an electronic, web-based platform for intervention&#xD;
      delivery and data collection with this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Management domain objectives: 3.a.) To assess parent/caregivers' willingness to&#xD;
      participate in future, similar research (i.e., full-scale trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Resource domain objectives: 4.a.) To determine time required for participants to complete&#xD;
      data collection forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.b.) To examine the feasibility of using iPads to collect data with parents/caregivers in&#xD;
      the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: This pilot trial is not designed to test hypotheses, but rather to gather initial&#xD;
      data to justify and inform a future, full-scale trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS &amp; DESIGN: This is a parallel-arm, pilot randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Consecutive individuals will be approached in the ED waiting room post-triage&#xD;
      assessment during data collection recruitment hours (7 days/week, 0700 - 2300). A member of&#xD;
      the study team (Research Coordinator, Research Assistant, etc.) will assess&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and review the information letter. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      indicated on iPads as part of the electronic data collection platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Participants will view the experimental (3 minute, whiteboard animation video&#xD;
      on pediatric acute gastroenteritis) and sham control (3 minute, CDC video on hand washing for&#xD;
      infection control) interventions on an iPad in the ED waiting room post-triage assessment.&#xD;
      Headphones will be provided with the iPad to both groups in the ED to maintain blinding. At&#xD;
      the end of data collection in the ED (post-intervention questionnaire 1), participants can&#xD;
      select to receive a link to their allocated video via email. Participants from the&#xD;
      experimental intervention group that are participating in the qualitative interview will view&#xD;
      the whiteboard animation video again at the start of the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Blocked randomization with randomly chosen block sizes will be used to ensure&#xD;
      equal distribution of participants to intervention and standard care intervention study arms.&#xD;
      The blocked randomization sequence will be computer generated. Following sequence generation,&#xD;
      the randomization sequence will be entered into a confidential module on the electronic&#xD;
      platform. Once the sequence is entered, the randomization module will only be accessible&#xD;
      using a confidential password. The randomization sequence will be kept confidential. It will&#xD;
      be inaccessible to data collectors/outcome assessors and to the study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the pre-intervention questionnaire, including demographic information and&#xD;
      baseline outcome data, on the electronic data collection platform, participants will&#xD;
      automatically be randomized to one of the study conditions (i.e., intervention or sham&#xD;
      control) based on the randomization sequence. This process will be seamless to participants.&#xD;
      After viewing the study condition materials, participants will be automatically directed to&#xD;
      the first post-intervention questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Using an electronic platform for data collection, study group allocation, and&#xD;
      intervention viewing will allow participants to access the interventions and provide data&#xD;
      independent of the research team. Participants will know they are viewing information on an&#xD;
      iPad, but won't know how the content differs between groups because they will be using&#xD;
      headphones. Participants and outcome assessors will not be able to determine group allocation&#xD;
      and since all data is collected electronically there is no risk of unblinding during data&#xD;
      collection, data cleaning and data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimate: Sample size calculations are not required for pilot/feasibility studies&#xD;
      as hypothesis testing is not the focus of this research design. Rather, recruitment will take&#xD;
      place over a 6-month period and will be evaluated for quantitative and qualitative components&#xD;
      as part of the identified process outcome measures. This 6-month period is intended to&#xD;
      reflect the seasonal nature of viral gastroenteritis, the most common cause of infection, in&#xD;
      temperate climates. Recruitment will take place over the peak infection time of late winter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Philosophically, qualitative methods do not conduct prospective determinations of a sample&#xD;
      size; instead, an adequate sample permits a deep, case oriented analysis that results in a&#xD;
      new understanding of experience. In this study, 12-20 interviews with participants are&#xD;
      anticipated to see patterns in experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-intervention questionnaire (baseline): Participants will complete a pre-intervention&#xD;
           questionnaire that includes demographics, knowledge questionnaire, and Decision Regret&#xD;
           Scale within the iCare Adventure platform on the iPad.&#xD;
&#xD;
           **Participants will then be randomized to view the study intervention or the sham&#xD;
           control intervention within the electronic platform on the iPad. This process will be&#xD;
           seamless for the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-intervention questionnaire 1 (immediate): After viewing the intervention,&#xD;
           participants will complete the knowledge questionnaire and Decision Regret Scale a&#xD;
           second time. In addition, participants will complete 2 items assessing their own&#xD;
           performance on the knowledge questionnaire and Decision Regret Scale and 1 item&#xD;
           regarding the perceived value and benefit of the KT tool. They will also be asked if&#xD;
           they would like a video link emailed to them. At the end of this questionnaire, parents&#xD;
           will be informed that the post-intervention questionnaire 2 will be emailed to them 4&#xD;
           days after this ED visit for completion at their earliest convenience. Experimental&#xD;
           intervention group parents will be asked about participation in a qualitative focus&#xD;
           group at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-intervention questionnaire 2 (4-14 days post-ED visit): Participants will be&#xD;
           emailed a secure link on day 4 post-ED discharge to complete the knowledge questionnaire&#xD;
           and Decision Regret Scale a third time 2 items assessing their own performance on the&#xD;
           knowledge questionnaire and Decision Regret Scale, 3 items related to healthcare&#xD;
           utilization, and 3 items related to the perceived value and benefit of the KT tool (if&#xD;
           applicable). Reminders to complete post-intervention questionnaire 2 will be sent every&#xD;
           third day (day 7, day 10, day 13). The last day for follow-up questionnaire completion&#xD;
           will be 14 days post ED visit (10 days after follow-up survey sent to participant).&#xD;
           Previous research has demonstrated that 82% of AGE cases are resolved in three days or&#xD;
           less and 14 days represents the outer limit for pediatric AGE resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Post-intervention semi-structured interview (sub-sample of experimental group):&#xD;
           Participants in the experimental group indicating willingness to participate in an&#xD;
           in-depth, semi-structured, qualitative interview will be contacted via telephone after&#xD;
           completion of post-intervention questionnaire 2. Up to three phone calls will be made to&#xD;
           establish interview date/time. Qualitative interviews will take 30-60 minutes to&#xD;
           complete and focus on satisfaction with the electronic data collection platform,&#xD;
           perceived benefit and value of the KT intervention, and willingness to participate in&#xD;
           future, similar research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: All data will be aggregated and analyzed as per the Alberta Health Information&#xD;
      Act. Quantitative data will be downloaded from a secure Canadian server to SPSS for data&#xD;
      cleaning and analysis. Data cleaning measures may include recoding into categorical variables&#xD;
      and comparing and recoding free text responses where appropriate. Descriptive statistics and&#xD;
      estimation are the recommended focus of pilot/feasibility trials. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      (e.g., frequencies, measures of variation and spread, etc.) will be calculated to describe&#xD;
      the study groups. Analyses will be conducted based on intention-to-treat overall and by site&#xD;
      (Stollery, IWK) to identify any differences in the pattern of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be de-identified during verbatim transcription. Prior to analysis,&#xD;
      transcripts will be verified by a member of the research team. Qualitative data will be&#xD;
      managed and analyzed using NVivo data management software. Qualitative outcomes will be&#xD;
      analyzed using thematic analysis by breaking interview text into small units for a detailed,&#xD;
      nuanced account of the data. This iterative process will be concurrent to data collection.&#xD;
      Thematic analysis will be guided by the hybrid approach of inductive and deductive coding and&#xD;
      theme development described by Fereday &amp; Muir-Cochrane (2006). Deductive coding of the&#xD;
      interview transcripts will be done first using the semi-structured interview guide as a&#xD;
      framework; smaller units of data that emerge inductively will be coded for increased&#xD;
      granularity and specificity. To ensure analytic rigor, field notes will be collected during&#xD;
      the data collection and analysis process and coded alongside interview data.&#xD;
