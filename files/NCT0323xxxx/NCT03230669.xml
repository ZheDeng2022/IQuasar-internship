    <textblock>
      Computer-based Training for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT4CBT) is a new on-line&#xD;
      addiction treatment developed by Dr Kathleen Carroll at the Yale School of Medicine in New&#xD;
      Haven, Connecticut. CBT4CBT consists of seven one-hour long online sessions that teach key&#xD;
      concepts, including dealing with cravings, problem solving, and decision making skills, to&#xD;
      help users reduce substance abuse. CBT4CBT has been rigorously tested throughout various&#xD;
      communities in the United States with great success and is currently being rolled out&#xD;
      throughout the States. The therapeutic approach of CBT4CBT is unique as its efficacy,&#xD;
      durability and cost-savings have been proven in several rigorous clinical trials and will be&#xD;
      magnified by the fact that the program can be delivered in Canada, allowing for increased and&#xD;
      continual improvements in population health. CBT4CBT has been accepted by both patients and&#xD;
      addiction treatment personnel alike and has won numerous clinical innovation awards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A collaboration has now been formed between Dr Carroll and Drs Michelle Patterson and Juergen&#xD;
      Krause of the UPEI Centre for Health and Community Research (CHCR) that will bring CBT4CBT to&#xD;
      Canada. While CBT4CBT has previously been tested in urban areas, there are many advantages to&#xD;
      offering computer-based training to more rural populations (such as PEI). These more remote&#xD;
      areas frequently suffer from a lack of services, as well as a lack of continuity with the&#xD;
      services currently offered. CBT4CBT may very well provide that needed continuity to&#xD;
      Addictions treatment and has also been shown to improve retention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CBT4CBT will be the first computer-based, cognitive behavioural therapy program for&#xD;
      Addictions treatment to be offered in Canada. CBT4CBT has been rigorously tested in urban&#xD;
      populations in the United States but this collaboration will be the first pilot trial in&#xD;
      First Nation and other rural communities in Canada. Prince Edward Island has a&#xD;
      self-proclaimed need for innovative new substance abuse treatments and CBT4CBT may provide&#xD;
      the continuity and retention to traditional therapy programs that current available treatment&#xD;
      options often lack. This study will allow CBT4CBT to be tested in several Prince Edward&#xD;
      Island communities to gage its efficacy and effectiveness. The results and feedback received&#xD;
      from the pilot study will allow the program to be adapted for Canadian populations in order&#xD;
      to optimize its positive outcomes within Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBT4CBT has been tested in urban populations in the United States in three rigorous&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials with great success. The nature of CBT4CBT suggests it would also&#xD;
      be beneficial in rural and remote populations which are common across Canada. Computer based&#xD;
      treatments are cost-effective and although their nature necessitates human participants they&#xD;
      have minimal risk associated with them. As the first computer based training for Addictions&#xD;
      in Canada this research project could have broad implications for treatment in Addictions&#xD;
      across our country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis techniques will be based on those used in previous CBT4CBT trials conducted by our&#xD;
      collaborator, Dr Carroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary substance abuse outcomes (self-reported abstinence) will be assessed throughout&#xD;
      the study and through a six month follow-up. Additional outcomes will include use of other&#xD;
      services (medical, legal), patient and provider satisfaction, as well as the costs of&#xD;
      implementing the program. Each week, the counsellors will deliver a questionnaire (provided&#xD;
      by the CHCR) which covers this range of topics to their patient participating in the trial.&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed with a focus on feasibility (retention in both conditions, levels&#xD;
      of substance abuse, health problems, and cost by condition).&#xD;
