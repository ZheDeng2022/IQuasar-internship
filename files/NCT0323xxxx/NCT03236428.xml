  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for Monoclonal Gammopathy of&#xD;
      Unknown Significance (MGUS) or Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Daratumumab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      investigational drug. Preliminary experience suggests that daratumumab may prevent or&#xD;
      postpone SMM from becoming active multiple myeloma. The purpose of this research study is to&#xD;
      determine if the this drug may improve the rate of prevention of multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cell, which is an important part of the immune&#xD;
      system. Patients with active multiple myeloma generally require treatment. There are&#xD;
      currently no approved therapies for smoldering multiple myeloma or Monoclonal Gammopathy of&#xD;
      Unknown Significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daratumumab is a drug that may kill or stop cancer cells from growing through a variety of&#xD;
      mechanisms by attaching to the CD38 molecule, which is over-expressed in multiple myeloma&#xD;
      cells. This type of drug is called a monoclonal antibody. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration) has not approved Daratumumab for the participant specific disease but it has&#xD;
      been approved for use in active Multiple Myeloma.&#xD;

             months before randomization, a history of additional risk factors for torsades de&#xD;

             family history of sudden cardiac death before age 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in other therapeutic clinical trials, including those with other&#xD;
