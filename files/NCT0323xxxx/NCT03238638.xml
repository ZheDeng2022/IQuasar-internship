    <textblock>
      This is a research study to test the combination of two drugs, pembrolizumab and epacadostat&#xD;
      with the goal of benefiting subjects with head and neck cancers where prior or ongoing&#xD;
      regimens with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor for the treatment of advanced head and neck cancer&#xD;
      after platinum failure.&#xD;

      Primary Objective(s) &amp; Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Objective: Response Rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: In patient with prior response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1+ therapy and subsequent&#xD;
      (acquired) resistance combined IDO1 and PD-1 inhibition will re-induce responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: In patients with suboptimal benefit from prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy combined&#xD;
      IDO1 and PD-1 inhibition will induce clinically meaningful responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s) &amp; Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective: 1-year Progression-free (PFS) and Overall (OS) survival Hypothesis: Combined&#xD;
           PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab + epacadostat in HNSCC patients will lead to improved&#xD;
           1-year survival in patients who a) progress on prior anti-PD-1/PD/L1 therapy on, and/or&#xD;
           b) compared to patients who progress on 2nd line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety Hypothesis: Combined treatment with pembrolizumab and epacadostat will be safe&#xD;
           and tolerable in HNSCC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory/Translational Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interferon-gamma Gene Expression Profile (GEP) (Seiwert ASCO 2015, Ribas ASCO 2015) and&#xD;
           evaluation of RR, PFS, and OS in GEP positive and GEP negative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the micro-environment that underlies resistance/suboptimal treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. underlying degree of tumor inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Baseline PD-L1 expression&#xD;
&#xD;
           d) Determine underlying Interferon Gamma signature&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess underlying mutational burden (Snyder 2014)) Preclinical hypothesis: IDO1&#xD;
           inhibition will alter the micro-environment to a be &quot;more T-cell inflamed&quot; and make&#xD;
           tumors amenable to benefit from anti-PD-1 treatment (when given concurrently with IDO1&#xD;
           inhibition). Hence we will evaluate tumors, with prior response exhibiting acquired&#xD;
           resistance as well as tumors with minor/suboptimal benefit from prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy&#xD;
           for evidence (at baseline) of suboptimal immune microenvironmental conditions.&#xD;

             requiring therapy Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally&#xD;
             inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g.,&#xD;
             Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed within 30 days prior to&#xD;
