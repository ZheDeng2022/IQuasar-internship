      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated with surgery alone&#xD;
      remains dismal with a 5 year survival rate between 25% to 80% depending on the tumor stage&#xD;
      and lymph node status. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (Methotrexate, Vinblastine,&#xD;
      Doxorubicin, Cisplatin ; Cisplatin, Methotrexate, Vinblastine; Gemcitabine/Cisplatin) have&#xD;
      demonstrated a modest but absolute benefit in overall survival of 5-8% when administered in&#xD;
      the neoadjuvant setting. Therefore, neoadjuvant Cisplatin-based regimens are regarded as a&#xD;
      standard of care in treating patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, bladder&#xD;
      cancer is a disease of the elderly and due to age-associated factors (e.g. hearing impaired ≥&#xD;
      grade 2), peripheral neuropathy (≥ grade 2), disease associated impairment of renal function&#xD;
      (Glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min) and performance status (ECOG ≥ 2) 30 to 50% are&#xD;
      ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens. Several combinations with Carboplatin&#xD;
      have been tested in single arm, phase II trials in patients ineligible for Cisplatin but no&#xD;
      standard regimen has been established for this patient population thus far. The Guidelines of&#xD;
      the European association of Urology (EAU) do not recommend any neoadjuvant treatment for&#xD;
      Cisplatin-ineligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors like Durvalumab or Azetolizumab, both antibodies&#xD;
      blocking the PD1/PD-L1 interaction, have shown promising results as single agents in terms of&#xD;
      response (15-46%) and tolerability in the metastatic setting of bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of the combination of the&#xD;
      immune-checkpoint inhibitors Durvarlumab and the anti-CTLA4 antibody Tremelimumab in various&#xD;
      solid tumors, including urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is ongoing (protocol D4190C0010).&#xD;
      Blocking the PD1/PD-L1 pathway in combination with an anti-CTLA4 antibody has shown greater&#xD;
      antitumor activity than each antibody alone in malignant melanoma trials and showed a&#xD;
      promising antitumor activity (17% overall response rate, irrespective of the PD-L1 expression&#xD;
      status on tumor cells) in a phase Ib study of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. The&#xD;
      safety profile was acceptable (42% grade 3-4 treatment related adverse events across all&#xD;
      dosing cohorts, most common were diarrhea, colitis and increase lipase), however, the rate of&#xD;
      adverse events (e.g. autoimmune phenomena) and treatment interruptions was higher as compared&#xD;
      to single agent use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary objective of the trial is to assess the safety and antitumor activity of the&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1 antibody Durvalumab in combination with the anti-CTLA4 antibody Tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial study duration encompassed the time from when the participant signs the informed&#xD;
      consent until the last protocol-specific procedure has been completed (Cystectomy between&#xD;
      week 17 to 23). All patients will be followed up for up to 78 weeks after end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the current version of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH-GCP as well as all national legal and regulatory&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
