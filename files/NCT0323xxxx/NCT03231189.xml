  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a patient is newly diagnosed of systolic dysfunction without obvious etiology (such as&#xD;
      rhythmic, ischemic, or valvular disease), most of the time a coronary angiography is&#xD;
      performed. In this situation, the investigators aim to evaluate a strategy with CMR as the&#xD;
      front line exam, and invasive coronary angiography performed only in case of ischemic scar on&#xD;
      CMR&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) is estimated to be present in 3-7% of the&#xD;
      population. With a survival rate between 25-40% at 5 years after a first hospitalization,&#xD;
      prognosis of heart failure is similar to that of most cancers. Its treatment and prognosis&#xD;
      strongly depend on the etiology, and coronary artery disease is the most frequent one.&#xD;
      Identifying coronary artery disease determines care, including medical treatment (aspirin,&#xD;
      statins) and revascularization strategies (stent implantation, coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      grafting). Once an echocardiography has revealed an LV reduction, with no clear etiology at&#xD;
      clinical or echographical examination, coronary angiography is almost systematically&#xD;
      performed. But among the 260,000 invasive coronary angiographies performed each year in&#xD;
      France (all indications included), 30-60% are &quot;normal&quot; (no obstructive coronary artery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      And among patients with unexplained LV dysfunction, this rate reaches 70-74%… Thus the&#xD;
      efficiency of systematic coronary angiography is questionable for these latter. Besides,&#xD;
      angiography is invasive, and associated with multiple risks and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) is very specific and sensitive for detecting&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. Small series concluded that a reduction of LVEF due to coronary artery&#xD;
      stenosis should have at least one myocardial scar, detected on CMR. But the available data&#xD;
      was not enough to change guidelines and clinical practice. In our retrospective study&#xD;
      performed on 305 patients, the sensibility of CMR for coronary stenosis was 96%. Furthermore,&#xD;
      CMR as a first-line exam would have avoided 71% of coronary angiography, saving 216 days of&#xD;
      hospitalization and 329.054 € (1.079€/patient). These results reinforce the previous data but&#xD;
      are not definitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to provide a high level of evidence of the benefits and safety of a&#xD;
      strategy based on CMR as the front line exam for newly diagnosed systolic dysfunctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the sensitivity of CMR for predicting the presence of&#xD;
      angiographically significant coronary artery stenosis in patients with reduced LVEF. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is the sensitivity of CMR for predicting the presence of significant&#xD;
      coronary artery stenosis on coronary angiography in patients with reduced LVEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the economic evaluation is to estimate the incremental (or decremental) cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of using CMR first compared to coronary angiography first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For unexplained LV dysfunction, patient will be addressed for CMR first and coronary&#xD;
      angiography within 2 weeks after (instead of systematic coronary angiography and unsystematic&#xD;
      CMR). CMR and coronary angiography will be performed in all patients. Independent committees&#xD;
      will blindly review CMRs and coronary angiographies at the end of the study.&#xD;

        All patients referred in one of the participating centers for the etiologic assessment of&#xD;
        an unexplained LVEF reduction will be assessed for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A trans-thoracic echocardiography will be performed in the center at the inclusion as&#xD;
        usual, to assess LVEF and confirm the absence of obvious explanation to its reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Standard biological tests (included in the standard biological investigation of dilated&#xD;
        cardiomyopathy) will be performed to exclude any contraindications to coronary angiography&#xD;
        as usual care. They are the same as those required before CMR.&#xD;
