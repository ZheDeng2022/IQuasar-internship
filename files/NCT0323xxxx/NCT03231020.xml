      The purpose of this study is to provide a rich description of the parental perspectives of&#xD;
      utilizing a mHealth application for data transfer during the single ventricle interstage&#xD;
      monitoring period. A gap in the body of knowledge of single ventricle cardiac disease&#xD;
      interstage will be explored with these research questions: 1) How do parents of children (&lt; 5&#xD;
      years of age) with single ventricle disease describe their experiences using a mHealth&#xD;
      application during the interstage period (first 6-12 months of child's life)? And 2) How do&#xD;
      these experiences influence their decision making for use of the mHealth application?&#xD;

      Background Nearly 2,000 infants with single ventricle cardiac disease are born each year in&#xD;
      the United States, and have near certain mortality without surgical intervention. The heart&#xD;
      with this congenital disease can never be converted to a four-chambered heart but rather, a&#xD;
      palliative three-staged surgical strategy has been designed to maintain both circulation to&#xD;
      the body and lungs without a pump. After an initial neonatal surgery, most infants are&#xD;
      discharged home and return for a second surgery around six months of life. The time occurring&#xD;
      between surgeries is known as the interstage period. This interstage period is very high risk&#xD;
      and high demand time for parents, and there is a mortality rate during the interstage ranging&#xD;
      from 2-20%, often from unknown reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a specific type of single ventricle disease that is&#xD;
      one of the most complex forms of congenital heart disease. Publications have focused on&#xD;
      improving the care of infants with HLHS using a Quality Improvement Model with the National&#xD;
      Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative (NPCQIC) through reduced variation,&#xD;
      best practices, and transparency. The concept of interstage home monitoring to reduce&#xD;
      mortality also was primarily focused on infants with only HLHS until recently when the focus&#xD;
      was made onto comprehensive care from birth to 1 year of age. Hemodynamic data such as oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, heart rate, intake, and overall status from a parental perspective were used to&#xD;
      promote communication and attempts of early recognition of deterioration in this high-risk&#xD;
      population. A strong set of qualitative studies have come from Rempel et al. in Canada on a&#xD;
      cross-section of mainly white married parents of infants with HLHS and their parenting&#xD;
      experience. Parenting under Pressure and the Facets of parenting a child with HLHS were&#xD;
      studies which used the grounded theory approach and provided substantial additions to our&#xD;
      knowledge of the interstage HLHS parenting experience. The basis of much of the care for all&#xD;
      types of single ventricle cardiac disease at home is found from the care of HLHS and applied&#xD;
      to infants with all types of single ventricle anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most hospitals with pediatric cardiac surgery programs have interstage home monitoring&#xD;
      programs for high risk infants with single ventricle heart disease to provide care and&#xD;
      support for infants with all types of single ventricle cardiac disease. Education for&#xD;
      caregivers of infants with single ventricle disease include guidelines to call health care&#xD;
      providers (HCPs) in cases of hemodynamic interstage concerns, and symptom management&#xD;
      questions, based on home monitoring of oxygen saturation and weight gain. There are&#xD;
      variations in the staffing structure between pediatric hospitals but the programs often&#xD;
      include care coordination and education by a nurse or advanced practice nurse communicating&#xD;
      with parents in a reactive model waiting for data to be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mHealth is defined through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as the use of mobile and&#xD;
      wireless devices to improve health outcomes, service, and research. The use of applications&#xD;
      is widespread in adult care with estimated 40,000 health-care applications available. Some&#xD;
      studies in pediatric medical homes have shown association of mHealth with adherence and&#xD;
      self-monitoring to improved outcomes. mHealth innovations like the Cardiac High Acuity&#xD;
      Monitoring Program (CHAMP) and other applications work most effectively when caregivers and&#xD;
      interstage programs work together to improve care and are a focus of future research from the&#xD;
      National Institute of Nursing Research. Much of the recent interstage literature focuses on&#xD;
      mortality and weight measures with little focus on expanding types of outcomes to the&#xD;
      parental and interstage teams' perspectives and phenomena like infant development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent developments in technology can provide a proactive means for data transfer for home&#xD;
      symptom monitoring so the interstage nursing team can review trends and provide proactive&#xD;
      monitoring for infants in the interstage. Since 2012, two pilot studies have been published&#xD;
      illustrating varying types of mHealth for the interstage with outcomes of improved somatic&#xD;
      growth and an improved system of interstage data review but did not show significant&#xD;
      mortality improvements. An innovative mHealth technology, CHAMP, was begun in 2014 for&#xD;
      interstage home monitoring symptom management and found improved interstage mortality&#xD;
      outcomes compared with historical controls. Research gaps remain in the role of adherence in&#xD;
      this population to the mHealth technology and the parental experience of utilizing these&#xD;
      innovative methods for communication with the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale The purpose of this study is to provide a rich description of the parental&#xD;
      perspectives of utilizing a mHealth application for data transfer during the single ventricle&#xD;
      interstage monitoring period for infants with congenital heart disease. The use of the case&#xD;
      study design in healthcare has been encouraged by Robert Yin because it adapts to the&#xD;
      complexity of interactions in a system that may be rapidly changing. Yin's qualitative case&#xD;
      research &quot;design propositions&quot;, presented below for this study, are applied to the literature&#xD;
      and the PI's professional experience to focus the scope of the study and improve feasibility&#xD;
      of completion of this qualitative case study approach research study. Propositions in this&#xD;
      type of qualitative design are similar to hypothesis in quantitative designs to help&#xD;
      formulate themes emerging from the data. The use of propositions may help with contributions&#xD;
      for the body of knowledge after generalizing case study analysis, especially in cases of&#xD;
      critical or extreme cases. Comparative analysis of the theoretical target (non-adherent&#xD;
      parents) and rival cases (adherent parents) within the case study are improved with study&#xD;
      propositions to guide the organization of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Propositions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The parental perspectives of the interstage period will influence the use of a home&#xD;
           monitoring mHealth technology&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parental perception of non-adherence of CHAMP and communication to the clinical team&#xD;
           will match the actual non-adherence patterns of the mHealth innovation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The use of Cardiac High Acuity Monitoring Program (CHAMP) application from the parental&#xD;
           perspective will benefit future improvements in this technology&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parents of infants with single ventricle will report the interstage report as a&#xD;
           stressful time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. The proposed research study uses a comparative case study methodology, utilizing&#xD;
      multiple sources of data to deeply examine 8-10 &quot;cases,&quot; each of which is defined as&#xD;
      parent(s) of a child (&lt; 5 years of age) with single ventricle disease who used the mHealth&#xD;
      application. One group of cases (4-5) will have used the mHealth application less than&#xD;
      recommended (non-adherent to the home monitoring recommendations) or declined to use the&#xD;
      application and returned it before the end of the interstage period. The other group of&#xD;
      comparison cases (4-5 cases) will have used the application as recommended by the clinical&#xD;
      team (adherent) and continued doing so through the interstage period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yin defines various types of cases, including, explanatory or causal case studies,&#xD;
      descriptive case studies, and exploratory case studies. The cases in this study are&#xD;
      exploratory in that they focus on &quot;what&quot; can be learned from these cases of using a novel&#xD;
      mHealth innovation and the CHAMP care team as a unit. Across the U.S., nearly 2,000 infants&#xD;
      are born with single ventricle cardiac disease each year but the actual experience at home is&#xD;
      difficult to comprehend. The research design is a multiple case study design with embedded&#xD;
      units of non-adherent and adherent cases of parental use of CHAMP within the larger case&#xD;
      group through the CHAMP Clinic at Children's Mercy Kansas City.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources will include semi-structured interviews with parents that include observations&#xD;
      of simulated home monitoring equipment and processes that had been previously used including&#xD;
      location, time of day, and frequency.&#xD;

        Purposeful sampling will be used for recruiting among the first 80 infants from that used&#xD;
        Cardiac High Acuity Monitoring Program (CHAMP) mHealth. All single and dual parent case&#xD;
        sets will be recruited from a single tertiary center's pediatric cardiology department that&#xD;
        used a mHealth application during the interstage period with the single ventricle team&#xD;
        clinic known as CHAMP. Thus a case will be defined as the parent(s) of a single ventricle&#xD;
        child who utilized CHAMP to monitor their baby at home during interstage with preliminary&#xD;
        screening from the CHAMP Webportal through Children's Mercy Kansas City.&#xD;
