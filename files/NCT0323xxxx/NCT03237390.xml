    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ribociclib and gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body. Ribociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ribociclib and gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the dose-limiting toxicities and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose of the combination of ribociclib and gemcitabine hydrochloride&#xD;
      (gemcitabine) in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the safety and tolerability of the combination of ribociclib and gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) of ribociclib in combination with gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe preliminary evidence of efficacy of the combination of ribociclib and&#xD;
      gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the correlation of CDK4/6, cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 amplification,&#xD;
      retinoblastoma (RB) and P16 expression in archived and biopsied tumor tissue with treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8&#xD;
      and ribociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 8-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>Number and severity of all adverse events (overall, by dose-level, and by tumor group) will be tabulated and summarized. Adverse events that are classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. Non-hematologic toxicities will be evaluated via the ordinal Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) standard toxicity grading. Hematologic toxicity measures of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia will be assessed using continuous variables as the outcome measures (primarily nadir) as well as categorization via CTC standard toxicity grading.

    <description>A population PK model will be developed utilizing the PK time points collected, and then used to estimate individual area under the curves or clearance of ribociclib in combination with gemcitabine hydrochloride.
