      This phase I trial studies the side effects of CD19/CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T&#xD;
      cells when given together with chemotherapy, and to see how well they work in treating&#xD;
      patients with CD19 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or B acute lymphoblastic leukemia&#xD;
      that has come back or does not respond to treatment. A CAR is a genetically-engineered&#xD;
      receptor made so that immune cells (T cells) can attack cancer cells by recognizing and&#xD;
      responding to the CD19/CD22 proteins. These proteins are commonly found on diffuse large&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma and B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Giving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells and chemotherapy may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the feasibility of producing CD19/CD22-CAR T cells meeting the established&#xD;
      release criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the safety of administering escalating doses of autologous CD19/CD22-CAR T cells&#xD;
      that meet established release specifications in adults with hematologic malignancies&#xD;
      following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine phosphate (fludarabine) conditioning regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the ability of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells to mediate clinical activity in adults with&#xD;
      B cell malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the frequency of CD22+ expression on lymphoma cells, and determine site density&#xD;
      when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Analyze alterations in early B cell development induced by immune pressure exerted via&#xD;
      CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate whether subjects receiving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells relapse with loss or&#xD;
      diminished expression of CD19 and/or CD22, when feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Measure persistence of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells in the blood, bone marrow and cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF), and explore correlations between anti CD19/CD22-CAR T cell properties and CAR T&#xD;
      cell efficacy and persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Establish the utility of chromatin structure and epigenomic technology to characterize CAR&#xD;
      T cell therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and fludarabine&#xD;
      phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -3. Patients then receive CD19/CD22-CAR T cells IV&#xD;
      over 10-20 minutes on day 0. Patients that benefited from the first dose of CD19/CD22-CAR T&#xD;
      cells, had no unacceptable side effects, and have enough cells left over may receive 2 or 3&#xD;
      additional doses of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up daily until day 14, twice per&#xD;
      week until day 28, at 2 months, at 3 months, every 3 months until month 12, every 6-12 months&#xD;
      up to year 5, and then annually for years 6-15.&#xD;
