  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify novel predictors of vascular access success or failure in&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease patients. Despite efforts to improve placement of arteriovenous&#xD;
      fistula (AVF) the primary failure rates are reported as high as 20-50%, but standard tools&#xD;
      like ultrasound cannot inform the clinician sufficiently to accurately predict success or&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to perform enhanced assessments of arterial health preoperatively&#xD;
      and correlate these measurements with vascular lesions (microscopic tissue changes and&#xD;
      monocyte infiltration) and early AVF outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation of monocytes in uremia condition is responsible for endothelium dysfunction,&#xD;
      intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis. The investigators expect that stiff arteries caused&#xD;
      by monocyte dysfunction refer to the poor distensability and probably longer maturation time.&#xD;

      Research Project Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with progressive chronic kidney disease the definitive treatment is a renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy. One of the methods is hemodialysis, which is frequently chosen in&#xD;
      patients above 65y. of age. Several clinical practice guidelines recommend an arteriovenous&#xD;
      fistula (AVF), rather than a central venous catheter or arteriovenous graft, as the preferred&#xD;
      access for maintenance hemodialysis (HD) therapy. Despite efforts to improve placement of AVF&#xD;
      in both the hemodialysis incident and prevalent population, many patients continue dialysis&#xD;
      through a central venous catheter, exposing them to higher risks of infection, co-morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in comparison to use an AVF for HD. Furthermore, AVF primary failure rates are&#xD;
      reportedly as high in 20-50% in published series confirming that ultrasound cannot&#xD;
      sufficiently inform the clinician to accurately predict success or failure. Because of higher&#xD;
      risk of early AVF failure offering this type of access is questionable in diabetics,&#xD;
      unfavorable artery/vein diameter and elderly people. To perform hemodialysis vascular access&#xD;
      ensuring adequate blood flow is required. Such access is most commonly obtained by the&#xD;
      creation of the vascular connection between an artery and a vein on the upper limb. Recent&#xD;
      data from European and National registries clearly indicate huge increase of incident&#xD;
      dialysis patients above 65y. In older patients with many co-morbidities and limited&#xD;
      predictive survival decision whether to start dialysis, when and how should be cautious. When&#xD;
      choosing vascular access fistula non-maturation problem must be taken into account. The&#xD;
      successful creation of a permanent vascular access depends on vessel health, patient&#xD;
      characteristics and possibly genetic factors. In patients with end stage renal disease&#xD;
      circulating monocytes are activated and proinflammatory monocytes are expanded. Recent data&#xD;
      indicates that uremic conditions drive monocytes to differentiate and interact with artery&#xD;
      wall promoting atherosclerosis. This interaction can be studied in the laboratory by testing&#xD;
      inﬂammatory activity of THP-1 monocytes and by checking proatherosclerotic and calcification&#xD;
      markers in the artery specimen (taken during AVF creation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis: monocytes activation and advancement of vascular lesions affect the&#xD;
      process of remodeling (maturation) of arteriovenous fistula, determines its usability&#xD;
      (functionality). The investigators also hypothesize that an increase in the collagen content&#xD;
      of the vascular media (medial fibrosis) preoperatively would impair vascular dilation and&#xD;
      thereby, limit the postoperative increase in arteriovenous fistula diameter, blood flow and&#xD;
      finally AVF maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working second hypothesis: the metrical age of patient with mild to moderate vascular lesions&#xD;
      is not limiting factor in AVF success rate and maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is assessment of changes in the vessels and monocyte activation and&#xD;
      its impact on the ability to create AVF and its usability for hemodialysis. Secondary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to perform enhanced assessments of arterial health preoperatively&#xD;
      and correlate these measurements with vascular lesions. The investigators intend to perform&#xD;
      preoperative vascular mapping, flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and assess endothelial&#xD;
      function. These non invasive measurements will provide a more accurate picture of overall&#xD;
      vascular health prior to AVF formation with the ultimate intention of informing the clinician&#xD;
      as to the likelihood of success or failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be subjects of a thorough evaluation of the morphological and functional&#xD;
      state of upper limb vessels by the techniques presented in the methodology of the study. The&#xD;
      study plan foresees the recruitment of patients, whose will have their vessels of the upper&#xD;
      limbs carried out in-depth assessment. Then creation of the vascular access - arteriovenous&#xD;
      fistula for dialysis, will be performed. Arterial and venous specimens will be sampled during&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula surgery. Its maturation will be evaluated in a conventional manner&#xD;
      (functional fistula allowing delivery of adequate dialysis dose) as well as using criteria&#xD;
      mentioned in the publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Prospective study with recruitment of consecutive approximately 30 patients with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease stage 4 or 5, who will be referred for vascular access creation for&#xD;
      hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion: (1) Aged &gt;18 years, (2) Has chronic kidney disease with estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;20 mL/min/1.73 m2 , (3) Is undergoing AVF creation with venous&#xD;
      end-to-arterial side anastomosis in the upper extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion: (1) Heart failure of New York Heart Association functional class III or IV, and&#xD;
      (2) Episode of cardio- or cerebrovascular event or receiving intervention therapy within 3&#xD;
      months prior to screening. The need for any interventional procedure (surgery or angioplasty)&#xD;
      to correct an occlusive or malfunctioning fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining an informed consent to participate in the study each participant will be&#xD;
      tested with followed measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical characteristic will be collected during interview (family longevity,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, history of vein cannulation) and based on medical records (cardiac events&#xD;
      including angiographic studies, cancer, diabetes, peripheral artery diseases, dementia and&#xD;
      other co-morbidities. Physical examination focused on heart function (blood pressure in two&#xD;
      positions, heart rate, congestion in auscultation and chest as well as vascular anatomy&#xD;
      examination with Allen test (patency of palmar arch), pulse presence, veins patency with and&#xD;
      without stasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound condition of vessel will be evaluated prior AVF creation (upper arms flow,&#xD;
      diameter of arteries and veins, possible stenosis, etc) and in follow up period (day 1, 14,&#xD;
      30). In selected cases (history of previous subclavian vein catheterization, collateral&#xD;
      circulation developed) venography will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histomorphology and immunomorphology of the vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial and venous specimens will be stained. Following markers will be used for&#xD;
      immunomorphology assessment. Pro-atherosclerotic molecules (ACE/ACE2, VCAM-1, ICAM-1)&#xD;
      expression in artery and vein (1-2mm section taken during surgery) which undergo immediate&#xD;
      freezing. Masson's trichrome-staining of samples will be used to quantify medial fibrosis&#xD;
      (collagen) both the artery and the vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood parameters for circulating molecules/cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken at routine control, or before routine dialysis session in HD&#xD;
      patients (referred for AVF placement). Samples will be collected and stored before the AVF.&#xD;
      Following vascular biomarkers will be assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays:ADMA and&#xD;
      sICAM1, sVCAM1. For HO-1 gene polymorphism genotyping blood sample will be collected ones. It&#xD;
      will be evaluated by Real Time PCR (frozen DNA samples).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukocytic RNA, serum and isolation of primary human monocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for RNA and serum isolation will be obtained from ESRD/HD patients. Blood&#xD;
      samples for leukocytic RNA isolation will be drawn into Tempus Blood RNA Tubes (Life&#xD;
      Technologies). Total RNA is isolated with Tempus Spin RNA Isolation Kits according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). Transcripts of genes related to&#xD;
      calcification (osteopontin, osteokalcin, RunX2), inflammation (TNFa, IL6) and atherosclerosis&#xD;
      (ACE/ACE2, VCAM-1, ICAM-1) processes will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adhesion and transmigration assays&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another in vitro test is designed for adhesion/invasion of THP-1 monocytes. It will test&#xD;
      aggressive properties of monocytes infiltration endothelium. Adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to&#xD;
      endothelial HUVEC monolayers and all transmigration assays will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular Functional tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of measures are available to assess vascular function (and predict cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk) such as flow mediated dilation (FMD) or peak blood flow (PBF) of the brachial artery.&#xD;
      FMD provides an assessment of macrovascular endothelial cell function. Healthy endothelium&#xD;
      releases a potent vasodilator (nitric oxide, NO) in response to ischemic stress such as cuff&#xD;
      occlusion of the brachial artery. FMD is a measure of the change in the brachial artery&#xD;
      diameter in response to cuff occlusion and subsequent NO release. Whereas FMD reflects the&#xD;
      ability of a large artery to vasodilate, the subsequent change in blood flow that ensues&#xD;
      represents the health of the peripheral resistance vessels or microvascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Above mentioned vascular tests will be conducted to assess endothelial dysfunction. The&#xD;
      absolute increase in diameter after ischemia (BAD, brachial artery diameter), peak blood flow&#xD;
      (PBF) and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) will be performed on both arms at day 0 (pre AVF&#xD;
      creation), and then at day 1, 14-28 (opposite to AVF arm). The measurement will be performed&#xD;
      according to published standard protocol for FMD measurement using Aloka alpha 7 USG device&#xD;
      with Doppler linear probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine laboratory parameters collected at baseline and during follow-up (14-28, 56-60, 90&#xD;
      day): Complete blood counts with focus on neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), phosphorus,&#xD;
      calcium, PTH, C-reactive protein (CRP), urea acid, lipids (cholesterol fractions,&#xD;
      triglycerides).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants data from recruitment and follow up will be collected in special designed&#xD;
      computer program. The primary outcome of this study is AVF success (patent and mature) at 8&#xD;
      and 14 weeks post creation. Baseline patient characteristics including age, gender and&#xD;
      co-morbidities will be compared between the patients with successful AVF and those with&#xD;
      unsuccessful AVF. Categorical variables will be presented by frequency (percentage) and&#xD;
      comparisons will be made via the Chi-square or Fisher's Exact test. Underlying distributions&#xD;
      of continuous variables will be tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and then&#xD;
      analyzed with appropriate tests. All analyses will be performed by external statistical&#xD;
      laboratory with high references. The professional statistical expertise is planned (PREST&#xD;
      laboratory at Mathematical Institute in Wroclaw) with utilization of R package and STATISTICA&#xD;
      10 software.&#xD;
