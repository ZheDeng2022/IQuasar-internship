      Purpose: To determine whether exposure to levels of fine particles that are close to the&#xD;
      current standard will cause cardiovascular changes in healthy individuals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Air pollution is associated with several adverse health outcomes. Specifically, ambient fine&#xD;
      particulate matter ≤2.5 μg/m3 (PM2.5) is associated with increased mortality and increased&#xD;
      risk for respiratory and cardiovascular disease It has been estimated that worldwide over 3.2&#xD;
      million premature deaths and over 74 million years of healthy life lost were attributable to&#xD;
      ambient particulate matter pollution, making it one of the top global health risk factors .&#xD;
      Further, an estimated 22% of disability-adjusted life-years for heart disease are&#xD;
      attributable to ambient particulate matter pollution. Similarly, it is estimated that air&#xD;
      pollution exposure contributed to about 6% (3.7 million) of all deaths in 2012, with 40% of&#xD;
      those coming from coronary artery disease (CAD). More than 100 time-series and case-crossover&#xD;
      analyses have demonstrated associations of short term PM2.5 exposure with myocardial&#xD;
      infarctions (MIs); aggravated asthma and increased risk for hospitalizations and mortality.&#xD;
      These studies suggest that the acute health effects of air pollution particularly affect&#xD;
      infants and children, older adults, and those with underlying disease, such as diabetes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (Pope, 2014). In healthy and younger individuals (&lt;65 year old) these&#xD;
      same studies observe associations between air pollution and subclinical biomarkers of&#xD;
      inflammation, coagulation and oxidative stress but not for any clinical outcomes. This has&#xD;
      led the American Heart Association to state that&quot; Despite theoretical statistical risks&#xD;
      ascribed to all individuals, this elevated risk from exposure is not equally distributed&#xD;
      within a population. At present-day levels, PM2.5 likely poses an acute threat principally to&#xD;
      susceptible people, even if seemingly healthy, such as the elderly and those with&#xD;
      (unrecognized) existing coronary artery or structural heart disease.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled human exposure studies are a critical component of the health risk assessment for&#xD;
      ozone because of their ability to establish exposure-response relationships at low doses and&#xD;
      have therefore weighed heavily in deliberations when the U.S. EPA has considered the National&#xD;
      Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). In contrast, for PM2.5, controlled exposure studies&#xD;
      have been used primarily to demonstrate biological plausibility. that is the potential for&#xD;
      particulate matter to exert extra-pulmonary effects. These studies have shown that healthy&#xD;
      volunteers primarily exhibit mild pulmonary inflammation, decreases in heart rate variability&#xD;
      and changes in blood factors associated with blood coagulation following exposure to&#xD;
      concentrated air particles (CAPs), most show no change in lung function and none result in&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmia. Nearly all these studies have been conducted at realistic but high levels&#xD;
      of PM2.5 (typically above 100 µg/m3). Currently the EPA 24-hour fine particle standard is&#xD;
      35µg/m3, a value based predominantly on epidemiologic studies. While epidemiologic studies&#xD;
      suggest that similar effects can occur at lower levels, it is difficult for these association&#xD;
      studies to conclusively demonstrate because of the problems in disassociating the effects of&#xD;
      PM2.5 from other pollutants and confounders. Only a controlled human exposure study can&#xD;
      determine directly whether PM2.5 can alter cardiovascular endpoints at lower concentrations.&#xD;
      Four hours represents a typical exposure duration to particulate matter during the course of&#xD;
      the day.&#xD;
