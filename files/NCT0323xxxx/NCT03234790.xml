  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strong scientific understanding of how emissions from diesel engines impact the lungs could&#xD;
      improve policies and regulations protecting workers exposed to diesel exhaust. Accordingly,&#xD;
      we are recruiting healthy volunteers who are non-smokers to participate in our study.&#xD;
      Volunteers sit in a room for four hours and breathe either clean filtered air or air that&#xD;
      contains pollution at various concentrations similar to occupational settings such as bus and&#xD;
      ferry terminals where diesel engines are used. A respirologist assesses the volunteer's lung&#xD;
      health and clinical samples are taken. We are equipped with advanced molecular biology tools&#xD;
      to measure different molecules and compare samples from our volunteer subjects following&#xD;
      exposure to clean air or diesel exhaust. Our research aim is to find a simple, clinically&#xD;
      relevant strategy that can be used to measure the impact of diesel exhaust on workers' lung&#xD;
      health. This knowledge will empower regulators, companies, and ultimately workers to better&#xD;
      manage their health risks. Our research aims to provide specific data to help regulators to&#xD;
      make informed decisions about the risks of diesel exhaust exposure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Purpose: Over 100,000 employees in Alberta are inadvertently exposed to diesel exhaust&#xD;
           at work because of wide use of diesel engines in vehicles and machines used in road&#xD;
           construction, trucking, forestry, oil extraction and mineral mining. Although ambient&#xD;
           air monitoring of DE exposure exists in some occupational settings, ambient air&#xD;
           monitoring depends heavily on surrogate models and may yield a distorted picture of past&#xD;
           exhaust exposure. Thus, a clear exposure limit based on bio-monitoring is needed to&#xD;
           adequately protect the workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective: Our research aims to establish the relationship between exposure&#xD;
           concentration and biological effect as an aid to determination of reference ranges for&#xD;
           acceptable exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypotheses and Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1: Diesel exhaust (DE) inhalation elicits a characteristic protein output, in&#xD;
           a dose-dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 1. Demonstrate, using a proteomic analysis of serum and urine, a signature that&#xD;
           acutely increases in response to a range of occupationally relevant DE concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2: DE inhalation increases concentrations of metabolites of polyaromatic&#xD;
           hydrocarbons (PAH) in urine, in a dose-dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 2. Ascertain the range of PAH metabolites accumulation in urine following acute&#xD;
           exposure to a range of occupationally relevant DE concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 3: DE inhalation alters the airway responsiveness to a contractile stimulus,&#xD;
           in a dose-dependent manner, and that alteration is associated with changes in a combined&#xD;
           proteomic/PAH-metabolomic signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 3: Determine the dose-response slope to methacholine, in response to a range of&#xD;
           occupationally relevant DE concentrations, and correlate changes in this slope to&#xD;
           changes in proteins and metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additionally, we aim to establish the relationship between a range of controlled DE&#xD;
           exposure concentrations and sleep quality and breathing in sleep through the sub-study&#xD;
           component.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our work will inform decision makers and stakeholders in creating evidence-based&#xD;
           policies to limit occupational diesel exhaust exposure based on relevant biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is an order-randomized, double-blinded, crossover human exposure study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This project aims to determine markers of DE exposure that can be used in an&#xD;
           occupational setting. Therefore, we will use a range of occupational exposure levels to&#xD;
           appropriately contextualize our results. For this, 20 healthy participants will be&#xD;
           exposed to a control condition and 3 different levels of DE concentration, each for a&#xD;
           period of 4 hours, in a randomized order. Each exposure will be separated by a washout&#xD;
           period of two weeks. The levels will be DE titrated to 20, 50 and 150 ug/m3 PM2.5, and&#xD;
           the control exposure will be filtered air (FA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will undergo a methacholine challenge and will provide urine and blood&#xD;
           samples before and after exposures to analyze lung function and biological responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If participants consent to participation in the sleep sub-study, they will be provided&#xD;
           with additional questionnaires throughout their visits pertaining to their sleep&#xD;
           quality. The participants will be provided with an Alice NightOne sleep monitor and&#xD;
           instructions on how to operate the equipment. The sleep monitor will be hooked up by the&#xD;
           participant at home when they are about to sleep, following an exposure, and will&#xD;
           monitor their sleep patterns for that night.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the changes in clinical parameters (methacholine PC20 and dose response slope) and&#xD;
      serum blood protein abundance between pre- and post-exposure will be determined. These&#xD;
      'delta' values will be statistically compared across exposures using linear mixed effects&#xD;
      models using R program, as outlined in our previous publications from similarly-designed&#xD;
      protocols from our group. Values of p&lt;0.05 will be considered significant throughout, with&#xD;
      adjustments for multiple comparisons. Although the 2-week washout period is intended to&#xD;
      minimize the likelihood of carryover effects, we will formally assess for this by including a&#xD;
      term for order of exposures in the models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses for the sleep component will be performed at the Hospital of Ottawa and will be&#xD;
      completed through a linear or logistic mixed effects model, as applicable using the R&#xD;
      program. Similar methods to data collected from the main study. Data interpretation will be&#xD;
      completed through a software algorithm on the local server.&#xD;
