    <textblock>
      This study is a large multi-centre collaboration between a busy regional paediatric intensive&#xD;
      care transport service (Children's Acute Transport Service, CATS), four large paediatric&#xD;
      intensive care units (PICUs at Great Ormond Street Hospital, St Mary's Hospital and Royal&#xD;
      London Hospital in London, and Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge) and the Department of&#xD;
      Paediatrics at Imperial College, London. CATS transports over 800 sick children on life&#xD;
      support to the three PICUs each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to improve our understanding of the genetic basis and biological pathways by which&#xD;
      children with acute infection or injury become critically ill and develop failure of vital&#xD;
      organs, and how these factors influence outcome. We will establish well-characterised cohorts&#xD;
      of sick children with diverse pathologies, in whom blood, urine and other samples will be&#xD;
      collected at an early stage of critical illness. Samples will be analysed using genomic,&#xD;
      transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic approaches. Advanced bioinformatics techniques will&#xD;
      be used to identify biomarkers for early diagnosis and robust risk stratification. We will&#xD;
      focus on biomarkers to help distinguish between serious bacterial infections, viral&#xD;
      infections and other causes of critical illness; diagnose incipient organ failure; and&#xD;
      accurately identify, early on, children at high risk of developing a poor outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit critically ill children at first contact with the CATS team, during emergency&#xD;
      transport to PICU. Due to the emergency nature of the research, and minimal risk associated&#xD;
      with the study procedure, we will seek deferred, written informed consent from&#xD;
      parents/guardians once their child has been stabilised, within 24-48 hours following PICU&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By studying these important questions, we aim to better understand how we can diagnose and&#xD;
      provide early life-saving treatments to critically ill children. The research team have an&#xD;
      established track record of successful completion of several large clinical studies in&#xD;
      critical care as well as validation of biomarkers in other diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study involving the collection of clinical data and biological&#xD;
      samples. No interventions will be performed on patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection Blood and urine samples will be collected at two time points. Stool and&#xD;
      throat swabs will also be collected if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timepoint 1: During stabilisation by the CATS team (first contact with an intensive care&#xD;
      team) The CATS team will collect samples during routine sampling, prioritised in the&#xD;
      following order: DNA (2 ml); RNA (2 ml); Serum (2 ml); Plasma (2 ml) and Urine (10 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timepoint 2: Within 24-48 hours of PICU admission The research team in the participating PICU&#xD;
      will collect samples during routine sampling, prioritised in the following order: DNA (2 ml);&#xD;
      RNA (2 ml); Serum (2 ml); Plasma (2 ml) and Urine (10 ml). In addition, stool and throat swab&#xD;
      samples will be collected on the PICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In infants less than 10 kg in weight, we will restrict total blood volume collected at each&#xD;
      time point to 0.8 ml/kg body weight, in line with MCRN Clinical Trials Guidelines, 25 July&#xD;
      2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, faecal samples will be collected on admission to PICU (day 1) and 24-48 hours&#xD;
      after PICU admission. If faeces are not available, an anal swab will be taken for&#xD;
      microbiological analysis. SCFA will be measured on the first available faecal sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample transport, processing and storage Samples will be transported by the CATS team to the&#xD;
      admitting PICUs in cool boxes (4Â°C). Sample processing and storage will occur at the hospital&#xD;
      where the patient is admitted. Processing will include anonymisation of the sample by&#xD;
      generating a unique study number, which will be used for all references to the samples&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data collection A standardised case report form and data collection manual with&#xD;
      definitions and rules will be produced. Data will be collected by research staff at each&#xD;
      unit. Clinical data will cover the key stages of the patient's pathway - intensive care&#xD;
      referral and transport, PICU course and outcome. We will perform detailed clinical&#xD;
      phenotyping of the patient, including reason for PICU referral/admission (infection, trauma,&#xD;
      neurological, cardiac, respiratory and other), severity of illness (PIM-2 score), severity of&#xD;
      organ failure (PELOD) and outcome at discharge from PICU (death, severe disability).&#xD;
      Recognising that short-term outcome at PICU discharge may not be the most meaningful outcome&#xD;
      for parents/carers, or provide an accurate picture of long-term outcome in children, we will&#xD;
      also seek parents/carers' consent to be contacted 1 year after PICU admission to complete&#xD;
      short questionnaires to assess the child's functional status and quality of life.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be either administered by telephone, email or web-based means, depending&#xD;
      on parental preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where possible, in order to avoid duplication of effort, clinical data from CATS retrieval&#xD;
      and PICU admission will be obtained by electronic linkage from the paediatric intensive care&#xD;
      national clinical audit (PICANet, University of Leeds and Leicester). Data linkage will be&#xD;
      performed using the CATS retrieval number, at the end of the study period. Collection of&#xD;
      these data will follow a standard procedure - any transfer of data (requests for data and the&#xD;
      return of the full dataset) will be performed securely (with full encryption).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Initially, each type of information, i.e. genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic,&#xD;
      epigenetic, clinical will be analyzed separately to identify associations and correlations at&#xD;
      a first stage. Differential behaviour and association patterns will be derived by various&#xD;
      statistical and bioinformatic analyses, both univariate and multivariate, as described above.&#xD;
      At a second stage, information will be combined across datatypes into predictive models. A&#xD;
      systems biology approach will be employed in which networks of co-regulated genetic,&#xD;
      transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenetic modules will be constructed in both case and control&#xD;
      cohorts. Network connections which will be different between cases and controls will be&#xD;
      identified as &quot;predictors&quot; of the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graphical modelling will be used to visualize those complex networks. Heavy statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be required to identify the most influential connections that once removed they&#xD;
      would have the greatest impact on the network topology. Models will be refined, re-evaluated,&#xD;
      validated and replicated across the different disease cohorts until the best possible out of&#xD;
      sample classification is achieved. The expertise of the mathematical and statistical group&#xD;
      will provide the ability to link the multiple layers of biological information from DNA to&#xD;
      phenotype into a network systems biology approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size No formal sample size calculations are possible but we will recruit a minimum&#xD;
      number of patients in each group of interest. We aim to recruit adequate numbers of patients&#xD;
      with different reasons for intensive care admission into the study (50-80 patients per group&#xD;
      of interest).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration Patient recruitment will take place over a 24 month period, with a 6 month&#xD;
      lead in time for staff training and 6 months lead out time for patient follow up and&#xD;
      completion of databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment Eligible patients will be recruited to the study during transport by&#xD;
      medical and nursing staff from the CATS intensive care transport team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting procedure We will seek deferred written informed consent from parents/guardians&#xD;
      once their child's condition stabilises, usually within 24-48 hours following PICU admission.&#xD;
      The consent process will be supported by Patient Information Leaflets. There are several&#xD;
      precedents for this approach in emergency research, including in paediatric intensive care.&#xD;
      Support for deferred consent in urgent life-threatening situations is also provided through&#xD;
      the latest EU Regulation on Clinical Trials (2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main reasons for seeking deferred consent in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical: Emergency intensive care transport of children represents an urgent situation&#xD;
           where life-saving treatment cannot be delayed and transport to a PICU needs to be&#xD;
           undertaken rapidly. In addition, parents/guardians may not be present at the time of&#xD;
           stabilisation to discuss consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Practical: Taking an additional staff member for the transport purely for research&#xD;
           consent is not feasible due to the limited space in the ambulance. The 24/7 nature of&#xD;
           the CATS service and the fact that multiple transports occur concurrently also makes&#xD;
           having dedicated research staff impractical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methodological: Difficulties in obtaining full informed consent may result in selection&#xD;
           bias being introduced. In addition, if study samples are not taken at an early stage of&#xD;
           critical illness, before treatments (such as fluids or inotropes) are initiated,&#xD;
           deriving robust biomarkers of critical illness may be flawed. While methodological&#xD;
           issues cannot provide an argument for including data when research subjects expressly&#xD;
           deny consent, it does make an ethically valid case for including samples or data&#xD;
           collected before consent has been taken, and where such explicit denial of consent does&#xD;
           not exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ethical: Due to the difficulties of obtaining informed consent in emergency situation,&#xD;
           the sickest patients are often subjected to anecdotal medical practice. It may be&#xD;
           unethical to deny sick children the benefits of new research and therapeutic strategies&#xD;
           based on the most robust scientific understanding of critical illness, which is what our&#xD;
           study aims to advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If parents/guardians do not wish to consent or are unable to consent, or staff are unable to&#xD;
      make contact with parents/guardians, the samples will be discarded and no clinical data will&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
