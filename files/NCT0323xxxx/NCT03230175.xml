  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that application of the human placental umbilical cord tissue TTAX01 to&#xD;
      the surface of a well debrided, complex diabetic foot ulcer will, with concomitant management&#xD;
      of infection, result in a higher proportion of wounds showing complete healing within 16&#xD;
      weeks of initiating therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis under study is that one or more applications of TTAX01 to the wound surface of&#xD;
      a well debrided, complex diabetic foot ulcer managed with appropriate antibiotic therapy will&#xD;
      result in a higher probability of complete healing than would be expected from management&#xD;
      with standard care alone. In this open label Phase 2 pilot trial, all subjects will receive&#xD;
      the intervention over a maximum period of 16 weeks. Eligible consenting subjects will undergo&#xD;
      a baseline aggressive debridement in the operating room to remove infected and devitalized&#xD;
      bone and soft tissue. TTAX01 will be applied to the debrided wound bed at baseline, and if&#xD;
      healing is not evident, it will be applied again at 4 week intervals. At each weekly visit&#xD;
      the wound will be further debrided as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting subjects who qualify for enrollment will undergo an aggressive surgical&#xD;
      debridement at the baseline visit, including biopsies of bone for histology and microbiologic&#xD;
      testing at the start and completion of debridement. Systemic antibiotics will be given&#xD;
      empirically, with adjustments made on the basis of culture and sensitivity results. New or&#xD;
      recurrent infections will be managed with additional debridement and adjustment or addition&#xD;
      of appropriate systemic antibiotics. The test article, TTAX01, will be sutured to the&#xD;
      debrided wound bed at baseline and again at 4 week intervals over the 16 week treatment&#xD;
      period for wounds that do not show evidence of healing. For wounds that do show evidence of&#xD;
      healing, additional applications of TTAX01 will be withheld, based on observations from&#xD;
      retrospective case series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects whose wounds close prior to 16 weeks will move directly to a 2 week confirmation of&#xD;
      closure period. Subjects whose wounds have not closed by the end of 16 weeks will exit the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

TTAX01: TTAX01 was applied directly to the wound surface and retained with non-absorbable sutures. A single layer of the test article covered the entire open surface of the wound. The material was applied once every 4 weeks unless the wound shows evidence of healing, in which case dosing is suspended; or, if the test article has been accidentally dislodged, it was replaced at any time.&#xD;
Surgical resection and debridement: Performed surgical sharp debridement in the OR, to remove:&#xD;
infectious agents and biofilms (purulence),&#xD;
all debris, eschar, callus and macerated non-viable tissue from the wound base, and&#xD;
dead (suprabasal epidermis), scarred (elevated/edematous) and necrotic/macerated tissue from the wound edge.&#xD;
Surgical Resection performed to remove as much of the necrotic bone detected by the radiographic evidence as is appropriate.&#xD;
Systemic antibiotics: Six (6) weeks of systemic antibiotic therapy was required. A definitive therapy was guided by the microbiological results based on bone biopsy.&#xD;

      <desc>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not considered causally related to that product. An Serious Adverse Event is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</desc>
