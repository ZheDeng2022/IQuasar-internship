      Objectives Validate the OncAlert® RAPID Test by demonstrating that NPV &gt; (1 -prevalence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the independent and associated contribution of readily available clinical variables&#xD;
      including age, race, gender, HPV status, socioeconomic level, tobacco, and alcohol use with&#xD;
      the biopsy and test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate OncAlert® RAPID Test results in patients without immediate biopsy, both at baseline&#xD;
      and scheduled follow-up visit (approximately 1-3 months±14 days), to assess impact on&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Number of Subjects A total enrollment of up to 1000 individuals is projected with 600&#xD;
      as the minimum accrued. Patients in the primary cohort (1a and 1b) will be followed until&#xD;
      pathology of clinically directed incisional / diagnostic biopsy pathology report is received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 200 'non-biopsy subjects' will be followed during a 1-3 month ±14 days clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts 1a and 1b:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with a clinical suspicion of oral potentially malignant disorders, oral or&#xD;
      oropharyngeal cancer, or both based in part on clinical examination, symptoms, clinical&#xD;
      history, suspicious lesion(s) in mouth without history of a prior positive biopsy. Even if&#xD;
      the suspicion is low for cancer or precancer, the patient is eligible if a biopsy is&#xD;
      performed, in part, to rule this out. For example, if a subject has findings on imaging, or&#xD;
      worrisome localizing symptoms in the oral cavity or oropharynx, they would be eligible. In&#xD;
      addition, subjects with papillomas or other findings where there is a low level of concern,&#xD;
      but cancer is still in the differential, are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1a: oral cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1b: oropharynx&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are enrolled with a clinical suspicion of oral potentially malignant disorders, oral&#xD;
      or oropharyngeal cancer, or both based in part on clinical examination, symptoms, clinical&#xD;
      history, suspicious lesion(s) in mouth without history of a prior positive biopsy; however,&#xD;
      based on clinical impression and or patient related issues no immediate biopsy is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screen Fail Rate: A 20% Screen Fail Rate is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product Name: OncAlert Oral Cancer RAPID Test (OncAlert RAPID)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospectively collect 5cc of normal saline after a combination of swish, gargle and spit into&#xD;
      the provided collection specimen cup. Specimens will be collected at baseline (time of&#xD;
      biopsy) as per standard practice at each site. The OncAlert RAPID Test cassette is inserted&#xD;
      into the specimen cup and read directly from the cassette in 10 minutes. In addition,&#xD;
      comprehensive clinical - pathology and patient demographic features including age, gender,&#xD;
      race, ethnicity, and all pathology biopsy results will be collected. Any pertinent additional&#xD;
      clinical data including HPV status, socioeconomic status, smoking, drinking history, and&#xD;
      pertinent features related to oral health will be obtained. A central pathology review for&#xD;
      all biopsy results will be performed and incorporated into the final analyses.&#xD;

      Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OncAlert Oral Cancer RAPID Test (OncAlert RAPID) is a qualitative point-of-care lateral&#xD;
      flow assay to aid in the decision to biopsy in patients with clinical features associated&#xD;
      with oral potentially malignant disorders and or oral/oropharyngeal cancer (i.e. head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Intended Use Statement&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device measures soluble CD44 and total protein in saliva samples collected in saline. The&#xD;
      test is an adjunct to the biopsy decision process, and not intended as a screening or&#xD;
      stand-alone diagnostic assay. To be used in adults 23 years and older. Not intended for use&#xD;
      in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validate the OncAlert RAPID Test, with an NPV ≥ (1-prevalence),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate OncAlert RAPID Test results in patients without immediate biopsy, both at&#xD;
           baseline and scheduled follow-up visit (approximately 1-3 months), to assess impact on&#xD;
           outcome,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the independent and associated contribution of readily available clinical&#xD;
           variables including age, race, gender, HPV status, socioeconomic level, tobacco, and&#xD;
           alcohol use with the biopsy and test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OVERVIEW&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospectively collect 5cc of normal saline after a combination of swish, gargle and spit into&#xD;
      the provided collection specimen cup. 1cc will be removed and sequestered for subsequent&#xD;
      downstream analyses (Section 7). Specimens will be collected at baseline (time of biopsy) as&#xD;
      per standard practice at each site. The OncAlert RAPID Test cassette is inserted into the&#xD;
      specimen cup and read directly from the cassette in 10 minutes. In addition, acquire&#xD;
      comprehensive clinical - pathology and patient demographic features including age, gender,&#xD;
      race, ethnicity, and all pathology biopsy results. Also, obtain any pertinent additional&#xD;
      clinical data including HPV status, socioeconomic status, smoking, drinking history, and&#xD;
      pertinent features related to oral health. It is presumed that some patients within the&#xD;
      current biopsy protocol will undergo treatment as a result of the biopsy diagnosis. The&#xD;
      clinical-pathology data, when accessible, for these patients will be collected for subsequent&#xD;
      secondary analyses. A central pathology review for all biopsy results will be performed and&#xD;
      incorporated into the final analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cohorts 1a and 1b patients, the pathology results of clinically directed incisional /&#xD;
      diagnostic biopsy will be followed until finalized and received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 patients not having an initial incisional / diagnostic biopsy at the initial visit&#xD;
      will have an additional OncAlert® RAPID test performed within 1 -3 months±14 days (or as&#xD;
      defined by standard of care (SOC)after the initial visit.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will conclude after all data is collected and analyzed. This could vary from 12 to&#xD;
      36 months or more depending on accrual rates at the open sites and other factors.&#xD;
