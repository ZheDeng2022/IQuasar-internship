      Background: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous autoimmune&#xD;
      disease mainly affecting stratum basal of the epithelium. It is very painful and hamper the&#xD;
      daily routine of patients e.g. (talking, drinking, eating, maintaining normal relationships).&#xD;
      Different topical treatments have been tried for the symptomatic relief of OLP which include&#xD;
      topical corticosteroids (TCSs), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) retinoids,&#xD;
      photochemotherapy; amitryptaline; thalidomide; amlexanox and traditional medicines such as&#xD;
      curcumin, selenium-ACE combined with itraconazole, glycyrrhiza glabra and aloe vera. But the&#xD;
      exact treatment is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the efficacy of Dexamethasone, Doxycycline, Nystatin and Promethazine&#xD;
      cocktail with Triamcinolone as topical treatment of OLP Subjects and Methods: 40 patients of&#xD;
      symptomatic OLP will be randomly divided in to study and control group. Study group will be&#xD;
      given a cocktail containing dexamethasone, doxycycline, nystatin and promethazine and will be&#xD;
      advised to rinse with 1 and half teaspoon of this cocktail 3 times a day for 2 minutes for&#xD;
      the period of 8 weeks. Study group is also advised to apply an orabase containing 0.1%&#xD;
      triamcinolone on lesions 3 times a day for the period of 8 weeks. The control group will be&#xD;
      advised to apply only triamcinolone orabase 3 times a day for 8 weeks.&#xD;

      Introduction Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous autoimmune&#xD;
      disease mainly affecting stratum basal of the epithelium. It is T-cell mediated immunological&#xD;
      disease that mostly occurs bilaterally on buccal mucosa while tongue and gingiva are other&#xD;
      commonly involved sites while palatal mucosa and floor of the mouth are rarely affected&#xD;
      (Roopashree MR, 2010, Torrente-Castells et al., 2010, Alves et al, 2010). The prevalence of&#xD;
      OLP in general population is 0.1-4% (Sugerman et al., 2002) mainly affecting the middle-aged&#xD;
      and elderly people (Ingafou et al., 2006) and female: male ratio 2:1 (Shen et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has six clinical forms: keratotic, reticular, papular, plaquelike white patches, erosive,&#xD;
      atrophic, and bullous (Shen et al., 2012). Reticular and erosive form are most common (Alves&#xD;
      et al, 2010). Keratotic reticular, papular, plaque like white patches often present with no&#xD;
      complaints (Oczko et al, 2011), while erosive, atrophic, and ulcerative lesions are a painful&#xD;
      or present with a burning sensation, and thus make eating, speaking, and swallowing difficult&#xD;
      (Thongprasom et al., 2007). Histologically, a subepithelial infiltration in the form of dense&#xD;
      band of lymphocytes, increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes and the liquefaction&#xD;
      degeneration of basal keratinocytes is seen in OLP (Payeras et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several predisposing factors have been identified which may cause or progress OLP which&#xD;
      include immunity, infection, genetics, stress and endocrine. Recent researches showed an&#xD;
      increased activity of prolidase and oxidative stress in OLP patients, causing disturbance in&#xD;
      the antioxidant defense system (Batu et al, 2016, Ergun et al, 2011). Although the exact&#xD;
      cause is still not clear, facts show that an immunological process is involved in OLP which&#xD;
      is activated by an unknown antigen that change the basal keratinocytes of the oral mucosa and&#xD;
      these alterations cause the cell immune response to attack the keratinocytes. (Ismail et al.,&#xD;
      2007, Payeras et al., 2013). This antigen may be intrinsic or extrinsic, or both. Evidence&#xD;
      shows that bacteria can be one of the etiologic factors of OLP. An association has already&#xD;
      been found between OLP and infection, such as Ebstein Barr virus, Hepatitis C virus,&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori and Candida Albicans. A study also pointed out the allergy to various&#xD;
      antigens coming in direct contact with oral cavity to contribute to the etiology of OLP. (D.&#xD;
      Wray, 2000) As the etiology is not known therefore there is no definitive treatment for OLP&#xD;
      and the mainstay of therapy for improving the life of these patients is symptomatic topical&#xD;
      treatment. Topical treatments which have been tried for the symptomatic OLP include topical&#xD;
      corticosteroids (TCSs), including betamethasone, clobetasol, dexamethasone and triamcinolone;&#xD;
      topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) such as pimecrolimus, tacrolimus or ciclosporin;&#xD;
      retinoids such as tretinoin; photochemotherapy; amitryptaline; thalidomide; amlexanox and&#xD;
      traditional medicines such as curcumin, selenium-ACE combined with itraconazole, glycyrrhiza&#xD;
      glabra and aloe vera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study both tacrolimus 0.1% ointment and pimecrolimus 1% cream were found equally&#xD;
      effective for the treatment of OLP (Vohra et al., 2016). Similarly another study showed that&#xD;
      Clobetasol propionate (0.05%) was found more effective than triamcinolone acetonate (0.1%)&#xD;
      and tacrolimus orabase (0.03%) for the management of OLP. This study also found that&#xD;
      triamcinolone 0.1% is superior to tacrolimus 0.03% in terms of effectiveness for the&#xD;
      treatment of OLP.(Sivaraman et al., 2016) According to another study both triamcinolone and&#xD;
      curcumin paste were found almost equally effective in reducing the pain and improving the&#xD;
      appearance of OLP lesions (Kia et al., 2015). In another study it was concluded that&#xD;
      combination of Selenium-ACE, corticosteroid and antifungal is a better treatment regimen for&#xD;
      the treatment of erosive ulcerative OLP than a capsule of 100 mg Itraconazole plus&#xD;
      dexamethsone mouthwash or dexamethasone alone (Belal, 2015). In another similar study&#xD;
      cocktail of clobetasol, ketoconazole and amitryptiline was found more efficacious than&#xD;
      diluted dexamethasone, nystatin and Diphenhydramine elixir (Javadzadeh et al, 2008). In a&#xD;
      comparative study tacrolimus 0.1% cream was found more effective than 0.05% clobetasol&#xD;
      propionate cream in reducing pain and healing of OLP lesions (Hettiarachchi et al., 2016).&#xD;
      Both thalidomide and dexamethasone were found almost equally effective in another trail (Wu&#xD;
      et al., 2010). In a trail of comperison between amlexanox paste and dexamethasone paste both&#xD;
      were found equally effective at the end of 7 days in terms of reduction in clinical signs&#xD;
      (erosion) and symptoms like pain and burning sensation (Fu et al., 2012). Some herbal&#xD;
      medicines have also been tried like Glycyrrhiza glabra and Aloe vera, in a trail to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy of 1% Glycyrrhiza glabra In orabase with 0.1% Triamcinolone Acetonide both were&#xD;
      found almost equally effective in reducing the pain and improving the appearance of OLP&#xD;
      lesions (Najafi et al., 2016) and in another trail both Aloe Vera Mouthwash and Triamcinolone&#xD;
      Acetonide were found almost equally effective in reducing the pain and in reducing the size&#xD;
      of OLP lesions (Mansourian et al., 2011) So steroids remained the mainstay of treatment for&#xD;
      OLP but evidence points towards the involvement of bacterial and fungal infections in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of OLP as according to a recent study disbiosis was found in the buccal surface&#xD;
      mucosa of patients of OLP, as certain bacterial species were found in greater no in buccal&#xD;
      mucosa of OLP patients so they concluded that an association exists between bacterial&#xD;
      disbiosis of buccal mucosa and OLP (He et al., 2017). Similar studies showed that antibiotics&#xD;
      relieved symptoms of OLP effectively (Backman &amp; Jontell, 2007; Carbone et al, 1999). OLP is a&#xD;
      disease which reduces the individual's resistance and changes the candida albican's role from&#xD;
      commensalism to parasitism which is among the normal flora of oral cavity or candida may&#xD;
      secondarily infect the OLP lesions and exacerbate the signs and symptoms (santosh gowdru&#xD;
      shivanandappa, 2012). In a study 62% of OLP patients were found allergic to different&#xD;
      allergens which come in contact with mucosa in daily life so they found that association&#xD;
      exists between OLP and allergy (D. Wray, 2000). According to another study mast cell&#xD;
      hyperplasia was seen in OLP patients which suggests their role in pathogenesis of OLP (Ankle&#xD;
      R et al, 2007) The most used therapy is TCSs however its effectiveness is limited due to&#xD;
      opportunistic oral infections in patients with OLP. Adjunct antibiotic therapies have been&#xD;
      used to aid in symptomatic relief and improved response has been observed as compared to TCSs&#xD;
      alone. however none of the combined therapies have used antifungal as an additive in their&#xD;
      local applications, as candida is one of the opportunistic organisms that colonizes affected&#xD;
      sites. Role of allergy mechanisms have also been discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Evidence of involvement of bacterial and fungal infections and allergy in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of OLP suggests the need for the use of antibiotic, anti fungal and&#xD;
      antihistamine for the topical treatment of OLP and there is a gap in literature. That's why&#xD;
      current trail is being done to evaluate the efficacy of topical doxycycline, nyastatin and&#xD;
      promethazine along with dexamethasone for the symptomatic relief of OLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Dexamethasone, Doxycycline, Nystatin and Promethazine combination topical rinse&#xD;
      are more effective for the treatment of OLP than Triamcinolone alone Objective To compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of Dexamethasone, Doxycycline, Nystatin and Promethazine combination topical rinse&#xD;
      with Triamcinolone rinse as topical treatment of Oral Lichen Planus.&#xD;
&#xD;

             -  Clinical response (improvement of lesions and symptoms) will be assessed by&#xD;
                criteria given by (Escudier et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Collection Method and Instruments After approval from the ethical review committee,&#xD;
           patients will be included in the study. Written informed consent will be obtained from&#xD;
           all patients prior to the study as a part of ethical practice. 40 patients of&#xD;
           symptomatic OLP will be enrolled in the study after evaluation through punch biopsy and&#xD;
           other inclusion and exclusion criteria to compensate the loss to follow up as the actual&#xD;
           size calculated from the formula was 32. They will be randomly divided in to study and&#xD;
           control group each containing 20 patients. At baseline visit after recording the&#xD;
           socio-demographic and oral parameters data the local irritant factors in the oral cavity&#xD;
           which can aggravate the OLP will be removed by doing basic oral procedures like scaling&#xD;
           and root planning restorations, rounding of sharp cusps and replacement of any ill&#xD;
           fitting appliances in both the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study group will be given a cocktail containing dexamethasone, doxycycline, nystatin and&#xD;
           promethazine and will be advised to rinse with 1 and half teaspoon of this cocktail 3&#xD;
           times a day for 2 minutes for the period of 8 weeks and do not eat or drink anything 30&#xD;
           minutes after its use. Study group will also advised to apply triamcinolone orabase&#xD;
           containing 0.1% triamcinolone on lesions 3 times a day for the period of 8 weeks. The&#xD;
           control group will be advised to apply only triamcinolone orabase 3 times a day for 8&#xD;
           weeks with the same protocol. Assessment of dimension of lesions, color, pain and&#xD;
           burning sensation and improvement of lesions and symptoms will be done at baseline and&#xD;
           after 4 and 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Analysis The data will be coded and entered using SPSS ver 20. All the&#xD;
