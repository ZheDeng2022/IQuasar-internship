      This study aims to obtain plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) data and characterize the PK profile of&#xD;
      imipenem (IMI), cilastatin (CIL), and relebactam (REL) following administration of a single&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) dose of MK-7655A (a fixed ratio combination of&#xD;
      imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam), hereafter referred to as IMI/REL.&#xD;
