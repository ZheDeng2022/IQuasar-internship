  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers constitute an important medical problem in the patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the proliferation of fibroblasts,&#xD;
      keratinocytes and vessel endothelial cells, which contributes to its healing properties.In&#xD;
      previous phase I-III clinical studies in patients with diabetic foot ulcers grade 3 and 4 of&#xD;
      the Wagner's classification (Meggitt-Wagner classification), it has been demonstrated that&#xD;
      the intralesional administration of the EGF stimulates the healing, having as result the&#xD;
      formation of a useful granulation tissue in the bed of the ulcers and the later closure of&#xD;
      the lesion. This effect was associated with a decreased risk of amputation. Considering the&#xD;
      pharmacological actions identified for the EGF, the pathogenesis of the disease, previous&#xD;
      clinical results and the absence of an effective treatment for this condition justifies the&#xD;
      current clinical study. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      intralesional administration of Heberprot-P® (human recombinant epidermal growth factor) plus&#xD;
      the standard treatment in patients with complex diabetic foot and risk of major amputation in&#xD;
      Kuwait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A demonstrative study, open, single-center, uncontrolled, with one treatment group to be&#xD;
      conducted in a maximum of 50 patients with DFU. The study will be conducted at DDI, Kuwait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective To assess the efficacy and safety of the intralesional administration of&#xD;
      Heberprot-P® plus the standard treatment in patients with diabetic foot ulcer in University&#xD;
      of Texas Wound Classification AI-AII and CI-CII and risk of major amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives To determine the efficacy of Heberprot-P® in patients with diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcer in terms of the proportion of patients that reach complete response (100% of the area&#xD;
      covered by granulation tissue) at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the time to reach the granulation tissue 100% of the lesion area. To assess the&#xD;
      effect of the administration of Heberprot-P® in the prevention of major amputations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify and characterize the adverse events associated with the intralesional and&#xD;
      perilesional administration of Heberprot-P® in patients with diabetic foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods to evaluate the quality of the assessment procedures of the efficacy. Quality control&#xD;
      visits will be carried out during the demonstration by the Research affairs office in DDI,&#xD;
      Kuwait and CIGB, previously coordinated with the investigators. When the patient finishes the&#xD;
      treatment, the monitors will gather the CRFs leaving a copy in the research site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavior in case of exit from the demonstration Management of withdrawals and missings to&#xD;
      evaluation visits is explained in item. The assessment will be carried out according to the&#xD;
      principle of intent to treat, so all the patients once included will be considered in the&#xD;
      response assessment, regardless they have had received the treatment or not, or having&#xD;
      completed the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events to that can appear and their recording An adverse event is any medical&#xD;
      undesirable and not deliberate manifestation that happens in a patient or subject of a&#xD;
      clinical research to which a drug has been administered, regardless if it is related or not&#xD;
      to this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This way, it can be any sign (including for example abnormal laboratory data), symptoms or&#xD;
      disease associated temporarily with the use of a pharmaceutical product, being or not a&#xD;
      causality ratio. The exacerbations of symptoms/diseases that were present before the study&#xD;
      will also be included as adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post-marketing stage, during the active pharmaco-surveillance of the use of&#xD;
      Heberprot-P® there were included about 4000 subjects. In the initial analysis of 1851&#xD;
      patients, 873 patients reported adverse events, the most frequent were: pain at the site of&#xD;
      application (21.7%), shivering from cold (19.8), burning at the application site (16.0%),&#xD;
      chills (9.2%), local infection (3.8%) and fever (2.3%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the information related to the occurrence of adverse events presented in the patients&#xD;
      included in the clinical demonstration will be registered and described by the researchers in&#xD;
      the Adverse Events Form of the CRF. There will be described the type, duration, intensity,&#xD;
      seriousness, causality and the followed behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity (severity) will be classified the following way:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild: adverse event that the subject tolerates well, causes minimal inconveniences and&#xD;
           does not interfere with the daily activities.It does not need treatment and does not&#xD;
           interrupt the administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate: adverse event that is annoying enough as to interfere the daily activities. It&#xD;
           needs treatment and not necessarily needs the suspension of the causative drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe: adverse event that prevents from doing the daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria that will be used to define an adverse event as serious will include the&#xD;
      presence of some of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It endangers the subject's life causes the death causes or prolongs the hospitalization&#xD;
      produces disability/incapacity causes congenital anomaly&#xD;
&#xD;
      These events need the suspension of the causative drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavior in case of adverse events The most frequent clinical adverse events reported with&#xD;
      the use of Heberprot-P are pain and Burning sensation in the injection site, shivering,&#xD;
      chills, local infection and fever. The behavior in case of these adverse events includes the&#xD;
      administration of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case allergic reactions appear, the behavior will depend on their magnitude, including the&#xD;
      use of antihistamines, steroids or even definitive suspension of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of having serious adverse events, the treatment will be suspended, there will be&#xD;
      taken the measures needed depending on the type of event and it will be considered the&#xD;
      possible expeditious report of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expeditious report of the adverse events Any unexpected serious adverse event that appears in&#xD;
      the course of the clinical demonstration will be valued with a view to the expeditious&#xD;
      report. The term &quot;unexpected&quot; refers to the events which specificity or seriousness is not&#xD;
      consistent with the available information of the product (Annex 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case you have a serious and unexpected adverse effect, the Clinical investigator will&#xD;
      report to Dr Rafael Ibargollin Ulloa and DDI Ethics committee .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up as for all reportable AEs. Basic follow up information must also be documented on&#xD;
      the SAE Report Form and in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording of the information and handling the data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researcher´s registry. After the patient has been included Patient´s identification&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registry of Included and Not included Patients. During the whole period of inclusion of&#xD;
           cases List of all the patients with diagnosis who come to the participant service,&#xD;
           indicating if they were included or not and the causes of non-inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent Before the inclusion Record of the patient's voluntariness in taking&#xD;
           part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Case Report Form. At the beginning and during the patient's follow-up. General data,&#xD;
           clinical assessments and complementary examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse event notification form. When serious and unexpected adverse events are&#xD;
           faced. Patient's data, description of the adverse events, date and time of start and&#xD;
           completion, behavior, causality ratio and result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information specified in the CRF will be completed by researchers in each of the&#xD;
      assessments. When patients have completed follow-up, the CRF should be reviewed and signed.&#xD;
      The CRF will be filled in duplicate, the researcher will keep a copy and send the other to&#xD;
      the monitors in the CIGB. Informed consent will also fill in duplicate, one for the&#xD;
      investigator and the other to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the individual data a database will be created, which will serve for their processing. A&#xD;
      double entry of the data will be carried out for later comparison and correction from&#xD;
      possible errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for preserving the information The CRFs, the databases, the reports that are&#xD;
      generated and the compact discs with the images will be preserved in the site destined for&#xD;
      this effect, previously designated by the persons in charge of the demonstration and they&#xD;
      will be preserved for at least 15 years by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analysis of the data The analyses will be carried out by intention to treat,&#xD;
      considering the abandonments as non-responses to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With each variable (main, secondary and control) exploratory analyses will be carried out to&#xD;
      know their global behavior and to evaluate fulfillment of the necessary hypothesis in order&#xD;
      to apply the proper statistical tests in the assessment stage.With the quantitative&#xD;
      variables, the assumptions of homogeneity of variances (Levene's test) and of approximation&#xD;
      to a normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk's test) must be verified. Additionally, as&#xD;
      measurements of central tendency and dispersion, the mean, median, standard deviation,&#xD;
      interquartile range and minimum and maximum values will be estimated. With the qualitative&#xD;
      variables, the distribution of frequencies should be estimated. It is proposed to carry out a&#xD;
      Cluster Analysis as exploratory method of association between the variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homogeneity of the sample With the qualitative variables (sex, type of Diabetes Mellitus,&#xD;
      obesity, smoking arterial hypertension, structural deformities, consumption of alcohol,&#xD;
      current treatment for the diabetes, history of ulcers, location of the lesion, osteomyelitis,&#xD;
      DDI, University of Texas Wound Classification System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency distribution will be estimated. With the quantitative variables (age, time of&#xD;
      evolution of the diabetes mellitus and of the ulcer, glycosylated hemoglobin, initial area of&#xD;
      the lesion, ankle/arm pressure index at the beginning): The measurements of central tendency&#xD;
      and dispersion will be estimated and analysis of normality will by made (Shapiro-Wilk's&#xD;
      tries) and of homogeneity of variances (Levene's test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With all (quantitative and qualitative variables): A logistic regression model will be&#xD;
      adjusted to study the influence of each of them and their interactions on the response to the&#xD;
      treatment and occurrence of serious adverse events. In case any statistically significant&#xD;
      dependence(s) is/are detected, the confirmatory analysis with the main variable should&#xD;
      envisage it/them as covariable (s) or stratum (strata).&#xD;
