  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is the inability of the pancreas to perform a normal&#xD;
      digestive function. The prevalence of IPE in patients with decompensated hepatic cirrhosis&#xD;
      (HC) is unknown and most published series are short, old and use a single diagnostic&#xD;
      technique with potential risk of false positives and negatives. Demonstrating IPE in a&#xD;
      patient with HC can change their vital prognosis with the indication of pancreatic enzymes&#xD;
      that can improve their nutritional status and help control their decompensations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the prevalence of IPE in patients with decompensated CH. To establish&#xD;
      correlation between fecal elastase and 13C triolein breath test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Unicentric, transversal study that will be carried out during hospitalization.&#xD;
      Patients with HC who enter for decompensation and requiere hospitalization will be included&#xD;
      consecutively. Exclusion criteria will include prior diagnosis of IPE, suspicion of biliary&#xD;
      obstruction, more than 5 dep / d induced by laxatives or liquid stools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of IPE will be made with the combination of two techniques (13C triolein breath&#xD;
      test and fecal elastase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic, epidemiological data, clinical data as well as anthropometric parameters will be&#xD;
      collected. A blood test will also be done to assess nutritional status and associated&#xD;
      deficits. A multivariate analysis will be performed to assess the predictive factors of IPE&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is defined as the inability of the pancreas to&#xD;
      perform a normal digestive function. Habitually, it occurs as a result of a severe reduction&#xD;
      in the secretion of pancreatic enzymes, although - less frequently - it may be due to the&#xD;
      inability of these enzymes to perform their function. Clinically, it has a very broad&#xD;
      spectrum of presentation with abdominal discomforts, malnutrition, chronic diarrhea and, in&#xD;
      severe cases, steatorrhea. It must be said, however, that it is not until the disease is very&#xD;
      evolved with a pancreatic function very deteriorated (more than 90%) that steatorrhea becomes&#xD;
      clinically evident. In addition, the onset of symptoms triggered by the intake of fats makes&#xD;
      these patients adapt their diet, often unconsciously, so it is not uncommon to find patients&#xD;
      with EPI and constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the diagnosis of IPE, different clinical tests are used. There are direct&#xD;
      methods or invasive (secretin stimulation test, secretin-cerulein Lundh test) and noninvasive&#xD;
      or indirect methods (coefficient of fat absorption, fecal elastase, fecal chymotrypsin&#xD;
      activity, the pancreoleuril test, test with paraaminobenzoic acid and marked triolein test)&#xD;
      are, in general, more accessible to the usual clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding etiology, the most frequent cause of EPI is chronic pancreatitis, an entity that is&#xD;
      closely linked to chronic alcohol consumption. On the one hand, it should be noted that&#xD;
      alcohol is a common etiologic factor to both pathogenesis of pancreatic and liver affections.&#xD;
      On the other hand, it is well known that the liver and pancreas have a close relationship&#xD;
      with regard to their anatomy and physiology. The pancreatic duct and the coledocus bind to&#xD;
      the level of the Vater papilla, so that their contents are mixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with EPI have severe malnutrition, a factor which increases the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Therefore, adequately replacing nutritional deficits by enzyme replacement therapy&#xD;
      contributes significantly to decrease the complications, the hospital stays and the&#xD;
      mortality. It could increase the quality of life of the patients. In addition, patients&#xD;
      suffering from liver cirrhosis have other complications arising from malnutrition, as ascites&#xD;
      that could be benefited from the improvement of the nutritional profile by enzyme replacement&#xD;
      therapy detected in case of EPI. That is why we believe that our study could contribute to&#xD;
      improving patient management with decompensated liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to assess the prevalence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency&#xD;
      EPI in patients with decompensated alcoholic liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an epidemiological, unicentral, cross-sectional study that will be carried out within&#xD;
      the hospital setting from October '17 to October'19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with liver cirrrhosis and enter the hepatology unit for clinical&#xD;
      decompensation (sd hepatorenal, ascitic decompensation, hepatic encephalopathy,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding stable) will be included .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect demographic, epidemiology, analytic and clinical data.&#xD;
      Anthropometric parameters such as tricipital fold, weight and size, will also be measured,&#xD;
      which will allow the calculation of body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to diagnose the presence of IPE, the breath test with triolein marked with 13C&#xD;
      (Pancreo-Kit®) will be performed. The study consists of a delay of 8 hours (overnight) and&#xD;
      later obtaining a basal sample through exhalation of air in a tube. Subsequently, a substrate&#xD;
      (foods with marked triolein) will be administered to the patient and after 30 minutes, it&#xD;
      will have to exhale air in a tube every 30 minutes for a total of 6 hours, thus obtaining a&#xD;
      total of 13 samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests will also be performed on all patients to assess their nutritional status (Hg,&#xD;
      albumin, prealbumin, total proteins, cholesterol (HDL / LDL), bilirubin, prothrombin time,&#xD;
      triglycerides, liposoluble Vitamins A, D, E and K; Vitamins B1, B12; calcium, phosphorus and&#xD;
      magnesium), Hb glucose and collect a sample of solid stool isolated for the determination of&#xD;
      the fecal elastase.&#xD;
