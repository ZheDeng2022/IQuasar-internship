    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well-being. These eight subscales were summarized as relating to either physical health or mental health. Physical component summary (PCS) was based primarily on physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health scales and mental component summary (MCS) encompasses vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health scales. Score from mental health, role emotional, social functioning, and vitality domains were averaged to calculate MCS. Total score range for MCS was 0-100 (100 = highest level of mental functioning). Score from physical function, role physical, bodily pain, and general health domains were averaged to calculate PCS. Total score range for PCS was 0-100 (100 = highest level of physical functioning).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue score was calculated according to a 13-item questionnaire that assess self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. It uses a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse possible score) to 52 (best score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>

DAS28-hsCRP was calculated using following formula: DAS28-hsCRP equals to (=) 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) plus (+) 0.28*sqrt (SJC28) + 0.36*natural log(hsCRP+1) + 0.014* participant's global assessment of disease activity + 0.96. Scores ranged 0-9.4, where lower scores indicated less disease activity. A DAS28 score less than (&lt;) 2.6 indicated clinical remission. Percentage of participants with low DAS28 &lt; 2.6 based on DAS28- hsCRP at Week 12 were reported.</description>

        <description>Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, which does not necessarily have causal relationship with treatment. A serious AE was defined as an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inparticipant hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs: events between first dose of study drug that were absent before treatment/that worsened relative to pre-treatment state up to 16 weeks. TEAEs included both serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs. Number of participants with TEAEs and serious TEAEs were reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes From Baseline in 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings</title>
        <description>12-lead ECG recordings included rhythm, heart rate (as measured by RR interval), PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval. The corrected QT interval (QTcF) was calculated using Fridericia's formula. 12-lead ECG recordings were obtained after the participants have rested for at least 10 minutes in semisupine position. Clinical significance was determined by the investigator. The number of participants with clinically significant changes from baseline in 12-lead ECG findings were reported.</description>

The CDAI was calculated based on following formula: CDAI = 28 joint count for swelling (SJC28) + 28 joint count for tenderness (TJC28) + GH + PhGA where, GH = general health component of the Disease Activity Score [DAS] (i.e., Participant's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, assessed using a scale of 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) where 0 = very well and 10 = very poor activity and PhGA = Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity assessed using a scale of 0 to 10 cm VAS, where 0 = very well and 10 = very poor activity. The total CDAI score ranges from 0 to 76, where 0 (none) to 76 (extreme disease activity). CDAI score =&lt; 2.8 indicated clinical remission.

          <description>SDAI was calculated based on following formula: SDAI = 28 joint count for swelling (SJC28) + 28 joint count for tenderness (TJC28) + GH + PGA + hsCRP where, GH = general health component of the Disease Activity Score [DAS] (i.e., Participant's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, assessed using a scale of 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) where 0 = very well and 10 = very poor activity and PhGA = Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity assessed using a scale of 0 to 10 cm VAS, where 0 = very well and 10 = very poor activity. The total SDAI score ranges from 0 to 86, where 0 (none) to 86 (extreme disease activity). SDAI score =&lt; 3.3 indicated clinical remission. Percentage of participants with SDAI score =&lt; 3.3 at Week 12 were reported.</description>

        <description>The hybrid ACR combines the ACR 20/50/70 response with the mean percent change in all 7 ACR core components, thus providing a percent improvement from baseline on a continuous scale. For each participant, the mean percent improvement from baseline across the 7 ACR core set measures (tender joint count, swollen joint count, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) was calculated (a positive change indicated improvement, and the maximum worst change was limited to -100%) and the ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response is determined. The hybrid ACR is determined from a reference table taking into account both ACR response and mean percent improvement in the core set measures. Scores can range from -100% (maximal worsening) to 100% (maximal improvement).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score (DAS) Based on a 28 Joint Count-High-Sensitivity C-reactive Protein (DAS28-hsCRP) at Week 12</title>
        <description>DAS28 was a composite score used for measuring disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis. The calculation was based on the tender joint count (out of 28 joints), swollen joint count (out of 28 joints), hsCRP (milligrams per liter [mg/L]) and Participant's Global Assessment of Disease Activity. Total DAS28-hsCRP score ranged from 0 (none) to 9.4 (extreme disease activity). DAS28-hsCRP &lt; 3.2 implied low disease activity and &gt;= 3.2 to &lt;= 5.1 implied moderate disease activity, &gt; 5.1 implied high disease activity. DAS28-hsCRP = 0.56*sqrt(TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(hsCRP in mg/L +1) + 0.014* Participant's Global Assessment of Disease Activity + 0.96; ln = natural logarithm, sqrt = square root.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The CDAI was a composite index (without acute-phase reactant) for assessing disease activity. The CDAI was calculated based on following formula: CDAI = 28 joint count for swelling (SJC28) + 28 joint count for tenderness (TJC28) + GH + PhGA where, GH = general health component of the DAS (i.e., Participant's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, assessed using a scale of 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) where 0 = very well and 10 = very poor activity and PhGA = Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity assessed using a scale of 0 to 10 cm VAS, where 0 = very well and 10 = very poor activity. The total CDAI score ranges from 0 to 76, where 0 (none) to 76 (extreme disease activity).</description>

        <title>Changes From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Total Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI score was an evaluation of the functional status for a participant. The 20-question instrument assessed the degree of difficulty a person had in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0, indicated no difficulty, to 3, indicated inability to perform a task in that area. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range: 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Total Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI score was an evaluation of the functional status for a participant. The 20-question instrument assessed the degree of difficulty a person had in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0, indicated no difficulty, to 3, indicated inability to perform a task in that area. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range: 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

        <description>A total of 8 joints in the hand and wrist were evaluated for RAMRIS synovitis. Individual joint scores were assessed on a scale of 0 (no synovitis) to 3 (67 to 100 percent volume enhancement). The final synovitis score was the sum of the individual joint scores. The total score from 8 joints ranges from 0 to 24, with 0 implying normal (no synovitis) and 24 implying 67 to 100 percent volume enhancement.</description>

        <description>The 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well-being. These eight subscales were summarized as relating to either physical health or mental health. Physical component summary (PCS) was based primarily on physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health scales and mental component summary (MCS) encompasses vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health scales. Score from mental health, role emotional, social functioning, and vitality domains were averaged to calculate MCS. Total score range for MCS was 0-100 (100 = highest level of mental functioning). Score from physical function, role physical, bodily pain, and general health domains were averaged to calculate PCS.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue score was calculated according to a 13-item questionnaire that assess self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. It uses a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse possible score) to 52 (best score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>
