  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of atezolizumab with or without eribulin&#xD;
      mesylate and how well they work in treating patients with urothelial cancer that has come&#xD;
      back (recurrent), spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes (locally advanced), or other&#xD;
      places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as eribulin mesylate,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving atezolizumab and&#xD;
      eribulin mesylate may work better at treating urothelial cancer compared to atezolizumab&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To confirm that eribulin mesylate (eribulin), at or close to the single agent recommended&#xD;
      phase 2 dose, and atezolizumab at the single agent recommended phase 2 dose, can be given&#xD;
      together with an acceptable toxicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for eribulin and atezolizumab in combination, and compare that to&#xD;
      the ORR of atezolizumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To summarize and characterize the toxicity associated with this 2-drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the best overall response rate (immune-related best overall response [irBOR]&#xD;
      rate) using the immune-related response criteria (irRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the disease control rate (DCR: complete response [CR] + partial response&#xD;
      [PR] + stable disease [SD]) based on RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate the duration of response and the duration of stable disease. V. To summarize&#xD;
      the progression-free survival (PFS). VI. To summarize the overall survival (OS). VII. To&#xD;
      evaluate efficacy in subsets of patients determined by PD-L1, CD3 and CD8 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of eribulin when it is given in combination&#xD;
      with atezolizumab, specifically exploring the expression of putative tumor, circulating&#xD;
      microenvironment and computed tomography (CT) radiomic correlatives of epithelial-mesenchymal&#xD;
      transition (EMT)/ (mesenchymal-epithelial transition) MET phenotype at baseline and 6 weeks&#xD;
      on therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To ascertain the role of expression of PD-L1 using the SP142 assay and potentially other&#xD;
      methods as a predictive biomarker for response to treatment with atezolizumab in combination&#xD;
      with eribulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify clinical biomarkers that may predict for efficacy and toxicity in this&#xD;
      population and with this treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and eribulin mesylate IV&#xD;
      over 2-3 minutes on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 52 weeks.&#xD;

In addition, a logistic regression (exact, if required based on the numbers) will be used to estimate the odds ratio comparing the 2 arms adjusting for the stratification variables, and also by the Bellmunt risk group (1-2 versus [vs] 3-4).</description>

Two-sided 80% confidence intervals will be constructed for the probability of response in each arm, as well as the difference between the two arms (unadjusted for the stratification variables).
