  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common nocturnal breathing disorder characterized by&#xD;
      complete (apnea) and partial (hypopnea) breathing cessations during sleep. Currently,&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of OSA is based on the clinical symptoms, especially excessive daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness, and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) providing a limited overview of the breathing&#xD;
      cessation event frequency during the night. Longer obstruction events and deeper&#xD;
      desaturations have been suggested to be more harmful than shorter and shallower events and&#xD;
      these individual characteristics are completely neglected by conventional and currently used&#xD;
      AHI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously introduced novel diagnostic parameters incorporating the&#xD;
      number, duration and morphology of individual obstruction events and shown that they improve&#xD;
      the severity estimation of OSA compared to traditional measures. Even though, the novel&#xD;
      diagnostic parameters have so far tackled some of shortcomings of AHI, they need to be&#xD;
      refined to further increase the accuracy of the OSA severity estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that age, body mass index (BMI) and sleeping position are strongly related&#xD;
      to the severity OSA. However, it is not thoroughly studied whether the severity of individual&#xD;
      obstruction events progress over time (the aging process) and which factors affect to this&#xD;
      progression. It is known that OSA patients with similar AHI values, durations of individual&#xD;
      breathing cessation events can differ significantly. Longer and deeper events are connected&#xD;
      to increased mortality rate in patients with moderate or severe OSA and thus, could be&#xD;
      considered to be more detrimental than shorter and shallower ones. However, it has not been&#xD;
      thoroughly investigated whether in severe OSA patients with identical AHI values, sleep&#xD;
      efficiency or hypertension is related to the severity of individual breathing cessation&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators planned to explore, whether the individual breathing cessation event&#xD;
      severity progress over time and how different confounding factors affect this progression.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the correlation of EDS with the individual breathing cessation event severity,&#xD;
      sleep structure, and frequency and occurrence of cortical arousals will be investigated.&#xD;
      Also, the investigators will explore whether the percentage time of disturbed breathing from&#xD;
      total sleep time is related to sleep efficiency or hypertension in severe OSA patients having&#xD;
      similar AHI. Moreover, Positional therapy (PT) i.e., the avoidance of the supine posture&#xD;
      during sleep is the treatment of choice for Positional Patients (PP) having most of their&#xD;
      breathing abnormalities while sleeping supine. Since it is known that apneas/hypopneas are&#xD;
      more severe while sleeping supine, this time the investigators will assess the therapeutic&#xD;
      value of PT for severe Non Positional patients (NPP).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent nocturnal breathing disorder characterized by&#xD;
      complete (apnea) and partial (hypopnea) breathing cessations during sleep 1. OSA is connected&#xD;
      to cardiovascular disease, increased mortality rate and impairment of quality of life 2-4.&#xD;
      Its prevalence has been estimated to be 9-27 % among middle-aged population and the&#xD;
      prevalence is expected to increase in the future 5,6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the most commonly used diagnostic parameter for OSA is apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)&#xD;
      based on number of apneas and hypopneas during sleep, neglecting their durations and also&#xD;
      durations and depths of related desaturation events. In adults OSA is diagnosed if patient&#xD;
      has 1) AHI≥5 events/h with associated symptoms (e.g. excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)) or&#xD;
      medical or psychiatric disorder (e.g. hypertension or mood disorder) or 2) AHI≥15 events/h 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, the investigators have introduced novel parameters called as obstruction&#xD;
      severity, obstruction duration, desaturation severity, desaturation duration, and&#xD;
      adjusted-AHI incorporating number, duration and morphology of individual obstruction events&#xD;
      (i.e. apneas, hypopneas, and oxygen desaturations) 8,9.we have shown that these parameters&#xD;
      can enhance the severity estimation of OSA and that the individual breathing cessation event&#xD;
      severity is more strongly connected to increased mortality and cardiovascular morbidities&#xD;
      than conventional AHI8,10,11. The potential of these parameters to enhance the assessment of&#xD;
      severity of OSA has been previously investigated only using ambulatory polygraphic recordings&#xD;
      without EEG registration. Therefore, the parameters do not take into account hypopneas&#xD;
      followed by arousal (but not desaturation). In addition, parameters do not take into account&#xD;
      apneas not followed by desaturation and novel parameters need to be refined to take into&#xD;
      account also such events in order to further increase their prognostic value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that age and body mass index (BMI) are positively related with the prevalence of&#xD;
      OSA12,13. Furthermore, AHI is higher and apneas longer in supine position compared to lateral&#xD;
      position14-16. However, it is not thoroughly explored whether the severity of individual&#xD;
      obstruction events progress over time and which factors affect to this progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EDS is a common symptom of OSA and it can be measured in various methods. The most widely&#xD;
      used methods are Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire which measures subjective&#xD;
      sleepiness and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT)&#xD;
      which measure sleepiness objectively. However, the correlation between ESS score and the&#xD;
      severity of OSA (i.e. number of obstruction events) have been shown to be poor 17.&#xD;
      Furthermore, albeit MSLT and MWT have been shown to have better correlations with daytime&#xD;
      functions than ESS their correlations with AHI and arousal index still remainsweak18.&#xD;
      Therefore, it needs to be investigated whether the severity of individual breathing cessation&#xD;
      events is correlated better with MSLT and MWT and thus, explaining with more accuracy the&#xD;
      daytime symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that between patients with identical AHI values, durations of individual&#xD;
      apneas and hypopneas and durations, depths, and areas of individual desaturations can differ&#xD;
      significantly 19. Longer and deeper obstruction events could be considered to be more harmful&#xD;
      than shorter and shallower events as they are linked to increased mortality rate in patients&#xD;
      with moderate or severe OSA 8. Nonetheless, it has not been thoroughly investigated whether&#xD;
      in severe OSA patients with identical AHI values sleep efficiency or hypertension is related&#xD;
      to the severity of individual breathing cessation events and if this relationship is&#xD;
      modulated by sleeping position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positional therapy (PT), the avoidance of the supine posture during sleep is the treatment of&#xD;
      choice for Positional Patients (PP) who have only or most of the apneas/hypopneas while&#xD;
      sleeping in the supine posture 22. Non positional patients (NPP) have many apneas/hypopneas&#xD;
      while sleeping in both, the supine and the lateral posture. For these patients Continuous&#xD;
      Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice, however, many patients have&#xD;
      strong difficulties to adhere to CPAP and thus, the investigators would like to assess the&#xD;
      therapeutic value of PT for these NNP. Since apneas/hypopneas are more severe while sleeping&#xD;
      in the supine than in the lateral posture.15, 16 PT for these patients could represent a&#xD;
      valuable treatment. This is an issue that the investigators also want to assess in this&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research project the investigators aim to tackle these shortcomings in the&#xD;
      diagnostics of OSA. The main aim is to improve the severity estimation of OSA by further&#xD;
      refining the novel parameters for diagnostics of OSA. These improvements to the parameters&#xD;
      will be done in order to prevent the harmful consequences of the disease and to be able to&#xD;
      target the limited treatment resources to those in the greatest need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. HYPOTHESES AND AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research project the investigators tackle the limitations of AHI and refine the novel&#xD;
      parameters introduced in our earlier papers. To achieve this, four aims will be undertaken.&#xD;
      The first aim is to explore, whether the severity of individual breathing cessations&#xD;
      progresses over time and how different confounding factors (e.g. BMI, sleeping position, and&#xD;
      gender) affect this progression. The investigators believe that individual event&#xD;
      characteristics have a major role in the overall severity of OSA. The current knowledge on&#xD;
      the progression of OSA is limited to number of events while the detailed changes in the&#xD;
      individual event characteristics has not been thoroughly explored before. This is a major&#xD;
      shortcoming as event severity can be considered clinically significant and have been&#xD;
      associated with the risk of OSA related mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. The second&#xD;
      aim is to improve our recently developed novel parameters to provide even more accurate&#xD;
      severity estimation by including more detailed analysis of hypopnea events followed by&#xD;
      arousal and apnea events that do not induce desaturations. This more detailed analysis can&#xD;
      enhance the estimation of OSA related mortality and incidence of comorbidities and improve&#xD;
      the discrimination of patients needed to be treated but it can also help clinicians to choose&#xD;
      best individualized treatment method for each patient. The third aim of the research project&#xD;
      is to evaluate the correlation of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) with the individual&#xD;
      breathing cessation event severity, sleep structure, and frequency and occurrence of cortical&#xD;
      arousals. As EDS is a major problem reducing the quality of life, finding effective measures&#xD;
      to recognize factors behind EDS could aid to enhance the treatment of these patients and&#xD;
      improvement of their life quality. The fourth aim is to explore whether the percentage time&#xD;
      of disturbed breathing from total sleep time is related to sleep efficiency or hypertension&#xD;
      in severe OSA patients having similar AHI values and whether this percentage alters depending&#xD;
      on confounding factors (e.g. BMI, hypertension, and proportion of supine sleep). More&#xD;
      detailed characterization of severe OSA patients could aid the clinicians to recognize the&#xD;
      patients with most urgent need for effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fifth aim is to assess the therapeutic value of positional therapy (PT) for severe NPP.&#xD;
      This assessment is of interest since many severe OSA patients that should be treated with&#xD;
      CPAP are not been treated due to the difficulties to adhere to CPAP treatment. This&#xD;
      behavioral treatment could represent a partial solution until these patients lose weight,&#xD;
      consider surgery (ENT or bariatric) or the use of dental appliance or give to CPAP another&#xD;
      chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that by losing weight NPP may become PP 23 and thus, PT could&#xD;
      represent no a partial but a more radical solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. RESEARCH PLAN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned research includes five work packages designed to enable reaching the project&#xD;
      aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package I: Progression of individual obstruction events over time - retrospective&#xD;
      follow-up study In this package,we will explore how the duration of individual apnea and&#xD;
      hypopnea events and duration, depth and area of individual desaturation events progress over&#xD;
      time. It will be investigated how different confounding factors (e.g. age, BMI, sleeping&#xD;
      position and gender) affect the progression of the individual breathing cessation event&#xD;
      severity. This package is based on polysomnographic (PSG) recordings of about 400 patients&#xD;
      with suspected OSA recorded with Embla (Natus Medical Incorporated, Pleasanton, CA, USA) or&#xD;
      Rembrandt (Natus Medical Incorporated, Pleasanton, CA, USA) devices and analyzed using&#xD;
      RemLogic software at the Sleep Disorders Unit, Lowenstein Hospital - Rehabilitation Center,&#xD;
      Raanana, Israel. For all patients, two - three PSG recordings were conducted at different&#xD;
      time points, at baseline, and after 3, 5, 10 years or more. These polygraphic recordings were&#xD;
      analyzed in conformity with the standard respiratory rules specified by AASM and based on&#xD;
      clinical practice in Lowenstein Hospital at the time of analysis. Based on the analyzed&#xD;
      recordings, the severity of individual obstruction events will be calculated using&#xD;
      custom-made MATLAB (Matlab R2014b, MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) functions. Severity of&#xD;
      individual obstruction events will be compared between the different time points for each&#xD;
      patient and in a group level. Grouping of the patients will be done based on the confounding&#xD;
      factors (e.g. patients' BMI, gender, sleeping position, AHI, and age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package II: Optimization of the diagnostic parameters of OSA which incorporates the&#xD;
      severity of individual breathing cessation events In this package, the novel parameters will&#xD;
      be further refined by adding features to also include apneas not followed by desaturations&#xD;
      and hypopneas followed by arousal (but not desaturation). Furthermore, the aim is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether apneas should be given more weight than hypopneas while estimating the overall&#xD;
      severity of OSA. In this package, in-laboratory PSG recordings (n=7540) including EEG&#xD;
      conducted and analyzed at the Sleep Disorders Unit, Lowenstein Hospital - Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Center for the patients with clinical suspicion of OSA will be studied. The basic&#xD;
      anthropometric data and information on mortality and co-morbidities will be also collected.&#xD;
      All recordings were analyzed according the standard respiratory rules defined by AASM and&#xD;
      based on clinical practice in Lowenstein Hospital. Novel parameters and severity of&#xD;
      individual obstruction events will be calculated using custom-made MATLAB functions. The&#xD;
      calculated severity indexes based on enhanced and the original obstruction severity&#xD;
      parameters will be compared with incidence of OSA related mortality and co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information on mortality, cause of death and co-morbidities hopefully will be obtained&#xD;
      from the Ministry of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package III: Effect of severity of individual obstruction events on excessive daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness In this package, the investigators investigate the correlation between the&#xD;
      severity of individual breathing cessation events and excessive daytime sleepiness measured&#xD;
      with objective means (i.e. Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and Maintenance of Wakefulness&#xD;
      Test (MWT)). Furthermore, it will be studied which information obtained from PSG recordings&#xD;
      (e.g. frequency and duration of cortical arousal, sleep structure or severity of individual&#xD;
      obstruction events) is best correlated with excessive daytime sleepiness and therefore, would&#xD;
      be beneficial to take into account while estimating the severity of OSA. Clinical&#xD;
      in-laboratory PSG recordings (n=3000) of patients with suspected OSA, conducted and analyzed&#xD;
      at the Sleep Disorders Unit, Lowenstein Hospital - Rehabilitation Center with the Embla&#xD;
      devices and RemLogic software, will be used. The values of the novel parameters and the&#xD;
      severity of individual obstruction events will be calculated using custom-made MATLAB&#xD;
      functions and their correlation on results of objective tests measuring excessive daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness (i.e. MSLT and MWT) will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package IV: Differences in severity of individual obstruction events between patients&#xD;
      having severe OSA In this package, the severe OSA patients will be matched by AHI and the&#xD;
      percentage time of disturbed breathing from total sleep time will be compared between these&#xD;
      patients. The patient population consists of 463 patients diagnosed to have severe OSA after&#xD;
      full overnight PSG recording conducted at the Sleep Disorders Unit, Lowenstein Hospital -&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Center. It will be studied whether the percentage time of disturbed breathing&#xD;
      from total sleep time differs between the patients having similar AHI and whether it is&#xD;
      related to different outcome measures (e.g. hypertension and sleep efficiency). Furthermore,&#xD;
      it will be investigated whether this percentage is modulated by different confounding factors&#xD;
      (e.g. gender, BMI, and sleeping position).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package V: The assessment of the therapeutic value of Positional Therapy for severe Non&#xD;
      Positional Patients (NPP) In this package the investigators we will assess the therapeutic&#xD;
      value of Positional Therapy (PT) i.e., the avoidance of the supine posture during sleep, as a&#xD;
      treatment alternative for severe Non Positional Patients (NPP) who failed to adhere to&#xD;
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). The patient population consists of the same 463&#xD;
      patients diagnosed to have severe OSA after full overnight PSG recording conducted at the&#xD;
      Sleep Disorders Unit, Loewenstein Hospital - Rehabilitation Center. In this group of patients&#xD;
      the investigators will assess the effect of sleeping only in the lateral posture (PT) and the&#xD;
      assessment of the severity of the disease will be calculated according to conventional and&#xD;
      new methods developed previously by our research group.&#xD;
