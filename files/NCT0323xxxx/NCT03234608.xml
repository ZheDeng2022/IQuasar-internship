  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The health system is ill-equipped to meet the needs of autistic adults. The Academic Autism&#xD;
      Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education (AASPIRE), an academic-community partnership&#xD;
      comprised of academics, autistic adults, healthcare providers, and supporters, has used a&#xD;
      community based participatory research (CBPR) approach to develop and test an online&#xD;
      healthcare toolkit aimed at improving primary care services for autistic adults. It was&#xD;
      specifically designed as a low-intensity, sustainable intervention that can realistically be&#xD;
      used in busy primary care practices that do not have a special focus on autism or other&#xD;
      developmental disabilities. The toolkit includes the Autism Healthcare Accommodations Tool&#xD;
      (AHAT)--an automated tool which allows patients and/or their supporters to create a&#xD;
      personalized accommodations report for their primary care provider (PCP)--and other targeted&#xD;
      resources, worksheets, checklists, and information. The investigators' pilot work has&#xD;
      demonstrated that the AHAT has strong construct validity and test-retest stability, the&#xD;
      toolkit is highly acceptable and accessible, and it has the potential to decrease barriers to&#xD;
      care and increase patient-provider communication. The investigators' long-term plan is to&#xD;
      conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial, using a cluster randomized trial design,&#xD;
      both to test the effectiveness of the AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit in improving healthcare&#xD;
      quality and utilization and to assess the utility of implementation strategies in diverse&#xD;
      healthcare systems. The objective of this proposal is to use a CBPR approach to understand&#xD;
      how to integrate the toolkit into these health systems, collect more robust efficacy data,&#xD;
      and explore potential mechanisms of action. The investigators will do so by conducting a&#xD;
      6-month pilot study with patients assigned to intervention and control clinics in three&#xD;
      diverse health systems. The investigators will meet our objectives by achieving the following&#xD;
      specific aims: 1) to determine how to integrate use of the toolkit within diverse health&#xD;
      systems; 2) to test the effect of the toolkit on short-term healthcare outcomes; 3) to use a&#xD;
      mixed-methods approach to further explore the toolkit's mechanisms of action; and 4) to&#xD;
      refine the recruitment, retention, data collection, and system integration strategies in&#xD;
      preparation for the larger cluster-randomized trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite growing attention to the needs of autistic children, the health system is ill&#xD;
      equipped to meet the needs of autistic adults. The investigators' prior work has identified&#xD;
      significant healthcare disparities experienced by autistic adults, including greater unmet&#xD;
      healthcare needs, lower use of preventive services, and greater use of the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED). These disparities likely stem from a complex interaction between patient-,&#xD;
      provider-, and system-level factors. Autism entails atypical communication and interpersonal&#xD;
      relationships, and challenges with executive function - factors that are critically important&#xD;
      for effective healthcare interactions and health system navigation. Moreover, a majority of&#xD;
      primary care providers (PCPs) lack the skills needed to care for autistic adults, yet&#xD;
      competing priorities make it unlikely they will attend trainings on autism. The heterogeneity&#xD;
      of the autism spectrum may also make it challenging to understand a specific patient's needs.&#xD;
      Finally, autistic patients may be disproportionally affected by the complexity of the health&#xD;
      system, low socio-economic status, and societal biases, yet few systems can afford&#xD;
      autism-specific care coordination programs for adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education (AASPIRE), an&#xD;
      academic-community partnership comprised of academics, autistic adults, healthcare providers,&#xD;
      and supporters, has used a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach to develop&#xD;
      and test an online healthcare toolkit aimed at improving primary care services for autistic&#xD;
      adults. It was specifically designed as a low-intensity, sustainable intervention that can&#xD;
      realistically be used in busy primary care practices that do not have a special focus on&#xD;
      autism or other developmental disabilities. The toolkit includes the Autism Healthcare&#xD;
      Accommodations Tool (AHAT)--an automated tool which allows patients and/or their supporters&#xD;
      to create a personalized accommodations report for their PCP--and other targeted resources,&#xD;
      worksheets, checklists, and information. A series of NIMH-funded studies demonstrated that&#xD;
      the AHAT has strong construct validity and test-retest stability, and that the toolkit is&#xD;
      highly acceptable and accessible. In a 1-month pre-post intervention comparison, the&#xD;
      investigators found a decrease in barriers to care and increases in patient-provider&#xD;
      communication and confidence in healthcare. Despite these promising preliminary results, more&#xD;
      data is needed to test its effectiveness and understand how to best integrate it into diverse&#xD;
      primary care practices and health systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' long-term plan is to conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial,&#xD;
      using a cluster randomized trial design, both to test the effectiveness of the AASPIRE&#xD;
      Healthcare Toolkit in improving healthcare quality and utilization and to determine the&#xD;
      potential utility of implementation strategies in diverse healthcare systems. The objective&#xD;
      of this proposal is to use a CBPR approach to understand how to best integrate the toolkit&#xD;
      into these health systems, collect more robust efficacy data, and explore potential&#xD;
      mechanisms of action. The investigators will do so by conducting a 6-month pilot study with&#xD;
      patients assigned to intervention and control clinics in three diverse health systems. The&#xD;
      investigators will meet our objectives by achieving the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine how to integrate use of the toolkit within diverse health systems. The&#xD;
           investigators' existing CBPR partnership will expand to include local patients,&#xD;
           providers, staff, and administrators from each system. Together, the investigators will&#xD;
           decide how to make patients and providers aware of the toolkit, integrate the AHAT into&#xD;
           the electronic medical record, and respond to recommendations. The investigators will&#xD;
           collaboratively develop implementation protocols and determine how to track them. The&#xD;
           investigators will then conduct a mixed-methods, formative process evaluation to&#xD;
           optimize the likelihood of success of future implementation efforts.'&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the effect of the toolkit on short-term healthcare outcomes. The investigators&#xD;
           hypothesize that, over 6 months, the toolkit will increase satisfaction with&#xD;
           patient-provider communication and decrease barriers to healthcare in patients from&#xD;
           intervention clinics as compared to patients from control clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To use a mixed-methods approach to further explore the toolkit's mechanisms of action.&#xD;
           Quantitative data will help the investigators refine and psychometrically test our&#xD;
           measures of patient self-advocacy and visit preparedness; provider/staff use of desired&#xD;
           accommodations and strategies; and patient and provider self-efficacy. Qualitative data&#xD;
           will allow the investigators to obtain a richer understanding of how the toolkit is&#xD;
           affecting care and potentially suggest additional mechanisms of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To refine our recruitment, retention, data collection, and system integration strategies&#xD;
           in preparation for the larger cluster-randomized trial. The investigators will use this&#xD;
           study to confirm or modify our change model, choose long-term health utilization&#xD;
           outcomes to be further studied in the R01, finalize study protocols and data collection&#xD;
           instruments, and develop a flexible implementation strategy that can be feasibly applied&#xD;
           to diverse primary care clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful integration of this scalable and sustainable low-intensity intervention into&#xD;
      primary care practices within diverse health systems will empower patients and providers to&#xD;
      work together to improve health outcomes for a large, underserved and understudied population&#xD;
      with great barriers to care.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Healthcare Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>AASPIRE Health and Healthcare Self-Efficacy Scale (HHSES-21): This is a 21-item scale about patient confidence in navigating the healthcare system and managing health problems. There are two sub-scales. The Individual Level Self-Efficacy Sub-scale consists of items 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 13,14, 15, 16, and 17. The Relationship Dependent Self-Efficacy Sub-scale consists of items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 19, 20, and 21. Each sub-scale is scored by summing responses to the items, and then dividing the sum by the number of items. The resulting sub-scales have a possible range of 1-10, with higher scores corresponding to higher self-efficacy.&#xD;
Change in healthcare self-efficacy is calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the score at 6 months. A positive score indicates an improved outcome (i.e. higher self-efficacy post-intervention).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visit Preparedness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>AASPIRE Visit Preparedness Scale (VPS-6): The scale is scored by summing responses to the 6 items. It has a range of 6-30, with higher scores indicating higher visit preparedness. This scale measures how well-prepared patient felt for their most recent visit.&#xD;
Change in visit preparedness is calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the score at 6 months. Positive scores indicate an improved outcome (i.e. higher visit preparedness post-intervention).</description>

AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit: The AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit includes a variety of resources (information, worksheets, checklists, links) for patients and providers. The centerpiece of the toolkit is the Autism Healthcare Accommodations Tool, which allows a patient or their supporter to create a personalized accommodations report for the patient's provider. Intervention patients will use the toolkit and create an AHAT report. Intervention clinics will receive a copy of each patient's AHAT report, place it in the medical record, and share it with the patient's PCP and other staff.</description>

        <description>AASPIRE Health and Healthcare Self-Efficacy Scale (HHSES-21): This is a 21-item scale about patient confidence in navigating the healthcare system and managing health problems. There are two sub-scales. The Individual Level Self-Efficacy Sub-scale consists of items 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 13,14, 15, 16, and 17. The Relationship Dependent Self-Efficacy Sub-scale consists of items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 19, 20, and 21. Each sub-scale is scored by summing responses to the items, and then dividing the sum by the number of items. The resulting sub-scales have a possible range of 1-10, with higher scores corresponding to higher self-efficacy.&#xD;
Change in healthcare self-efficacy is calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the score at 6 months. A positive score indicates an improved outcome (i.e. higher self-efficacy post-intervention).</description>

AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit: The AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit includes a variety of resources (information, worksheets, checklists, links) for patients and providers. The centerpiece of the toolkit is the Autism Healthcare Accommodations Tool, which allows a patient or their supporter to create a personalized accommodations report for the patient's provider. Intervention patients will use the toolkit and create an AHAT report. Intervention clinics will receive a copy of each patient's AHAT report, place it in the medical record, and share it with the patient's PCP and other staff.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study aimed to integrate the AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit into 3 healthcare systems. The intervention relied on primary care providers receiving and using a patients' Autism Healthcare Accommodations Report (AHAT). Unfortunately, due to various implementation challenges, very few providers received the AHAT reports. As such, most participants in the intervention arm did not receive the intended intervention. Data cannot be used to assess intervention efficacy.</limitations_and_caveats>
