    <textblock>
      Recent studies have suggested that gut-brain axis may be one of the mechanisms of major&#xD;
      depression disorder (MDD). In animal studies, alteration of gut microbiota can affect&#xD;
      animal's depression or anxiety-like behavior, brain neurochemistry and inflammation. In human&#xD;
      studies, the composition of gut microbiota is different between patients with MDD and healthy&#xD;
      controls. In addition, supplementation of probiotics can improve mood status in community and&#xD;
      clinical participants. Inflammation is one of possible pathway to connect gut and brain. Gut&#xD;
      permeability and inflammation level are higher in patients with MDD. Lactobacillus plantarum&#xD;
      PS128 in one of bacteria extracted from traditional fermented food, Fu-Tsai. It can alleviate&#xD;
      depressive-like behavior reduce inflammation level in maternal separation mice. This study is&#xD;
      an 8-week open trial to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 on&#xD;
      psychophysiology in patients with MDD and higher level of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-phase study. In the first phase, we will recruited patients fulfilling the&#xD;
      following inclusion criteria: Age 20-65; fulfill Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders fifth version (DSM-V) criteria of major depressive episode in recent 2 years;&#xD;
      Psychotropics including antidepressants, antipsychotics and hypnotics have been kept&#xD;
      unchanged for at least 3 months. The exclusion criteria are: comorbid with schizophrenia,&#xD;
      bipolar disorder, or other substance use (except tobacco) disorder; having active suicidal or&#xD;
      homicidal ideation; known allergy to probiotics; comorbid with hypertension, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowl disease, liver cirrhosis, or autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases; known active bacterial, fungal, or viral infections in one month; use of&#xD;
      antibiotics, steroid, immunosuppressants, probiotics, or synbiotics in the month before&#xD;
      collecting blood and fecal samples; pregnant or lactating women; who state to have dietary&#xD;
      pattern changed or in diet within previous two months. Those hs-CRP &gt; 3 mg/L in the first&#xD;
      screen will be invited into the second phase intervention. In the second phase intervention,&#xD;
      we will give eligible patients Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 for 8 weeks, and compare&#xD;
      depression symptoms, gut microbiota, gut inflammation and permeability, and serum&#xD;
      inflammation level before and after intervention.&#xD;

      1. Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex and long-term illness that&#xD;
      involves marked disabilities in affected patients. It has been one of the leading causes of&#xD;
      global burden of disease, especially in the middle-age groups (GBD Lancet 2016; 388:1603-58).&#xD;
      It is also a common comorbidity in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and cancer (Musselman et al. 1998; Spiegel et al. 2003; Whitehead et al. 2002). The&#xD;
      mechanisms responsible for depression and its comorbidity are not clear, but inflammatory&#xD;
      processes may be implicated. Meta-analysis has shown that patients with depression have&#xD;
      higher levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-Reactive Protein (CRP), interleukin-1&#xD;
      (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (Dowlati et al. 2010;&#xD;
      Howren et al. 2009). Microbiota-gut-brain axis may explain higher inflammatory cytokines in&#xD;
      patients with MDD. Accumulating data now indicate that the gut microbiota can communicate&#xD;
      with the CNS--possibly through immune, neural, and endocrine pathways--and thereby influences&#xD;
      brain function and behavior (Cryan et al. 2012; Forsythe et al. 2016; Rogers et al. 2016).&#xD;
      Probiotics, which are defined as a live organism that when ingested in adequate amount exerts&#xD;
      a health benefit, can affect gut microbiota, brain neurochemistry, HPA axis, and&#xD;
      inflammation, and may be a novel class of psychotropics (Dinan et al. 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Microbiota-gut-brain axis The lower gastrointestinal tract contains almost 100 trillion&#xD;
      microorganisms, most of which are bacteria. The microbiota collectively encodes more than 3.3&#xD;
      million non-redundant genes, exceeding the number encoded by the human host genome by&#xD;
      150-fold (Qin et al. 2010). Many microbial gene products have important effects on metabolism&#xD;
      and the health of the host.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been numerous studies supporting the communications between gut microbiota and&#xD;
      brain. Study using germ free (GF) animal is a good model to show the relationship between&#xD;
      microbiota and brain. Compared to specific pathogen free (SPF) mice with a normal gut&#xD;
      microbiota, GF mice display increased motor activity and reduced anxiety behavior. An&#xD;
      increased turnover of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitters in striatum was&#xD;
      observed in GF mice (Diaz Heijtz et al. 2011). In addition, GF mice exhibited higher&#xD;
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone elevation in response to restraint&#xD;
      stimulus than SPF mice did (Sudo et al. 2004). It suggests that gut microbiota can affect&#xD;
      host's response to stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can affect the presentation of&#xD;
      host's psychophysiology. For example, consumption of high fat diet (HFD) is associated with&#xD;
      altered microbial diversity (Daniel et al. 2014) and reduced synaptic plasticity (Liu et al.&#xD;
      2015). HFD also increased anxiety-like behavior (Sharma et al. 2013). Adult male C57BL/6 mice&#xD;
      given HFD microbiota had significant and selective disruptions in exploratory, cognitive, and&#xD;
      stereotypical behavior compared with mice with control diet microbiota. No significant&#xD;
      differences in body weight were noted. The difference in composition of gut microbiota&#xD;
      between HFD and normal-diet groups was noted (Bruce-Keller et al. 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of antibiotics is another way to affect gut microbiota composition and change&#xD;
      host's psychophysiology. Oral administration of non-absorbable antimicrobials transiently&#xD;
      altered gut microbiota composition and increased exploratory behavior and hippocampal&#xD;
      expression of BDNF mRNA in mice, but intraperitoneal administration had no effect on behavior&#xD;
      (Bercik et al. 2011). Increased antibiotic exposures were associated with the risk of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety in a population study (Lurie et al. 2015). Therefore, administration&#xD;
      of probiotics may be a direct way to change the environment and composition of gut&#xD;
      microbiota, and observe its physiological effects on host.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Administration of Probiotics in animal studies Animal studies have shown that probiotics&#xD;
      affect psychophysiological markers of anxiety and depression. Desbonnet et al. did not find a&#xD;
      significant effect of Bifidobacteria infantis treatment on swim behaviors at day 3 or day 14&#xD;
      in naïve rats. However, Bifidobacteria infantis treatment attenuated pro-inflammatory immune&#xD;
      responses and elevated tryptophan, suggesting this probiotic may possess antidepressant&#xD;
      properties (Desbonnet et al. 2008). In their following study, they used maternal separation&#xD;
      (MS) rats as study animal. They found MS rats reduced swim behavior and increased immobility&#xD;
      in the forced swimming test (FST), decreased noradrenaline (NA) content in the brain, and&#xD;
      enhanced peripheral IL-6 release and amygdala corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA&#xD;
      levels compared to control rats (Desbonnet et al. 2010). Bifidobacteria infantis treatment&#xD;
      resulted in normalization of the immune response, reversal of behavioral deficits, and&#xD;
      restoration of basal NA concentrations in the brainstem. These changes were comparable to&#xD;
      those observed in the citalopram group, suggesting that some probiotic benefits are similar&#xD;
      to antidepressant effects (Desbonnet et al. 2010). Liu et al found that Lactobacillus&#xD;
      plantarum PS128 (PS128) could ameliorate anxiety-like, but not depression-like behavior in GF&#xD;
      mice, and significantly increased levels of both serotonin and dopamine in striatum, but not&#xD;
      in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (Liu WH et al. 2016). In MS model, however, PS128&#xD;
      significantly reduced depression-like, but not anxiety-like behaviors. PS128 significantly&#xD;
      reduced anxiety-like, but not depression-like behavior in naïve mice. It also reduced&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, levels and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, level in&#xD;
      MS mice (Liu YW et al. 2016). PS128 had more obvious effect on psychophysiology in MS mice&#xD;
      than that in naive mice suggests that probiotic administration may have more robust effect on&#xD;
      modification in behaviors, neurochemistry, and HPA in those suffering from higher stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Microbiota composition in patients with MDD Since compositions of gut microbiota alter&#xD;
      inflammation, neurochemistry and behavior in animal studies, several human studies compared&#xD;
      gut microbiota between patients with MDD and healthy controls. Naseribafrouei et al. compared&#xD;
      gut microbiota compositions in 37 depressed and 18 non-depressed participants. The results&#xD;
      showed Bacteroidales overpresentation, while Lachnospiraceae underrepresentation, in&#xD;
      depressed participants. At low taxonomic levels, Oscillibacter and Alistipes were associated&#xD;
      with depression (Naseribafrouei et al. 2014). Jiang et al recruited 29 active MDD (A-MDD), 17&#xD;
      responded MDD (R-MDD), and 30 healthy controls (HC) and compared their gut microbiota. They&#xD;
      found that increased fecal bacterial alpha-diversity in the A-MDD vs. the HC group but not in&#xD;
      the R-MDD vs. the HC group. Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria significantly&#xD;
      increased, whereas that of Firmicutes was significantly reduced in the A-MDD and R-MDD groups&#xD;
      compared with the HC group. MDD groups had increased levels of Enterobacteriaceae and&#xD;
      Alistipes, but reduced levels of Faecalibacterium (Jiang et al. 2015). Not only differences&#xD;
      in composition of gut microbiota between patients with MDD and healthy control, transplanting&#xD;
      fecal sample from MDD patients into mice can induce depressive-like behavior in recipient&#xD;
      mice. The composition of gut microbiota in recipient mice was similar to that of human host&#xD;
      (Zheng et al. 2016). This study supports that gut microbiome may have a causal role in the&#xD;
      development of depressive-like behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Effects of probiotics on mood in human studies In addition to the differences in&#xD;
      distribution of gut microbiota between depressed subjects and non-depressed subjects, several&#xD;
      human studies have shown that probiotics may have beneficial effect on mood. Benton et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated that no significant difference in change of mood, measured by Profile of Mood&#xD;
      State, between healthy participants using probiotic (containing Lactobacillus casei) milk for&#xD;
      3 weeks and those using milk without probiotic. However, they found that those who were in&#xD;
      low mood at baseline became better after using probiotic-containing milk (Benton et al.&#xD;
      2007). Mohammadi et al. also showed that participants using probiotic yogurt (containing&#xD;
      Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 and Bifidobacterium lactis BB12) or probiotic capsule&#xD;
      (containing Actobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. bulgaricus, .B. breve, B.&#xD;
      longum, S. thermophiles) for 6 weeks had significant improvement in mood, measured by GHQ and&#xD;
      Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale, but those using conventional yogurt did not have&#xD;
      significant change in these measurement. There were no differences in HPA axis indices, such&#xD;
      as cortisol and ACTH, among these three groups (Mohammadi et al. 2016). Messaoudi's study, in&#xD;
      which participants were healthy volunteer, showed that probiotics (containing L. helveticus&#xD;
      R0052 and B. longum R0175) administration could improve participants' mood symptoms, measured&#xD;
      by Hopkins Symptom Checklist-90 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, compared to those&#xD;
      used placebo (Messaoudi et al. 2011). Heightened cognitive reactivity to normal, transient&#xD;
      changes in sad mood is an established marker of vulnerability to depression and is considered&#xD;
      an important target for interventions (Kruijt et al. 2013). Steenbergen et al. found that&#xD;
      overall cognitive reactivity significantly reduced, which was largely accounted for by&#xD;
      reduced rumination and aggression subscales, in participants without current mood disorders&#xD;
      after 4 weeks multispecies probiotics administration. Because they used non-depressed&#xD;
      participants, BDI and BAI did not significantly change after intervention (Steenbergen et al.&#xD;
      2015). The efficacy of probiotics in mood symptoms is not only shown in healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      but also in clinical subjects. In patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, Rao et al. found&#xD;
      that administration of Lactobacillus casei for 2 months could improve BAI, but not BDI,&#xD;
      compared to placebo. At the same time fecal Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria increased after&#xD;
      2-month L. casei intervention (Rao et al. 2009). Akkasheh et al. gave multi-species&#xD;
      probiotics, containing Lactobacillus acidophilum, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      bifidum, or placebo to patients with MDD for 8 weeks. They found that multi-species&#xD;
      probiotics could significantly reduce BDI scores in patients with major depressive disorder&#xD;
      (Akkasheh et al. 2016), but which strain of probiotics exerts the beneficial effect is not&#xD;
      clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Childhood trauma, inflammation, and gut permeability in depression In animal study, early&#xD;
      life stress, such as maternal separation, elevated IL-6 level and increased depressive-like&#xD;
      behavior (increased immobility time in FST) (Liu YW et al. 2016). One recent metaanalysis&#xD;
      showed that childhood trauma contributes to a pro-inflammatory state in adulthood (Baumeister&#xD;
      et al. 2016). In addition, childhood trauma also increased the risk of depressive disorders&#xD;
      (Norman et al. 2012). Metaanalyses have shown that patients with MDD have elevated serum&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokins (Dowlati et al. 2010; Howren et al. 2009). One possible mechanism&#xD;
      contributing to systemic inflammation in patients with MDD is bacterial translocation due to&#xD;
      increased gut permeability (leaky gut). Figure 2 shows the relationship among childhood&#xD;
      trauma, gut permeability, inflammation, and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every microbe possesses a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) or pathogen-associated&#xD;
      molecular pattern (PAMP). Microbes leaking from gut activate the MAMPs and&#xD;
      pattern-recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Proinflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, are released from cells after a series of signal transduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics may affect gut permeability. HFD-derived gut microbiota increased intestinal&#xD;
      permeability, systemic inflammation, and brain inflammation (Bruce-Keller et al. 2015). One&#xD;
      in-vitro study showed that Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ameliorates gut barrier dysfunction and&#xD;
      inflammation through inhibition of NF-kappaB (Donato et al. 2010). Administration of&#xD;
      Lactobacillus farciminis could alleviate intestinal permeability and inflammation in partial&#xD;
      restraint rats (Ait-Belgnaoui et al. 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of increased gut permeability in patients with MDD was revealed by Maes' studies.&#xD;
      Maes et al found that the median values for serum IgM and IgA against LPS of gram-negative&#xD;
      enterobacteria were significantly greater in patients with MDD than in normal volunteers,&#xD;
      suggesting that increased gut permeability results in an increased translocation of&#xD;
      gram-negative microbiota (Maes et al. 2008; Maes et al. 2012). In patients with alcohol&#xD;
      dependence, those with increased gut permeability, which was measured by the radioactive&#xD;
      probe 51Cr-EDTA, had higher depression and anxiety scores than those with normal gut&#xD;
      permeability. The composition and activity of microbiota were altered in patients with&#xD;
      increased gut permeability (Leclercq et al. 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6 Rationale of current study PS128 was found in traditional fermented food, fu-tsai, by our&#xD;
      co-PI (Tsai YC) and its genome architecture has been finished and indicated its potential&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effect. (Chao et al. 2009). Lactobacillus plantarum is generally recognized&#xD;
      as safe (GRAS). PS128 can reduce IL-6 levels and increased IL-10 level, which accompanied&#xD;
      with improved depression-like behavior, in MS mice (Liu YW et al. 2016). In the current&#xD;
      study, we would like to investigate the effect of PS128 on psychophysiology, including&#xD;
      composition of gut microbiota, gut permeability and inflammation, TLR expression, serum&#xD;
      cytokines levels, and depressive symptoms in patients with MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metaanalyses have shown that patients with MDD have higher inflammatory cytokines (Dowlati et&#xD;
      al. 2010; Howren et al. 2009), but only a subgroup of patients with MDD has a higher level of&#xD;
      inflammation. For example, according to the definition of high inflammation of hs-CRP &gt; 3&#xD;
      mg/l (Pearson et al. 2003), the proportion of patients with high inflammation was 24 % in&#xD;
      patients with MDD (Rapaport et al. 2016) and 45% in patients with treatment-resistant&#xD;
      depression (Raison et al. 2011). Baseline inflammatory level may affect treatment response.&#xD;
      For example, patients with high baseline inflammation had better treatment response to&#xD;
      infliximab (tumor necrosis factor antagonist) (Raison et al. 2013) and omega-3 fatty acids&#xD;
      (Rapaport et al. 2016) compared to those with low baseline inflammation. In Raison's study,&#xD;
      the effect of infliximab on depression symptoms was worse than placebo in those with lower&#xD;
      inflammatory level at baseline (Raison et al. 2013). Therefore, we will recruit patients with&#xD;
      MDD and high inflammatory level into our PS128 intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that PS128 can (1) change the composition of gut microbiota; (2) improve gut&#xD;
      permeability, which is measured by fecal zonulin level, and inflammation, which is measured&#xD;
      by fecal calprotectin level; (3) reduce the translocation of pathogen into circulation&#xD;
      system, which will be demonstrated by reduced TLR expression, (4) reduce IL-6 and TNF-alpha,&#xD;
      and hs-CRP, and increase IL-10 level. We hope the improvement in inflammation level can also&#xD;
      have a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms.&#xD;
