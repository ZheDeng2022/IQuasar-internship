  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unstable plaques are characterized by lower segmental stiffness and intimal&#xD;
      neovascularization compared to stable plaques. Our objective is to determine the capacity of&#xD;
      the elastographic parameters obtained by the UF to discriminate the unstable to the stable&#xD;
      plaques. We hope to improve the stroke prediction in asymptomatic patients with carotid&#xD;
      stenosis.&#xD;

      Context&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke is the second leading cause of death in the Western world and the leading cause of&#xD;
      major disability in the long term. About 15% of strokes are secondary to thrombosis or&#xD;
      embolization of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque of the carotid bifurcation. In these&#xD;
      symptomatic patients, the degree of carotid stenosis is correlated with the risk of early&#xD;
      recurrence. In patients with stenosis (NASCET)&gt; 70%, endarterectomy is an intervention aimed&#xD;
      at removing the carotid plaque to prevent stroke. In asymptomatic patients, the degree of&#xD;
      stenosis is a limited predictive factor and a better risk stratification is required to&#xD;
      assess the degree of the plaque vulnerability. The therapeutic decision towards&#xD;
      endarterectomy in addition to drug therapy is debated because of a variable benefit/ risk&#xD;
      balance. Several imaging parameters were studied: anfractuosity, heterogeneity, and&#xD;
      vascularization of the plaque for example, without allowing a modification of the current&#xD;
      recommendations. Our objective is to improve the evaluation of the risk of stroke by the fine&#xD;
      characterization of the carotid stenosis to help the medical decision. We want to evaluate a&#xD;
      new ultrasound imaging technology called Ultrafast ultrasound imaging (UF). Ultrasound has&#xD;
      the advantage of being a non-irradiating, low-cost easily accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unstable plaques are characterized by lower segmental stiffness and intimal&#xD;
      neovascularization compared to stable plaques. Our objective is to determine the capacity of&#xD;
      the elastographic parameters obtained by the UF to discriminate the unstable to the stable&#xD;
      plaques. We hope to improve the stroke prediction in asymptomatic patients with carotid&#xD;
      stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovative aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The originality of the approach is the use of an advanced imaging technique, UF, developed by&#xD;
      the Langevin Institute with Mathias Fink, and already validated in the study of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness with pulse wave analysis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project for the application of UF in atherosclerotic plaques stems from the ability to&#xD;
      analyze the biomechanical properties of tissues by ultrasound elastography, already developed&#xD;
      in the breast, liver and thyroid. Not only does UF determine the tissue stiffness expressed&#xD;
      in kPa (Young's modulus) of the arterial wall and therefore of the carotid plaque, but UF&#xD;
      also offers the possibility of establishing a rigidity mapping at the μm3 scale And therefore&#xD;
      to approach the variability of the rigidity inside the plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, following the recent development of the Doppler UF by the Langevin Institute, the&#xD;
      capabilities of this tool in the precise detection of microvascular flows make it a&#xD;
      cutting-edge tool adapted to the study of the vascularization of the carotid plaque As well&#xD;
      as the study of the hemodynamic shear stresses that apply to the surface of the plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is the development and validation of informative biomarkers of the carotid&#xD;
      plaque stability by UF in order to improve the stroke prediction in case of asymptomatic&#xD;
      stenosis. A UF-ultrasound approach is a non-irradiating, easily accessible, and low cost&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - to demonstrate a significant difference in the local stiffness measurement using UF between&#xD;
      the stable and unstable plaques, according to the histological criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to compare the stiffness between plaque and its adjacent arterial segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to show a correlation between the plaque's stiffness and the histological quantification&#xD;
           of the fibrous tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to demonstrate a correlation between the elasticity of the plaque and the histological&#xD;
           quantification of the calcifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. compare the quantification of vascularization by UF Doppler with the number of&#xD;
           neovessels histologically quantified&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the quantification of the wall shear stress evaluated by UF Doppler between&#xD;
           stable and unstable plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. to compare all the different parameters used to evaluated the plaque's stability, but&#xD;
           depending on whether or not the carotid stenosis is symptomatic.&#xD;
