  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food is selected primarily on their taste and texture properties. It is essential to get more&#xD;
      insight in taste and texture characteristics of the foods in the Dutch and Malaysian diets&#xD;
      for a better understanding of food choices. Currently, there is insufficient information on&#xD;
      taste and texture properties of foods to relate these properties to the composition of diets&#xD;
      and individual food choice in larger (observational) studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the investigators want to assess the perceived intensities of the 5&#xD;
      basic tastes, i.e. sweet, salt, sour, bitter and umami, as well as fat sensation and texture,&#xD;
      in an array of about 1,000 often consumed Dutch and Malaysian foods. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      do this with a trained sensory panel, which is a well-accepted way of assessing perception of&#xD;
      sensory attributes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the current study, the investigators aim to build a table, which is comparable to the&#xD;
      food composition table, but contains data that describes foods and meals in terms of sensory&#xD;
      properties. That is, investigators want to quantify sensory characteristics of about 1,000&#xD;
      commonly eaten Dutch and Malaysian foods. This enables investigators to add sensory&#xD;
      information to the food intake data that is already being collected in observational studies,&#xD;
      and to further understand food choices in specific populations, such as elderly and patient&#xD;
      groups. In current project, the investigators also aim to compare the Dutch diet to the&#xD;
      Malaysian diet in term of sensory properties.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an observational study on taste and texture of commonly consumed Dutch and&#xD;
      Malaysian foods with three phases, i.e. screening, training and tasting sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be held in the sensory tasting rooms at Wageningen University, The Netherlands&#xD;
      and Taylor's University, Malaysia, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the recruitment and prior to the training and tasting sessions, there will be a 2-hour&#xD;
      screening session (Phase I) during which the investigators will select respective Dutch and&#xD;
      Malaysian participants based on their performance in a sensory test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the training session (Phase II), the participants need to commit and involve in 2&#xD;
      1½-hour sessions a week for approximately four- six months (until sufficiently trained).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the tasting sessions (Phase III), trained Dutch and Malaysian panellist also need to&#xD;
      involve in 2-3 sessions a week for a consecutive three years. Each session will take&#xD;
      approximately 1½ hour. During this session, series of food will be rated for their taste, fat&#xD;
      and texture. In addition, food texture will be measured by eating rate and quantifying the&#xD;
      size of the bites which it is eaten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual performance of the panellist also are discussed with the panellists and monitored&#xD;
      throughout the training phase and regularly (each month) during the tasting phase.&#xD;

    <description>For individual taste attributes of the reference solutions and reference foods, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the performance of each panel on discrimination, repeatability and agreement according to the following model:&#xD;
Attribute= µ + product (P) + assessor (A) + replicate (r) + product*assessor (P*A) + product*replicate (P*r) + assessor*replicate (A*r) + E, where product= discrimination, assessor= consistency of ratings between assessors, replicate= consistency of ratings from one session to another, product*replicate= panel repeatability, product*assessor = agreement between assessors, assessor*replicate= assessor repeatability. The replicate scores deviated from the product mean for all taste attributes from the total scale were also reported as root mean squared error (RMSE) of the ANOVA model without replicate effect</description>

    <description>This is an observational Sensory study methodologically similar to &quot;Astringency and bitterness perception clinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03171402 &quot;Participants are first involved in sensory training sessions that train how they recognise between different basic tastes and differentiate perceived intensity in solutions and foods. After 6 months of training, the trained participants are involved in tasting a wide array of commonly consumed foods. At this study phase, participants will rate for the foods' taste, fat sensation perception and texture</description>
