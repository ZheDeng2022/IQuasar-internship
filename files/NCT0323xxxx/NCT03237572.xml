      This pilot study evaluates the use of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) combined with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer. One-half of participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive the first dose of pembrolizumab after HIFU and one-half of participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive their first dose of pembrolizumab before HIFU.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any receptor status (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2 receptor).&#xD;
             Patients who are HR+ should also no longer be candidates for hormonal-based therapy.&#xD;
             Patients who are HER2+ should have progressed on or no longer be candidates for&#xD;
             available HER2 directed therapy. Hormonal therapy must be stopped prior to day 1 of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had at least one prior line of therapy for breast cancer in the&#xD;
             metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an accessible lesion in the breast/chest wall/axilla which has not&#xD;
             been previously thermally ablated. Prior breast irradiation is acceptable if the&#xD;
             lesion has recurred or grown following radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one target lesion in breast/chest wall/axilla which is&#xD;
             amenable to application of high intensity focused ultrasound:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional&#xD;
             biopsy of a tumor lesion.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis of immunodeficiency, patients receiving systemic steroid&#xD;

             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to study Day 1. Patients who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;

          -  Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent within the prior 24&#xD;
             weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.&#xD;
