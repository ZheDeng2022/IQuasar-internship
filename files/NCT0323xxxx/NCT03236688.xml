      Demonstrate detection of ARv7 splice variant transcripts from exosomes in the circulation of&#xD;

      abiraterone and enzalutamide)&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Demonstrate detection of ARv7 splice variant transcripts from exosomes in the circulation of&#xD;
      MCRPC patients pre and post treatment with selective Androgen pathway inhibitors (i.e.&#xD;
      abiraterone and enzalutamide)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary and Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate ARv7 status with PSA response (&gt;/=50% decline in PSA level from baseline,&#xD;
           maintained for &gt;/=4 weeks) at any time after the initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine additional molecular lesions in exoRNA and cfDNA in MCRPC patients&#xD;
           post-treatment with androgen pathway inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate other AR-variants (non ARv7) with clinical outcomes including PSA response.&#xD;

    <measure>Detection of ARv7 splice variant in the circulation of MCRPC patients. PSA response rate in ARv7 positive patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>The detection of ARv7 splice variants in samples will be considered both binary: positive or negative/not assessable and level based. ARv7 splice variants from exosomes will be detectable from baseline in 50% of both API; PSA response rates will be 10% or less in ARv7 positive patients. With a sample of 30 patients (as reported in the NEJM study) per cohort would allow the study to have an 85% power to detect a difference of 50 percentage points in PSA response rates, with the use of a two-sided test at an alpha level of 0.1.</description>
