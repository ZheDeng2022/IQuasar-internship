  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaps in delivery of gender-sensitive comprehensive care have resulted in disparities in&#xD;
      quality and patient experience among women seen in VA. VA policy action providing guidance on&#xD;
      delivery of comprehensive healthcare services for women Veterans was disseminated nationally&#xD;
      in 2010, followed by annual assessments and site visits evaluating local VA efforts. While&#xD;
      substantial inroads have been made, policy implementation, even when leveraged by field-based&#xD;
      women's health leaders, has not been uniformly successful in achieving delivery of&#xD;
      comprehensive care by designated providers in gender-sensitive care environments that ensure&#xD;
      women's privacy, dignity and safety, all tenets of the original guidance and the updated&#xD;
      directive (2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on prior effectiveness of an evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) approach to&#xD;
      tailoring VA's medical home model -- Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) -- to the needs of&#xD;
      women Veterans, VA leaders in women's health adopted EBQI to help low-performing VAs&#xD;
      systematically improve services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the resulting Partnered Evaluation Initiative (PEI) funded by VA's Quality&#xD;
      Enhancement Research Initiative and VA Office of Women's Health were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate barriers and facilitators to achieving delivery of comprehensive women's&#xD;
           health care in the identified low-performing VAs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate effectiveness of EBQI in supporting low-performing VA facilities achieve&#xD;
           improved organizational features, provider/staff attitudes, quality of care, and patient&#xD;
           experiences among women Veteran patients; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate contextual factors, local implementation processes, and organizational&#xD;
           changes in the participating facilities over time.&#xD;

      Gaps in delivery of gender-sensitive comprehensive care have resulted in disparities in&#xD;
      quality and patient experience among women seen in VA. VA policy action providing guidance on&#xD;
      delivery of comprehensive healthcare services for women Veterans was disseminated nationally&#xD;
      in 2010, followed by annual assessments and site visits evaluating local VA efforts. While&#xD;
      substantial inroads have been made, policy implementation, even when leveraged by field-based&#xD;
      women's health leaders, has not been uniformly successful in achieving delivery of&#xD;
      comprehensive care by designated providers in gender-sensitive care environments that ensure&#xD;
      women's privacy, dignity and safety, all tenets of the original guidance and the updated VA&#xD;
      directive (2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with VA Women's Health Services (WHS), VA researchers developed a series of&#xD;
      studies to better understand and help improve comprehensive care implementation through the&#xD;
      Women Veterans' Healthcare CREATE Initiative. Among these, one focused on testing an&#xD;
      evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) approach to tailoring VA's medical home model --&#xD;
      Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) -- to the needs of women Veterans, which has yielded&#xD;
      significant local improvements in women Veterans' care. EBQI emphasizes a multilevel&#xD;
      partnered approach to building capacity for innovation, implementation and spread of&#xD;
      evidence-based practice. With its demonstrated success in the CREATE PACT study and several&#xD;
      other EBQI trials, WHS adopted EBQI as a strategy to help low-performing VA facilities&#xD;
      systematically improve services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the WHS/QUERI Partnered Evaluation Initiative that this project represents&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the barriers and facilitators to achieving delivery of comprehensive women's&#xD;
           health care in the identified low-performing VA facilities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of EBQI in supporting low-performing VA facilities achieve&#xD;
           improved:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Organizational features (e.g., level of comprehensive services available; care&#xD;
                coordination arrangements; PACT features implemented; environment of care&#xD;
                improvements);&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Provider/staff attitudes (e.g., improved gender awareness; women's health knowledge&#xD;
                and practice);&#xD;
&#xD;
           d) Quality of care and patient experiences among women Veteran patients using secondary&#xD;
           data; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate contextual factors, local implementation processes, and organizational&#xD;
           changes in the participating facilities over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the evaluation have been used to provide feedback to stakeholders, including women&#xD;
      Veterans, at the local, network and national levels, while also being used to continuously&#xD;
      refine EBQI implementation processes. The evaluation is also helping inform optimal&#xD;
      strategies for ongoing improvements in women Veterans' care in the 21 participating VA&#xD;
      facilities, other VA facilities and for other improvement initiatives in this and other&#xD;
      national program offices.&#xD;

          <description>EBQI represents a multilevel stakeholder engaged top-down/bottom-up research-clinical partnership approach to systematically improving the design and implementation of local innovations adapted to local contexts. The EBQI contractor will (1) convene facility-level stakeholder meetings, (2) facilitate local facility-level quality improvement (QI) team design meetings, (3) provide external practice facilitation through within and across facility QI collaboration calls, (4) provide formative QI data feedback and (5) provide QI training/education to local teams.&#xD;
Launched at participating VA facilities through advance key stakeholder interviews, in-person site visits, data review (e.g., structure and environment of care, gender disparities in quality and patient experience), QI training, technical support (e.g., QI project and measures development), additional formative feedback from the evaluation (e.g., provider/survey measure summaries), external and internal practice facilitation, and across-EBQI site collaboration calls. Local leadership, EBQI champions and QI teams develop and implement innovation projects aimed at improving prioritized quality targets related to women Veterans' health and healthcare needs as well as facility-level structural changes needed to improve compliance with VA guidelines.</description>

            <title>Evidence-Based Quality Improvement (EBQI)</title>
            <description>EBQI represents a multilevel stakeholder engaged top-down/bottom-up research-clinical partnership approach to systematically improving the design and implementation of local innovations adapted to local contexts. The EBQI contractor will (1) convene facility-level stakeholder meetings, (2) facilitate local facility-level QI team design meetings, (3) provide external practice facilitation through within and across facility QI collaboration calls, (4) provide formative QI data feedback and (5) provide QI training/education to local teams.&#xD;
Launched at participating VA facilities through advance key stakeholder interviews, in-person site visits, data review (e.g., structure and environment of care, gender disparities in quality and patient experience), QI training, technical support (e.g., QI project and measures development), additional formative feedback from the evaluation (e.g., provider/survey measure summaries), external and internal practice facilitation, and across-EBQI site collaboration calls. Local leadership, EBQI champions and QI teams develop and implement innovation projects aimed at improving prioritized quality targets related to women Veterans' health and healthcare needs as well as facility-level structural changes needed to improve compliance with VA guidelines.</description>

            <description>EBQI represents a multilevel stakeholder engaged top-down/bottom-up research-clinical partnership approach to systematically improving the design and implementation of local innovations adapted to local contexts. The EBQI contractor will (1) convene facility-level stakeholder meetings, (2) facilitate local facility-level QI team design meetings, (3) provide external practice facilitation through within and across facility QI collaboration calls, (4) provide formative QI data feedback and (5) provide QI training/education to local teams.&#xD;
Launched at participating VA facilities through advance key stakeholder interviews, in-person site visits, data review (e.g., structure and environment of care, gender disparities in quality and patient experience), QI training, technical support (e.g., QI project and measures development), additional formative feedback from the evaluation (e.g., provider/survey measure summaries), external and internal practice facilitation, and across-EBQI site collaboration calls. Local leadership, EBQI champions and QI teams develop and implement innovation projects aimed at improving prioritized quality targets related to women Veterans' health and healthcare needs as well as facility-level structural changes needed to improve compliance with VA guidelines.</description>

            <description>EBQI represents a multilevel stakeholder engaged top-down/bottom-up research-clinical partnership approach to systematically improving the design and implementation of local innovations adapted to local contexts. The EBQI contractor will (1) convene facility-level stakeholder meetings, (2) facilitate local facility-level QI team design meetings, (3) provide external practice facilitation through within and across facility QI collaboration calls, (4) provide formative QI data feedback and (5) provide QI training/education to local teams.&#xD;
Launched at participating VA facilities through advance key stakeholder interviews, in-person site visits, data review (e.g., structure and environment of care, gender disparities in quality and patient experience), QI training, technical support (e.g., QI project and measures development), additional formative feedback from the evaluation (e.g., provider/survey measure summaries), external and internal practice facilitation, and across-EBQI site collaboration calls. Local leadership, EBQI champions and QI teams develop and implement innovation projects aimed at improving prioritized quality targets related to women Veterans' health and healthcare needs as well as facility-level structural changes needed to improve compliance with VA guidelines.</description>

The EBQI contractor will (1) convene facility-level stakeholder meetings, (2) facilitate local facility-level QI team design meetings, (3) provide external practice facilitation through within and across facility QI collaboration calls, (4) provide formative QI data feedback and (5) provide QI training/education to local teams.&#xD;
Launched at participating VA facilities through advance key stakeholder interviews, in-person site visits, data review (e.g., structure and environment of care, gender disparities in quality and patient experience), QI training, technical support (e.g., QI project and measures development), additional formative feedback from the evaluation (e.g., provider/survey measure summaries), external and internal practice facilitation, and across-EBQI site collaboration calls. Local leadership, EBQI champions and QI teams develop and implement innovation projects aimed at improving prioritized quality targets related to women Veterans' health and healthcare needs as well as facility-level structural changes needed to improve compliance with VA guidelines.</description>

            <description>EBQI represents a multilevel stakeholder engaged top-down/bottom-up research-clinical partnership approach to systematically improving the design and implementation of local innovations adapted to local contexts. The EBQI contractor will (1) convene facility-level stakeholder meetings, (2) facilitate local facility-level QI team design meetings, (3) provide external practice facilitation through within and across facility QI collaboration calls, (4) provide formative QI data feedback and (5) provide QI training/education to local teams.&#xD;
Launched at participating VA facilities through advance key stakeholder interviews, in-person site visits, data review (e.g., structure and environment of care, gender disparities in quality and patient experience), QI training, technical support (e.g., QI project and measures development), additional formative feedback from the evaluation (e.g., provider/survey measure summaries), external and internal practice facilitation, and across-EBQI site collaboration calls. Local leadership, EBQI champions and QI teams develop and implement innovation projects aimed at improving prioritized quality targets related to women Veterans' health and healthcare needs as well as facility-level structural changes needed to improve compliance with VA guidelines.</description>
