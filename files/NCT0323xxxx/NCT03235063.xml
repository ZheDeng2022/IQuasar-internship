  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing cases of women with dilated cardiomyopathy with a project of pregnancy are&#xD;
      observed. However there is few knowledge and publications about cardiac diseases in pregnant&#xD;
      women. Moreover the majority of medical articles deal with women with congenital heart&#xD;
      diseases, valvular pathologies or peripartum cardiomyopathies, and few data are available in&#xD;
      literature about women with dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed before or during the first&#xD;
      months of the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiologist and obstetrician advices are considerably limited when patients with dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy have a pregnancy project. Knowledges and know-how are currently based on&#xD;
      limited personal experiment or on few clinical cases descriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy represents a high-risk situation for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Creation&#xD;
      of a cohort of pregnant women with dilated cardiomyopathy collecting specific data will allow&#xD;
      to have a better overview and to appreciate possibilities of a pregnancy project, evolution&#xD;
      risks and modalities for medical attention and to improve follow-up and advices delivered to&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a national (20 centres) retrospective (10 years) and prospective registry of&#xD;
      pregnant women with dilated cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study is observational, medical attention of the enrolled patients will not be&#xD;
      modified. No specific visit is planned for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the enrolment of the patient, the investigator provides the subject with clear and&#xD;
      precise information about the protocol and requests her for written informed consent. The&#xD;
      French ethical committee gave the investigators the possibility to include women in the&#xD;
      registry if the investigators are unable to inform her (deceased women, no follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate clinical characteristics and study maternal&#xD;
      and neonatal evolution and complications during pregnancy using analysis of the&#xD;
      morbi-mortality and clinical and para clinical criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be compiled in a case report form (e-CRF):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk factors, cardiac history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BNP or NTproBNP value, echocardiographic data (LVEF and LV diameter)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical treatment before and during the pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complications; occurrences during the pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modalities of medical attention during delivery: mother/child Patient's data are coded,&#xD;
           and therefore anonymous, by using the inclusion number and initials of the patient&#xD;
           (first letter of name and first letter of surname (ex: 01-X_X).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective and retrospective, multi-centre, clinical study, all patients enrolled in&#xD;
      the cohort will be included in the statistical analysis. As an observational non-randomized&#xD;
      single arm evaluation, the statistical analyses will be descriptive. A minimum of 100&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
