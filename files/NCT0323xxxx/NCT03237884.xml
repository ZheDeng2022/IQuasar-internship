      Palliative Care procedures should be integrated early in the course of disease of patients&#xD;
      with advanced incurable cancer. With this study, where the investigators follow adult&#xD;
      patients with incurable cancer over 6 months or until death (whatever occurs earlier), the&#xD;
      investigators aim to identify patients' needs for Palliative Care interventions (like support&#xD;
      in illness understanding and decision making, symptom management, concrete end-of-life&#xD;
      preparation, and others) and their remembered delivery by health care professionals. The&#xD;
      investigators also collect data on patients care (use of chemotherapy, intensive care in the&#xD;
      last month of life) and quality of death and dying (assessed by post-death-interviews with&#xD;
      bereaved relatives). The aim is to have a &quot;reality map&quot; on current integration of oncology&#xD;
      and palliative care and to test if appropriate Palliative Care interventions predict a better&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

      Background The integration of Palliative Care (PC) in routine oncological care remains&#xD;
      challenging, particularly in resource-restricted, culturally diverse, and regulatory/legal&#xD;
      disperse settings like Romania. The investigators aim to collect original data (&quot;reality&#xD;
      map&quot;) about the implementation of Key-Interventions Palliative-Cancer-Care (KI-PCC) and&#xD;
      specific outcome quality indicators (QI). The investigators also hypothesize that both&#xD;
      predefined cofactors and appropriately delivered KI-PCC will predict quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim is to detect gaps in the care of advanced incurable cancer patients. Because in&#xD;
      this setting there are no predefined structures, the investigators focus on interventions&#xD;
      perceived by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The investigators' target population are advanced incurable cancer patients in&#xD;
      different care settings (oncology clinics, Palliative Care centers, and hospice, varying in&#xD;
      size, location (rural, urban) and grade of specialization) representing the heterogeneity of&#xD;
      care in Romania. The investigators characterize the population using demographic data (EAPC&#xD;
      basic dataset amended by country specific data like family structures and income), and&#xD;
      validated tools for patient needs (IPOS, EQ5D). Need for and perceived Key interventions of&#xD;
      Palliative Cancer Care (KI-PCC), measured by nurse-patient-interaction, are assessed. These&#xD;
      KI-PCC include illness understanding, symptom management, decision making, spirituality,&#xD;
      end-of-life-preparation, and network/family support. Further, the investigators collect&#xD;
      defined outcome quality indicators (QI) for the integration (quality of death and dying,&#xD;
      symptoms, aggressive end-of-life-care, inappropriate anticancer care, ER-visits). In&#xD;
      addition, known, associated cofactors (e.g. comorbidities, living situation) are measured.&#xD;
      The data collection will be longitudinal with monthly follow-ups for at most six months or&#xD;
      until death. Focus groups at each participating center explore local influencing factors both&#xD;
      for KI-PCC and QI. Several steps of quality assurance (source data verification, expert&#xD;
      reviews of anticancer treatment, etc.) are introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis has three elements. First, the investigators will describe the population.&#xD;
      Second, the investigators will map the patient perceived KI-PCC and defined outcome QI.&#xD;
      Third, if data show robust after international expert review, the investigators will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that appropriate KI-PCC predict quality of care, measured by QI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected impact The investigators expect that their approach will identify gaps in the&#xD;
      integration of oncology and palliative care in their specific settings, focusing, however,&#xD;
      mainly on patient and proxy view and backed by available information from outcome QI. The&#xD;
      conduct of this protocol might also directly have an influence on patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach will allow the development of tailored interventions in a next step. The&#xD;
      investigators' approach may also serve as a model to measure the integration of oncology and&#xD;
      palliative care in various settings, focusing on interventions.&#xD;
