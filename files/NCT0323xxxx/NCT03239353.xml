  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomized, parallel-group, single-center study in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two parts sequentially:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is an open-label, two-arm, active-controlled design to evaluate the PK and safety of&#xD;
      single oral dose of ETV XR tablet (1.5 mg) in healthy subjects. Part 1 will consist of 16&#xD;
      healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is a double-blind, three-arm, placebo-controlled design to evaluate the PK and safety&#xD;
      of higher oral doses of ETV XR tablet (3 mg and 6 mg) in healthy subjects. Part 2 will&#xD;
      consist of 24 healthy subjects.&#xD;
