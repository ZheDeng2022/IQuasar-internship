      Inclusion Criteria: aged 21 and older, BMI&gt;=25, and presence of recurrent binge eating on the&#xD;
      MOVE! Survey. Exclusion Criteria: more than 4 MOVE! sessions in the prior year; active&#xD;
      psychosis or suicidal ideation; medical or psychiatric illness, or cognitive deficits that&#xD;
      interfere with providing consent or completing assessments, and; pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the VA's MOVE! Program at VA Connecticut Healthcare&#xD;
      System (both Newington and West Haven campuses). Those participants who meet eligibility and&#xD;
      are interested in the study will meet with a research associate who will obtain written&#xD;
      consent. A baseline appointment will be made where the participant will complete written&#xD;
      assessments, anthropometric measures (weight, height, blood pressure etc.), along with a&#xD;
      blood draw. Participants will then be randomized, by luck of a draw, to either MOVE! or&#xD;
      MOVE!+gshCBT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those randomized to the MOVE! condition, participants will continue in the MOVE! program&#xD;
      by meeting with the multidisciplinary team in a group setting once a week for 60 minutes, for&#xD;
      16 weeks. The group sessions are lead by a dietician, health psychologist, and physical&#xD;
      therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those randomized to the MOVE!+gshCBT treatments, participants will continue in the MOVE!&#xD;
      program as described above, but will also partake in up to 10 individualized sessions over a&#xD;
      3-month period. Participants will be given a treatment manual to read at home, ask to&#xD;
      complete daily food logs and work with the study therapist to create goals and complete&#xD;
      homework that is geared at examining and changing how participant think about binge eating&#xD;
      and how that thinking affects behavior. Lastly, a walking program will also be incorporated&#xD;
      into the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both treatment arms, 3 months from treatment starting, then again at 9 months and 15&#xD;
      months, participants will be asked to complete post and follow up assessments, much like the&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;

      As of 03/17/2021: We have resumed recruitment for Phase 3 of this study. Moving forward, the&#xD;
      study will be conducted entirely virtually, leveraging the VA's national TeleMOVE program and&#xD;
      Virtual MOVE groups and the study arms will now be TeleMOVE/Virtual MOVE only (control) or&#xD;
      TeleMOVE/Virtual MOVE + CBT (treatment). As such, this project modification required several&#xD;
      changes and additions to the protocol, to ease administrative burden we have added a Phase 3&#xD;
      to this trial to accommodate all the necessary waiver, consent, and procedural changes&#xD;
      necessary to enact this project. The following are included in this modification for Phase 3:&#xD;
      Waivers: Add WIC, WWIC, WOA. Consent/Recruitment: Add Study Information Sheets and Opt-out&#xD;
      Letters for potential participants, phone screen and chart review. Study Site: Add VA Central&#xD;
      Western MA in addition to VACHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Overview To address the specific aims of this proposal, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      an RCT comparing MOVE! (treatment-as-usual; MOVE!) to MOVE! plus gshCBT (MOVE!+gshCBT).&#xD;
      Overweight/obese Veterans (108 men and women) with recurrent binge eating as reported on the&#xD;
      binge eating item from the MOVE! survey will be enrolled. Potential participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from MOVE! group orientation meetings at two VA CT sites which take place several&#xD;
      times per month. Major assessments will be performed by an independent evaluator at&#xD;
      pre-treatment (baseline), at the end of gshCBT treatment (3 months), and at 6- and 12-months&#xD;
      following treatments (9 and 15 months after randomization). Analyses are powered for the&#xD;
      primary outcome of binge remission (categorical). Analyses for binge frequency (continuous),&#xD;
      and eating disorder and mental health outcomes will be performed. Exploratory analyses will&#xD;
      be conducted on treatment engagement (MOVE! session attendance) and weight outcomes (weight&#xD;
      loss and metabolic outcomes), as well as for potential predictors and moderators (age,&#xD;
      gender, clinical severity, and comorbidity), and correlates (change in weight control&#xD;
      strategies and physical activity) of treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Criteria have been kept to a minimum to increase the generalizability of&#xD;
      findings. Inclusion Criteria: aged 21 and older, BMI&gt;=25, and presence of recurrent binge&#xD;
      eating on the MOVE! Survey. Exclusion Criteria: more than 4 MOVE! sessions in the prior year;&#xD;
      active psychosis or suicidal ideation; medical or psychiatric illness, or cognitive deficits&#xD;
      that interfere with providing consent or completing assessments, and; pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
      The investigators will aim for a sample that is 34% racial/ethnic minority (66% Caucasian) to&#xD;
      be consistent with the demographics of a nationally representative sample of Veterans seeking&#xD;
      weight management treatment through VHA3. The investigators will also aim for 25% women (75%&#xD;
      men), a figure that represents an oversampling of women compared to the rate of 6% for all&#xD;
      VHA users. This will allow us to examine gender as a potential predictor or moderator of&#xD;
      treatment outcome and address the VHA's strategic plan to better serve women Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Potential participants will be recruited from orientation sessions for MOVE!&#xD;
      groups conducted at two sites, the West Haven and Newington campuses, of VA CT. While MOVE!&#xD;
      is delivered in different formats (i.e., group, individual and telehealth), the group format&#xD;
      accounts for 75% of weight management services delivered across the VHA. The Research&#xD;
      Assistant will be given a few minutes at the beginning of each orientation session to&#xD;
      describe the study. Orientation sessions are available to Veterans three times per month&#xD;
      between the two sites. Names and numbers will be collected of those who are interested so&#xD;
      that they may be contacted for individual sessions to assess interest and eligibility using&#xD;
      the criteria above. Dr. Ruser (Co-I, Chief of Primary Care and MOVE! Physician Champion for&#xD;
      VA CT) oversees the program at both campuses, and Dr. Dorflinger (Co-I, Health Behavioral&#xD;
      Coordinator who is directly responsible for the delivery of MOVE!) splits her time between&#xD;
      the two sites. According to MOVE! performance measures, a greater number of patients are seen&#xD;
      for weight management at the Newington campus compared to the West Haven campus. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to test, and control, for potential site differences in the analyses. In&#xD;
      addition, Dr. Driscoll (Co-I), women Veteran's health researcher for the VHA's Women's&#xD;
      Practice Based Research Network, and clinical supervisor for the local women's clinic, will&#xD;
      be responsible for recruiting women Veterans into the MOVE! orientation sessions and&#xD;
      treatment study. She has experience successfully oversampling for women Veterans in a&#xD;
      previous trial that resulted in 25% women (compared to 6% of all VHA users)38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for &quot;recurrent binge eating&quot; The presence of binge eating will be determined by the&#xD;
      MOVE! Survey, an 11-item self-report survey that must be completed prior to attending MOVE!&#xD;
      programs. This survey was created to aid in the tailoring of MOVE! treatment for patients'&#xD;
      specific needs. The item that assesses the presence of binge eating reads as follows: &quot;On&#xD;
      average, how often have you eaten extremely large amounts of food at one time and felt that&#xD;
      your eating was out of control at that time?&quot; The response set for this item is never, less&#xD;
      than one time per week, one time per week, two to four times per week, or five or more times&#xD;
      per week. Participants reporting binge eating at least one time per week will be included&#xD;
      following published methods. These methods come from two effectiveness studies for recurrent&#xD;
      binge eating that have been conducted with participants from a large integrated healthcare&#xD;
      system18,19. Further assessment with the Eating Disorder Examination-Interview 12th Ed.&#xD;
      (EDE)46, described below, will enable us to further categorize participants who meet full&#xD;
      DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for BED (clinical BED) and those who do not (subclinical BED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent and pre-treatment assessment If the potential participant is eligible and&#xD;
      interested, a pre-treatment assessment of one to two sessions will be scheduled. This&#xD;
      assessment will help to determine whether participants are able to comply with the&#xD;
      requirements of the program (such as regular appointments and record-keeping) and also to&#xD;
      minimize the attrition rate of the trial, since only those who complete these requirements&#xD;
      will be enrolled. The Research Assistant will describe the study, and the consent will be&#xD;
      reviewed verbally and in writing, before IRB written informed consent is obtained. During the&#xD;
      pre-treatment assessment session(s), the following will be obtained/completed: anthropometric&#xD;
      measures (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure; methods described below),&#xD;
      demographic information (age, gender, race/ethnicity, etc.), self-report measures (described&#xD;
      below), blood draw, psychiatric evaluation with the Mini-Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)49,&#xD;
      and the eating disorder evaluation with the Eating Disorder Examination-Interview 12th Ed.&#xD;
      (EDE)46.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of binge status: Subclinical vs. Clinical BED The Eating Disorder&#xD;
      Examination-Interview 12th Edition (EDE)46 is the structured diagnostic interview that is&#xD;
      considered the gold-standard to diagnose, and assess the symptoms of, eating disorders&#xD;
      including binge eating and eating disorder pathology. The EDE will be used to categorize&#xD;
      participants as clinical BED (meeting full DSM-5 criteria including a binge frequency of at&#xD;
      least one time per week on average for the past three months) or subclinical BED (reporting&#xD;
      at least one time per week binge eating on the MOVE! survey but not meeting DSM-5 criteria&#xD;
      for BED). The Research Assistant will be trained and supervised by Dr. Masheb (PI) who has&#xD;
      extensive experience with the EDE. Binge status will be used as a potential covariate in&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedures Eligible patients who agree to participate and sign consent forms&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to MOVE! or MOVE!+gshCBT in the order in which they complete the&#xD;
      evaluation process. Equal numbers of participants will be randomly assigned to each of the&#xD;
      two conditions. The randomization schedule will be created with a random number generator,&#xD;
      independent of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control condition: MOVE! (treatment-as-usual) Based on scientific review and practice&#xD;
      guidelines of the NIH, and in collaboration with VHA Central Office, the MOVE! program was&#xD;
      developed as an evidence-based weight management and physical activity initiative that&#xD;
      included assessment and treatment procedures, clinical algorithms, patient and provider&#xD;
      information, and instructional materials. The program was widely disseminated and implemented&#xD;
      beginning in January 200653. Every VHA facility across the country is required to have some&#xD;
      form of the MOVE! program, if not several programs differing in intensity, which utilize&#xD;
      these materials. At a minimum, on-site weekly, multidisciplinary groups must be held. MOVE!&#xD;
      group at VA CT is the most widely used weight management service and was thus chosen as the&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual for the present study given the potential for disseminability. Research&#xD;
      has demonstrated minimal weight losses with MOVE! and these findings have largely been&#xD;
      attributed to poor treatment engagement (i.e., attendance) and weight gain in the year prior&#xD;
      to treatment initiation54,55. One initiative to increase the reach and impact of weight&#xD;
      management in the Veteran population has been to identify vulnerable subgroups of&#xD;
      overweight/obese patients, such as those with binge eating8, pain56, and serious mental&#xD;
      illness57. The hope is that the present study will extend this initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive MOVE! group treatment as it is delivered at VA CT or VA Central&#xD;
      Western MA. The 60-minute groups cycle every 16 weeks and are led by a physical therapist,&#xD;
      dietitian, and/or clinical health psychology predoctoral intern. Clinicians utilize materials&#xD;
      available on-line, and encourage the use of, but do not require or provide, food diaries.&#xD;
      Participants in both MOVE! and MOVE!+gshCBT will be encouraged to attend these sessions&#xD;
      throughout their involvement in the entire study (i.e., during treatment and follow-up&#xD;
      phases). MOVE! is similarly delivered at both the VA CT West Haven and Newington facilities&#xD;
      as both programs are overseen by Drs. Ruser and Dorflinger (Co-Is).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental condition: MOVE!+gshCBT One-half of participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      MOVE!+gshCBT and will receive the MOVE! treatment described above as well as a gshCBT&#xD;
      treatment for binge eating. gshCBT will be administered via 8 individual sessions over a&#xD;
      3-month treatment period. The first two sessions will be 60 minutes each and subsequent&#xD;
      sessions will be 30 minutes. CBT has emerged as the treatment of choice for BED for its&#xD;
      robust effects on reducing binge eating and improving the behavioral and psychological&#xD;
      aspects of the disorder9. The gshCBT treatment will adhere to a manual developed by Dr.&#xD;
      Masheb (PI) and generally follows the book Overcoming Binge Eating 58 that has been used by&#xD;
      Drs. Masheb and Grilo (Co-I) in previous published studies of CBT11,21,32-35, as well as by&#xD;
      others 12,40,59. A copy of the gshCBT manual is included in the Appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given the gshCBT manual with a schedule to read at home. During&#xD;
      sessions, the Psychologist will use the following session guideline: 1) setting an agenda, 2)&#xD;
      reviewing food diaries and self-monitoring, 3) introduction of new material from the manual,&#xD;
      4) reviewing old material and problem-solving difficulties, and 5) establishing new homework&#xD;
      and goals. The treatment follows three stages. Stage 1 consists of presentation of the CBT&#xD;
      model; introduction and discussion of the structure, goals, interventions, and expected&#xD;
      outcome of treatment; education regarding binge eating and dieting; and the introduction of&#xD;
      self-monitoring techniques for identifying problematic eating practices and triggers. Stage 2&#xD;
      consists of maintaining the normalized eating and self-monitoring procedures but becomes&#xD;
      increasingly cognitively oriented. Stage 3 focuses on practicing skills, consolidation of&#xD;
      progress and relapse prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each session participants will receive new, blank food diaries. Participants are expected&#xD;
      to complete these diaries on a daily basis, and they will be reviewed and checked at each&#xD;
      session by the Psychologist. If participants would like to use these food diaries for their&#xD;
      MOVE! treatment as well, they may do so. [NOTE: Food diaries are encouraged in MOVE! but are&#xD;
      not provided or required.] gshCBT participants will also be instructed in how to record&#xD;
      (i.e., self-monitor) binge eating. Recording of this data will be mandatory and participants&#xD;
      who arrive to session with incomplete food diaries or self-monitoring will be asked to use&#xD;
      session time to complete these records for at least the previous day or two. This technique&#xD;
      emphasizes the importance of food diaries, raises patients' awareness of their eating, allows&#xD;
      clinicians to address any concerns about how to complete diaries, and demonstrates that&#xD;
      diaries can be completed without too much effort. The investigators will continue this&#xD;
      strategy through all CBT sessions until the patients arrive to sessions with diaries&#xD;
      completed. This typically takes two sessions, however sometimes food diary non-compliance can&#xD;
      reemerge later in treatment. In this scenario in-session diary completion is reintroduced&#xD;
      following the same procedure. Patients will also be encouraged to gradually increase daily&#xD;
      modest physical activity with the goal of establishing 30 minutes of activity (walking&#xD;
      sessions or other activity) five times per week. This prescription is consistent with&#xD;
      recommendations from several expert-based organizations (NIH and Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Participant assessments will be conducted by the Research Assistant and&#xD;
      independent of the treating Psychologist so that assessment will be unbiased. These will&#xD;
      include outcomes for: binge eating and mental health; engagement and weight; weight control&#xD;
      behaviors and physical activity, and; treatment satisfaction and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic Plan. Statistical analyses will be conducted by a biostatistician and who has&#xD;
      extensive experience in statistical modeling, particularly in the analysis of longitudinal&#xD;
      data. Baseline characteristics will be compared between the treatment groups using ANOVA and&#xD;
      chi-squares as appropriate in order to determine the level of success of the randomization.&#xD;
      Distributions of outcomes will be examined in order to determine if assumptions of specific&#xD;
      model types are met. Change of model type as well as transformation of the data will be&#xD;
      considered if model assumptions are not met. Mixed-effects models, a method for statistical&#xD;
      modeling that uses both fixed effects and random effects, will be used to examine continuous&#xD;
      outcomes such as binge eating frequency, mental health symptoms, and percent weight loss for&#xD;
      completer, as well as intent-to-treat (all randomized persons), analyses. Logistic regression&#xD;
      models will be used for categorical outcomes such as binge remission and achieving clinically&#xD;
      meaningful weight loss (i.e., 5% weight loss or greater). Missing data and covariate&#xD;
      adjustment will be handled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 addresses binge eating (primary outcome) and mental health outcomes. Binge remission&#xD;
      (H1; defined as zero binges for the 28 days prior to the end of treatment) will be examined&#xD;
      as a binary outcome in logistic models including treatment group and relevant covariates.&#xD;
      Reduction in frequency of binge eating over time will be examined using mixed effects models.&#xD;
      Previous work indicates that the outcomes may need to be log-transformed to better&#xD;
      approximate normality11. Mental health outcomes (H2), using validated symptom scales for&#xD;
      depression and quality-of-life, will also be examined using mixed models. Relevant&#xD;
      demographic and clinical characteristics will be included in the logistic and mixed models,&#xD;
      and main as well as interaction effects will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 addresses level of engagement in weight loss treatment (i.e., number of MOVE! treatment&#xD;
      sessions) and weight outcome. Engagement (H1) will be explored using Poisson regression on&#xD;
      counts of MOVE! sessions completed using a binary treatment variable (MOVE! vs.&#xD;
      MOVE!+gshCBT). The distribution of engagement will be reviewed to determine if there is&#xD;
      over-dispersion (in which case quasi-likelihood estimation will be used to account for it).&#xD;
      Models will include relevant covariates such as demographic and clinical characteristics. The&#xD;
      treatment effect on weight (H2) will be examined with a mixed effects model, as described&#xD;
      above, using longitudinal change in percent weight loss during the intervention and follow-up&#xD;
      phases. Categorical analyses will also be performed comparing treatments on the proportion of&#xD;
      participants achieving 5% weight losses using logistic regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will be performed on the metabolic outcomes (HbA1C, total cholesterol,&#xD;
      HDL, LDL, triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and waist circumference)&#xD;
      using mixed models. These outcomes were chosen for analysis to be consistent with interests&#xD;
      of health services research although the investigators recognize that changes in these&#xD;
      measures may not be sufficient to detect a difference. These analyses also could be important&#xD;
      downstream in adding credibility in the eyes of patients, and providers, and could be used to&#xD;
      enhance incentives for participation (or patient referral).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 is an examination of predictors, moderators and correlates of treatment outcome.&#xD;
      Predictors are variables present at baseline that influence outcome regardless of treatment&#xD;
      condition, and moderators are variables present at baseline that influence outcome depending&#xD;
      on the treatment condition. Potential predictors and moderators (H1) will be explored with&#xD;
      demographic (age and gender)81, and clinical characteristics (clinical severity and&#xD;
      comorbidity) from the relevant literature on BED82,83. Logistic and multiple regression&#xD;
      analyses, that have been detailed conceptually and analytically by Kraemer et al.84, will be&#xD;
      used. Associations (H2) between changes in weight control strategies and physical activity,&#xD;
      and weight loss 71 will be examined with correlation analyses.&#xD;
