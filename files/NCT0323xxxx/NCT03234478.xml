      Every year, approximately 9,000 Parkinson disease (PD) patients undergo deep brain stimulator&#xD;
      (DBS) placement into the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS). Studies suggest that PD patients with&#xD;
      mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene are at high risk for cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      approximately 10-17% of subjects undergoing DBS carry GBA mutations. There may be an&#xD;
      interaction between STN-DBS, which also impairs cognitive function, and GBA, resulting in&#xD;
      worsened cognitive function. This project will 1) determine the relationship between GBA&#xD;
      mutation status and post-operative STN-DBS cognitive function, 2) broaden genotype-phenotype&#xD;
      relationships of GBA mutation carriers and 3) provide scientific knowledge regarding the&#xD;
      longitudinal cognitive effects of DBS in GBA mutation carriers through repeated&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting at least 1 million people in&#xD;
      the U.S. Each year, 9,000 PD patients undergo deep brain stimulator (DBS) placement into the&#xD;
      subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS), the most commonly used basal ganglia target. Despite motor&#xD;
      improvement, up to 50% of patients have cognitive impairment after DBS. Cognitive impairment&#xD;
      is associated with a 2-3 fold increase in mortality, progression to dementia, and nursing&#xD;
      home placement. At present, subjects with cognitive impairment after DBS cannot be identified&#xD;
      pre-operatively and the effects of DBS on cognitive function are not fully understood. A&#xD;
      specific group of PD patients, carriers of mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene,&#xD;
      are at particularly high risk for cognitive impairment. PD-GBA mutation carriers have&#xD;
      dysfunction of the glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme, resulting in more rapid accumulation&#xD;
      and spread of Lewy bodies compared with non-mutation carriers. Clinically, PD-GBA mutation&#xD;
      carriers have: (1) deficits in visual memory due to higher Lewy body burden in hippocampal&#xD;
      and medial temporal regions, and (2) faster progression to dementia secondary to diffuse&#xD;
      cortical Lewy body pathology. Approximately 10-17% of PD subjects with DBS carry GBA&#xD;
      mutations, indicating that a substantial portion of the DBS population may be susceptible to&#xD;
      cognitive problems. Importantly, STN-DBS itself can impair cognition through modulation of&#xD;
      the striato-anterior cingulate cortex circuit, resulting in impulsivity and more errors when&#xD;
      faced with tasks that rely on executive functions. Therefore, the central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      PD-GBA mutation carriers have greater global cognitive decline after STN-DBS compared with&#xD;
      PD-GBA mutation carriers without STN-DBS, and compared with non-mutation carriers with and&#xD;
      without STN-DBS. This is a critical area of research because if an association between GBA&#xD;
      and STN-DBS is detected, clinicians will be able to identify subjects at risk for worsened&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction through genetic testing and prevent harm by: (1) recommending that&#xD;
      PD-GBA mutation carriers avoid STN-DBS, or (2) considering an alternative DBS target such as&#xD;
      the globus pallidus interna (GPi) that may have less cognitive side effects. The following&#xD;
      aims are proposed: Aim 1: Determine the longitudinal changes in global cognitive function in&#xD;
      PD-GBA mutation carriers and non-mutation carriers with and without STN-DBS; Aim 2: Determine&#xD;
      the specific pattern of cognitive dysfunction in PD-GBA mutation carriers and non-mutation&#xD;
      carriers with and without STN-DBS; Aim 3: Determine the differential effects of DBS on&#xD;
      cognitive function in the ON-stimulation state vs. OFF-stimulation state, comparing PD-GBA&#xD;
      mutation and non-mutation carriers.&#xD;
