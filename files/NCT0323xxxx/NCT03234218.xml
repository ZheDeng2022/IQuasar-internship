    <textblock>
      Interest in vitamin D has seen an unprecedented revival sparked by the finding that vitamin D&#xD;
      has pleiotropic effects with an intriguing link to the critically ill patients. The recent&#xD;
      VITdAL-ICU RCT found a significant difference in mortality in patients with severe deficiency&#xD;
      when high doses of vitamin D supplementation were administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common in patients with chronic liver disease and/or&#xD;
      cirrhosis. It seems to be a marker of severity of the disease, but also a possible&#xD;
      contributing factor in determining poor outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study: Observational prospective study. Primary variable end point: Vitamin D&#xD;
      at baseline, and POD (post-operative day) 1, 3, 7, 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary variable end points: ICU length of stay; SAPS 2 and SOFA score at POD 1, 7; Days of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation; Hospital length of stay; Mortality at POD 28; Diagnosed invasive&#xD;
      infections; Graft rejection in the first 28 days; Bilirubin and INR at POD 7 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY. The patient will not undergo to additional procedure during the study and will be&#xD;
      asked for consent to treatment of personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE. Because of the lack of knowledge in this specific cohort no formal sample was&#xD;
      calculated beforehand. The sample size will be defined by one-year clinical activity: about&#xD;
      60 consecutive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. All statistical analysis and results will be assessed and reported as&#xD;
      exploratory analysis. In order to describe the trend over time of the vitamin D levels,&#xD;
      descriptive statistics such as mean, median, interquartile range and standard deviation will&#xD;
      be evaluated. In addition, 95% confidence intervals for mean and standard deviation will be&#xD;
      reported. Comparisons between two temporal observations will be assessed with paired t-test.&#xD;
      Any univariate association between factors or covariates, will be explored. Statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be done with SAS 9.4,&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Interest in vitamin D has seen an unprecedented revival sparked by the finding&#xD;
      that vitamin D has pleiotropic effects. The nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) is widely&#xD;
      present in different cell types and organs and regulates more than 200 genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between vitamin D and critical illness is new, but intriguing, because vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  has a very high prevalence in the ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is strongly associated with excess morbidity and mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is associated with increased susceptibility to sepsis thought its immunomodulating&#xD;
           effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  has a relation with acute kidney injury, acute respiratory failure, duration of&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation and ARDS Critically ill patients are at high risk of mortality&#xD;
           and standard care uses little or no vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may well be the case that vitamin D deficiency is indeed an &quot;invisible accomplice to&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality,&quot; as proposed by Paul Lee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VITAMIN D IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE AND/OR CIRRHOSIS Vitamin D deficiency is&#xD;
      extremely common in patients with chronic liver disease and/or cirrhosis. It seems to be a&#xD;
      marker of severity of the disease, but also a possible contributing factor in determining&#xD;
      poor outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms Low synthesis. Severe liver disease decreases vitamin D hydroxylation and albumin&#xD;
      and DBP production. But lack of liver function is just one piece of the puzzle. Possible&#xD;
      concomitant causes may include inadequate sun exposure, insufficient food intake, steroids,&#xD;
      jaundice-related deterioration of vitamin synthesis on the skin, and decreased vitamin D&#xD;
      absorption caused by intestinal edema secondary to portal hypertension or cholestasis-induced&#xD;
      bile salt disruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signaling disruption. Vitamin D plays a role in reducing risk of chronic diseases. This most&#xD;
      likely results from local production of 1a25(OH)2D, with its autocrine and paracrine actions&#xD;
      in cellular proliferation and differentiation. These effects may also be relevant in liver&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pro-inflammatory signals in monocytes and macrophages may regulate the local metabolism of&#xD;
      vitamin D, and the local production of α25(OH)2D. Almost 90% of tissue macrophages are in the&#xD;
      liver, suggesting that local production of vitamin D in liver inflammation is impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innate immunity. Vitamin D increases secretion of antibacterial proteins such as cathelicidin&#xD;
      and beta-defensin, promotes chemotaxis and macrophage phagocytosis, and regulate the&#xD;
      expression of several TLRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive immunity. Vitamin D seems to control excessive immune response by decreasing the&#xD;
      expression of class II HLA complex, and by modulating T cells, inducing differentiation and&#xD;
      expansion of regulatory T cells, which secrete IL-10 and TGF-β. This could explain an&#xD;
      association between vitamin D deficiency and autoimmune liver damage. Moreover in vitro and&#xD;
      in vivo studies of mouse models with liver fibrosis reported an anti-fibrotic effect for&#xD;
      vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis C. Data have shown that vitamin D supplementation during interferon and ribavirin&#xD;
      increased the level of sustained viral response. Furthermore, vitamin D seems to indirectly&#xD;
      inhibit HCV replication in human hepatocytes by stimulating IFB beta production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAFLD. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a clinical entity ranging from steatosis to&#xD;
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Vitamin D deficiency has a possible role in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of liver transplantation on vitamin D status: lack of knowledge Individual outcome&#xD;
      after liver transplantation varies widely due to multi-factorial variables. Vitamin D has not&#xD;
      been extensively evaluated in patients undergoing liver transplantation. In one cohort of&#xD;
      patients, vitamin D deficiency was associated with acute cellular rejection. It is still&#xD;
      unclear how it acts in the more critical days after transplantation, and what predictive role&#xD;
      it may play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relevant role of calcium metabolism and vitamin D after solid organ transplantation has&#xD;
      been highlighted by several meta-analyses in recent years, suggesting a possible impact on&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To stress the relevance of the topic even in such a complex surgical procedure, low vitamin D&#xD;
      is associated with a worse outcome after various types of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myriad considerations suggest its evaluation in liver transplantation recipients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients affected with liver disease have much lower levels of vitamin D&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Causes of low levels of vitamin D may be low production, low sun exposure, reduced&#xD;
           mobility, and other factors reducing the availability of vitamin D in the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitamin D has pleiotropic effects, and seems to act mainly on the immunomodulating&#xD;
           system. Infection is the main threat in the first 6 months after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of patients receiving marginal donor organs is increasing. In many of them&#xD;
           the recovery of liver function proceeds slowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some liver recipients become severely ill during the ICU stay. In these patients there&#xD;
           is a suspicion of severe vitamin D insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of acute kidney injury is very high in complicated liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The VITdAL-ICU RCT found a reduced mortality in severe deficiency after high doses of&#xD;
           vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitamin D may reveal itself as a marker of improving metabolic function, acting as a&#xD;
           prognostic marker that may even contribute to outcome, and is easily modifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study Principal&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Describe the level and the trend of vitamin D levels in liver transplantation recipients&#xD;
      during the first 28 days after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the association between vitamin D level post-transplant and critical conditions&#xD;
           (ICU stay, severity score, infections, mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the association between vitamin D level post-transplant and pre-transplant&#xD;
           conditions (vitamin D level and severity of liver disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the association between pre-transplant vitamin D level and outcome (mortality at&#xD;
           28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the association between the quality of graft (marginal vs. standard) on&#xD;
           post-transplant vitamin D level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the association between vitamin D level and graft function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the association between post-transplant vitamin D level and long term patient&#xD;
           and graft outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary variable end point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D level measured at baseline, and POD (post-operative day) 1, 3, 7, 28. Secondary&#xD;
      variable end points ICU length of stay SAPS 2 and SOFA score at POD 1, 7 Days of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation Hospital length of stay Mortality at POD 28 Diagnosed invasive infections Graft&#xD;
      rejection in the first 28 days Bilirubin and INR at POD 7 and 28&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and timing of the observations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D level and metabolism:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitamin D at time of listing (wait list for liver transplantation); at time of hospital&#xD;
           admission for liver transplantation; POD 1, 3, 7, 28&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Albumin POD 1, 3, 7, 28&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parathormone (PTH) at time of hospital admission for transplantation, and on 1, 7, 28&#xD;
           SAFETY. Vitamin D levels will be measured in blood samples drawn during standard&#xD;
           clinical practice. Clinical activity will follow well established protocols for liver&#xD;
           transplants at our institute. Given the observational nature of the study, insurance for&#xD;
           possible patient damage is waived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be asked for consent to treatment of personal data. The person responsible&#xD;
      for this privacy consent will be the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Because this is an exploratory study, all statistical analysis and&#xD;
      results will be assessed and reported as exploratory analysis. In order to describe the trend&#xD;
      over time of the vitamin D levels in patients undergoing liver transplantation, descriptive&#xD;
      statistics such as mean, median, interquartile range and standard deviation will be&#xD;
      evaluated. In addition, 95% confidence intervals for mean and standard deviation will be&#xD;
      reported. Comparisons between two temporal observations will be assessed with paired t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) will be applied in order to assess the&#xD;
      vitamin D trend level over PODs 1-7-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the secondary aims, the same methods given above will be applied. In&#xD;
      particular, for the secondary aim, for the association between quality of graft (marginal vs.&#xD;
      standard) on post-transplant vitamin D level, a logistic analysis for repeated measures will&#xD;
      be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any univariate association between factors or covariates, described in the data collection&#xD;
      section, will be explored. In addition, multiple MMRM analyses will applied in order to&#xD;
      explore association between vitamin D level and the most relevant variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be done with SAS 9.4, all results will be considered&#xD;
      exploratory for statistical testing, and p-values will be reported as &quot;nominally&#xD;
      statistically significant.&quot; ANALYTICAL METHODS. Vitamin D will be measured with the Bio-Rad&#xD;
      25-OH Vitamin D3/D2 HPLC assay (High Performance Liquid Chromatography). Parathormone will be&#xD;
      measured with a chemiluminescence technique using the IMMULITE® 2000 Intact PTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANTICIPATED BENEFITS AND IMPACT OF FINDINGS. Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem.&#xD;
      This study would be an actual description of vitamin D status in a cohort of recipients of&#xD;
      liver transplantation, indicating a possible group of patients in which routine measurement&#xD;
      of serum vitamin D may be mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high prevalence of severe deficiency may suggest starting later high dosage supplementation&#xD;
      if new evidence confirms its positive effect in critically ill patients.&#xD;

        The study presented in this protocol is the first to focus on vitamin D status in patients&#xD;
        undergoing liver transplantation. The primary objective is to study, explore, and describe&#xD;
        the level and the trends of vitamin D values over time in liver transplantation recipients&#xD;
        in the first days after transplantation, i.e., POD 1, POD 7, and POD 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because of the lack of knowledge on the association between vitamin D levels and outcomes&#xD;
        in this specific cohort no formal sample was calculated beforehand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The sample size will be defined by one-year clinical activity: about 60 consecutive&#xD;
        patients undergoing liver transplantation will be enrolled during this period.&#xD;
