      Project which objective is to test the effectiveness of a classroom-based physical activity&#xD;
      intervention (MOVI-da10!) on improving, body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness and&#xD;
      executive function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade, this research group has tested the effectiveness of three interventions&#xD;
      following after-school intervention model. The first one (MOVI) was carried out in&#xD;
      peripuberal age children (4th and 5th year of primary education, 8-11 years) and showed a&#xD;
      moderate effect in reducing the adiposity of schoolchildren with higher BMI, an improvement&#xD;
      of the lipid profile, without significantly improving the global cardiometabolic risk because&#xD;
      it did not produce a reduction in insulinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second edition (MOVI-2), carried out at schoolchildren of the same age range, increased&#xD;
      the duration and intensity of the sessions, and was focused on the development of muscular&#xD;
      strength in order to improve insulinemia levels. The intervention showed proved&#xD;
      effectiveness; in addition, the data from this intervention showed a modest improvement in&#xD;
      girls' aerobic capacity, but not in boys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last edition (MOVI-KIDS) was aimed at children aged 4 to 7 years to test the hypotheses&#xD;
      that vigorous physical activity at early ages could produce lifelong cardio-metabolic&#xD;
      benefits. Data submitted for publication in this study show that, as in the case of the&#xD;
      IDEFICS study in children of similar age, the intervention was not effective in improving&#xD;
      fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new edition (MOVI-da10!) has been designed following integrated physical activity&#xD;
      intervention and active breaks designs, and as a controlled cluster-randomized trial&#xD;
      including 9 schools from Cuenca province, Spain. Six schools will be randomized to the two&#xD;
      intervention groups (IG), where the intervention of MOVI-da10! will be conducted for third&#xD;
      grade preschool children (about 5 years old), using two different design. Three of them will&#xD;
      receive an active breaks intervention, in which twice a day a 10 minutes breaks standard&#xD;
      physical activity will be developed, and the other three will receive twice a day a 10&#xD;
      minutes of enriched physical activity integrated in the curriculum. The other three schools&#xD;
      will be allocated to the control group (CG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During an academic year the MOVIda10! interventions will consist of: i) an integrated across&#xD;
      the curriculum cognitive demanding physical activity program including two active breaks&#xD;
      lasting 10 min, five days/week; and ii) an active breaks physical activity program including&#xD;
      two active breaks lasting 10 min, five days/week. In the CG regular physical activity will&#xD;
      continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the school year the researchers will determine main outcome variables: changes&#xD;
      in VO2max, body fat by bioimpedance and executive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of this new edition will be that: the MOVI-da10 intervention! based on&#xD;
      physical activity integrated in the curriculum for third grade preschool children, will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Moderately increase the executive function and academic performance in the IGs versus&#xD;
           the CG (effect size 0.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase aerobic capacity (VO2max) in IGs versus CG by 3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduced body fat in IGs versus CG by 3%&#xD;
