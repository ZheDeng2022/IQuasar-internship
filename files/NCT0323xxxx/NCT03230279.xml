    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with chronic SIJ pain that can be treated by sacroiliac joint fusion or&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation. The radio frequency ablation is performed using either conventional&#xD;
      or &quot;cooled&quot; techniques aimed at the S1-S3 lateral branches and the L5 dorsal ramus. Minimally&#xD;
      invasive sacroiliac joint consists of implanting 2 to 3 metallic implants inside the SIJ to&#xD;
      increase the stability and eventually fuse the SIJ. This randomized controlled trial aims at&#xD;
      comparing treatment success at 6-month follow-up time-point after minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacroiliac joint fusion and radiofrequency ablation for chronic SIJ dysfunction.&#xD;

      Introduction This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be&#xD;
      conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21&#xD;
      part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government&#xD;
      regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction is a common pain condition involving the buttock and may&#xD;
      irradiate in the low back, groin and/or lower extremity. About one in five patients with low&#xD;
      back pain is estimated to have SI joint pain. The economic burden of SIJ pain is high in the&#xD;
      United States and there is a need for more cost effective treatment options. There is a lack&#xD;
      of relevant high quality studies that compared nonsurgical and surgical treatment for SI&#xD;
      joint dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction has been estimated to be the origin of lower back pain in&#xD;
      13 to 30% of patients. SIJ pain is usually referred to the buttock, low back, groin and/or&#xD;
      lower extremity. SIJ osteoarthritis, trauma, SIJ degeneration following lumbar fusion and&#xD;
      postpartum SIJ dysfunction are common causes of SIJ pain found in a clinical setting. Other&#xD;
      less common causes for SIJ pain include inflammatory sacroiliitis, infective sacroiliitis,&#xD;
      insufficiency stress fractures and neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic evidences for SIJ dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presenting symptoms of SIJ dysfunction can be similar to those of other spinal conditions&#xD;
      such as disc herniation or degenerative spinal stenosis. Unlike radiculopathy, there is often&#xD;
      an absence of specific radiological finding with SIJ dysfunction. A gold standard for SI&#xD;
      joint pain diagnosis does not exist, but dual comparative local anesthetic joint blocks with&#xD;
      at least 70% pain relief are considered a validated diagnostic test for SI joint pain.&#xD;
      Reproducibility of SIJ pain with at least 3 SIJ-selective stressing tests, including the&#xD;
      thigh trust, compression, Patrick's, distraction and Gaenslen's test, is also considered&#xD;
      having good diagnostic validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Agents and Preclinical Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonsurgical treatment efficacy for SIJ dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacroiliac dysfunction is thought to be secondary to a loss of SIJ stability caused by either&#xD;
      deficient form closure (joint anatomy) or force closure (compressive forces exerted by&#xD;
      neuromuscular and ligamentous structures around the joint. Physical therapy can improve SI&#xD;
      joint pain by increasing force closure. Pelvic stabilization, strengthening and self-bracing&#xD;
      exercises have been showed to improve force closure and may provide SIJ pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When SIJ pain fails to improve with physical therapy, several pain management interventions&#xD;
      can be offered to patients. Up to now, the level of evidence for SIJ intraarticular or&#xD;
      periarticular steroid injections is mainly limited to short-term outcome (3 months) and the&#xD;
      effectiveness results are conflicting between different studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to conventional radio frequency ablation, the effectiveness of cooled radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation is supported by superior level of evidence. Two randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      comparing cooled radio frequency ablation vs placebo demonstrated a success rate varying&#xD;
      between 38 to 57% at 6 months for cooled radiofrequency ablation. Observational studies also&#xD;
      demonstrated success rate varying from 40% to 71% at 6 months for both conventional and&#xD;
      cooled radio frequency ablation. The effectiveness of conventional and cooled radio frequency&#xD;
      ablation at 9 and 12 months are more limited and some studies did report loss of&#xD;
      effectiveness at 12 months. Based on the available data, there is no evidence supporting&#xD;
      clinical superiority between traditional and cool radio frequency ablation. A retrospective&#xD;
      study on 88 patients revealed comparable effectiveness between conventional and cool radio&#xD;
      frequency ablation with &gt; 50% pain reduction in the majority of patients after 3 and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment evidence for SIJ dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally invasive SIJ fusion is a surgical treatment aimed at stabilizing the SIJ to reduce&#xD;
      pain, disability and improve quality of life. In a recent randomized controlled trial called&#xD;
      Investigation of Sacroiliac Fusion Treatment (INSITE), minimally invasive SIJ fusion, using&#xD;
      triangular titanium implants (iFuse Implant System, SI-BONE®, San Jose, CA), has been shown&#xD;
      superior to non-surgical treatments in managing SIJ dysfunction at 6 months (81.4% vs 26.1%&#xD;
      success rate) and the results in the surgical group were sustained at one year and two years&#xD;
      of follow-up. In this trial, success rate was defined as a decreased in SIJ pain Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Score of at least 20 mm compared to baseline, an absence of device-related serious&#xD;
      adverse events, an absence of neurological worsening and no surgical reintervention. There&#xD;
      were 101 subjects in the SIJ fusion group who completed the 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Data to Date The INSITE study is the first and only published Level 1 randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to have compared SIJ fusion with nonsurgical treatment. Although this study&#xD;
      demonstrated prolonged improvement in pain, disability and quality of life with SIJ fusion,&#xD;
      superiority of SIJ fusion compared to nonsurgical treatment at 6 months cannot be&#xD;
      generalized. This superiority trial may not have been truly clinically relevant because there&#xD;
      was no specific treatment protocol used in the nonsurgical group for each subject.&#xD;
      Nonsurgical management consisted of physical therapy in 98%, at least one steroid injection&#xD;
      in 74%, 2 steroid injections in 4% and radiofrequency ablation of the sacral nerve root&#xD;
      lateral branches in 46% of the 46 subjects assigned to nonsurgical treatment. The different&#xD;
      proportions of treatment offered in the nonsurgical group may in fact differ from other pain&#xD;
      management clinical practices and the generalizability of the results is questionable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to all nonsurgical treatment available for SIJ pain, the effectiveness of&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation is supported by literature of higher level of evidence. Prolonged&#xD;
      therapeutic effect up to 6 months after the procedure has been demonstrated for&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation. In the INSITE study, only 21 subjects received radio frequency&#xD;
      ablation, a group size that corresponds to only 21% of the number of subjects studied for SIJ&#xD;
      fusion. This may explain why the nonsurgical group only had 26.1% success rate in this trial.&#xD;
      The quality of evidence for the INSITE study may also be contested as the study sponsor,&#xD;
      SI-BONE®, participated in the manuscript redaction and performed the statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The costs of nonsurgical treatments for SIJ pain are substantial in the United Sates medicare&#xD;
      population and there is a need to assess the best cost effective therapy for SI joint pain.&#xD;
      SIJ fusion and RFN are two SIJ pain treatment modalities that have been studied with a higher&#xD;
      level of evidence compared to other modalities, showing significant effectiveness lasting&#xD;
      more than 6 months after each procedure. However the effectiveness and costs associated with&#xD;
      these two different treatments have never been compared in a clinically relevant randomized&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS&#xD;
&#xD;
      General / Unforeseeable&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks of receiving a SIJ fusion include but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  post-operative incisional pain or worsened pain due to muscle spams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hematoma and/or surgical site infection (less likely)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nerve damage that can cause paralysis, loss of sensation or pain (unlikely&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  possible second intervention for revision or withdrawal of implants (unlikely)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks of receiving SIJ radiofrequency ablation include but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain or discomfort around the area treated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  numbness of skin covering the area treated, worsened pain due to muscle spasm,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  permanent nerve pain (less likely)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  allergies or reactions to medications, infection and/or hematoma (less likely) 3rd&#xD;
           degree burn (rare)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nerve damage due to trauma (rare)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other risks that are not specifically related to SIJ fusion or SIJ radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      but may occur during any procedure include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiovascular and /or cerebrovascular events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pulmonary emboli&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urinary tract infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  skin abrasions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  coma or death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluoroscopy is an imaging technique that uses X-rays during the SIJ fusion or SIJ&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation. This form or ionizing radiation poses a potential for increasing the&#xD;
      patient's risk of radiation-induced cancer. Radiations doses and exposure during the study&#xD;
      are the same that would be used if the subjects were receiving the treatment outside of this&#xD;
      study. Therefore, this study does not involve any additional radiation risk for the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: Determine clinical superiority between minimally invasive SIJ fusion and&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation in chronic SIJ dysfunction patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: Compare cost-effectiveness between treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized controlled trial where randomization is done by a random number generator.&#xD;
           Even numbers will be directed to the SI joint procedure group and odd numbers will be&#xD;
           directed to the radiofrequency ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The enrolment uses a 1:1 ratio of SIJ fusion to radio frequency ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects and investigators are not blinded to treatment allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a detailed medical history and will complete these questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SIJ pain rating using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Form-36 (SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be evaluated at randomization and at follow-up visits scheduled at 1, 3, 6,&#xD;
      9, and 12 months.&#xD;

          -  The subject will rate his pain level using the VAS at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours after&#xD;
             the sacroiliac joint block and steroid injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient will be excluded from the study if they do not meet this criteria: VAS defined&#xD;
             as at least 75% pain relief that is sustained for at least 2 hours in a 10 hours&#xD;
