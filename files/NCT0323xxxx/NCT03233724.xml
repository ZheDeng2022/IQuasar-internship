      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Lung cancer is the&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Most people with lung cancer are&#xD;
      already in the advanced stages of the disease by the time they see a doctor. Researchers want&#xD;
      to see if combining an approved drug with two new drugs can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study if tetrahydrouridine-decitabine (THU-DAC) with pembrolizumab is safe and effective&#xD;
      in people with non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years and older who have NSCLC that cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of heart and lung function&#xD;
&#xD;
      They may have a small tumor sample taken (biopsy). They may have tumor scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting treatment, participants will repeat the screening tests. They will also give&#xD;
      a stool sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be done in 3-week cycles for up to 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take the 2 study drugs by mouth 3-5 days a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get pembrolizumab in a vein for 30 minutes 1 day each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a study medication diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During cycle 1, participants will have blood taken multiple times on days 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 cycles, participants will repeat screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a mandatory tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When they finish treatment, participants will have a physical exam and blood tests.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) esophageal carcinomas (EsC) and malignant&#xD;
&#xD;
      pleural mesotheliomas (MPM) account for approximately 185,000 deaths annually in the United&#xD;
      States, with over two thirds of patients presenting with advanced, incurable disease.&#xD;
      1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, EsC or MPM produces transient&#xD;
      responses at best, with most patients succumbing to disease within 12-16 months following&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent randomized clinical trials have demonstrated response rates approximating 20% in&#xD;
           unselected patients with advanced NSCLC or EsC, and nearly 45% in patients with tumors&#xD;
           exhibiting high level expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) following&#xD;
           administration of pembrolizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti- PD-1 antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 17% of unselected MPM patients have exhibited objective responses&#xD;
&#xD;
      following administration of pembrolizumab or other PD-1 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical studies have demonstrated that epigenetic drugs such as DNA demethylating&#xD;
           agents and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can prime cancer cells and tumor&#xD;
           microenvironments thereby enhancing efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although a potent DNA demethylating agent, Decitabine has poor bioavailability and&#xD;
           inconsistent distribution in solid tumors due to rapid inactivation by cytidine&#xD;
           deaminase (CDA) which is present in high levels in many organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent studies in rodents and nonhuman primates, as well as a Phase 1 clinical trial&#xD;
           (NCT#01685515) in patients with sickle cell disease have demonstrated that oral&#xD;
           tetrahydrouridine (THU), an inhibitor of CDA, significantly enhances&#xD;
           bioavailability/solid-tissue-distribution of low dose oral DAC, thereby enhancing&#xD;
           systemic DNA demethylation with acceptable toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preliminary results of recent clinical trial suggest that oral DAC-THU can increase the&#xD;
           frequency and magnitude of responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer&#xD;
           patients with low or absent intra-tumoral PD-L1 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These data support further evaluation of oral DAC-THU in combination with immune&#xD;
           checkpoint inhibitors for therapy of thoracic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To define pharmacokinetics, toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of oral DAC-THU in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with inoperable, or unresectable locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic NSCLC, EsC, or MPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine clinical response by RECIST criteria to oral DAC-THU in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in patients with inoperable, or unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      NSCLC, EsC, or MPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male or female, 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically-proven,&#xD;
           inoperable, or unresectable locally advanced, or metastatic NSCLC, EsC, or MPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with high PD-L1 expression ( (Bullet) 50%) and low PD-L1 expression (0-49%) in&#xD;
           cancer cells by immunohistochemistry are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NSCLC patients with no prior systemic treatment, or those with prior first line&#xD;
           treatment including an immune checkpoint inhibitor are eligible for study.&#xD;
&#xD;

           are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with EsC including Seiwert-Stein Type I and Type II gastro-esophageal junction&#xD;
           (GEJ) carcinomas who have received or refused standard of care first line therapy and/or&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Patients who received DNA demethylating agents or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for another&#xD;
           malignancy may be eligible for study if there were no dose-limiting immune related&#xD;
           events, and there has been either no clinical evidence of disease or minimal residual&#xD;
           disease that has been stable for at least three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness to undergo tumor biopsies if safely accessible per PI discretion before and&#xD;
           after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status 0 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No evidence of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease; adequate pulmonary reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with any targetable mutation for which there is approved first or second line&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious cardiovascular conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related&#xD;
           illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are receiving systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receiving another investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Phase I component will be a standard 3+3 design combining high and low PD-L1&#xD;
           expressers with incremental dose escalation of oral DAC-THU to define MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simon 2-stage design for Phase II studies will be used to determine clinical response at&#xD;
           the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive oral DAC-THU- on T-W for two weeks out of every 3 for 9 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab will be administered on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday at a fixed&#xD;
           intravenous dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One cycle is three weeks; one course is 9 weeks. Treatment evaluation using RECIST 1.1&#xD;
           every 10 +/- 1 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those patients exhibiting disease progression or unacceptable toxicities will be removed&#xD;
           from study. Patients exhibiting stable disease or disease regression will be offered an&#xD;
           additional course of therapy followed by treatment evaluation. Treatment will continue&#xD;
           in this manner until off-study criteria have been met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the MTD for DAC/THU has been identified, the MTD dose level will be expanded by 4&#xD;
           patients to confirm its safety. Then, including these 10 patients at the MTD, a total of&#xD;
           10 NSCLC patients with high (50% or greater) intratumoral PD-L1 expression and 10 NSCLC&#xD;
           patients with low (0-49%) intratumoral PL-L1 expression will be accrued to the first&#xD;
           stage of each of two separate Phase II cohorts using individual Simon optimal designs.&#xD;
           If 5 or more patients of the 10 first stage NSCLC patients in the high PD-L1 cohort&#xD;
           respond to treatment, the cohort will be expanded to 23 patients. If 11 of 23 of these&#xD;
           patients respond to treatment, the trial will be deemed positive for NSCLC with high&#xD;
           PD-L1 expression. If 2 or more of the 10 first stage NSCLC patients in the low PD-L1&#xD;
           expression cohort respond to treatment, the cohort will be expanded to 29 patients. If 6&#xD;
           or more of these 29 patients experience a response, the trial will be deemed positive&#xD;
           for NSCLC with low PD-L1 expression. Up to 10 EsC patients, including those considered&#xD;
           to be part of the Phase I component after the MTD has been identified, will be enrolled&#xD;
           into a separate cohort to examine responses to DAC-THU/pembrolizumab at the MTD. If 2 or&#xD;
           more of these 10 EsC patients respond to treatment, these findings may warrant an&#xD;
           amendment or a separate Phase II trial to determine response rates to&#xD;
           DAC-THU/pembrolizumab in EsC patients. Similarly, if 2 or more of 10 MPM patients&#xD;
           respond to treatment, these findings may warrant an amendment or a separate Phase II&#xD;
           trial to determine response rates to DACTHU/pembrolizumab in MPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsies of index lesions will be obtained at baseline and at treatment evaluation&#xD;
           following the first course of therapy for analysis of pharmacodynamic endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed for toxicity for at least 30 days after treatment has been&#xD;
           discontinued, start of new anti-cancer treatment or until death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

          -  The effects of DAC-THU and pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason and because antineoplastic agents as well as other therapeutic agents&#xD;
             used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and&#xD;
             for 60 days after completion of the study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cancers harboring any targetable mutation for which there is approved&#xD;
             first or second line therapy, unless standard care of therapy refused.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular / cerebrovascular disease as follows: cerebral&#xD;
             vascular accident / stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt;&#xD;
             6 months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (New York&#xD;
             Heart Association Classification Class greater than or equal to II), serious cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, clinically significant bleeding or clinically significant pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome&#xD;
             (AIDS)-related illness due to unknown effects of DAC-THU on systemic immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because DAC-THU may have the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             DACTHU, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with DAC-THU.&#xD;
             These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of or active autoimmune disease including thyroiditis, colitis,&#xD;
             nephritis, neuropathy or pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving another investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions&#xD;
             include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that&#xD;
             has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in-situ cervical or anal cancer, or&#xD;
             ductal carcinoma in-situ&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that&#xD;
             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject s participation&#xD;
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to&#xD;
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with&#xD;
             the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Thrombocytosis defined as platelet count &gt;1,200,000/mcL.&#xD;
