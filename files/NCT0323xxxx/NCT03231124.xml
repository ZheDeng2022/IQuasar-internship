  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) data of LEO&#xD;
      32731 (and major human metabolite LEO 40815) in healthy male Japanese subjects. The primary&#xD;
      objective is the assessment of PK in Japanese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained from this trial will be used to compare with existing data from the other Phase&#xD;
      1 trials. This comparison of safety and PK profiles between Japanese and Caucasian subjects&#xD;
      will allow the inclusion of Japanese patients into Phase 2b studies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ability to provide written, personally signed, and dated informed consent to&#xD;
             participate in the study, in accordance with the ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;

             generation Japanese, defined as born in Japan and having 4 biologic grandparents who&#xD;
             are ethnic Japanese.&#xD;
