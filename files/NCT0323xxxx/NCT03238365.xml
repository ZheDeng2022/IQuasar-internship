  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot early phase I trial studies how well nivolumab with or without&#xD;
      tadalafil work in treating patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that has come&#xD;
      back and can be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Tadalafil may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving nivolumab and tadalafil&#xD;
      may work better in treating patients head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate whether adding the PDE5 inhibitor, tadalafil, to nivolumab therapy affects&#xD;
      intratumoral and systemic anti-tumor immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Characterize the combined effects of nivolumab and tadalafil on safety, exosome&#xD;
      composition and function, the composition of intratumoral immune cell populations, wound&#xD;
      healing, and tumor radiographic response.&#xD;
