    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of different&#xD;
      dose regimens of KRX-0502 in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in adult subjects&#xD;
      with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, 48-week, randomized, open-label, multicenter clinical study comprised of 2&#xD;
      periods: a 24-week Dose Titration Period, followed by a 24-week Dose Maintenance Period. The&#xD;
      study will consist of 12 scheduled clinic visits over a period of 48 weeks and additional&#xD;
      visits as needed.&#xD;

All individual items were summed to create a single fatigue score ranging from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicate greater fatigue.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin (Hgb) at Week 24</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Estimates are from a mixed model of repeated measures (MMRM), including an intercept term and covariates for randomized treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, Baseline value, and Baseline value by visit interaction. The Kenward-Roger method was used along with an unstructured covariance matrix.</description>

Scheduled study drug dose adjustment occurred at Week 12 and was based upon the hemoglobin (Hgb) increase relative to Baseline and an Hgb threshold. Participants who completed the 24-week Dose Titration Period were eligible to enter the 24-week Dose Maintenance Period. During the Dose Maintenance Period, participants continued on the dose determined during the Dose Titration Period. The maximum dose was the dose determined at Week 12.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bicarbonate at Week 48</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Estimates are from an MMRM, including an intercept term and covariates for randomized treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, Baseline value, and Baseline value by visit interaction. The Kenward-Roger method was used along with an unstructured covariance matrix.</description>

Scheduled study drug dose adjustment occurred at Week 12 and was based upon the Hgb increase relative to Baseline and an Hgb threshold. Participants who completed the 24-week Dose Titration Period were eligible to enter the 24-week Dose Maintenance Period. During the Dose Maintenance Period, participants continued on the dose determined during the Dose Titration Period. The maximum dose was the dose determined at Week 12.</description>

          <description>Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The WPAI is a questionnaire to evaluate the effect of anemia associated with Chronic Kidney Disease on the ability to work and perform regular activities. Scores are presented as percentages (multiplying the scores by 100), with 0% representing no impact and 100% representing complete impact.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Participants were asked to respond to 13 statements (as they apply to the last 7 days) that other people with the same illness said are important with one of the following: 0, not at all; 1, a little bit; 2, somewhat; 3, quite a bit; 4, very much. All individual items were summed to create a single fatigue score ranging from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicate greater fatigue.</description>
