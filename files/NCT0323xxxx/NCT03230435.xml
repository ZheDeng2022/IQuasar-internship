      Eating disorders (ED) comprise a multitude of symptoms involving a disturbed body image and a&#xD;
      preoccupation with food or bodyweight. EDs are often difficult to treat, in part due to the&#xD;
      lack of motivation for improvement. Anorexia nervosa (AN) has the highest mortality rate of&#xD;
      any psychiatric disease, and less than half of patients will recover from the disease.&#xD;
      Studies have found that patients suffering from AN have impaired health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQoL) compared to the general population. It has also been suggested that despite&#xD;
      improvement in clinical parameters, patients report deterioration in HRQoL, which is in line&#xD;
      with a study finding low agreement between patient perceived outcome and clinician assessed&#xD;
      characteristics. To evaluate the patients' perception of their disease, it is important to&#xD;
      develop reliable and valid assessment tools. Previously generic questionnaires have been used&#xD;
      to assess HRQoL in Danish ED patients, as no disease-specific questionnaires have been&#xD;
      developed. Translating and validating a disease-specific questionnaire would provide a useful&#xD;
      tool in assessing current treatment and in developing new treatment options. This study aimed&#xD;
      to develop a Danish version of an internationally disease-specific HRQoL questionnaire.&#xD;
      Furthermore, HRQoL is assessed in patients who have gone through shorter or longer treatment.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder of unknown etiology. The evidence&#xD;
      base for treatment is still very limited considering the extent to which this disorder erodes&#xD;
      lives and still carries the highest fatality rate of any psychiatric disease as well as any&#xD;
      other chronic disease in adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus on appropriate effect goals in AN. Assessment of biomedical parameters&#xD;
      alone is not sufficient, why evaluation tools that consider the patient's own perception of&#xD;
      their health and well-being are essential. However, patients with AN characteristically have&#xD;
      a different opinion of their needs to that of the health professionals, which can lead to&#xD;
      differences in treatment goals, ambivalence towards treatment, and immense compliance&#xD;
      difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) can be defined as the overall effect of a medical&#xD;
      condition and/or its consequent therapy upon a patient. HRQOL is subjective and&#xD;
      multidimensional, encompassing physical and occupational function, psychological state,&#xD;
      social interaction and somatic sensation. Discrepancy between one's current level of function&#xD;
      and one's ideals or expectations can result in lower self-rated HRQOL, while cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility is believed to contribute to good HRQOL. Patients with AN typically have&#xD;
      unrealistically high expectations of themselves, are often rigid and usually do not consider&#xD;
      weight gain to be a necessity for a positive outcome. Therefore, treatment may potentially&#xD;
      lead to further reduction of HRQOL (for example due to coerced hospitalization), despite&#xD;
      significant positive improvements in biomedical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently published meta-analysis examining the HRQOL of patients with eating disorders,&#xD;
      several methodological challenges were identified such as variations in study design,&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria and health outcome measurement. It is essential that HRQOL measures are&#xD;
      valid and reliable for the patient group in question. These measures can be either generic&#xD;
      (applicable to all patient groups) or disease-specific (designed to detect HRQOL changes&#xD;
      specific to a disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a few disease-specific HRQOL measures for AN have been developed. The Eating Disorder&#xD;
      Quality of Life (EDQLS) questionnaire was published by a Canadian research group and consists&#xD;
      of 40 items on selected topics including relationships with family and others, physical and&#xD;
      psychological health and eating. Subsequent studies have shown that the EDQLS demonstrates&#xD;
      excellent psychometric properties in terms of validity, reliability and responsiveness to&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To validate a Danish version of the Eating Disorder Quality of Life questionnaire in two&#xD;
           age ranges, 13-17 years and +18 years in patients with AN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess age-specific HRQoL in patients with AN in different treatment settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN Preparatory study: Testing and adaptation of the Danish version of the EDQLS for use&#xD;
      by 13-17 year olds with anorexia nervosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: Concurrent validity and internal consistency. EDQLS, ED symptomatology, distress,&#xD;
      social function and generic HRQOL assessed in different clinical samples of AN patients aged&#xD;
      13-17 &amp; +18 years and in a sample of age-matched healthy controls within a normal weight&#xD;
      range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: Test-retest reliability. EDQLS completed twice with a 2-4-week interval in a sample&#xD;
      of weight- and treatment-stable outpatients and controls aged 13-17 &amp; +18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3: Sensitivity to change. EDQLS applied three times over a 4-6-week interval in a&#xD;
      sample of AN inpatients aged 13-17 &amp; +18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 4: Patients outside the established treatment. EDQLS, ED symptomatology, distress,&#xD;
      social function and generic HRQoL score among members and followers with BMI&lt;18 recruited&#xD;
      from the official website for the national patient organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATION Prior to this study, the initial translations of the EDQLS was carried out using&#xD;
      the method recommended by WHO World Mental Health Initiative Translation Guidelines. After&#xD;
      permission from the Canadian authors, an expert panel of bilingual staff from an ED&#xD;
      outpatient clinic worked on the translation from English to Danish, aiming for conceptual&#xD;
      equivalence between the versions (i.e. similar relevance and meaning in the two&#xD;
      languages/cultures). After panel discussions to create a consensus version the Danish draft&#xD;
      questionnaire was completed individually by 18 adult women with AN, who in subsequent&#xD;
      qualitative interviews commented on their understanding of the items and any difficulties&#xD;
      they had with the wording. The linguistic comments and suggestions from the patients were&#xD;
      used to further improve the translation, which was then approved by the expert panel. This&#xD;
      draft was back-translated and the back-translation was reviewed by the Canadian authors of&#xD;
      the scale. After the refinement of a single word, it was accepted as the official Danish&#xD;
      EDQLS translation. Both the Danish version and the original EDQLS are licensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the original EDQLS will be tested and adjusted as necessary for use&#xD;
      patients aged 13-17 years. This will be done by repeating the qualitative interviews with six&#xD;
      adolescents AN patients (13-17 years) to investigate whether the questionnaire should be&#xD;
      linguistically modified for this age group. Any modifications will be discussed with the&#xD;
      Canadian developers of EDQLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASURES Screening questionnaire: Patients will be asked to fill out a questionnaire&#xD;
      regarding current weight, height and information regarding current medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease-specific quality of life (EDQLS). WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5). Generic health&#xD;
      related quality of life: Short Form-36 (SF-36). Eating disorder symptomatology: Eating&#xD;
      Disorder Inventory-3. Depression: The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). Impairment in&#xD;
      functioning: Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). Total item burden: Total amount of&#xD;
      measures is 201 items. Estimated time for administration is about two hours. The&#xD;
      questionnaires are stored in RedCap, automatically uploading the answers as the patients fill&#xD;
      them out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSES AND STATISTICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER CALCULATIONS The sample size is based on the validation work of the original language&#xD;
      version in Canada. A high response rate of at least 80% is expected because there is a high&#xD;
      participatory interest in the subject and purpose of the study, and because the participants&#xD;
      receive a small fee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES Description of the subsamples is presented as means and standard&#xD;
      deviations and frequencies. Inter-item correlations and confirmatory factor analyses are&#xD;
      performed on the full sample across age-groups and health status and in sub-populations.&#xD;
      Pearson correlations are produced for the included symptom and HRQOL scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS According to Danish legislation, surveys are exempt from ethical board&#xD;
      review. However, a formal enquiry was made and the ethical board determined that the project&#xD;
      was approved without further application to the ethical committee. Participants will be&#xD;
      informed that study participation is voluntary, and will have no effect on their treatment&#xD;
      and management. There are no risks associated with participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All questionnaires and tests used in the study are validated, recommended and widely&#xD;
      distributed clinically for diagnosing in psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate a high proportion of completion, all participants (patients and controls) who&#xD;
      complete the test are honored with Danish kroner (DDK) 150.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANONYMITY The project is approved by the Data Protection Agency, File no. 17/3218. The data&#xD;
      will be stored in a data sheet, REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINANCE The study is a 100 % non-commercial study. The Jascha Fund has supported the post doc&#xD;
      salary for 18 months. There will be applied for licenses, participation fees, and operating&#xD;
      expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISSEMINATION AND TENTATIVE PUBLICATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study findings, both positive and negative results, will be disseminated through&#xD;
      communication at congresses and written scientific publications. Publications will be made&#xD;
      according to the Vancouver criteria with the tentative titles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life in anorexia nervosa: Validation of a Danish language&#xD;
           version in young and adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-patients treatment of anorexia nervosa: Does it improve health related quality of&#xD;
           life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with anorexia nervosa, not seeking established treatment: specific health&#xD;
           related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender differences in health-related quality of life in patients with anorexia nervosa.&#xD;
