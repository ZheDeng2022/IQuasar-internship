      This project investigates the use of 4 weeks of 24 mg/day ondansetron as compared to placebo&#xD;
      on symptoms and brain functioning in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and&#xD;
      tic disorders (TD). Patients will be randomized to receive ondansetron or placebo for 4&#xD;
      weeks, with MRI scans and symptom assessments occurring at baseline (before any drug) and at&#xD;
      the end of the 4 weeks. Patients will also be asked to come into the lab approximately 2&#xD;
      weeks into the trial for symptom assessments. The investigators hypothesize that after 4&#xD;
      weeks there will be greater reduction from baseline in sensory symptoms and the activation of&#xD;
      the insula and sensorimotor cortex compared for ondansetron as compared to placebo.&#xD;

      Many psychiatric disorders are associated with altered sensory experiences arising from&#xD;
      within the body. Examples include increased experience of sensations or urges in muscles,&#xD;
      skins, joints or visceral organs in Tic/Tourette's Disorders, OCD patients with symptoms of&#xD;
      &quot;not just right experiences&quot; or disgust sensitivity, and other disorders such as&#xD;
      trichotillomania or excoriation disorder. In OCD, these sensory phenomena occur in&#xD;
      approximately half of patients, are associated with earlier age of onset, and may be harder&#xD;
      to treat with classic cognitive-behavioral approaches to OCD. Of interest, sensory phenomena&#xD;
      in OCD are associated with Tourette's syndrome and respond to pharmacological treatments&#xD;
      primarily used for tics. As such, abnormal sensory processing may be a basic mechanism that&#xD;
      links various psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of attending to body sensations is referred to as interoception, abnormality of&#xD;
      which may be related to sensory phenomena. Research has revealed a cortical interoceptive&#xD;
      circuit involving insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and sensorimotor cortex.&#xD;
      Ondansetron (OND) is a good candidate for the modulation of the above-described interoceptive&#xD;
      circuit. It is a selective 5-HT3 (serotonin) receptor antagonist that acts on both peripheral&#xD;
      and central receptors. OND has long been used to treat nausea and vomiting due to&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiation therapy, anesthesia, and opioid-induced emesis. It has also been used&#xD;
      alone or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of both OCD and Tourette's disorder, showing&#xD;
      some efficacy in small clinical trials. The mechanisms by which ondansetron improves symptoms&#xD;
      in OCD and tic disorders are unknown, although the investigator's earlier study found that&#xD;
      single doses of ondansetron reduce activation of insula and somatosensory cortex in healthy&#xD;
      controls. As a follow-up to this work, the current protocol will compare the effects of 24&#xD;
      mg/day of ondansetron vs. placebo for 4 weeks in patients with OCD or Tic Disorders on&#xD;
      symptoms and brain functioning.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Data Sharing Plan The project will be registered and results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov. Neuroimaging data and associated files (e.g. behavioral response data generated during tasks) will be de-identified and provided for use by other researchers. De-identification will include removal of sensitive data from image file headers (e.g. name, date of birth). The anonymized final data set will be made available upon request, with an announcement on the lab website providing information on how to obtain the data. In addition, final data will be uploaded to an appropriate public database, such as the Open fMRI project, for broad availability. Data sharing will comply with local, state, and federal laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as well as institutional policies and review</ipd_description>
