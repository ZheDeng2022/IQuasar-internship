      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term &quot; Endodontic-Periodontal &quot; lesion has been proposed to describe the destructive&#xD;
      lesions resulting from inflammatory products found in varying degrees in both the&#xD;
      periodontium and the pulpal tissues. The term concurrent endodontic periodontal lesion&#xD;
      without communication applies to a tooth that has an infected root canal system with some&#xD;
      form of apical periodontitis plus marginal periodontal disease with pocketing but the&#xD;
      periapical and periodontal disease do not communicate with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are many factors, the primary cause of both diseases is the presence of&#xD;
      bacterial infection with complex microbial flora. Based on microbiological studies many&#xD;
      authors have reported the similarity between bacterial flora associated with endodontic and&#xD;
      periodontal infections. Therefore periodontal pocket may be a source of bacteria for root&#xD;
      canal system or vice versa and cross seeding of bacteria can occur in either direction&#xD;
      through communication pathways. An untreated infection of one of these tissues can lead to&#xD;
      signs or symptoms of disease within the other tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations based upon review articles and case reports has suggested, if the root canal&#xD;
      system is infected, endodontic treatment should be commenced prior to any periodontal therapy&#xD;
      in order to remove the intra-canal infection before any cementum is removed in case of&#xD;
      concurrent endodontic - periodontal lesions without communication. Treatment results of&#xD;
      endodontic therapy should be evaluated in 2-3 months and only then periodontal treatment&#xD;
      should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerns about the possibility that endodontically treated teeth might not respond to&#xD;
      periodontal therapy are certainly not new. Histological examination of human teeth concluded&#xD;
      that endodontic therapy had adversely affected periodontal healing. Teeth that had undergone&#xD;
      endodontic therapy did not respond well to regenerative procedures as teeth that had not&#xD;
      undergone such treatment. It has been advocated to perform periodontal therapy before&#xD;
      endodontic obturation because of the concern that the leakage of endodontic sealer would&#xD;
      hinder repair, regeneration or both. There is a negative impact of certain root canal filling&#xD;
      materials on fibroblast attachment to the dentin surface of extracted third molars. Also&#xD;
      endodontic therapy performed simultaneously with or soon after periodontal surgery adversely&#xD;
      affected the formation of new bone, new cementum and new attachment. It was also found in a&#xD;
      study that periapical pathology was not significantly correlated to mean pocket depth&#xD;
      reduction after non surgical and surgical treatment of horizontal and vertical defects .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microflora in infected root canals of teeth that have concurrent endodontic and&#xD;
      periodontal diseases is more complex than in teeth with infection confined to the periapical&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the above findings are based on microbiological, histological, case-reports,&#xD;
      retrospective and in vitro studies, management of concurrent endodontic periodontal lesions&#xD;
      need more evidence based investigations. So far no clinical study has compared periodontal&#xD;
      healing along with or without endodontic therapy. It is hypothesized that endodontic&#xD;
      treatment did not influence the periodontal outcomes after periodontal surgery in&#xD;
      endodontic-periodontal lesion without communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the aim of our study is to evaluate the periodontal parameters in terms of periodontal&#xD;
      healing by periodontal surgical therapy with simultaneous or delayed endodontic therapy in&#xD;
      management of concurrent endodontic -periodontal lesion without communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology in&#xD;
      collaboration with Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Post Graduate&#xD;
      Institute of Dental Sciences , Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Patients will be recruited from regular out patient department of the&#xD;
      Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Department of Conservative Dentistry &amp;&#xD;
      Endodontics and Department of Oral medicine, Diagnosis and Radiology.The study will be&#xD;
      conducted as follows:- This Interventional study will include systemically healthy minimum 36&#xD;
      patients with chronic periodontitis having at least one tooth involving endodontic&#xD;
      periodontal lesion which will be further divided into two groups (minimum 18 each) based on&#xD;
      patient's consent for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Simultaneous endodontic periodontal therapy group (Group 1) Scaling and root planning&#xD;
           will be performed simultaneously with non surgical endodontic treatment (in the form of&#xD;
           root canal treatment). After 6 weeks of scaling and root planning , periodontal surgery&#xD;
           will be performed in the form of open flap debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Delayed endodontic therapy group (Group 2) Periodontal treatment initiated with scaling&#xD;
           and root planning followed by periodontal surgery in the form of open flap debridement&#xD;
           after 6 weeks. Endodontic treatment will be initiated after 3 months of periodontal&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior informed consent will be taken from each patient after explaining the procedure in&#xD;
      patient's language along with risk and benefits involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Patients will be allocated to group1 and group 2. The study will be conducted as&#xD;
      follows:- Presurgical therapy:- which will be including&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Oral hygiene instructions ii. Full mouth supragingival and subgingival scaling and root&#xD;
      planning with ultrasonic scaler, hand scaler and curettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. In group 1 conventional root canal therapy will be performed simultaneously to&#xD;
      presurgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical therapy:- In both groups periodontal surgical procedure in the form of open flap&#xD;
      debridement will be performed after 6 weeks of SRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A probing stent will be fabricated for every patient,relative to which attachment loss will&#xD;
      be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group 2 conventional root canal therapy will be performed 3 months after periodontal&#xD;
      surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL PARAMETERS&#xD;

        1. Full mouth indices to be recorded at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bleeding on probing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Probing Pocket depth&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Attachment loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Site specific indices&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Plaque index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gingival index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Probing Pocket depth&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relative attachment loss&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bleeding on probing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tooth mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relative gingival marginal level Using UNC 15 periodontal probe at 6 sites (mesial,&#xD;
                distal, median points at buccal and lingual aspects) per tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Customized bite blocks and parallel angle technique will be used to obtain radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters will be recorded at baseline, at 6 weeks of nonsurgical phase, at 3&#xD;
      months and after 6 months post surgery for Group 1(6 months of periodontal surgery and&#xD;
      endodontic treatment) and group 2 (6 months of periodontal surgery and 3 months of root canal&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIODONTAL NON SURGICAL PROCEDURE This involves supragingival and subgingival scaling and&#xD;
      root planning to be performed with ultrasonic scaler, hand scaler and curette and will be&#xD;
      completed in minimum two sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIODONTAL SURGICAL PROCEDURE After administration of local anaesthesia, buccal and&#xD;
      lingual/palatal intracrevicular incision will be made and mucoperiosteal flaps will be&#xD;
      reflected including atleast one tooth ahead and another behind the tooth. Meticulous defect&#xD;
      debridement and root planning will be carried out using area specific curettes and scalers&#xD;
      with special effort to remove all the granulation tissue. After instrumentation, the root&#xD;
      surfaces will be washed with saline solution in attempt to remove any remaining detached&#xD;
      fragments from the defect and surgical field. After debridement mucoperiosteal flaps will be&#xD;
      repositioned and secured by using 3-0 non absorbable black silk surgical suture. The surgical&#xD;
      area will be protected and covered with periodontal dressing and post operative instructions&#xD;
      will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Instructions will be given for gentle brushing with soft brush and reinstructed for proper&#xD;
      oral hygiene postoperatively and will be examined weekly for up to 1 month after surgery and&#xD;
      again at 3 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONVENTIONAL ENDODONTIC PROCEDURE After achieving local anaesthesia, access opening will be&#xD;
      made with the help of round bur. Then the root canal will be thoroughly debrided followed by&#xD;
      copious irrigation and subsequently prepared with the help of endo files. After preparation&#xD;
      of the canal, calcium hydroxide intracanal medicament will be placed with the help of 27&#xD;
      gauge endodontic syringe for 10 days and access cavity will be sealed with suitable sealer.&#xD;
      Obturation will be performed with gutta percha and zinc oxide eugenol based sealer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -All parameters will be re-evaluated at recall period of 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months for&#xD;
      Group 1 (conventional endodontic periodontal therapy group) and group 2 (delayed endodontic&#xD;
      therapy group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recorded will be processed by standard statistical analysis.&#xD;
