      The goal of this study is to evaluate the utilization of conventional 'thermally' polarized&#xD;
      perfluorinated gases mixed with oxygen as an exogenous inert contrast agent to image the&#xD;
      airway spaces in subjects with suspected lung disease, post deployment in Iraq and&#xD;
      Afghanistan. This is an open label proof of concept study expanding on work here at Duke.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There has been mounting evidence of respiratory problems related to military service in the&#xD;
      Middle East especially in the past two decades. An overview by Flavo et al. summarizes&#xD;
      studies not only of soldiers but evaluation of particulates from the Middle East in a number&#xD;
      of animal models. While there have been some 'prospective' studies based on use of a standard&#xD;
      evaluation protocol post deployment, the primary imaging modalities have been chest&#xD;
      radiograph (most read as normal) and chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT),&#xD;
      neither of which have significant functional information. Standard pulmonary function testing&#xD;
      (e.g. spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing capacity, bronchoalveolar lavage, as well as&#xD;
      oscillatory resistance) were used in the STAMPEDE study, but only provide global functional&#xD;
      information. The case study by King et al. included lung biopsy in a sub-cohort (n = 49) of&#xD;
      soldiers with varying degrees of inhalation exposure during deployment. All biopsy samples&#xD;
      were abnormal and some were consistent with constrictive bronchiolitis. Constrictive&#xD;
      bronchiolitis is a non-reversible bronchiolar airway disease that is characterized by&#xD;
      fibrosis of the bronchioles and can be challenging to diagnose without biopsy (it is also&#xD;
      known by the term 'bronchiolitis obliterans'). The chest radiographs were normal in these&#xD;
      subjects although about 25% of chest CT showed 'air trapping' or 'centrilobular nodules'.&#xD;
      Pulmonary function testing in 39 soldiers with HRCT showed normal to near normal results in&#xD;
      32 of the subjects, with seven showing low diffusion capacity, obstruction and/or&#xD;
      restriction. Clearly, neither global measures of lung function nor high resolution anatomic&#xD;
      imaging are sensitive enough to avoid a biopsy to confirm diagnosis of constrictive&#xD;
      bronchiolitis. We hypothesize that measures of regional lung function should provide&#xD;
      additional information to aid in the diagnosis of WLI and may assist in the management of&#xD;
      more difficult or advanced cases of WLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label study in up to 10 subjects being evaluated for post war lung injury.&#xD;
      Each subject will receive up to 25 liters of inert perfluoropropane/oxygen gas mixtures as a&#xD;
      contrast agent to visualize the airway and alveolar spaces in their lungs using 19F magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging of inert gas/oxygen mixtures.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for&#xD;
             enrollment into the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Outpatients of either gender, age &gt; 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Willing and able to give informed consent and adhere to visit/protocol schedules.&#xD;
                  (Consent must be given before any study procedures are performed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test. This&#xD;
                  will be confirmed before participation in this investigational protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subjects must have been deployed in Iraq and/or Afghanistan&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Subjects must have a strong clinical suspicion of a diagnosis of constrictive&#xD;
                  bronchiolitis based on clinical presentation and spirometry results&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Unable to undergo a 3.0-Tesla MRI exam of the lungs and chest because of&#xD;
                  contraindications (e.g. metal in the eye, claustrophobia);&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Medical or psychological conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
                  might create undue risk to the subject or interfere with the subject's ability to&#xD;
                  comply with the protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Unable to receive gas mixture by breathing because of contraindications;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
                  abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or may&#xD;
                  interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
                  investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female; women at risk of pregnancy are required to have a confirmed negative urine&#xD;
        pregnancy test at Screening if of childbearing potential prior to the MRI scan&#xD;
