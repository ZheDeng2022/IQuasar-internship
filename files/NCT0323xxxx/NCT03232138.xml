  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves taking an experimental anti-cancer dietary supplement called&#xD;
      Sulforaphane (SF) or a placebo (product without any supplement content) over a period of&#xD;
      twelve months in order to determine if it is a useful dietary supplement for prevention of&#xD;
      lung cancer in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goals of this research study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To learn about the effects of giving Sulforaphane (SF) to former smokers who are still&#xD;
           at high risk of developing cancer due to their smoking history and whether or not their&#xD;
           condition improves, stays the same or becomes worse after Sulforaphane (SF) is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To learn whether Sulforaphane (SF) might reverse some of the lung cell changes&#xD;
           associated with future development of lung cancer.&#xD;
