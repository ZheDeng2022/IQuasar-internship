  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STRIMVELIS is a medicinal product that restores adenosine deaminase (ADA) function in&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell lineages, thereby preventing impaired immune function. STRIMVELIS is&#xD;
      indicated for the treatment of patients with ADA- severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID),&#xD;
      for whom suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related stem cell donor is not&#xD;
      available. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of routine and&#xD;
      additional risk minimization measures by assessing the understanding of referring health care&#xD;
      providers (HCPs) and parents/carers (hereby referred as participants) with regard to the&#xD;
      specific risks associated with STRIMVELIS. In this cross-sectional study, surveys will be&#xD;
      provided to referring HCPs and parents/carers of children approximately six months after&#xD;
      treatment with STRIMVELIS. The study will recruit for approximately two years or until a&#xD;
      maximum of 10 referring HCPs and 10 parents/carers have completed their respective surveys,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first.&#xD;
