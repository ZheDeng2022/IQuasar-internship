      To evaluate the compatibility and correlation between noninvasive surface respiratory&#xD;
      electromyography and invasive transesophageal diaphragmatic electromyography measurements, as&#xD;
      facilitating indicators of neural respiratory drive evaluation during treadmill exercise.&#xD;
      Transesophageal diaphragmatic EMG (EMGdi,es) and surface inspiratory EMG, including surface&#xD;
      diaphragmatic EMG (EMGdi,sur), surface parasternal intercostal muscle EMG (EMGpara) and&#xD;
      surface sternocleidomastoid EMG (EMGsc) were detected simultaneously during increasing&#xD;
      capacity exercise in stable patients with COPD. EMGdi,es, EMGdi,sur, EMGpara and EMGsc was&#xD;
      quantified using root mean square (RMS), which represent as RMSdi,es, RMSdi,sur, RMSpara and&#xD;
      RMSsc.&#xD;

      Subjects This self-matching clinical trial included twenty patients with COPD (age range,&#xD;
      40-80 years) treated at outpatient respiratory medicine departments at the First Affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between July 2016 and December 2016. The diagnosis&#xD;
      of COPD in all participants were measured using the pulmonary spirometry, according to the&#xD;
      Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD).1 Inclusion criteria: 1) post&#xD;
      bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] ,70% and&#xD;
      FEV1 ,50% of the predicted value); 2) bronchial dilation test (BDT) negative. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria: 1) acute exacerbation in the previous 4 weeks; 2) use of oral corticosteroids&#xD;
      within 4 weeks; and 3) smoking more than 10 cigarettes daily; (4) history of other&#xD;
      respiratory, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and musculoskeletal diseases that could interfere&#xD;
      with the exercise performance and inspiratory muscle activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This study has been reviewed and published on the ClinicalTrials.gov public site&#xD;
      (identifier: NCT03017300, Clinical trial date of registration: March 29, 2017). The study&#xD;
      protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou&#xD;
      Medical University. Informed consent was obtained from COPD patients before participation in&#xD;
      this study. To ensure the rights of all participants were protected, the researchers strictly&#xD;
      adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and the ethical principles in designing and conducting&#xD;
      clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of transesophageal diaphragmatic EMG (EMGdi,es) EMGdi,es is the classic&#xD;
      representative index describing activity of diaphragmatic myoelectric signals, the electrical&#xD;
      manifestations of the excitation process elicited by action potentials propagating along&#xD;
      muscle fiber membranes. The EMG signal is detected with multiple electrodes and then&#xD;
      amplified, filtered, and displayed on a screen or digitized to facilitate further analysis.&#xD;
      Electromyography of respiratory muscles can be used to assess the level and pattern of their&#xD;
      activation so as to detect and diagnose neuromuscular pathology and, when coupled with tests&#xD;
      of mechanical function, to assess the efficacy of the muscle's contractile function. Neural&#xD;
      respiratory drive, expressed as EMGdi, was measured using a multipair esophageal electrode&#xD;
      consisting of nine consecutive coils composed of five electrode pairs positioned in the&#xD;
      esophagus and traversing the cardia. EMGdi signals acquired with digital sampling at 2 kHz&#xD;
      were bandpass filtered (10 Hz-3 kHz) and amplified. Peak RMS per respiratory cycle was&#xD;
      calculated and averaged over 1 min. RMS of the EMGdi signal is thequantification of the total&#xD;
      EMGdi power. Theoretically, the RMS of the EMGdi reflects the force output from the brainstem&#xD;
      respiratory centre to the peripheral respiratory muscles and also reflect the sensation of&#xD;
      dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of surface inspiratory EMG EMG electrodes The electrical activity of the surface&#xD;
      inspiratory EMG was derived transcutaneously from pairs of single disposable electrodes&#xD;
      (Neotrode, Conmed Corporation, New York, USA). For the commonor ground electrode the same&#xD;
      disposable electrode was used. Electrical activity of the sternocleidomastoidmuscles and&#xD;
      Intercostals muscles were derived transcutaneously from reusablebipolar electrodes formed by&#xD;
      two narrow rim electrodes housings, each containing a 4mm Ag-AgCl sintered electrode pallet&#xD;
      (InVivo Metrics, Healdsburg, USA), interconnected with a plastic clip (homemade UMCG,&#xD;
      Groningen, The Netherlands) at a distance of14mm. After filling the electrode cavity with&#xD;
      electrode gelthe assembly was fixed to the skin by means of double sided adhesives. All EMG&#xD;
      signals detected by electrodes were convey to connected to the biological signal acquisition&#xD;
      and analysis system (Powerlab 16/35; ADInstruments) by shielded low noise cables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrode placement Surface diaphragmatic EMG (EMGdi,sur): The surface detecting electrode&#xD;
      couple were separately placed at the intersection point of the sixth and eight intercostal&#xD;
      space and anterior axillary line, at a distance of 5 cm.10 Surface parasternal EMG (EMGpara):&#xD;
      The surface detecting electrodes were placed bilaterally in the second intercostal space,&#xD;
      about 3 cm parasternal, a reference ground electrode was placed atthe sternum sternal angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface sternocleidomastoid EMG (EMGsc): Surface detecting electrode were placed on the 1/3&#xD;
      and 2/3 of overall length of sternocleidomastoid, a reference ground electrode was placed at&#xD;
      the suprasternal fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise testing All subjects performed a maximal incremental cycle ergometry test in a&#xD;
      sitting posture, in order to minimize the effects of muscle activity necessary for body&#xD;
      stabilization (Ergoselect 200 K; Cosmed, Rome, Italy). Furthermore, to minimize muscle&#xD;
      activity for head positioning, the subjects were instructed to look straight ahead during the&#xD;
      measurements. The test consisted of a steady-state resting period of 3 min followed by 1 min&#xD;
      of unloaded pedaling at 60 cycles/min for each individual; the exercise load was increased by&#xD;
      10 W each min until the test had to be stopped because symptoms prevented further exercise.&#xD;
      After test results were recorded, EMGdi,es and each surface inspiratory EMG of maximal&#xD;
      exercise capacity were analysed.&#xD;
