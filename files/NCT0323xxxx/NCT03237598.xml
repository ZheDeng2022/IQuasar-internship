  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of economics in China, the dietary diversity got higher. Meanwhile, the&#xD;
      prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) raised up as well. To investigate the gender&#xD;
      difference of getting MetS and its various associations with dietary diversity at different&#xD;
      ages.Data of adults(n=4308) aged 18+ y with three consecutive 24-h recalls and complete&#xD;
      co-variates information were extracted from Chinese Nutrition and Health Survey in 2009.&#xD;
      Modified Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) was adopted to capture the diversity of diet. MetS was&#xD;
      defined by the harmonized criteria. Multivariable adjusted logistic regression was carried&#xD;
      out to detect the association between DDS and MetS and its components for young, middle aged&#xD;
      and elderly adults by a cross-sectional study.&#xD;

      Population and data collection Chinese Nutrition and Health Survey （CHNS） was implemented by&#xD;
      the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) and the Chinese Institute of&#xD;
      Nutrition and Food Safety (INFS), and China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC).&#xD;
      This survey was approved by the Institutional Review Board of aforementioned institutions.&#xD;
      All participants provided the written informed consent. Detailed information about this&#xD;
      survey and laboratory examinations has been described elsewhere .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary assessment and dietary diversity score Individual daily food consumption data were&#xD;
      collected through face-to-face interviews for 3 consecutive days which are randomly&#xD;
      distributed within one week. Trained field interviewers helped each participants recall the&#xD;
      food that they consumed at home and outside in a 24-h period and recorded the codes (listed&#xD;
      in the Food Composition Table of China), types, amounts, and locations of consumption for&#xD;
      each food item by using food models and pictures. More detailed information about the dietary&#xD;
      data in CHNS has been previously reported (The China Health and Nutrition Survey,&#xD;
      1989-2011,PMID: 24341753 .).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with previous studies, the investigator combine the original 12 major food categories&#xD;
      in Chinese Food Composition Table into 6 broad groups (grains, vegetables, fruits,&#xD;
      meat/poultry/seafood, dairy, and beans/eggs/nuts) based on similarities in nutrient&#xD;
      composition and dietary function. Detailed information about DDS has been depicted in&#xD;
      previous study(PMID: 27848939). Foods consumed less than a minimum amount (25g) per day was&#xD;
      excluded to avoid measurement error caused by negligible consumption. Since the consumption&#xD;
      of dairy was generally low in Chinese dietary, the cutoff point was adjusted to 10g per day.&#xD;
      The DDS value ranges from 0 to 6 and higher value indicates greater diversity of diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables and covariates Waist circumference was measured around the body at the top&#xD;
      of the hipbone, using an unstretched tape over the light cloth. Measurement was conducted&#xD;
      without putting any pressure to body surface, and the value was recorded to the nearest&#xD;
      0.1cm.Height and weight was measured by trained health worker using regularly calibrated&#xD;
      equipments under the instructions of manufacturers. BMI was calculated by dividing the weight&#xD;
      (kg) by the square of the height (m2). Blood pressure was measured after thrice rest in a&#xD;
      seated position, each rest lasts for 5 minutes. It was utilized to calculate the average&#xD;
      value of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Blood sample was&#xD;
      collected after 12-14h overnight fasting from all participants, and was stored in vacationer&#xD;
      tubes. All blood samples were analyzed in the central laboratories of China-Japan Friendship&#xD;
      Hospital. Fasting plasma glucose was measured by glucose oxidase-3'-phosphoadenosine&#xD;
      5'-phosphate (GOD-PAP), using the kit produced by Randox, United Kingdom (UK). Serum&#xD;
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration was measured by enzymatic method;&#xD;
      serum triglyceride levels was measured by cholesterol oxidase peroxidase -&#xD;
      3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (CHOD-PAP); these two testing reagent were produced by the&#xD;
      Kyowa, Japan. The last three indices were measured by the Hitachi 7600 machine. Detailed&#xD;
      information about blood collection and test are presented in appendix 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about sex, age, income per capita, and educational level (Primary, middle and&#xD;
      high) can be found in previous study, total energy intake, smoking status (0= currently not&#xD;
      smoking, 1= currently smoking) and drinking status (0= did not drink in the past year, 1=&#xD;
      drank alcohol in the past year), and residential area (urban and rural, north and south) were&#xD;
      collected as co-variables. Physical activity was defined according to occupation (1=light&#xD;
      physical activity, working in a sitting or standing position, such as office worker, teacher;&#xD;
      2=moderate physical activity, such as student or driver; 3= heavy physical activity, such as&#xD;
      farmers, loader, miner), and adjusted in the model as well. Adults were categorized into&#xD;
      three age groups according to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards (young: ≥18 &amp;&#xD;
      ≤45; adult: &gt;45 &amp; ≤60; old: &gt;60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis First, in order to investigate whether the association between dietary&#xD;
      diversity and MetS varies between men and women, an interaction term between sex and DDS was&#xD;
      added into the multivariable linear model. Accordingly, the descriptive statistical were&#xD;
      presented at each tertiles of DDS for each sex(1st, ≤3; 2nd, 4; 3rd, 5-6). Continuous&#xD;
      variates are presented as means ± standard deviations and categorical variables are presented&#xD;
      as percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between DDS and MetS and its individual components was detected by&#xD;
      multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, both the OR values and 95% CI were presented.&#xD;
      Sex, income per capita, educational level, physical activity, age and age squared, smoking&#xD;
      and drinking status, fat share, total energy intake, and residential location were adjusted&#xD;
      in the multivariable regression model. Income and total energy intake were measured in&#xD;
      logarithm. The association between predicted probability of MetS and age was mapped using&#xD;
      kernel weighted local polynomial smoothing; both the fitted probability and 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval were presented. The linear trend of odds ratio for DDS was tested by taking DDS as&#xD;
      continuous variable in the multivariable logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses were performed with Stata multi processing (MP) 13.0 (Stata Crop, USA) and&#xD;
      P&lt;0.05 was considered as statistical significance.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the present study, participants were extracted from 2009, as the biochemical data&#xD;
             was only available in 2009. Only adults (≥18 years old) with complete information on&#xD;
             food consumption and biochemical data were included in our analysis (n=5118).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We excluded women who were pregnant or lactating (n=41). To avoided the distortion of&#xD;
             outlier, adults with implausible daily energy intake (&gt;7000kcal or &lt;520kcal) were&#xD;
             censored (n=4). Meanwhile, adults who have a history of metabolic related disease,&#xD;
             such as myocardial infarction (n=15), diabetes (n=90), and apoplexy (n=31) were&#xD;
             excluded, because their diet might be changed after diagnostic disease. In addition,&#xD;
             we also excluded people who take antihypertensive drugs (n=507). After matching food&#xD;
             data with biochemical and anthropometric data and biochemical data, individuals with&#xD;
             incomplete information was removed (n=122).&#xD;
