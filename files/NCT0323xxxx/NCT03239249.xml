      The aim of this study is to analyze whether and how a systemic school-level approach to&#xD;
      dropout prevention (the IKO-model), increase the completion rate from upper secondary school.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that schools that implement the model (i.e. randomized to the experimental&#xD;
      group), will reduce the amount of students in risk of dropout, compared to their counterparts&#xD;
      in schools randomized to the control group. The main expected outcomes in the study are; 1)&#xD;
      increased amounts of students in upper secondary education completing their education within&#xD;
      the three-year standard length of education, 2) decreased amounts of school-drop out, and 3)&#xD;
      reduced values in mediating variables, such as low achievement, course failures, lack of&#xD;
      attendance and lack of school-motivation and -effort. Accordingly, implementation quality and&#xD;
      fidelity to the model will be assessed, both with quantitative (survey) and qualitative&#xD;
      (interviews and observation) data. A total of five counties and 42 upper secondary schools&#xD;
      participate in the evaluation project. One of the counties (Akershus County) have developed&#xD;
      and piloted the model and function as a mentor in the other four counties (Oppland, Hedmark,&#xD;
      Nord-Trøndelag and Hamar). While 20 schools have been randomized to the experimental group,&#xD;
      22 schools have been randomized to the control group. Schools randomized to the control group&#xD;
      will work as earlier with school dropout.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to analyze whether and how a systemic school-level approach to&#xD;

      (interviews and observation) data. A total of five counties and 42 upper secondary schools&#xD;
      participate in the evaluation project. One of the counties (Akershus County) have developed&#xD;
      and piloted the model and function as a mentor in the other four counties (Oppland, Hedmark,&#xD;
      Nord-Trøndelag and Hamar). While 20 schools have been randomized to the experimental group,&#xD;
      22 schools have been randomized to the control group. Schools randomized to the control group&#xD;
      will work as earlier with school dropout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implemented model is based on the County of Akershus´ experiences of developing and&#xD;
      implementing the IKO-model since 2009. The IKO-model represents a systemic intervention at&#xD;
      the school-level level, with the aim of improving the schools' follow-up structures related&#xD;
      to students in risk of school dropout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic idea of the model is that there are three groups of students: 1) students with&#xD;
      ordinary follow-up needs, 2) students with the right to special education and 3) students&#xD;
      without the right to special education, but who need individually targeted efforts from time&#xD;
      to time. While there are guidelines and requirements when it comes to the follow-up of&#xD;
      students with the right to special education, schools are less systematic in their approaches&#xD;
      to students with temporary need for follow-up. Hence, the IKO-model focuses on improving the&#xD;
      way schools identify and follow-up students in risk for dropout, but who do not qualify for&#xD;
      special education. It is also emphasized, that time-limited and low-cost interventions are&#xD;
      sufficient enough to reduce the risk of drop-out for the majority of students within this&#xD;
      group, however the most important is to identify problems early and find solutions quickly.&#xD;
      The goal is to remove the need for additional interventions as soon as possible and return&#xD;
      students to normal education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another assumption is that the model will help schools to implement goal-focused targeted&#xD;
      interventions at an early stage and ensure that the measures implemented are adjusted based&#xD;
      on student needs. At student level the model aim to a) early identify students &quot;in risk&quot; for&#xD;
      drop-out , b) charter students´ situation in order to find suitable interventions, and c)&#xD;
      follow-up identified students with immediate interventions including an ongoing evaluation of&#xD;
      their situation. In order for schools to succeed at identifying, chartering and following-up&#xD;
      students, three main school-level components are implemented; 1) a computer assisted early&#xD;
      warning system, 2) organizational structures and practices that enables schools to monitor&#xD;
      progress and implement effective interventions, and 3) external and school internal&#xD;
      communities of learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question is whether, how and to what extent the IKO-model reduce drop-out from&#xD;
      upper secondary school. The hypothesis is that the IKO-model will assist schools in their&#xD;
      work with identifying, charting and supporting students in risk through the early warning&#xD;
      system, organization-level monitoring practices, and communities of learning. The main&#xD;
      outcome assessed is reduced amounts of students that dropout from upper secondary school&#xD;
      measured through increased amounts of students accomplishing education within the three-year&#xD;
      standard length. The intervention is also expected to reduce amounts of students not in&#xD;
      education, activity or employment at follow-up.&#xD;
