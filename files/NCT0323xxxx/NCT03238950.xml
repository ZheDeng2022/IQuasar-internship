  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether the type of simulation model used in cricothyroidotomy&#xD;
      training has an effect on the subsequent confidence and competence in the procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Pilot study - prospective randomised controlled trial involving:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of ability to complete a surgical cricothyroidotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Completion of questionnaire prior to training and prior to assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to beginning training, questionnaires will be completed by all participants asking&#xD;
      their level of previous training. Current confidence level for completion of&#xD;
      cricothyroidotomy will be marked on a visual analogue scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training will then be completed with each group using the appropriate manikin type - porcine&#xD;
      or synthetic. This will consist of didactic information on the procedure delivered via&#xD;
      recorded information to standardise this initial training, and then proceeding to supervised&#xD;
      practice of the procedure for two occasions. This will be completed by the same trainer, with&#xD;
      the same information given to both groups. Questions to clarify how to perform the procedure&#xD;
      will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second questionnaire will be given to the trainees on completion of training to mark on a&#xD;
      visual analogue scale their confidence level at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment will then be completed later the day comprising of assessment of completion of&#xD;
      surgical cricothyroidotomy using a porcine manikin with skin overlying. This will be&#xD;
      different to the porcine manikin used for training. The assessment will time the trainees&#xD;
      from start to completion of airway insertion, as well as a checklist of activities to be&#xD;
      achieved. The porcine manikins will then be dissected to identify if correct location for&#xD;
      insertion was achieved and complications. The same amount of time will be given between&#xD;
      groups training and assessment.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically trained healthcare professionals working in Anaesthetics, Emergency Medicine&#xD;
             or General Surgery as these doctors may be expected to complete a surgical&#xD;
             cricothyroidotomy despite infrequently performing the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The healthcare professionals can be from Foundation Year 1 to before Certificates of&#xD;
             Completion of Training (CCT). Those who are out of training and are not yet at&#xD;
             consultant level are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        â€¢ Healthcare professionals who already complete surgical airways on a regular basis (e.g.&#xD;
        Ear Nose Throat or Maxillofacial trainees) as these doctors may already be competent prior&#xD;
        to training.&#xD;
