  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the postprandial glucose and insulin responses to&#xD;
      replacing digestible carbohydrates with resistant starch type 4 (RS4) in a baked product in&#xD;
      healthy men and women. A randomized, double-blinded cross-over study will be conducted&#xD;
      comparing two foods (a reference food and a test food). The primary outcome variable will be&#xD;
      the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for capillary glucose from pre-product&#xD;
      consumption (average of t = -15 and -5 min) to 120 min (iAUC0-120 min). This study will&#xD;
      provide substantiation for a beneficial reduction in glycemic response followed by the&#xD;
      consumption of the active product containing an efficacious dose of resistant starch type 4&#xD;
      (RS4).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover trial that includes one&#xD;
      screening visit (Visit 1; day -7) and two test visits (Visits 2 and 3; days 0 and 7) which&#xD;
      are separated by a washout period of 4-7 days. At Visit 1 (day -7), subjects will provide&#xD;
      informed consent and undergo screening assessments including evaluations of medical history,&#xD;
      prior/current medication/supplement use, inclusion and exclusion criteria, height, body&#xD;
      weight, BMI, vital signs, and Vein Access Scale. A fasting capillary blood glucose will be&#xD;
      assessed for eligibility purposes and an in-clinic urine pregnancy test (all women) will also&#xD;
      be obtained. Subjects will then be dispensed a 24-h Diet Record with instructions to record&#xD;
      intake the day prior to Visit 2 (day 0). At Visit 2 (day 0), subjects will arrive at the&#xD;
      clinic fasted (10-14 h, water only, anchored to the t = -15 min blood draw), to undergo&#xD;
      clinic visit procedures. Adverse events (AE) will be assessed and subjects will be queried&#xD;
      about test day instructions compliance. Additionally, the 24-h Diet Record will be collected&#xD;
      and reviewed. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to a randomization sequence and&#xD;
      will undergo the glycemic and insulinemic response test with blood glucose concentrations&#xD;
      assessed via capillary measurement and insulin concentrations assessed via venous&#xD;
      measurement. Blood samples (capillary and venous) will be obtained at t = -15 and -5 ± 5 min.&#xD;
      Subjects will consume the study product in its entirety within 10 min at t = 0 min with 8 oz&#xD;
      of water. Capillary and venous blood samples will be obtained at t = 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and&#xD;
      120 ± 5 min, where t = 0 min is the start of study product consumption, to assess glucose and&#xD;
      insulin concentrations. Subjects will be provided one-8 oz bottle of water to consume at t =&#xD;
      0 to 60 min and one-8 oz bottle of water to consume at t = 61 to 120 min. Water consumption&#xD;
      will be recorded and replicated at the subsequent test visits. AEs will be assessed and&#xD;
      subjects will be dispensed a blank/new 24-h Diet Record to record all food and beverage&#xD;
      consumed the day prior to Visit 3, day 7; as well as a copy of the completed 24-h Diet Record&#xD;
      (from day -1) with instructions to replicate the same food and beverage intake as closely as&#xD;
      possible the day prior to the next test visit (Visit 3, day 7). Test day instructions will&#xD;
      also be provided. At Visit 3 (day 7), subjects will return to the clinic for clinic visit&#xD;
      procedures. AEs will be assessed and subjects will be queried about test day instructions&#xD;
      compliance. The 24-h Diet Record will be collected and study staff will review the 24-h Diet&#xD;
      Record to compare food and beverage consumption to the day -1 Diet Record for consistency.&#xD;
      Subjects will then crossover to the next study product in their test sequence and repeat the&#xD;
      glycemic/insulinemic response test described above for Visit 2. At the conclusion of the&#xD;
      glycemic/insulinemic response test, AEs will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluable sample size of 19 is required to observe a statistically significant difference&#xD;
      between active and control products (α = 0.05 (2- tailed); power = 80%) assuming that the&#xD;
      glucose response of the Cargill active product is 61% of that of the control product and&#xD;
      standard deviation is 65% of the mean value (standard deviation estimation is based on a&#xD;
      recently completed proprietary study conducted by Biofortis on baked products containing&#xD;
      different amounts of fiber). To account for possible attrition, a total of 22 subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Each subject will consume a single serving of the control or active product.&#xD;
      These consumption events will be separated by at least 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be conducted using Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS) for&#xD;
      Windows (version 9.4, Cary, NC) and/or R 3.3.1 (R Core Team 2016). The data will be analyzed&#xD;
      for the modified intent-to-treat population, which will include all subjects who complete the&#xD;
      test condition and the reference product. Assessment for outliers, as per the International&#xD;
      Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, will also be conducted. All decisions&#xD;
      regarding subject population and data inclusion will be documented prior to database lock.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics [number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, standard error of the&#xD;
      mean (SEM), median, interquartile limits, minimum and maximum or frequency counts] will be&#xD;
      presented for subject demographics and anthropometric measurements collected at&#xD;
      screening/baseline. Incremental area under the curve (iAUC) 0-120 min will be calculated as&#xD;
      outlined in ISO 26642:2010(E) for each subject. Descriptive statistics (i.e. number of&#xD;
      subjects, minimum and maximum, median, inter-quartile limits, mean, SEM, and standard&#xD;
      deviation) will be presented for all the continuous outcomes for each test group. All tests&#xD;
      of significance, unless otherwise stated, will be performed at alpha=0.05, two sided. A&#xD;
      repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess differences between&#xD;
      test groups for the primary and secondary outcome variables with the exception of the&#xD;
      comparisons between groups for glucose and insulin concentrations at each time point. Initial&#xD;
      repeated measures ANCOVA models will contain terms for test group, test sequence, and test&#xD;
      period, with test group specified as a repeated effect and subject nested within sequence.&#xD;
      Models will be reduced using a backward selection method until only significant terms or test&#xD;
      group remains in the model. Appropriate least squares mean values and corresponding SEM will&#xD;
      be derived from the final model for each test group. Assumption of normality of residuals&#xD;
      will be investigated at the 5% level with the Shapiro-Wilk test (Shapiro 1965). If the&#xD;
      normality assumption is not satisfied, then an analysis based on ranks will be performed.&#xD;
      Average blood glucose response curve, as described in ISO 26642:2010(E), and time curve plots&#xD;
      of the observed glucose and insulin concentration per time point per test product will be&#xD;
      presented. Glucose concentrations will be provided in mg/dL and insulin concentrations will&#xD;
      be provided at μIU/mL.&#xD;
