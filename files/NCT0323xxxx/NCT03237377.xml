  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of neoadjuvant 'immunoradiation' (durvalumab or durvalumab plus&#xD;
      tremelimumab) administered every 4 weeks for 2 doses, concurrently with standard thoracic&#xD;
      radiation (RT) (45Gy in 25 fractions), with one dose of immunotherapy alone delivered in the&#xD;
      pre-surgical window, prior to surgical resection, for patients with stage IIIA NSCLC that is&#xD;
      deemed resectable with a lobectomy by a thoracic surgeon. If preliminary safety of the&#xD;
      durvalumab/thoracic RT combination is established, a second cohort investigating the&#xD;
      combination of durvalumab/tremelimumab/thoracic RT prior to surgical resection will be&#xD;
      opened. After surgical resection, patients may receive standard adjuvant chemotherapy, as&#xD;
      deemed appropriate by the treating investigator.&#xD;
