  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through a better understanding of the biology of significant (lethal) prostate cancer, we&#xD;
      hope to develop new markers/targets from urine metabolomics for more effective screening and&#xD;
      prevention of significant prostate cancer. In the meantime, with these new markers we may&#xD;
      substantially reduce overtreatment of insignificant PC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) afflicts millions of men worldwide. In Taiwan, around 5,000 men are&#xD;
      diagnosed as PC while 1,200 men die of the disease each year. However, thousands of Taiwanese&#xD;
      men may have been over-treated for their insignificant PCs. The above situations signify the&#xD;
      unmet clinical need where effective measures of stratifying risk of PC are lacking. The study&#xD;
      is to identify new markers/targets with which to better screen and prevent significant (sPC)&#xD;
      or lethal PC (lePC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, observational and investigational study investigating the role of&#xD;
      urine metabolites via metabolomics analysis in subjects who will undergo prostate biopsy&#xD;
      and/or subsequent MCS supplementation. MCS (or Botreso) is a new patented botanic agent,&#xD;
      composed of primarily multi-carotenoids, including lycopene, phytoene, phytofluene, etc. The&#xD;
      expected subject number to be enrolled is 620 men and 20 women from NTUH. There will be 3&#xD;
      cohorts: Cohort A (N=200), Cohort B (N=400) and Cohort C (N=40). Cohort A will be recruited&#xD;
      in the first 9 months of the study period to generate the first batch of urine metabolite&#xD;
      profiles. Cohort B will be recruited in the next 18 months of the study period to validate&#xD;
      the first batch of newly developed urine metabolite profile. Cohort C is the control cohort,&#xD;
      including 20 women and 20 men without any signs of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By risk stratification after biopsy pathology results are available, there will be 5 groups&#xD;
      of subjects, including patients with Group 1. mPC: Metastatic prostate cancer Group 2. sPC:&#xD;
      Non-metastatic significant prostate cancer (sPC) Group 3. isPC: Non-metastatic insignificant&#xD;
      PC (isPC) Group 4. Pre-cancerous lesions: atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) or&#xD;
      prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) Group 5. Non-cancer benign pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, sPC is defined as any of the followings: Gleason score &gt;= 4+3=7, stage&#xD;
      &gt; =T3a (capsule invasion), or presence of metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy pathology report and clinicopathological parameters will be recorded. In addition,&#xD;
      transcriptomics study will be performed. Group specific urine metabolite profiles will be&#xD;
      constructed by comparing the outstanding metabolites between groups. These metabolite&#xD;
      profiles are constructed so as to efficiently separate groups of graded risk stratification,&#xD;
      especially to predict subjects with mPC (Group 1) or sPC (Group 2). The newly constructed&#xD;
      metabolite profiles from Cohort A will be validated against Cohort B of subjects who will&#xD;
      undergo biopsy to determine the predictive efficiency of the constructed profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort A, sPC (Group 2), isPC (Group 3), ASAP/PIN (Group 4) and benign pathology patients&#xD;
      (Group 5) will further be invited to take MCS supplementation for 8 weeks after the pathology&#xD;
      confirmation. The expected enrollment number is 30 for each of the 4 groups (in total 120).&#xD;
      Urine samples will be collected before and after 8 weeks of MCS supplementation for&#xD;
      metabolomics analysis. The effect of MCS supplementation in modifying urine metabolites will&#xD;
      be investigated to determine the potential use of MCS in prostate cancer chemoprevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through a better understanding of the biology of significant (lethal) PC, we hope to develop&#xD;
      new markers/targets for more effective screening and prevention of sPC. In the meantime, with&#xD;
      these new markers we may substantially reduce overtreatment of insignificant PC.&#xD;
