  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Half of all adolescents report experiencing low back pain (LBP), and adolescents who are&#xD;
      active in sport report an even higher rate. The most common identifiable cause of LBP in the&#xD;
      adolescent athlete is a stress fracture in the low back, known as a spondylolysis.&#xD;
      Spondylolysis injuries have been found in up 47% of young athletes with LBP. The current&#xD;
      recommendations of care for a spondylolysis consist of rest for at least 3 months, bracing,&#xD;
      and physical therapy. These recommendations result in athletes being out of sport for as long&#xD;
      as 46 months, and are based on low level evidence and expert opinion. In addition to the long&#xD;
      period out of sport, 42% have poor long-term outcomes, and 1 in 6 athletes are no longer able&#xD;
      to play at their former level specifically due to their back injury. These long periods out&#xD;
      of sport and poor long-term clinical outcomes suggest current care recommendations are&#xD;
      suboptimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the proposed research is to test the feasibility of using an early&#xD;
      functional progression program to reduce athletes' time out of sport and improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Specifically, to pilot altering the rest period in athletes with a spondylolysis&#xD;
      and begin rehabilitation immediately. These young athletes will return to sport as they are&#xD;
      able, after demonstrating predetermined pain free functional ability. Twelve young athletes&#xD;
      with a confirmed active spondylolysis will be recruited to undergo the early function&#xD;
      progression intervention. The specific aims of this study are to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing the immediate functional progression protocol, refine the protocol if necessary,&#xD;
      and estimate potential effectiveness of this intervention. The athletes' outcomes will be&#xD;
      compared to historical controls. The investigators hypothesize that the immediate functional&#xD;
      progression program can be successfully implemented and with only minor changes will be&#xD;
      suitable for use in larger trials. It is estimated the immediate functional progression&#xD;
      program has the potential to return athletes to sport more than a month sooner than current&#xD;
      practice. Once able to demonstrate the feasibility of the early functional progression&#xD;
      program, the investigators plan to progress this work into larger trials to fully assess&#xD;
      effectiveness, safety and long-term outcomes.&#xD;

      Athletes who meet the inclusion criteria and consent to participate in the pilot study will&#xD;
      be referred directly to physical therapy (PT) care for 2 times per week. Athletes will&#xD;
      follow-up with their co-investigating physician every 4 weeks until discharge. The immediate&#xD;
      functional progression program will be performed by physical therapists trained in the&#xD;
      treatment protocol. Athletes will perform phase I of the program and progress to phase II as&#xD;
      able without an increase in pain and without compensations noted in function. The athlete&#xD;
      will be assessed at each session to determine if they meet the criteria to begin the next&#xD;
      step of functional progression program. Once the athlete has met the criteria of phase II,&#xD;
      they will progress into the final phase of the functional progression program for return to&#xD;
      sport activity. As these athletes progress through the third phase, and are able to meet the&#xD;
      return to sport criteria, they will be released to return to sport. Athletes will not be&#xD;
      released to return to sport prior to their first physician follow-up visit at 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Immediate Functional Progression Program Core strengthening in neutral spine Treat&#xD;
      directional preference if identified Hip strengthening Peri-scapular strengthening&#xD;
      Flexibility exercises Manual Therapy as needed Modalities for pain (use sparingly)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Immediate Functional Progression Program Core strengthening in functional range Hip&#xD;
      and peri-scapular strengthening Flexibility exercises Manual Therapy (use sparingly) Phase&#xD;
      III Immediate Functional Progression Program- Return to Sport Return to sport activity with&#xD;
      focus on functional return to all aspect of sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs of not responding as anticipated during the immediate functional progression program:&#xD;
      Inability to meet long-term goals of care in PT including inability to return to sport due to&#xD;
      low back pain within three months, an increase in pain or no significant decrease in pain&#xD;
      (&lt;2/10) at physician visits until patient reports &lt;2/10 pain with activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size A sample size of 12 will be recruited for this pilot trial. As there is a&#xD;
      nonlinear relationship between confidence interval (CI) width and sample size, further&#xD;
      increases in participants beyond 12 have a diminishing benefit on precision for preliminary&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Descriptive statistics of the patient demographics and outcome variables will&#xD;
      be reported. Inferential calculations will not be performed as this is a pilot to demonstrate&#xD;
      the feasibility of implementing the proposed immediate functional progression program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Discussion of the success of implementing the immediate functional progression program&#xD;
      will occur during and after care of each patient. The PI will monitor patient documentation&#xD;
      to assess adherence to the research protocol in care. Adverse events will be monitored, the&#xD;
      immediate functional progression program will be considered acceptably tolerated by patients&#xD;
      if &lt;3 adverse events are observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: (Potential Problems and Alternative strategies) Minor problems identified in the pilot&#xD;
      study will serve to refine to the protocol for the full randomized clinical trial. Larger&#xD;
      potential problems include non-adherence to the experimental treatment protocol. The risk of&#xD;
      this potential problem will be reduced by training of all staff involved in the research&#xD;
      process. If a problem is found in the experiment protocol that inhibits patients from&#xD;
      satisfactorily progressing in their care, the co-investigators will meet and decide on a&#xD;
      course of action to fix this issue. An alteration in the experimental protocol that results&#xD;
      in improved care would be considered a positive outcome, as the goal of this pilot study is&#xD;
      to demonstrate viability and feasibility for a larger clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Clinical outcomes including pain, function, time to return to sport and recurrence of&#xD;
      symptoms will be compared against historical controls to assess for potential efficacy.&#xD;
      Historical controls for quality of life are not available in this population. Time to return&#xD;
      to sport will be the primary outcome of interest. A decrease in return to sport time of &gt; 30&#xD;
      days compared to the historical control time of 3.8 months without a notable worsening of&#xD;
      other outcomes will indicate future research is warranted.&#xD;
