  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MAC lung infections are a growing public health problem. The ATS / IDSA 2007 guidelines for&#xD;
      the treatment of these non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections recommend the use of a&#xD;
      macrolide or azalide (clarithromycin or azithromycin), rifampicin or rifabutin and&#xD;
      ethambutol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For MAC disseminated infections, several studies have compared combinations containing&#xD;
      clarithromycin or azithromycin and found no significant difference in efficacy. No randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials have been performed for pulmonary infections to compare clarithromycin and&#xD;
      azithromycin in terms of efficacy. Clarithromycin is often used as a first-line treatment in&#xD;
      France, but its tolerance is often poor, particularly in terms of risk of hepatitis, metallic&#xD;
      taste in the mouth, nausea or vomiting, and it interacts with many drugs via cytochrome p450&#xD;
      . In particular, it increases the toxicity of rifabutin, in particular in terms of uveitis.&#xD;
      Azithromycin has fewer side effects especially less digestive toxicity and drug interactions&#xD;
      than clarithromycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is therefore that the efficacy of azithromycin would be non-inferior in&#xD;
      comparison with that of clarithromycin.&#xD;

      1. Scientific rationale and general description:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) represent all mycobacteria not belonging to the&#xD;
           Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. This group of mycobacteria was discovered recently&#xD;
           and has demonstrated pulmonary pathogenicity. The presence of a NTM in a respiratory&#xD;
           specimen is therefore not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of a lung infection. The&#xD;
           ATS/IDSA 2007 guidelines require clinical, radiological and microbiological criteria to&#xD;
           distinguish infection from colonisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main NTM isolated and responsible of NTM pulmonary infections in France is&#xD;
           Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). MAC organisms are common in many environmental sites,&#xD;
           including water, soil and in animals. Up to now, the main hypothesis for transmission is&#xD;
           inhalation of MAC via aerosol during the shower. Three classical clinical and&#xD;
           radiological patterns are described for MAC: the fibrocavitary lung disease, the nodular&#xD;
           bronchiectatic disease and the hypersensitivity disease. This last pattern classically&#xD;
           doesn't need any antibiotics. So, this study will focus only on the two first patterns:&#xD;
           fibrocavitary form and nodular-bronchiectatic form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The limitations for effective therapy were the absence of antimicrobial agents with low&#xD;
           toxicity and good in vivo activity against the organism. The major therapeutic advance&#xD;
           is the introduction of the newer macrolides, clarithromycin and azithromycin, which have&#xD;
           substantial efficacy in vitro and clinical activity against MAC. Structurally,&#xD;
           azithromycin is an azalide. However, because of the close similarity of azalides to&#xD;
           macrolides, the term &quot;macrolide&quot; is often used to refer to azithromycin and&#xD;
           clarithromycin. As macrolides are the cornerstone of MAC treatment, their use in&#xD;
           monotherapy is responsible of selection of macrolides MAC resistant strains that are&#xD;
           associated with microbiological and clinical relapse. This is why all international&#xD;
           guidelines and all experts recommended the use of macrolides with at least two companion&#xD;
           drugs, classically rifampicin and ethambutol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment of MAC lung disease is long and not well tolerated. Despite treatment,&#xD;
           microbiological failure or early relapse occurs in 20-30% of patients. One of the main&#xD;
           failure explanations in NTM disease is the spontaneous treatment stop by the patient,&#xD;
           due to adverse effects. Even if clarithromycin is often used in first line in France and&#xD;
           is the only one macrolide with indication in its Summary of Product Characteristics, its&#xD;
           tolerance is often poor. Adult patients generally cannot tolerate clarithromycin at more&#xD;
           than 1,000 mg/day. The most common toxicities seen with clarithomycin are&#xD;
           gastro-intestinal (metallic taste, nausea, and vomiting) and it interacts with numerous&#xD;
           drugs via P450 cytochrome. Moreover, clarithromycin enhances rifabutin toxicity,&#xD;
           especially uveitis. Azithromycin toxicity is dose and serum-level related. Most adult&#xD;
           patients with MAC lung disease do not tolerate azithromycin doses of greater than 300&#xD;
           mg/day because of frequent adverse events, including gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
           (primarily diarrhea).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main hypothesis is the non-inferiority of azithromycin containing regimen efficacy&#xD;
           in comparison to clarithromycin. Moreover differences in intracellular concentration of&#xD;
           azithromycin and clarithromycin may result in differences in efficacy and safety. The&#xD;
           investigators also suggest that intracellular concentration of azithromycin or&#xD;
           clarithromycin may be correlated with microbiological success at 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
           If this study could demonstrate that azithromycin is not inferior to clarithromycin in&#xD;
           term of efficacy, azithromycin could be used in first line to improve patient tolerance&#xD;
           and adherence to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design and randomization method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CLAZI study is a multicentre, controlled open-label clinical trial studying two treatment&#xD;
      regimens containing two molecules, rifampin and ethambutol, in combination with a third&#xD;
      randomized molecule, either clarithromycin or azithromycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      41 centres located in France will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After having confirmed the presence of all inclusion criteria and the absence of all&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, and after having obtained the patient's free and informed consent, the&#xD;
      patient will be included and randomized to one of the treatment regimens. An interactive web&#xD;
      response system will be used to randomize patients using a minimization algorithm stratified&#xD;
      on centre, radiological form (nodular bronchiectatic form and fibrocavitary form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Study treatment procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion, the patients will receive the treatment as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rifampin 10 mg/kg once daily on an empty stomach (600 mg for patients weighing more than&#xD;
           50 kg, 450 mg for patients weighing less than 50 kg) at least 30 minutes before a meal,&#xD;
           in combination with ethambutol 15 to 20 mg/kg once daily and clarithromycin 1,000 mg/day&#xD;
           in two divided doses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rifampin 10 mg/kg once daily on an empty stomach (600 mg for patients weighing more than&#xD;
           50 kg, 450 mg for patients weighing less than 50 kg) at least 30 minutes before a meal,&#xD;
           in combination with ethambutol 15 to 20 mg/kg once daily and azithromycin 250 mg once&#xD;
           daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments will not be provided because they are prescribed in their indication. They will be&#xD;
      issued in the dispensary. The compliance of treatment will be evaluated for each period by&#xD;
      the investigator, from the book of compliance, given to the patient at the beginning of&#xD;
      treatment and bring each consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Study procedures: The planned inclusion period is 48 months. However, the number of&#xD;
      inclusions will be evaluated at 18 months in order to request extension of the inclusion&#xD;
      period, if necessary. Each patient will be followed for the first 12 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring will be performed throughout treatment, comprising:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring of liver function tests (transaminases, gamma GT, alkaline phosphatase,&#xD;
           bilirubin) weekly for the first two weeks, then monthly throughout treatment. Liver&#xD;
           function tests will be repeated more frequently whenever an abnormality is detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBC, clotting parameters at M1 then only in the presence of abnormal liver function&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monthly ophthalmological examination (colour vision and, if abnormal, visual field&#xD;
           examination) and an additional consultation if the patient reports any symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depending on the patient's concomitant treatment and any possible drug interactions,&#xD;
           pharmacological assays of the patient's usual medications (e.g. digoxin) left to the&#xD;
           discretion of the patient's clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram two weeks after starting treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical surveillance&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nested pharmacokinetic study will be done on 100 patients with peak serum and mononuclear&#xD;
      cells concentration of azithromycin and clarithromycin and their main metabolites (D&#xD;
      azithromycin and 14OH clarithromycin respectively). Indeed, a correlation could exist between&#xD;
      intracellular concentration and microbiological success. These dosages will be done at 1 and&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosages in hair samples will be done at M6, as it is the best reflect of macrolides use.&#xD;
      Indeed, most drugs present in the bloodstream also reach and stay in the forming hair where&#xD;
      their concentrations can be measured and interpreted as an overall chronic exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, a baseline assessment will be performed on inclusion and the same criteria&#xD;
      will then be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months in order to determine the clinical and&#xD;
      radiological outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up of the included patients will be proposed, with recording of any new&#xD;
      adverse effects emerging at the end of treatment (between 12 and 18 months), any relapses,&#xD;
      and survival at 18, 24, 36 months and, whenever possible, 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient who initially clears sputum, but then turns positive again while still on&#xD;
      therapy could be a failure of treatment or a re-infection. To distinguish between failure and&#xD;
      re-infection, genotyping will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse is defined by the presence of two positive cultures on respiratory specimens obtained&#xD;
      at least 6 months after stopping treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cure is defined by classical bacteriological criteria, i.e. 2 negative cultures during the&#xD;
      last 3 months of treatment and 3 years after stopping treatment. When specimens are not&#xD;
      obtained 3 years after stopping treatment, the definition of clinical cure will be based on&#xD;
      the absence of relapse at 3 years in survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Statistical methods: Quantitative variables will be presented as the mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation or the median [range] and qualitative variables as percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the primary point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inferiority will be established if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval of the difference in the proportion of 6-month negative sputum rate between the two&#xD;
      groups (Control arm - Experimental arm) is lower than the non-inferiority margin (10%).&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed followed by a per protocol analysis. A multiple&#xD;
      imputations analysis will be performed if more than 5% of the data are missing for the&#xD;
      primary endpoint. Farrington-Manning p-value for non-inferiority will be calculated and a&#xD;
      two-sided p-value &lt; 0.05 will be required for statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tolerance and safety will be compared between the two arms with a χ2 or Fisher exact&#xD;
           test as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical improvement will be compared with Student or Wilcoxon test and radiological&#xD;
           improvement with χ2 or Fisher exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 3, and 12-month sputum conversion rate will be compared with a χ2 or Fisher exact&#xD;
           test as appropriate and asymptotic or exact 95% confidence intervals will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-month death will be compared with χ2 or Fisher exact test and Kaplan-Meier curves&#xD;
           will be displayed graphically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum and mononuclear cells concentration of azithromycin and clarithromycin and their&#xD;
           metabolites will be compared with Student or Wilcoxon test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each arm, association between azithromycin/clarithromycin intracellular&#xD;
           concentration in circulating mononuclear cells and microbiological success at 6 month&#xD;
           will be assessed with a logistic regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each arm, association between azithromycin/clarithromycin intracellular&#xD;
           concentration in circulating mononuclear cells and tolerability of treatment will be&#xD;
           assessed with a logistic regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association between MAC species (avium, intracellulare and chimaera) and 6-month&#xD;
           conversion will be assessed with a logistic regression model with adjustment by the&#xD;
           treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the substantial number of analyses for secondary endpoints, the step-down Bonferonni&#xD;
      procedure will be used to control the type I error rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS® version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).&#xD;

    <description>Three spontaneous sputum specimens will be obtained at baseline and 6 months. If it's not possible to obtain good quality specimens, the clinician may perform three hypertonic aerosol-induced sputum specimens on 3 consecutive days. In the absence of sputum (spontaneous or induced), bronchoscopic aspiration and two post-bronchoscopy sputum specimens will be performed.&#xD;
Microscopic examination will be performed after auramine or Ziehl-Neelsen stain.&#xD;
Specimens will be cultured at 37°C after decontamination on Lowenstein-Jensen solid medium and Coletsos medium. Results will be expressed quantitatively as the number of colonies per tube according to a logarithmic scale. Culture on liquid medium will also be performed.&#xD;
