      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of PEG 3350 for use in nerve repair.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate more rapid and increased return of function by PEG-fusion compared to the best&#xD;
      current nerve repair techniques. Neurorrhaphy is not new, being performed now for over 150&#xD;
      years much research has been performed. PEG-Axon fusion on the other hand is relatively new&#xD;
      in mammals. Success has already been obtained by two institutions in the rat sciatic nerve&#xD;
      transections, demonstrating rapid return of behavioral function4. These however are very&#xD;
      controlled injuries and unclear how well these will translate into human studies. For this&#xD;
      reason 3 separate clinical studies in increasing order of complexity are proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study proposed will be PEG fusion in digital nerve lacerations. Two goals will be&#xD;
      demonstrated; improved innervation density and improved innervation threshold compared to&#xD;
      traditional repair, and complication rate similar or less than traditional repair. This will&#xD;
      demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the procedure.&#xD;
