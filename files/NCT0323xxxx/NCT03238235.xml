  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      micro-macroscopic effects on muscles, the safety and tolerability, and the efficacy of&#xD;
      givinostat in patients with Becker Muscular Dystrophy. Approximately 48 eligible patients&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to be treated with givinostat or placebo for a period of 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Givinostat or placebo oral suspension (10 mg/mL) will be administered orally as 2 oral doses&#xD;
      daily while the subject is in fed state, according to the subject's weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug should be permanently stopped if any of the following occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  severe drug-related diarrhoea;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any drug-related Serious Adverse Event (SAE);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QTcorrected by Fridericia's formulas (QTcF) &gt;500 msec;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  platelets (PLT) count ≤50 x 1.000.000.000/L (10E9/L);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  White blood cell (WBC) ≤ 2.0 x 10E9/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin (Hb) ≤ 8.0 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug should be temporarily stopped if any of the following occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PLT count &lt;75 x 10E9/L but &gt;50 x 10E9/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WBC &lt; 3.0 x 10E9/L but &gt; 2.0 x 10E9/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hb &lt; 10.0 g/dL but &gt; 8.0 g/dL;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  moderate or severe diarrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tryglicerides &gt;300 mg/dL In case the study drug was temporarily stopped, the study drug&#xD;
           can be resumed at a level 20% smaller than the dose at which the Adverse Event leading&#xD;
           to temporary stop occurred, once platelets and/or WBC and/or Hb and/or tryglicerides are&#xD;
           normalized or when diarrhoea is mild&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ambulant patients with BMD diagnosis confirmed by genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able and willing to give informed consent in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to perform 6MWT at screening with a minimum distance of 200 m and maximum&#xD;
             distance of 450 m.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If in treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or angiotensin-converting-enzyme&#xD;
             (ACE) inhibitor , and/or β or α adrenergic receptor blocker, no significant change in&#xD;
             dosage or dosing regimen (excluding changes related to body weight change) for a&#xD;
             minimum of 6 months immediately prior to start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be willing to use adequate contraception. Contraceptive methods must be&#xD;
             used from Randomization through 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Exposure to another investigational drug within 3 months prior to the start of study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Use of any pharmacologic treatment, other than corticosteroids, that might have an&#xD;
             effect on muscle strength or function within 3 months prior to the start of study&#xD;
             treatment (e.g., growth hormone). Vitamin D, calcium, and any other supplements will&#xD;
             be allowed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Presence of other clinically significant disease that in the Investigator's opinion&#xD;
             could adversely affect the safety of the patient, making it unlikely that the course&#xD;
             of treatment or follow-up is completed, or could impair the assessment of study&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A diagnosis of other neurological diseases or presence of relevant somatic disorders&#xD;
             that are not related to BMD.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Symptomatic cardiomyopathy or heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or&#xD;
             IV) or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50% at screening or with heart transplant.&#xD;

             with Gilbert's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Inadequate renal function, as defined by serum Cystatin C &gt; 2 x the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (ULN). If the value is &gt; 2 x ULN, serum Cystatin C will be repeated once, and&#xD;
             if again &gt; 2 x ULN becomes exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Baseline corrected QTcF &gt; 450 msec, (as the mean of 3 consecutive readings 5 minutes&#xD;
             apart) or history of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (e.g., heart&#xD;
             failure, hypokalemia, or family history of long QT syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Current psychiatric illness/social situations rendering the potential patient unable&#xD;
             to understand and comply with the muscle function tests and/or with the study protocol&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Hypersensitivity to the components of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Sorbitol intolerance or sorbitol malabsorption, or the hereditary form of fructose&#xD;
             intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Contraindications to muscle biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Contraindications to MRI/MRS (e.g., claustrophobia, metal implants, or seizure&#xD;
             disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Hypertrygliceridemia (&lt;1.5 per upper limit of normal)* * at screening, patient with&#xD;
             hypertrygliceridemia can be enrolled if in stable treatment and with controlled level&#xD;
             of tryglicerides (i.e. within normal range) for at least 6 months&#xD;
