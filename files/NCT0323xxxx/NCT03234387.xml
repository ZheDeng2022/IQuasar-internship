  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A great medical success is the increase in the median survival age associated with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis (CF). However, this success has led to a new era of research with the aim to&#xD;
      maximise the quality of life (QoL) of the aging CF population. Recent research has&#xD;
      demonstrated that the traditional method of determining disease progression, i.e. pulmonary&#xD;
      function, no longer adequately predict survival rates. Therefore, various bodies have&#xD;
      promoted cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), as outcomes from this test (e.g. one's&#xD;
      maximal O2 uptake [VO₂max]) are known predictors of the QoL, risk of hospitalisation and&#xD;
      prognosis of individuals with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common non-pulmonary co-morbidities of CF is CF-related diabetes (CFRD).&#xD;
      Importantly, CFRD is associated with a poorer pulmonary function compared to CF patients&#xD;
      without CFRD, and ultimately a worsened prognosis. Despite this, the influence an impaired&#xD;
      glycaemic control has upon the VO₂max derived from a CPET is unknown in CF. Therefore, the&#xD;
      present study aims to assess whether VO₂max, an established determinant of QoL, differs&#xD;
      between patients with CF with and without established CFRD as well as a group of age- and&#xD;
      gender-matched healthy control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional measures within the present study, such as: biomarkers of inflammation, redox&#xD;
      balance and nitric oxide (NO2) bioavailability, as well as functional measures of&#xD;
      microvascular endothelial function will aid our knowledge of the physiological abnormalities&#xD;
      which are a cause or consequence of CFRD. Importantly, by identifying the factors which may&#xD;
      contribute to CFRD progression and those that are viable for early intervention, mean the&#xD;
      aims and objectives of this study are compatible with the top 10 research objectives set by&#xD;
      the CF Trust.&#xD;

      Participants and recruitment The present study will be a pilot, cross-sectional trial in&#xD;
      individuals with CFRD (n = 15), as well as age- and gender-matched CF controls without&#xD;
      diabetes (n = 15) and age- and gender-matched healthy control participants (n = 15).&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from adult and paediatric CF outpatient clinics within the&#xD;
      Southampton CF network. The healthy control participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      University of Portsmouth and local area. Individuals with CF will be tested at a laboratory&#xD;
      established within the CF unit at the Southampton General Hospital and/or the Department of&#xD;
      Sport and Exercise Sciences (University of Portsmouth), depending on participant convenience.&#xD;
      All healthy control participants will attend the Department of Sport and Exercise Sciences at&#xD;
      the University of Portsmouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 During this visit, a valid informed consent and GCP trained member of the research&#xD;
      team will fully explain the information sheet and study protocol, as well as answer any&#xD;
      questions to ensure that all relevant parties are clear about the study requirements.&#xD;
      Following this, fully informed written consent will be obtained. Additionally, informed&#xD;
      written assent will be obtained from those &lt; 16 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the consent procedures the participants resting pulmonary function (forced vital&#xD;
      capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, mid force expiratory flow and peak expiratory&#xD;
      flow) and anthropometric measures (weight, height and body fat percentage) will obtained. The&#xD;
      subsequent aim of this visit is then to habituate all participants with exercising on a cycle&#xD;
      ergometer in preparation for their CPET in visit 2, in particular maintaining a certain&#xD;
      cadence at a given power output. Appropriate adjustments will be made to the ergometer seat&#xD;
      and handlebar position, and noted for visit 2. Furthermore, the protocols of obtaining ones&#xD;
      ratings of perceived exertion and dyspnoea will be fully explained. Lastly, the participant&#xD;
      will be instructed to avoid consuming mouthwash for the entirety of the study period due to&#xD;
      evidence suggesting it may influence the uptake of dietary nitrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 Participants will arrive to the laboratory at 1900 ± 2 hours. They will be instructed&#xD;
      to arrive 2 hours postprandial, having avoided caffeine for &gt; 12 hours, as well as nitrate&#xD;
      rich foods, alcohol and exhaustive exercise for &gt; 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival, CGM's will be fixed to the interior surface of the upper arm and worn for the&#xD;
      subsequent 14 days. In addition to this, hip worn accelerometers, as well as hourly specific&#xD;
      physical activity and food diaries will be distributed and completed for 14 days alongside&#xD;
      the CGM. The participants resting pulmonary function will be assessed using the spirometry&#xD;
      procedures described below, and a resting blood sample will be collected via venepuncture for&#xD;
      the analysis of plasma [NO-(₂)] and ET-1. Additionally, the cycle ergometer CPET with a&#xD;
      supramaximal (Smax) verification phase will be employed to determine ones aerobic exercise&#xD;
      function, and a second venous blood sample will be collected immediately following exercise&#xD;
      termination for the analysis of plasma [NO-(₂)] and ET-1. The total volume of blood collected&#xD;
      over this 2 hour visit will be approximately 20 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 Participants will be required to arrive to the laboratory ≥ 3 days post visit 1, at&#xD;
      0800 ± 2 hours, following an overnight fast (&gt; 10 hours). Furthermore, participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to avoid nitrate rich foods, caffeine, alcohol and exhaustive exercise for 24&#xD;
      hours prior to arrival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival participants will undergo the acetylcholine (ACh) and insulin iontophoresis&#xD;
      protocols described below, including 5 resting blood pressure measurements. Immediately&#xD;
      following this, the participant's pulmonary function will be assessed via spirometry.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to rest, and entertainment will be provided, for the following 60&#xD;
      minutes. The iontophoresis procedures will then be repeated to assess the short-term&#xD;
      test-retest variability of the iontophoresis procedures. Following this, a cannula will be&#xD;
      inserted into a vein by a trained phlebotomist, prior to the 3 hour OGTT and a baseline blood&#xD;
      sample will be taken (measuring all the below biomarkers). Venous blood samples will be drawn&#xD;
      at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes post glucose ingestion for the analysis of glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), TNF-α, soluble vascular cell adhesion&#xD;
      molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), IL-6, [NO-(₂)] and ET-1. NT, total glutathione (tGSH) and total&#xD;
      cysteine (tCys) will be analysed at 120 minutes post-glucose ingestion. The total volume of&#xD;
      blood collected over this 5 hour visit will be approximately 176 mL. Additionally, the&#xD;
      iontophoresis procedures will be repeated at 30, 90 and 150 minutes post-glucose ingestion&#xD;
      (i.e. hourly measurements of microvascular endothelial function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up CGM's, accelerometers and physical activity/food diaries will be completed for 14&#xD;
      days following visit 1. A member of the research team will collect these from the preferred&#xD;
      location of the participant.&#xD;
