    <textblock>
      A Phase 1 dose escalation study to determine if SNDX-6352 as monotherapy and SNDX-6352 in&#xD;
      combination with a fixed dose of durvalumab will be sufficiently safe and well-tolerated at&#xD;
      biologically active doses to warrant further investigation in patients with solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center Phase 1 study consisting of Phase 1a and Phase 1b. The&#xD;
      study will evaluate SNDX-6352 monotherapy (in Phase 1a) and SNDX-6352 combined with&#xD;
      durvalumab (in Phase 1b) in patients with advanced solid tumors which must have progressed&#xD;
      following prior treatment and have no standard therapy alternatives left (i.e.. patients must&#xD;
      not be candidates for regimens known to provide clinical benefit). The primary objective will&#xD;
      be to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of SNDX-6352 as monotherapy (Phase 1a) and in combination&#xD;
      with durvalumab (Phase 1b) as evaluated by the incidence of AEs that are defined as DLTs. In&#xD;
      both study phases, a standard &quot;3+3&quot;dose escalation schema will be used to determine an MTD&#xD;
      with 3-6 evaluable patients enrolled per dose level. The RP2D will be determined based on&#xD;
      data from the dose escalation patients as reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC;&#xD;
      comprised of investigators and the Sponsor).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Initially in both phases, 3 patients will receive SNDX-6352 at 1 mg/kg IV on C1D1 and again on C1D15 of a 28-day cycle. Phase 1b only will also receive a fixed dose of 1500mg durvalumab IV on C1D1. If no DLTs are noted, 3 more patients will be treated at the next higher dose level (3 mg/kg). If 1 DLT is observed in 1 of 3 patients, 3 more patients will be treated at that starting dose level (1 mg/kg). If 2 or more DLTs are observed in 3-6 patients at the starting dose, the study will be terminated or a lower dose will be considered. If the safety profile is acceptable, escalation to SNDX-6352 doses of 3, 6 and 10mg/kg are planned for the 1a and for the 1b, doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg of SNDX-6352 in combination with a fixed dose of 1500mg of durvalumab are planned. The MTD will be considered to have been exceeded if 2 or more patients in a dose group experience a DLT; in this case, the next lower dose group which has been evaluated will be considered as the MTD.</intervention_model_description>

             age-specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;

                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had&#xD;
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent&#xD;
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or&#xD;

             Non-sterilized male partners of a female patient of childbearing potential must use&#xD;
             male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after&#xD;
             this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the&#xD;
             rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control.&#xD;
             Female patients should also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period.&#xD;

             from the time of screening throughout the total duration of the study drug treatment&#xD;
             and 90 days after the last dose of study drug. However, periodic abstinence, the&#xD;
             rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
             Male patients should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period.&#xD;
