  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of a pre-arrival and pre-departure trauma checklist to optimize care has not yet been&#xD;
      studied. The Alberta Children's Hospital (ACH) Trauma Checklist was developed by the ACH&#xD;
      Resuscitation Council with input from the ACH Trauma Program. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if the introduction of the ACH Trauma Checklist as a cognitive aid, coupled with an&#xD;
      educational session, will improve clinical performance in a simulated environment. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to conduct a pilot, randomized control trial assessing the impact of the&#xD;
      ACH trauma checklist on time to critical interventions on a simulated pediatric patient by&#xD;
      multidisciplinary teams. The investigators hypothesize that teams who use a trauma checklist&#xD;
      as a cognitive aid will have faster initiation of key clinical interventions within a&#xD;
      simulated pediatric trauma resuscitation. Improvements in performance in a simulated&#xD;
      environment with this tool may translate to similar results in the clinical setting.&#xD;

      Research Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of a pre-arrival, pre-departure trauma checklist on&#xD;
      improving time to initiation of key clinical interventions in a simulated pediatric trauma&#xD;
      scenario&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of a pre-arrival, pre-departure trauma checklist on completion&#xD;
      of primary and secondary survey tasks as demonstrated by an Advanced Trauma Life Support&#xD;
      (ATLS) performance tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To evaluate the cognitive task load of a trauma checklist on emergency department&#xD;
      physicians during a simulated trauma resuscitation scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To describe patterns of eye movement of a trauma team leader in a simulated scenario&#xD;
      in relation to critical patient interventions and team communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation scenarios will be run with multidisciplinary trauma teams recruited from the&#xD;
      Alberta Children's Hospital. Each team will be comprised of a trauma team leader, second&#xD;
      physician, three registered nurses and a respiratory therapist. Confederate actors will play&#xD;
      the role of the medication nurse and respiratory therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study utilizes a prospective, randomized controlled study design. The investigators&#xD;
      propose a randomized control trial methodology with a control group representing standard&#xD;
      practice to justify the change to adopt the method amongst clinical trauma teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants recruited to partake in the study will be asked to perform as members of a&#xD;
      pediatric trauma resuscitation team. Each team of healthcare providers will be randomized&#xD;
      into one of two study arms. In the intervention arm, the participants will watch a 10-minute&#xD;
      recorded educational video demonstrating the use of the trauma checklist prior to their&#xD;
      simulation scenario. These teams will subsequently receive a copy of the checklist for use&#xD;
      during their simulation scenario. In the control arm, teams will not receive a copy of the&#xD;
      checklist for use. All simulated trauma resuscitations will be video recorded and reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All teams will be asked to participate in a standardized 20-minute trauma resuscitation&#xD;
      simulation scenario. This scenario will be followed by a 10-minute debriefing session&#xD;
      facilitated by a simulation consultant. Following the trauma resuscitation scenario, and&#xD;
      debriefing, the trauma team leader and bedside physician will be asked to complete the NASA&#xD;
      Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) survey on cognitive workload. The data collected from this survey,&#xD;
      will allow further insight into the impact on mental workload on participants with the use of&#xD;
      a cognitive aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the trauma team leader will be asked to wear an eye-tracking device during the&#xD;
      simulation scenario. Eye movements are recorded using an eye tracking system. The system&#xD;
      captures a scene view calibrated to the participant's perspective of the environment, and an&#xD;
      eye view capturing the surface anatomy of the eye (i.e. pupil, iris, sclera, eyelids). The&#xD;
      software processes eye and scene data to compute point of gaze data in the environment.&#xD;
      Eye-tracking data will be collected and analyzed for development of future studies. In&#xD;
      particular, the study investigators aim to describe patterns of eye tracking of a trauma team&#xD;
      leader during periods of critical interventions and key team member communication within a&#xD;
      simulated scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE &amp; STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot study and the investigators will use team performance as unit of&#xD;
      measure. In order to achieve a significant level of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, 12 teams per&#xD;
      group allows us to detect a large effect size (d = 1.2). A 2-sample t-test is planned to&#xD;
      detect the difference in time to initiation of key interventions between 2 groups. If the&#xD;
      data does not fall with a normal distribution, the team will use the Wilcoxon rank sum test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSSIBLE PROBLEMS &amp; ANTICIPATED SOLUTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants may have prior exposure to the trauma checklist: The Alberta Children's&#xD;
           Hospital Trauma checklist has been available for use since July 2016. Physical copies&#xD;
           are available in the trauma bay; however, the checklist was not formally introduced to&#xD;
           the department staff with specific educational initiatives, demonstrations or rounds&#xD;
           presentations. Less than 5 completed checklists have been submitted to the Trauma&#xD;
           Committee for review. The success of checklist use is influenced by implementation and&#xD;
           team culture. The investigators anticipate that participants will have minimal&#xD;
           experience with checklist use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Imprecision of outcome measurements: Defining the exact timing of initiation and&#xD;
           completion of clinical tasks by video review can be difficult and variable. The research&#xD;
           team will determine standardized definitions for video reviewers. All video reviewers&#xD;
           will undergo an hour long training session and assessment of their inter-rater&#xD;
           reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Variability within the simulation scenario: A standardized simulation lab will be&#xD;
           prepared. All simulations will be run by a study co-investigator and study coordinator.&#xD;
           Confederate actors will undergo specific training and have tightly scripted roles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality and Privacy Protection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed and written consent to participate in this research study will be obtained from each&#xD;
      team member before the start of each simulation scenario. All data will be stored on a&#xD;
      password protected computer within a secured server that can only be accessed by research&#xD;
      team members. Data will be destroyed after completion of the study.&#xD;

There are 3 specific areas of interest: the patient, the monitor, and the external environment. The frequency of which eye movements rest on those areas will be tracked. This will be reported as a total duration of time (in minutes) spent looking at each of the 3 areas of interest.</description>
