  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to studies, approximately 20% of children having contact with child protection&#xD;
      services have conduct disorder. Negative parenting can make this problem even worse. Research&#xD;
      has shown Incredible Years Program to be one of the most effective programs to prevent and&#xD;
      reduce child conduct problems. This study is an randomized controlled trial, which evaluates&#xD;
      the suitability and effectiveness of group-based Incredible Years program in child protection&#xD;
      and family support services. The aim of this study is to find out whether this intervention&#xD;
      reduces children's psychiatric symptoms, especially conduct symptoms, increases positive&#xD;
      parenting and positive interaction between parents and children, and reduces children's and&#xD;
      parent's stress and increase well-being. The study will be carried out in 2015-2018. Overall&#xD;
      101 children and 120 parents participate in the study.&#xD;

      1. Introduction Parenting skills and home environment play a major role in children's&#xD;
           development and safety, especially in early childhood. Studies have shown that&#xD;
           maltreating parents have poor child management techniques, high levels of hostile&#xD;
           feelings, reduced emotional responsiveness and escalated verbal aggression. It is&#xD;
           apparent that large number of parents receiving child protection services are engaged in&#xD;
           parental behaviors that do not decrease child's problems, but instead may be harmful to&#xD;
           their children. Since over 80 000 of the children receiving support from child&#xD;
           protection services in Finland remain in their homes, the need of effective methods to&#xD;
           support parenting is evident.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several randomized trials have shown that parent management training programs, which are&#xD;
           based primarily on social learning theory, cognitive-behavioral theory, and attachment&#xD;
           theory, effectively improve parenting skills, parents' mental health and child conduct&#xD;
           problems. These programs build on social learning theory according to which parents&#xD;
           model the appropriate behavior to their children. Behavioristic principles, however,&#xD;
           include methods of prompting children's positive behavior. Ideas based on cognitive&#xD;
           theory help parents change their conceptions of the child and his/her problematic&#xD;
           behavior and coaches them to use problem solving and anger management skills. The basis&#xD;
           of attachment theory is that when a sensitive and safe attachment has developed between&#xD;
           the child and the caretaker, it helps a child feel safe and builds his/her positive&#xD;
           perception of different situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Incredible Years Parent Training Program(IY) is one of the most researched programs and&#xD;
           has been found to be effective in different countries and contexts, for example among&#xD;
           high-risk, disadvantaged, and maltreating families and also among foster carers .&#xD;
           However, only a few studies have been made in the context of child protection services&#xD;
           or with maltreated children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The IY program is group-based, focuses on building support networks and decreasing&#xD;
           isolation, and has a format designed to reduce stigma, and increase parental&#xD;
           participation and engagement. It emphasizes individual goal-setting and a&#xD;
           self-reflective learning style, as well as intensive behavior practice and rehearsal&#xD;
           methods with other parents and a positive, collaborative relationship between group&#xD;
           leaders and parents. For the previous reasons it may be particularly relevant to&#xD;
           families with child protection services contact and should be thoroughly researched.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main study question is:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Does the group based, intensive Incredible Years Parent Management Training reduce&#xD;
           children's (age 3-7) (sub)clinically significant behavioral problems?&#xD;
&#xD;
           The other study questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Does Incredible Years Parent Management Training&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  increase positive parenting?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  increase positive interaction between parents and children?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  reduce children's (age 3-7) other psychiatric symptoms?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  reduce children's and parent's stress?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  increase parent's well-being?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design Randomized controlled trial design will be used (RCT). Participants are 3-7&#xD;
           year old children (index children, n=101) with behavioral problems and their parents who&#xD;
           are currently clients of child protection services, other special support services for&#xD;
           families or families who are clients of family centers or need support just for their&#xD;
           parenting. Parents and children were randomized before the baseline measurements to the&#xD;
           intervention group or treatment as usual / waiting list condition. The intervention&#xD;
           program is Incredible Years Parent Training (Preschool Basic), with 20 parent group&#xD;
           meetings, including 4 home visits. Children themselves do not participate in any&#xD;
           intervention. Based on earlier studies the intervention effects of parent management&#xD;
           training is mediated by changed parenting practices towards children. The measuring&#xD;
           points are pre, post and 1 year. The study will be carried out in 2015-2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention Participants will attend the Incredible Years Parent Training Program,&#xD;
           Preschool Basic version, with 18-20 group meetings. The program is based mainly on&#xD;
           cognitive-behavioral and social learning theories.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The goal of the group is to enhance and support parenting skills, increase knowledge of&#xD;
           child development, improve child's positive behavior and parent-child interaction.&#xD;
           Parents are taught to use more positive and consistent strategies in reducing child&#xD;
           misbehavior by watching dvd's, rehearsing and group discussions. Groups consist of 10-12&#xD;
           parents and they get together weekly for app. 2-2,5 hours at a time. Four home visits&#xD;
           are added to the program to support parents in practicing new skills and to provide&#xD;
           individual practical consultation. Also weekly phone calls are being made to the&#xD;
           parents, as part of normal procedure of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Parents will be interviewed before starting the intervention to explain it fully.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention groups will start in fall 2016 or beginning of 2017. In each group&#xD;
           there will be three trained group leaders, of which two are from family counselling&#xD;
           services and one a family worker from child protection services, who also conducts&#xD;
           family visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Program fidelity The group leaders will receive supervision from certified peer coach&#xD;
           every three weeks and once from a mentor during the duration of the groups. Group&#xD;
           leaders will fill out check lists and self-evaluations after every group meeting. Also&#xD;
           evaluations from parents after every group meeting will be gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents and children are participating voluntarily in the research. Participants of the&#xD;
      intervention group are given concrete information and training about positive parenting&#xD;
      methods in a supportive and positive peer group by trained leaders. The participants of the&#xD;
      control group can access all the other services and support they are entitled to, other than&#xD;
      the intervention program being researched. The restrain and discomfort caused to participants&#xD;
      can be considered minor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families participating the study have been interviewed and their willingness to participate&#xD;
      have been asked beforehand. The group leaders of the intervention will interview the&#xD;
      participants of the intervention group and tell about the intervention. The participants of&#xD;
      the control group have a possibility access the next available parent group in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents participating the research have at any time a right to withdraw from the research.&#xD;
      Confidentiality will be taken care of.&#xD;
