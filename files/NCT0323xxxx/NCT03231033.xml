    <textblock>
      Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a syndrome of surfactant accumulation, respiratory&#xD;
      failure, and innate immune deficiency for which therapy remains limited to whole lung lavage&#xD;
      (WLL), an invasive physical procedure to remove surfactant unavailable at most medical&#xD;
      centers. While PAP occurs in multiple diseases affecting men, women, and children of all ages&#xD;
      and ethnic origins, in 85% of patients, it occurs as an idiopathic disease associated with&#xD;
      neutralizing GM-CSF autoantibodies. Basic science and translational research has shown that&#xD;
      idiopathic PAP is an autoimmune disease in which disruption of GM-CSF signaling impairs the&#xD;
      ability of alveolar macrophages to clear surfactant and perform host defense functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been shown that cholesterol toxicity drives pathogenesis in alveolar&#xD;
      macrophages from GM-CSF deficient (Csf2-/-) mice and patients with autoimmune PAP. Loss of&#xD;
      GM-CSF signaling reduces PU.1/CEBP-mediated expression of PPARγ and its downstream target&#xD;
      ABCG1 (a cholesterol exporter important in macrophages). The cell responds by esterifying and&#xD;
      storing cholesterol in vesicles to reduce toxicity. Eventually, vesicles fill the cell,&#xD;
      impair intracellular transport and reduce uptake and clearance of surfactant from the lung&#xD;
      surface resulting in disease manifestations. Recent data indicates that pioglitazone, a PPARγ&#xD;
      agonist currently approved by the FDA for human use, increases cholesterol/surfactant&#xD;
      clearance by alveolar macrophages from autoimmune PAP patients and Csf2-/- mice. Importantly,&#xD;
      pioglitazone significantly reduced the severity of PAP lung disease in Csf2-/- mice after&#xD;
      several months of therapy. Together, these observations suggest pioglitazone could be&#xD;
      'repurposed' as pharmacologic therapy for PAP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAP is a rare syndrome of surfactant accumulation and resulting hypoxemic respiratory failure&#xD;
      that occurs in multiple diseases that can be classified on the basis of pathogenesis into&#xD;
      three groups: primary PAP (caused by disruption of GM-CSF signaling - autoimmune PAP,&#xD;
      hereditary PAP), secondary PAP (caused by reduction in alveolar macrophage numbers and/or&#xD;
      functions), and metabolic disorders of surfactant production-related PAP (caused by mutations&#xD;
      in genes required for normal surfactant production). Blood tests are capable of identifying&#xD;
      the PAP-causing disease in about 95% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has demonstrated that aPAP is caused by a high level of GM-CSF autoantibodies, which&#xD;
      block GM-CSF signaling. Normally, alveolar macrophages clear (remove) about half of the used&#xD;
      surfactant from air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. Without GM-CSF, alveolar macrophages have a&#xD;
      reduced ability to clear surfactant, which builds up in the alveoli and the blocks delivery&#xD;
      of oxygen into the blood, resulting in a low blood oxygen level and a reduced oxygen delivery&#xD;
      to tissues of the body. This macrophage defect is thought to occur because loss of GM-CSF&#xD;
      stimulation causes reduced activity of PPAR-gamma, a molecule present within alveolar&#xD;
      macrophages that they require to simulate the ability to clear surfactant: the reduction in&#xD;
      PPAR-gamma activity cause a functional impairment of surfactant clearance by alveolar&#xD;
      macrophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no pharmacologic agent has been FDA-approved as therapy aPAP: it is currently&#xD;
      treated by whole lung lavage, a procedure requiring general anesthesia and a breathing&#xD;
      machine the lungs are individually filled with saline and drained repeatedly to physically&#xD;
      remove the excess surfactant. Recent research has shown that pioglitazone, a drug that&#xD;
      activates PPAR-gamma, is able to increase the ability of cultured macrophages to clear&#xD;
      surfactant in the laboratory and that oral administration is able to reduce lung disease&#xD;
      severity and be well-tolerated in a mouse model of aPAP. Currently, pioglitazone is approved&#xD;
      by the FDA for treatment of increased blood sugar in patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot phase I/II human clinical trial of oral pioglitazone as therapy for&#xD;
      autoimmune PAP. The target population is adults with aPAP who have measurable, clinically&#xD;
      significant disease satisfying all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study design&#xD;
      will involve recruitment, screening, and enrollment of participants into a phase I,&#xD;
      open-label, dose-escalating, single site study. Oral pioglitazone will be administered to&#xD;
      autoimmune PAP patients with a personalized dose escalation plan beginning at 15 mg per day,&#xD;
      advancing to 30 mg per day and then 45 mg per day, if tolerated, in 12 week increments.&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and pharmacodynamics (PD) parameters will be&#xD;
      evaluated. The experimental approach will evaluate 1) safety of oral pioglitazone by&#xD;
      documenting occurrence of treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs, 2) physiological effects of oral&#xD;
      pioglitazone by measuring changes in the physiological, clinical, and quality of life&#xD;
      parameters and 3) biochemical effects of pioglitazone on the transcriptome, phenotype, and&#xD;
      function of mononuclear phagocytes (alveolar macrophages and monocytes) from autoimmune PAP&#xD;
      patients. Anticipated results will determine the safety, efficacy, and biochemical effects of&#xD;
      oral pioglitazone in patients with autoimmune PAP. These results will impact the field by 1)&#xD;
      monitoring safety of oral pioglitazone in autoimmune PAP patients, 2) translating existing&#xD;
      preclinical data in humans, and 3) demonstrating the results of pioglitazone in a&#xD;
      personalized treatment plan with dose escalation in a pilot trial to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      oral pioglitazone for aPAP.&#xD;
