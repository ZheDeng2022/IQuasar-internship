      1. BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tumor-host interaction includes inactivation of immunologic recognition of malignant&#xD;
           cells by a mechanism yet not fully understood. Aneuplodity studies on cells from&#xD;
           different metastatic sites demonstrate increased heterogeneity depending on metastatic&#xD;
           site (Kimball 1997). This suggests that phenotypically different cell populations are&#xD;
           responsible for different metastases and may demonstrate different&#xD;
           sensitivity/resistance to treatment. Kitayama (2015) studied ratio of lymphocytes to&#xD;
           epithelial cell in peritoneal cavity, but used this ratio only as marker of tumor burden&#xD;
           and did not relate it to perioperative outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators have clinically observed a different behavior of peritoneal metastases as&#xD;
           compared to those located in other body sites (Franko 2012, Klaver 2012, Franko 2016).&#xD;
           It is hypothesized that tumor-host interaction and host-treatment response are related&#xD;
           to treatment-related morbidity, early vs. delayed recurrence, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is a limited literature and research examining the immunologic profile of&#xD;
           intraperitoneal chemotherapy and its relationship to morbidity and future metastatic&#xD;
           sites. Therefore, further knowledge of the biology of different peritoneal surface&#xD;
           metastatic disease is necessary. This, with additional research, may lead to specific&#xD;
           therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To ascertain immunologic profile of peritoneal cavity and its relationship to immediate&#xD;
           postsurgical outcome (morbidity or the treatment) and long-term outcome (time to&#xD;
           recurrence and survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis undergoing intraperitoneal chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Exclusion criteria: Under age of 18 years, pregnant patients, those unable to&#xD;
           provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. SUBJECT RECRUITMENT METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients scheduled to undergo cytoreductive procedure for peritoneal carcinomatosis&#xD;
           in at Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines, IA (MMC). This study will be offered during a&#xD;
           preoperative office or a hospital visit by Dr Franko or Dr Goldman.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. INFORMED CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Attached&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. RESEARCH PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Liquid samples will be collected and analyzed. We will collect ascites, peritoneal&#xD;
           washout, HIPEC perfusion fluid. Samples will be analyzed using flow cytometry, routine&#xD;
           fluid cytology, and tested for anti-microbial properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.1 Sample labeling:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following peritoneal fluid sample will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A - ascites or peritoneal saline washout at the beginning of case B - HIPEC fluid after&#xD;
           pre-heating and immediately before chemotherapy agent provision C, D, E - HIPEC fluid at&#xD;
           30, 60, and 90 minutes of perfusion 6.2 Flow cytometry Fluid samples will be run through&#xD;
           flow cytometry to analyze proportion of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD34 positive cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.3 Cytology Routine cytology of peritoneal fluid represents standard of care for&#xD;
           malignant disease diagnostics and will be conducted as per usual diagnostic plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.4 Detection of anti-microbial properties Fluid samples will be introduced to bacterial&#xD;
           growth in the microbiology laboratory at MMC. Growth inhibition of standard bacterial&#xD;
           strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli) will be recorded. The samples will&#xD;
           also be sent for flow cytology and possibly chromatography to measure exact&#xD;
           concentrations of chemotherapeutic agent remaining in samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.5 High-performance liquid chromatography A limited number of samples will be analyzed&#xD;
           with high performance liquid chromatography to determine exact chemotherapy&#xD;
           concentration remaining in sample (den Hartigh 1981). This part of the research is&#xD;
           conducted in collaboration with Dr. Brian Gentry at Drake University. Sample provided&#xD;
           for this part of research will be deidentified, date-time-stamped, and Drake's team will&#xD;
           receive no other clinical or demographic information. Re-identification at MMC remains&#xD;
           possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To satisfy methodological needs, we will collect each case will provide 2 samples:&#xD;
           Sample B will be a HIPEC perfusate solution at the completion of initial heating up&#xD;
           period collected before adding chemotherapy agent. Sample E will be perfusate at the&#xD;
           completion of HIPEC procedure expected to contain MMC. Sample E is the main research&#xD;
           sample. Sample volume is 5 cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample B is obtained before active treatment agent is provided to the solution. It&#xD;
           represents a small withdrawal volume of 5 cc out of approximately 3-5 liter HIPEC&#xD;
           solution used in usual case. Average clinical dosing of carrier solution is 2 liters/m2&#xD;
           of patient's body surface area, therefore representing &lt; 0.2% total HIPEC carrier&#xD;
           solution volume. Sample C &amp; D represent the same volume, but are withdrawn from patient&#xD;
           with active treatment. Given very small volume of each sample no negative effect is&#xD;
           expected, as total sample volume is &lt;0.6% total HIPEC perfusion fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All other research samples are derived only from residual surgical specimen exclusively&#xD;
           obtained for treatment purposes. Data collection will include, but is not limited to,&#xD;
           patient name, gender, age, initial tumor stage, current tumor stage &amp; extent, histology,&#xD;
           prior treatment modalities, and results from flow cytometry, microbiology, and HPLC, and&#xD;
           medical record for 60 months following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. POTENTIAL RISKS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1 Risks related to sampling: Some body fluid samples are collected on residual&#xD;
           surgical specimens removed from patient for treatment purpose (samples A and E), and are&#xD;
           independent of research. The exception are Sample B,C,D - the only samples removed from&#xD;
           patient for research purpose only. The volume of each sample is minute, &lt; 0.2% of total&#xD;
           perfusate volume; therefore total sampling volume in â‰¤0.6% expected perfusate volume.&#xD;
           Given these two facts it is reasonable to assume no expected influence on patients'&#xD;
           outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2 Risks related to loss of confidentiality Because identifiable data are collected&#xD;
           there is a potential risk of breach of confidentiality. To protect confidentiality and&#xD;
           minimize risk, research data will be maintained on MMC computers with access restricted&#xD;
           to the core research team and password-protected file. Privacy laws will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. RESEARCH MATERIALS, RECORDS, AND PRIVACY:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research database will be maintained on MMC computers with privileged access restricted&#xD;
           to the core research team and password-protected file. Privacy laws will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. CONFIDENTIALITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No research specimen will be stored. All research specimens will be destroyed in accordance&#xD;
      with usual laboratory procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic data will be maintained until the last analysis is carried out. Access to the data&#xD;
      will be limited to authorized personnel associated with this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples provided to Drake University are deidentified and cannot be re-identified by&#xD;
      Drake University team. Therefore no confidentiality loss there is expected.&#xD;
