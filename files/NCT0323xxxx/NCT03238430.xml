  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analgesia in liver surgery is a challenge, postoperative coagulopathy risk raises fears an&#xD;
      epidural haematoma formation following the epidural analgesia, &quot;gold standard&quot; in major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery. The spinal analgesia and/or continuous wound infiltration of local&#xD;
      anesthetics constitute so an alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare the continuous infiltration of local anesthetics and rachianalgesia in&#xD;
      terms of decreased postoperative morphine consumption and incidences of chronic postoperative&#xD;
      pain at 3 and 6 months after hepatic surgery compared to the control group.&#xD;
