  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of new media technologies has made these an indispensible part of human life.&#xD;
      Increasing cell phone use is to a large extent a component of this development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects on humans of electromagnetic waves (EMW) has been a subject of particular&#xD;
      interest and concern in recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell phone technology; With the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Bluetooth and Digital&#xD;
      Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), cell phones have become one of the most commonly&#xD;
      used sources of EMW to which humans are today exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerns over the effects of EMW (at a range of 900-1800 MHz) cell phone receivers may be&#xD;
      associated with carcinogenic and neuronal activity. Excessive use of cell phones is known to&#xD;
      cause headache, a feeling of discomfort and a warm sensation around the ear. In addition, it&#xD;
      is thought to have side-effects including memory loss, depression and adverse impacts on&#xD;
      attention and concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention is defined as the individual directing his mental receptors toward a stimulus or&#xD;
      stimuli occurring in the phenomenal environment, of which he is aware and which he can&#xD;
      perceive with his sense organs. Attention is also a nervous system function permitting the&#xD;
      individual to concern himself solely with stimuli in the context of needs and aims at that&#xD;
      moment from among the many stimuli in the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the significant features of attention is that it is selective. There are many stimuli&#xD;
      around us potentially capable of attracting our attention. Since it is impossible to focus on&#xD;
      all of these, one must be able to select the important ones. Selective attention refers to&#xD;
      the ignoring of other stimuli by identifying the important one and directing one's attention&#xD;
      to a specific stimulus. In other words, it means reacting only to relevant stimuli, not to&#xD;
      irrelevant ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency care means the prompt provision of the medical care required by an individual with&#xD;
      a life-threatening condition. Emergency departments are units that provide this service for&#xD;
      patients requiring emergency care. Emergency departments are places in which health personnel&#xD;
      are in a constant state of activity and have to provide constant services at an intense work&#xD;
      rate. Personnel such as emergency medicine specialists and emergency medicine assistant&#xD;
      physicians or other specialist physicians and practitioners, nurses, health administrators,&#xD;
      emergency medicine technicians and ancillary staff work in emergency departments. Emergency&#xD;
      department personnel are exposed to very significant stress factors, such as taking immediate&#xD;
      and vitally important decisions, an intense work rate, long shifts, insufficient rest time,&#xD;
      and the need to cope with rude and aggressive patients and relatives. These stress factors&#xD;
      are estimated to affect health workers' attention levels, decision-making abilities and&#xD;
      concentration. Factors such as inattention and memory errors that compromise that compromise&#xD;
      the individual's concentration are reported to pay an important role in medical errors in&#xD;
      emergency departments. The importance of attention and concentration is obvious in emergency&#xD;
      departments, where vital decisions are made concurrently, and where medical procedures must&#xD;
      be performed to perfection and in a race against time. Combatting factors that have a&#xD;
      negative impact on this is highly important. The hypothesis that cell phones and&#xD;
      electromagnetic fields may have an effect on this attention and concentration constituted the&#xD;
      basis of the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell phone use among emergency department physicians is widespread, as in all other fields.&#xD;
      Cell phone use is particularly important for requesting consultations in patient management&#xD;
      in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the acute effects on emergency physicians'&#xD;
      attention and concentration of EMWs emitted by cell phones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, emergency department physicians were asked to complete an&#xD;
      assessment form in order to determine the inclusion and exclusion criteria (App-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators were planned to enroll 30 emergency physicians on the basis of the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An internet-based power analysis program was used to calculate the sample size (UCSF&#xD;
      Biostatistics:Power and sample size programs.&#xD;
      http://www.biostat.ucsf.edu/sampsize.html#G*Power.) According to a preliminary study the&#xD;
      investigators were performed before EMW exposure, emergency physicians' mean attention level&#xD;
      was determined at 75. The sample size was calculated predicting a 50% decrease with EMW&#xD;
      exposure. The investigators were therefore targeted 30 participants, 15 in each group, for&#xD;
      80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators were planned to apply the d2 test of attention, which is widely recognized&#xD;
      in the literature, to assess attention and concentration before the study, to all the&#xD;
      physicians enrolled. Based on TN-E scores in the d2 test of attention, the participants were&#xD;
      listed in order of highest score to lowest. Following that procedure, two-way randomization&#xD;
      was applied and two groups (experimental and control) with similar initial attention level&#xD;
      were established using the head-tail method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: The investigators were planned that all participants in this group would&#xD;
      hold a cell phone to their left ears in their left hands, in 'on' mode, for 15 min, and that&#xD;
      they would thus be exposed to a 900-1800 MHz magnetic field (EMW) for 15 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: these would hold a cell phone to their left ears in their left hands for 15&#xD;
      min in 'off' mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, The investigators were planned that the cell phone screen would be&#xD;
      covered with black tape, and that all participants and the author performing subsequent&#xD;
      attention evaluations would be unaware whether the cell phone was 'on' or 'off'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this 15-min procedure, The investigators were planned that the d2 test of attention&#xD;
      would be administered to both groups by a specialist psychologist in a blinded manner, and&#xD;
      planned to compare attention and concentration levels between the experimental group exposed&#xD;
      to EMW via cell phone and the non-exposed control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d2 test of attention: A time-dependent test measuring selective attention and concentration.&#xD;
      Other parameters measured are speed of performance, rule compliance and performance quality.&#xD;
      The test can be administered individually or in groups between the ages of 9 and 60. The test&#xD;
      form contains 14 rows with 47 figures in each. The letters 'd' and 'p' are used in the test.&#xD;
      Up to four marks are placed above, below or both above and below some letters. There are 16&#xD;
      total possible forms, depending on the marks on the letters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The task of the person administered the test is to find all the letters 'd' with two marks.&#xD;
      The subject is allowed 20 seconds to complete the task set out in each row and is asked to&#xD;
      find all the letters 'd' with two marks. The test takes approximately 8 min to administer.&#xD;
      Evaluation of the test is based on TN: Total number of symbols marked (psycho-motor speed),&#xD;
      E1: Number of symbols skipped without being marked (selective attention), E2: Number of&#xD;
      symbols marked incorrectly (special learning difficulty), E: Focusing level, CP: Total number&#xD;
      of correct marks , TN-E: Total number of items minus error score (test performance), FR: The&#xD;
      difference between the maximum and minimum numbers of items processed (distractibility) and&#xD;
      PR: TN-E score percentile rank percentage score .&#xD;
