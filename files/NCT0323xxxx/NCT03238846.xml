    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two strategies for multi-month dispensing&#xD;
      (MMD) of ART in Community ART Refill Groups (CARGs) on retention, virologic suppression, and&#xD;
      cost compared to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a three-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted among 5,760 stable&#xD;
      HIV-positive patients) in Zimbabwe to compare outcomes of three antiretroviral therapy (ART)&#xD;
      dispensing models. Outcomes of retention in care, virologic suppression, and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness will be investigated in 30 purposively selected clusters (facilities) which are&#xD;
      randomized into three arms; standard of care (3 months dispensing at facilities), three-month&#xD;
      dispensing in CARGs, and six-month dispensing in CARGs. Each study arm will have 10 clusters&#xD;
      stratified into 2 urban and 8 rural. Study participants will be followed, and outcomes will&#xD;
      be measured at 12 months and 24 months. Qualitative research will be conducted at baseline,&#xD;
      12 months, and 24 months (20 participant Focus Group Discussion (FGDs) and 20 provider Key&#xD;
      Informant Interview (KII) at each interval) to understand patient and health provider&#xD;
      acceptability of multi-month dispensing of ART within CARGs. Other outcomes of interest&#xD;
      include measuring gains of facility decongestion and feasibility of multi-month dispensing of&#xD;
      ART within CARGs. Cost analysis will include comparisons of patient level costs, cost per&#xD;
      patient outcomes and cost effectiveness across the three study arms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a cluster (facility) randomized trial with 3 arms; patients receiving 3&#xD;
      monthly ART supply at facilities-standard of care (3MF) (Control group), patients receiving 3&#xD;
      monthly ART supply at newly formed CARGs (3MC) and patients receiving 6 monthly ART supply at&#xD;
      newly formed CARGs (6MC). Participants will be followed up for 24 months. A total of 30 study&#xD;
      clusters (facilities) will be randomization, into the three study arms; 10 clusters per arm&#xD;
      stratified 2 urban, 8 rural.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting and study population The study population is HIV-infected adults over the age&#xD;
      of 18 years recruited from health facilities in U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS&#xD;
      Relief (PEPFAR) Zimbabwe scale-up districts (using existing national records of patients in&#xD;
      the ART registers) that have been stable on a standard first-line ART treatment regimen for&#xD;
      at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilities from Chitungwiza Municipality, Matebeleland South Province, Masvingo Province and&#xD;
      Mberengwa district will be purposively selected to be the urban/periurban and rural settings&#xD;
      in the study. These areas were selected as they have PEPFAR Zimbabwe scale-up priority&#xD;
      facilities, high numbers of patients on ART and have prioritized implementation of CARGs.&#xD;
      These locations are also viewed to be good representations of PEPFAR Zimbabwe scale-up&#xD;
      priority facilities, hence are likely to improve the generalizability of the study findings&#xD;
      to the study population. As contexts differ between rural and urban/periurban settings, it is&#xD;
      important to determine the effectiveness of MMD within CARGs within both contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling and Sample size Sample sizes were determined for a cluster-randomized noninferiority&#xD;
      trial, using PASS v.14 (TM) software. Sample size estimates were calculated for the primary&#xD;
      outcome of retention in care at 12 months. The probability of patient attrition twelve months&#xD;
      after study enrolment in the control group (3MF) is assumed to be 5%, derived from the&#xD;
      relative difference in patient retention between 12 and 24 months from the 2015 Zimbabwe&#xD;
      UNAIDS Global AIDS Response progress report. An intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of&#xD;
      0.01 for patient retention/attrition amongst stable ART patients is assumed. The&#xD;
      noninferiority limit is specified as 3.25%. Assuming Î±=0.05, power of 85%, using one-sided&#xD;
      Z-test (unpooled) test statistic, 182 participants per facility will be required with a total&#xD;
      sample size of 5460 participants. A sample size re-estimation during accrual will increase&#xD;
      the total sample size to approximately 5760; 192 enrolled participants per study site and&#xD;
      1,920 participants per arm. As retention in care is the primary outcome, no adjustment for&#xD;
      loss to follow-up needs to be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures As this is operational research, the study will not interfere with routine&#xD;
      patient management and will follow national guidelines. The health care worker assesses each&#xD;
      patient's clinical notes to establish stability and study inclusion. Once informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained, a baseline questionnaire will be applied to record demographic characteristics and&#xD;
      the patients clinical and ART history. Patients will receive care based on their study ARM&#xD;
      and relevant SOP. Patient files and CARG tools will be reviewed and data collected at each&#xD;
      ART refill. Viral loads will be repeated annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection The study will use both qualitative and quantitative methods. The data&#xD;
      sources will include patient clinic notes, electronic patient management system (ePMS), CARG&#xD;
      monitoring data collection tools. In addition, variables to control for confounding in the&#xD;
      analysis for outcomes of interest will be collected at baseline through a short&#xD;
      cross-sectional survey. A pre-and-24-month post survey time-flow evaluation of patient&#xD;
      waiting times to assess gains of facility decongestion will be conducted. Feasibility of MMD&#xD;
      of ART within CARGs will be measured prospectively at baseline, 12 and 24 months. To&#xD;
      understand the acceptability of CARGs by patients and service providers; patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, and improvement in quality of care at the facilities, 20 patient FGDs and 20&#xD;
      heath care provider KII will be conducted at baseline, 12 and 24 months. A micro-costing&#xD;
      approach supplemented by a macro-costing approach of fixed costs will be utilized to measure&#xD;
      cost outcomes. A resource use form will collect information per patient through retrospective&#xD;
      review of clinic records. Start up costs will be included under each arm. Data to assess&#xD;
      patient level costs will be collected from a randomly selected sub-sample of 365 patients per&#xD;
      arm at baseline, 12 months and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Quantitative data will be analyzed using STATA 14. An intention-to-treat&#xD;
      analysis will be performed for the primary outcome of retention in care, in which all&#xD;
      patients and clinics will be analyzed in the group to which they were originally assigned.&#xD;
      Risk differences between arms will be compared with binomial population averaged generalized&#xD;
      estimating equations using an identity link and an exchangeable correlation matrix,&#xD;
      specifying for clustering by facility. Viral load suppression analyzed using log-binomial&#xD;
      regression, generalized estimating equations will be used to estimate risk ratios between the&#xD;
      study arms, specifying for clustering by facility and using an exchangeable correlation&#xD;
      matrix. Average patient waiting times will be compared between study arms using linear&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content qualitative analysis will be conducted using Atlas Ti, A cost outcomes analysis will&#xD;
      be conducted from the provider perspective. Average cost per yield rates (cost per client&#xD;
      retained in care, cost per client virally suppressed, cost per patient per year) will be&#xD;
      calculated. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the will be calculated; ICER&#xD;
      threshold comparison as recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO) will be employed.&#xD;
      Average patient costs will be from the patient's perspective. Startup costs for each service&#xD;
      delivery model will also be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS / BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS There may be no direct benefit to participants who take part&#xD;
      in this study, beyond benefits related to their routine ART medication that would have been&#xD;
      achieved otherwise. Information learned in this study may be of benefit to participants and&#xD;
      others in the future, particularly information that may lead to optimized treatment&#xD;
      guidelines for HIV-infected stable patients on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is operational research, study procedures are routine clinical care associated with&#xD;
      minimal risk to participants. All patients will attend routine clinic visits to be assessed&#xD;
      for new Opportunistic infections (OIs), pregnancy, drug-drug interactions or side effects of&#xD;
      medications. This will ensure that patients who develop co-morbidities or become pregnant&#xD;
      during the study receive standard care, although they will not be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REIMBURSEMENTS AND COMPENSATION As participants of FGDs may use transport money to the&#xD;
      discussion venue, this will be reimbursed. Those who are part of a FGD will receive snacks&#xD;
      after the discussion. CARGs will receive a bag to carry drugs from the clinic back to their&#xD;
      communities. This will be made clear to all study participants during the informed consent&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY ASSURANCES Participant information will not be released without written&#xD;
      permission to do so except as necessary for review, monitoring, and/or auditing. All&#xD;
      study-related information will be stored securely. Participant research records will be&#xD;
      stored in locked areas with access limited to study staff. case record files (CRFs), and&#xD;
      other documents that may be transmitted off-site will be identified by patient identifier&#xD;
      only. Likewise, communications between study staff and the investigators regarding individual&#xD;
      participants will identify participants by patient identifier only. The patient identifier&#xD;
      will be an anonymized key to identify unique subjects and will be used for data pooling,&#xD;
      transfer, storage, manipulation and analysis. Personal identifying data will not be available&#xD;
      to the investigators. Study sites will store study records that bear participant names or&#xD;
      other personal identifiers separately from records identified by patient identifier. Lists,&#xD;
      logbooks, appointment books, and any other documents that link the patient identifier to&#xD;
      personal identifying information at the facilities should be stored in a separate, locked&#xD;
      location in an area with limited access. Electronic data will be stored on password secured&#xD;
      servers, which will be backed-up on a regular basis. Data will be presented in aggregate form&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
