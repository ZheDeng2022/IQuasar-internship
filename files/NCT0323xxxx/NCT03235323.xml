  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is prevalent worldwide and the leading cause of mortality of&#xD;
      citizens. Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)is one of the major revascularization&#xD;
      procedures for multi-vessel disease nowadays. However vein graft failures (VGF) are known to&#xD;
      occur frequently following CABG surgery . It is estimated that VGF developed in 25% patients&#xD;
      in half a year postoperatively, and up to 50% vein grafts would result in occlusion in ten&#xD;
      years postoperatively. Surgical success depends on the continued patency of grafts, and VGF&#xD;
      has been associated with worse outcomes in CABG patients. Thus prevention of VGF following&#xD;
      CABG is an active area of scientific inquiry. External counter pulsation (ECP) is a&#xD;
      non-invasive method which consists of three sets of pneumatic cuffs attached to each of the&#xD;
      patient's legs at the calf and lower and upper thigh. The inflation of the cuffs is triggered&#xD;
      by a computer, and timing of the inflation is based on the R wave of the electrocardiogram.&#xD;
      The ECP therapist adjusts the inflation and deflation timing to provide optimal blood&#xD;
      movement per a finger plethysmogram waveform reading. This produces a retrograde flow of&#xD;
      blood in the aorta resulting in a diastolic augmentation of blood flow and also an increase&#xD;
      in venous return, which leads to an improved coronary perfusion pressure during diastole.ECP&#xD;
      has been elucidated that it may release angina symptoms and improve the prognosis of CAD,&#xD;
      however, it remained unknown that weather EECP can reduce VGF rates following CABG surgery.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of ECP on heart function of CABG patients and&#xD;
      VGF rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this investigation, patients underwent CABG with at least one vein graft are&#xD;
      enrolled and randomize them into control or ECP group, the ECP intervention will be carried&#xD;
      out with a standard protocol which involves 35 one-hour sessions (5 days a week) for&#xD;
      continuous 7 weeks, and the follow-up will last for 2 years. The primary endpoints are the&#xD;
      2-year major composite cardiovascular events (MACEs,) and 2-year vein graft patency rate&#xD;
      determined by coronary CT angiography, secondary endpoints include scoring of angina&#xD;
      pectoris, heart function by echocardiography, biomarkers of arteriosclerosis and endothelial&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
