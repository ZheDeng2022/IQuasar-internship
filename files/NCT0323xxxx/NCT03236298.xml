  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Mount Sinai Hospital, epidural analgesia for labor pain is delivered by programmed&#xD;
      intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB), in combination with pushes of medication activated by the&#xD;
      patient, a technique called patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). Studies have shown&#xD;
      that delivering analgesia in this manner can prolong the duration of analgesia, diminish&#xD;
      motor block, lower the incidence of breakthrough pain, improve maternal satisfaction and&#xD;
      decrease local anesthetic consumption comparing to a conventional continuous infusion. The&#xD;
      use of this PIEB technique in routine practice has reduced the total consumption of local&#xD;
      anesthetic and the percentage of patients requesting additional boluses (PCEA or manual&#xD;
      rescues).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, at the same time, sensory blocks above those targeted for labor pain relief have&#xD;
      been reported in our institution, suggesting that the spread of the freezing medication is&#xD;
      wider than necessary. Based on the information already available in the literature, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct this study to determine the best regimen of PIEB achievable with a&#xD;
      slower delivery speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that PIEB boluses with 125 mL/h will decrease by 50% the&#xD;
      incidence of women presenting sensory block to ice equal or higher than T6 as compared to a&#xD;
      delivery rate of 250 mL/h.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PIEB is a novel technique, which provides better analgesia and less motor block; however, the&#xD;
      ideal regimen has not been established. To optimize the PIEB regimen, the investigators have&#xD;
      conducted several clinical trials using bupivacaine with fentanyl. Although PIEB provides the&#xD;
      excellent analgesia to laboring parturients, studies completed by the instigators have shown&#xD;
      that the incidence of sensory block to ice ≥T6 was 66%. For labor analgesia during the first&#xD;
      stage of labor, effective sensory block requires T10 to L1; therefore, a sensory block ≥T6&#xD;
      seems unnecessarily high, and the investigators seek to confine epidural spread within a&#xD;
      proper range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous studies showed that the effective volume 90% using 0.0625% bupivacaine was 10.7&#xD;
      mL, and incidence of epidural blockade ≥T6 was similar even using a 5-mL bolus with 0.125%&#xD;
      bupivacaine. The investigators concluded that it is not possible to reduce volume of the&#xD;
      PIEB, or use a higher concentration of local anesthetic without compromising the quality of&#xD;
      analgesia. There is some evidence in the literature that supports the idea that higher&#xD;
      injection pressures result in a wider spread of local anesthetic administered into the&#xD;
      epidural space, therefore a slower epidural delivery flow rate may result in less spread.&#xD;
