      The registry study aims to determine serial biomarkers to diagnosis and prognosis of aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm/aortic dissection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the role of candidate biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis&#xD;
      of AA and AD. In the diagnosis part, we begin with a discovery phase where individually&#xD;
      matched case-control study. Patients within each disease outcomes (i.e. AD, AMI, PE, AA&#xD;
      without AD and healthy controls) are age and sex matched and retrospectively included.In the&#xD;
      prognosis part of the study, patients with confirmed AA and AD are enrolled. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is the all-cause mortality based on the death certificates. The secondary outcome is&#xD;
      the in-hospital mortality according to the patients'medical records.&#xD;

AMI if they had chest pain lasting &gt;20 min, diagnostic serial ECG changes comprising new pathological Q waves or ST-segment and T-wave changes, and a plasma creatine kinase-MB elevation greater than twice the normal level or cardiac troponin I (cTnI) level greater than 0.1 ng/mL.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with initial suspicion of having AAD were perspectively enrolled.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Retrospective&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received packed red blood cells, whole blood, or platelets less than 10&#xD;
             days before the blood sample was taken;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with aortic trauma, pseudo aneurysm, history of heart failure, renal&#xD;
             dysfunction, severe pulmonary diseases, or active cancer;&#xD;
