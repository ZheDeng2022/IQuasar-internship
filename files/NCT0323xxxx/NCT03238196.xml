  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-institution, phase Ib trial that evaluates the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of fulvestrant, palbociclib and erdafitinib&#xD;
      in patients with ER+/HER2-/FGFR-amplified metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and tolerability of fulvestrant, palbociclib and erdafitinib in&#xD;
      patients with ER+/HER2-/FGFR-amplified MBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the anti-tumor effect of fulvestrant, palbociclib and erdafitinib in&#xD;
           patients with ER+/HER2-/FGFR-amplified MBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetic assessments of erdafitinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the therapeutic predictive role of FGFR1-4, CCND1-2, CDK4 and CDK6&#xD;
           amplifications, and RB1 and ESR1 mutations on clinical outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if the FGFR1 amplification levels is an early surrogate of response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if the cfDNA results at disease progression show new genomic alterations&#xD;
           potentially associated with resistance to CDK4/6 and FGFR inhibition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine pharmacodynamic biomarkers of FGFR inhibition&#xD;
