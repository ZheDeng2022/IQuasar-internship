  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pain Relapse From 2 to 48 Hours Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>From 2 hours up to 48 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain levels were assessed on a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe) using the eDiary. Pain relapse was defined as pain level of mild, moderate, or severe after 2 hours up to 48 hours for the participants who were pain-free at 2 hours post-dose.</description>
