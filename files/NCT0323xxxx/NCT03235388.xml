      Audit filters for monitoring trauma care quality are regarded as one of the most essential&#xD;
      components of trauma quality improvement programmes; however, there is a paucity of evidence&#xD;
      that shows that audit filters are associated with improved outcomes. Therefore, our aim is to&#xD;
      assess if institutional implementation of audit filters reduce mortality in adult trauma&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Survey of the field&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma, defined as the clinical entity composed of physical injury and the body's associated&#xD;
      response, kills almost five million people each year. This is more than the total number of&#xD;
      annual deaths from malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and maternal conditions combined. More&#xD;
      than 90% of trauma deaths occur in low and middle income countries (LMIC), and about 30-50%&#xD;
      of these deaths have been reported to occur in hospital. Research show that almost 11% of the&#xD;
      global burden of disease estimated using disability adjusted life years are due to trauma,&#xD;
      and that disability adjusted life years from road traffic trauma has increased by 35% in the&#xD;
      last 25 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The United Nation now vows to reduce the number of road traffic deaths by 50% by 2020.&#xD;
      Although primary prevention will play a major role in achieving this, several international&#xD;
      actors, including the World Health Organization (WHO), emphasise the importance of&#xD;
      strengthened trauma care. A considerable body of research on the strengthening of trauma care&#xD;
      attributes improvements in trauma patient outcomes to the implementation of quality&#xD;
      improvement programmes, defined as programmes to improve &quot;health care through monitoring the&#xD;
      process of care and measuring outcomes&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, a recent single centre study from Australia showed a reduction in in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality from 16 to 10% after the implementation of a quality improvement programme. This&#xD;
      programme included interventions such as a protocol for trauma team activation, massive&#xD;
      transfusion protocols, case reviews and the recording and follow up audit filters. Similarly,&#xD;
      research from Thailand and Pakistan show reduced mortality after the implementation of such&#xD;
      programmes. Unfortunately the heterogeneity of interventions included in most quality&#xD;
      improvement programmes makes it hard to draw conclusions about the impact of individual&#xD;
      components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this heterogeneity, audit filters constitute a common denominator across different&#xD;
      quality improvement programmes. Such filters can be defined as &quot;pre-identified variables that&#xD;
      are routinely tracked to identify whether accepted standards of care are being met&quot;. Hence,&#xD;
      audit filters are also referred to as quality indicators or key performance indicators. The&#xD;
      concept of audit filters in trauma care originates from the American College of Surgeons&#xD;
      guidelines on trauma care . They defined 22 filters and the basic idea was that each filter&#xD;
      should represent a &quot;sentinel event&quot; associated with poor patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In theory, audit filters may catalyse improvements in care and therefore the use of such&#xD;
      filters is now widespread in trauma care organisations. Research on the impact of&#xD;
      implementing audit filters on patient outcomes is however scarce. One widely cited study from&#xD;
      Thailand demonstrated a reduction in preventable mortality after the revision of audit&#xD;
      filters; however, this study was not deemed to be of high enough quality to merit inclusion&#xD;
      in the only Cochrane review conducted on the subject. In fact, the authors of that review&#xD;
      were not able to identify a single study of high enough quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The push to include audit filters in efforts to strengthen trauma care is strong, despite the&#xD;
      remarkable lack of evidence that such filters improve patient outcomes. The WHO even includes&#xD;
      audit filters as a core technique in their guidelines for trauma quality improvement&#xD;
      programmes . Considering the often extremely limited resources in the contexts of their&#xD;
      intended audience, primarily decision and policy makers in LMIC, it is crucial that the&#xD;
      recommendations of potentially costly interventions are evidence based. Therefore, the&#xD;
      research question is, does institutional implementation of audit filters reduce mortality in&#xD;
      adult trauma patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of audit filters will lead to: 1) identification of potentially&#xD;
      correctable deficiencies; 2) subsequent correction of identified deficiencies; and 3)&#xD;
      ultimate improved clinical care and reduced mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A controlled interrupted time series trial. This design is generally considered to be the&#xD;
      strongest quasi experimental design when a randomised controlled trial is not feasible. In&#xD;
      brief, the trial will be composed of three phases. First there will be an observation phase&#xD;
      spanning one year, during which outcome baselines will be established. Then there will be an&#xD;
      implementation phase during which locally relevant and appropriate audit filters will be&#xD;
      developed and implemented and an audit filter review board will be elected. This phase will&#xD;
      be six months. Finally, there will be an intervention phase for two years when the audit&#xD;
      filters will be reviewed at monthly meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted in four university hospitals in India. There are several reasons&#xD;
      why India will be used as a model. First, India accounts for 20-25% of all trauma mortality&#xD;
      globally and efforts to strengthen trauma care in the country are urgently needed. The&#xD;
      results of this trial will thus be highly relevant to its participants as well as the&#xD;
      community at the large. Second, none of the centres that will participate use audit filters&#xD;
      today. Hence, the time of implementation will be precisely controlled and thereby one source&#xD;
      of bias will be substantially reduced. All four centres are public university hospitals with&#xD;
      demonstrated research capacity. Each centre has approximately 1500 beds and all clinical&#xD;
      specialities relevant for trauma care available in house. The trial will start in 2017 and&#xD;
      continue for four years after ethical approval from participating centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source and method of participant selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      One project officer at each centre will be employed to enrol participants and collect data.&#xD;
      The project officer will be posted in the emergency department and enrol consecutive patients&#xD;
      that fit the eligibility criteria. She or he will work day, evening, and night duties&#xD;
      according to a rotating random schedule so that all possible shifts are covered during the&#xD;
      course of each month. Each shift will be eight hours, out of which the project officer will&#xD;
      spend six in the emergency department and two conducting follow up of admitted and discharged&#xD;
      patients. The project officer will work five shifts per week. The aim of this model for&#xD;
      participant selection and data collection is to enrol a representative sample of each&#xD;
      centre's population of eligible participants, maximising data quality by having the project&#xD;
      officers record outcomes and covariates, while at the same time minimising data collection&#xD;
      costs and potential observer bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setup&#xD;
&#xD;
      As alluded to previously, the trial will have three distinct phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      observation, implementation, and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation phase The observation phase will be used to establish a baseline for primary&#xD;
      outcome and secondary outcome. The data collection procedures outlined in section &quot;Source and&#xD;
      method of participant selection&quot; will be applied in all four centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation phase (Month 12-18)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two centres will randomly be chosen as control centres and the remaining two will be chosen&#xD;
      as intervention centres. Data collection continues as during the observation phase in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control centres: No change compared to the observation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention centres: The goal of the implementation phase in the intervention centres will&#xD;
      be to develop and implement locally relevant and appropriate audit filers, as well as a&#xD;
      system to identify and implement solutions to identified deficiencies. To achieve this goal a&#xD;
      participatory and multidisciplinary approach will be used. First a meeting and two day course&#xD;
      will be hosted at each intervention centre to present the background and rationale for using&#xD;
      audit filters to improve trauma care. Representation by all disciplines and specialities&#xD;
      involved in trauma care, including clinical specialities, nursing, rehabilitation and&#xD;
      administration will be strived for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two day course on trauma quality improvement processes (TQIP) including audit filters&#xD;
      will include the following objectives: 1) Gaining an understanding of TQIP and a familiarity&#xD;
      with the evidence supporting it; 2) Gaining an understanding of implementation options for&#xD;
      different clinical contexts; 3) Gaining an understanding of the application of audit filters&#xD;
      in TQIP; 4) Training on the implementation of targeted corrective action plans; 5)&#xD;
      Explanation of the utility of ongoing data collection to evaluate interventions (&quot;closing the&#xD;
      loop&quot;). This course will provide an overview of techniques used for hospital-based TQIP,&#xD;
      focusing on the concepts of audit filter application, and processes of flagged event review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the course participants on professor, associate professor, and assistant professor&#xD;
      level, i.e. 10-15 people, will be invited to take part in an anonymous online Delphi survey.&#xD;
      The Delphi approach means that the survey will be delivered in multiple rounds, and that&#xD;
      participants receive feedback on the previous round's results before a new round is&#xD;
      initiated. In each round the participants will be provided with a set of audit filters and&#xD;
      will be asked to rate each filter on a scale from 1 to 10 (where 1 represent useless and 10&#xD;
      very useful), provide written comments on suggested filters, and finally suggest new audit&#xD;
      filters, and provide a written rationale for each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first round participants will be provided with a set of audit filters used in other&#xD;
      contexts. All audit filters that get a median rank of ≥7 as well as all filters provided by&#xD;
      participants will be included in subsequent rounds. The Delphi survey will be terminated when&#xD;
      either consensus or stability of group responses is reached. Consensus is defined as the&#xD;
      situation when all included audit filters have a median rank of ≥9. Stability is defined as&#xD;
      the situation when no significant change in audit filter ranks occurs between two rounds. If&#xD;
      stability is reached then all audit filters with a median rank of ≥9, or the five audit&#xD;
      filters with the highest ranks, will be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the Delphi survey will be presented in each intervention centre at a second&#xD;
      meeting. This first post-survey meeting will only host the survey participants. After this&#xD;
      meeting each centre will be asked to elect an audit filter review board. This board will&#xD;
      review audit filter data, identify potentially correctable deficiencies and solutions. The&#xD;
      board will also have the mandate to implement potential these solutions. Once an audit filter&#xD;
      review board has been elected it will inform the relevant staff cadres of the audit filter&#xD;
      implementation and review mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The audit filters will then be implemented. Data on audit filters will be collected and&#xD;
      collated by a second project officer, employed by us, in each of the intervention centres.&#xD;
      Project management will participate in the three first audit filter review meetings. At these&#xD;
      meetings each flag will be assessed by reviewing the patient's record. The plan, do, study,&#xD;
      act (PDSA) cycle typically employed to implement and evaluate interventions to improve&#xD;
      processes of care will be taught.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention phase (Month 18-42)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control centres: No change compared to the observation and implementation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention centres: The audit filter review board will conduct monthly review meetings.&#xD;
      Project management will not participate in these meetings. The audit filter review board will&#xD;
      be free to add or remove audit filters and implement and evaluate interventions as they&#xD;
      choose. The meetings will be documented in standardised protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the trial data on the following covariates will be collected to allow describing&#xD;
      participants as well as adjust analyses for potential differences in case mix between centres&#xD;
      and over time:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age in years. Recorded by project officers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex, coded as male or female. Recorded by project officers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systolic blood pressure. Recorded by project officers using dedicated equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diastolic blood pressure. Recorded by project officers using dedicated equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate. Recorded by project officers using dedicated equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood oxygen saturation. Recorded by project officers using dedicated equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory rate. Recorded by project officers by manual counting during one minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of consciousness using the Glasgow coma scale and Alert, Voice, Pain or&#xD;
           Unresponsive scale (AVPU). Recorded by project officers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mechanism of injury according to chapter XX of ICD-10. Recorded by project officers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injuries sustained, extracted from patient records by project officers to enable&#xD;
           anatomical injury severity scoring using the injury severity score (ISS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transferred from another health facility. Recorded by project officer by asking&#xD;
           participant or participant's relative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mode of transport. Recorded by project officer by asking participant or participant's&#xD;
           relative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and time of injury, to calculate delay between injury and presentation to&#xD;
           participating centre. Recorded by project officer by asking participant or participant's&#xD;
           relative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and time of computed tomography investigation. Recorded by project officer from the&#xD;
           participant's hospital record or by direct observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of ultrasonography investigation. Recorded by project officer from the&#xD;
           participant's hospital record or by direct observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date when mechanical ventilation was started and stopped. Recorded by project officer&#xD;
           from the participant's hospital record or by direct observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date, time and type of surgery, defined as any surgical intervention performed under&#xD;
           general or regional anesthesia. Recorded by project officers from the participant's&#xD;
           hospital record or by direct observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods and analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      A segmented general additive model (GAM) will be used to assess the impact of institutional&#xD;
      implementation of audit filters on outcomes. The GAM approach will allow accommodation of&#xD;
      potential nonlinearity in intervention effect while adjusting for autocorrelation,&#xD;
      seasonality and case mix differences. Data from intervention and control centres will be&#xD;
      pooled separately. Each observation will represent averaged data for all patients enrolled&#xD;
      during one month instead of data for an individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second analysis will be conducted using patient level data. In both analyses the primary&#xD;
      interest is detecting a change in trend between the observation and intervention phases, as&#xD;
      well as between control and intervention centres, for each of the outcomes. Furthermore,&#xD;
      estimation of intervention effect on both mortality and quality of life will be possible by&#xD;
      calculating the difference between predicted outcomes assuming no intervention effect and the&#xD;
      observed outcomes with intervention. R will be used for statistical analyses, adopting a 95%&#xD;
      confidence level and 5% significance level. The Holm procedure will be used to adjust for&#xD;
      multiple tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with major trauma, defined as any patient who is admitted for more than three&#xD;
           days with an ISS of &gt;15, or who dies within three days of admission, or who dies between&#xD;
           arrival and admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with life-threatening, but potentially salvageable trauma, defined as any&#xD;
           patient with 15&lt;ISS&lt;24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion of the implementation phase from the analysis model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be pooled for the observation and intervention phase and analysed using a&#xD;
           pre-post design.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The collated data will be de-identified adhering to recognised standards, e.g. applicable parts of the Safe Harbor standard defined in the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The de-identified data, from which it will not be reasonable possible to identify individual hospitals or patients, will be uploaded to a public data repository to be used by other researchers. Further, such use will be preceded by the signing of a data sharing agreement, which will include the prohibition of any attempts at re-identification of centres or patients.</ipd_description>
