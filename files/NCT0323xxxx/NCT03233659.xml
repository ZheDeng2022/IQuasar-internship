  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graft versus Host disease ( GVHD) is one of the major complications of Allogeneic Stem Cell&#xD;
      Transplantation. Acute GVHD develops early ( within 2to 3 months) after transplantation and&#xD;
      is the leading cause of death of transplanted patients. The pathogenesis of Chronic GVHD is&#xD;
      still little known. Chronic GVHD is caused by donor T lymphocytes, but we have no precise&#xD;
      knowledge on the participation of specific subsets of immune system cells to chronic GVHD. In&#xD;
      general, chronic GVHD is associated with an increase in the number of T effector lymphocytes,&#xD;
      both helper type 2 and cytotoxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, also antigen presenting cells (APCs) have been implicated in pathogenesis of&#xD;
      chronic GVHD in studies performed on animal models. T lymphocyte responses that characterize&#xD;
      chronic GVHD require that recipient antigens are submitted by APCs which originate from the&#xD;
      donor's HSC ( Hematopoietic Stem Cells) APCs are heterogeneous population that includes&#xD;
      dendritic cells (DCs) ,monocytes, activated B lymphocytes and CD34+ cell subpopulations.&#xD;
      These cells can be identified by cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data about APCs role in chronic GVHD are preliminary and often discordant. Seemingly,&#xD;
      there isn't correlation between circulating APCs number and risk of cGVHD. However, recent&#xD;
      data of our group show that patients with cGVHD could have higher number of monocytes in bone&#xD;
      marrow than transplanted patients without cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of study is to measure the number of circulating immune cells in the PB (peripherical&#xD;
      blood) before and after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation by flow cytometry.&#xD;

&#xD;
      All patients undergoing Allogeneic Transplantation in our Institute are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection and processing of blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each peripheral blood sample must be collected in three heparin tubes ( up to 18 ml of SP)&#xD;
      and a non-anticoagulant tube (6 ml for a total of at least 3 ml of serum)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each sample is processed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample taken without anticoagulant will be centrifuged to obtain serum, the aliquots of&#xD;
      serum are frozen and stored at -20°C The immunophenotypic analysis for number and function of&#xD;
      the mentioned cells are performed on fresh PB samples within 72 hours of collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mononuclear cells and monocytes are purified by standard procedures (MNCs by density gradient&#xD;
      centrifugation, monocytes by immunomagnetic selection) and then stored in liquid nitrogen&#xD;
      until they are used for expected functional assays. The negative CD14 fraction are frozen and&#xD;
      used as the source of T lymphocytes.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  The allostimulatory function is determined in mixed leukocyte cultures using HLA&#xD;
           different CD4 + T lymphocytes as &quot;responders&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ability to capture antigens is measured in flow cytometry on individual cells by&#xD;
           fluorescence antigens, such as FITC conjugated albumin or fluorescent beads.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gene expression profile is performed using a MICROARRAY study&#xD;

        -  Cytokine production is determined in single-color flow cytometry after stimulation with&#xD;
           anti-CD3 and anti-CD28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In positive male HLA-A2 patients receiving female donor transplantation, the frequency&#xD;
           of T anti-HY lymphocytes is measured by fluorochrome-conjugated pentamers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In all other patients, T-cell donor response to receptor antigens is measured in&#xD;
           ELISPOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum cytokines Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of serum cytokines is determined in cytometry using CBA (Cytokine Bead&#xD;
      Assay, CBA, Becton Dickinson, Mountian View, CA, USA). We analyze the following cytokines:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-helper 1 cytokines: TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-12;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-helper 2 and regulators cytokines (IL-10, IL-5), and TGF-beta&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Serum autoantibodies Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of the antinuclear antibodies is measured by indirect immunofluorescence on&#xD;
      HEp2 cells (a cell line of hepatocarcinoma). The antibodies against extractable nuclear&#xD;
      antigens (ENA) are measured by ELISA (ENA SCREENING). In case of positivity, the presence of&#xD;
      antibodies against specific antigens is determined by DOT BLOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      micro(mi) RNA PCR study in patient's serum and cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total RNA is extracted from human serum samples and stored at -80 ° C. A part of RNA (&#xD;
      3µl) is processed for reverse transcription and pre-amplification with a pool of primers&#xD;
      according to the supplier's description. 664 human miRNA, 6 small human RNA and 1 control&#xD;
      miRNA are processed in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene expression profile Study of transplanted patient's monocytes by PCR and MICROARRAY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monocyte RNA messenger is extracted from the cells, converted into cDNA by reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase and at the same time labeled with a fluorescent probe. The hybridization&#xD;
      between the nucleic acids (probes) present on the matrix and the cDNA target will remain&#xD;
      hybridized and can then be identified by detecting the location where it is bound. At the end&#xD;
      of study, all samples will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive or have received chemotherapy for transplant preparation according to&#xD;
      current clinical practice. After transplantation, patients will receive medication for&#xD;
      prophylaxis of GVHD and infections according to clinical practice. Concomitant therapies&#xD;
      possibly administered according to clinical practice are documented in CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of visits and evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient visit is expected and CRF is completed at the enrollment. There are 6 blood samples&#xD;
      per patient. Any blood sample after the enrollment can be delayed or anticipated by 14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests are performed under the normal care pathway and are not study-specific. Blood exam&#xD;
      informations are reported on CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is the measure of circulating immune cell number in PB&#xD;
      before and after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation. Statistical analysis&#xD;
      consists of comparison analysis between averages using GRAPH PAD PRISM version 4.02 program.&#xD;
      The level of significance is defined as &lt;.05 Analysis of secondary endpoints is performed&#xD;
      using the same methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is proposed to all patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation. The number of&#xD;
      transplants performed at the Seràgnoli Institute is on average between 50 and 60 per year. It&#xD;
      is therefore estimated that 300 patients will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administrative procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any modification to the protocol will be made in the form of the amendment. No other types of&#xD;
      modification to the protocol are allowed during the study period. Any unexpected changes in&#xD;
      the study will be recorded in the Clinical Study Report.&#xD;
&#xD;
