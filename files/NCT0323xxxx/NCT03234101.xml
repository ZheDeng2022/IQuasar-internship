  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Public health policy is universal in recommending the adoption of low risk low-risk lifestyle&#xD;
      behaviors for health promotion and prevention of chronic or non-communicable diseases&#xD;
      (NCDs).These behaviors generally include achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight,&#xD;
      healthy diet, regular physical activity, smoking cessation, moderate alcohol intake, and&#xD;
      adequate sleep. While there is a general consensus that adherence to any one of these&#xD;
      low-risk lifestyle behaviors is associated with benefit, it is not clear if adherence to&#xD;
      multiple behaviors would result in a larger benefit across different groups of people,&#xD;
      conditions, and chronic disease outcomes. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS), as part&#xD;
      of the Dyslipidemia Guidelines Update, commissioned a series of systematic reviews and&#xD;
      meta-analyses (a type of knowledge synthesis) using the Grading of Recommendations&#xD;
      Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to quantify the benefit of adherence&#xD;
      to multiple low-risk lifestyle behaviors in relation to patient-important chronic disease&#xD;
      outcomes (risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and death) and assesses the&#xD;
      quality and strength of the evidence for this benefit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      International health authorities universally recommend adherence to low-risk lifestyle&#xD;
      behaviors for health promotion and prevention of chronic or non-communicable diseases (NCDs).&#xD;
      Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies have shown that adherence&#xD;
      to any one low-risk lifestyle behavior, including a healthy body weight, healthy diet,&#xD;
      regular physical activity, smoking cessation, moderate alcohol intake, or adequate sleep, is&#xD;
      associated with less risk of chronic disease. Although individual prospective cohort studies&#xD;
      have shown that adherence to a combination of these low-risk lifestyle behaviors is&#xD;
      associated with an even greater benefit, there are no systematic reviews and meta-analyses&#xD;
      assessing whether it holds across different definitions of low-risk lifestyle behaviors,&#xD;
      levels of exposure, populations, geographical regions, background risks, and chronic disease&#xD;
      outcomes. To inform recommendations for the role of low-risk lifestyle behaviors in chronic&#xD;
      disease prevention, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS), as part of the Dyslipidemia&#xD;
      Guidelines Update, commissioned a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach of the&#xD;
      association between adherence to a combination of low-risk lifestyle behaviors and (1)&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), (2) diabetes, (3) cancer, and (4) all-cause mortality outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the association between&#xD;
           adherene to a combination of low-risk lifestyle behaviors and 4 chronic disease outcomes&#xD;
           (1) cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality,&#xD;
           coronary heart disease [CHD] incidence and mortality, and stroke incidence and&#xD;
           mortality), (2) diabetes, (3) cancer (cancer incidence and cancer mortality), and (4)&#xD;
           all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the quality and strength of the evidence using GRADE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planning and conduct of the proposed systematic reviews and meta-analyses will follow the&#xD;
      Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the&#xD;
      Meta-Analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and the Preferred Reporting&#xD;
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials;&#xD;
      CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms. These searches will be supplemented&#xD;
      by manual hand searches of the bibliographies of included studies and existing review&#xD;
      articles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective cohort studies investigating the relation of at-least three low-risk lifestyle&#xD;
      behaviors, one of which must include a healthy diet, with incident cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      diabetes, cancer or all-cause mortality will be included. Studies will be excluded if&#xD;
      low-risk lifestyle behaviors are combined with biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two independent reviewers or more will independently extract relevant information about study&#xD;
      design, sample size, subject characteristics, low risk lifestyle behaviors,&#xD;
      duration/person-years of follow-up, adjustments of models. Risk ratios for clinical outcomes&#xD;
      will be extracted or derived from clinical event data across quantiles of exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two independent reviewers or more will assess risk of bias of (ROB) of each of the included&#xD;
      prospective cohort studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) by . Up to 9 points can be&#xD;
      awarded based on cohort selection (max 4 points), the comparability of cohort design and&#xD;
      analysis (max 4 points), and adequacy of the outcome measures (max 3 points). Studies that&#xD;
      receive ≥6 points will be considered as higher quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the four proposed systematic reviews and meta-analyses will assess a different&#xD;
      chronic disease outcome: cardiovascular disease (CVD incidence and mortality, CHD incidence&#xD;
      and mortality, and stroke incidence and mortality), (2) diabetes, (3) cancer (cancer and&#xD;
      cancer mortality), and (4) all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk estimates of extreme comparisons (all who adhered to low-risk behaviors versus none)&#xD;
      will be pooled using inverse variance random effects models and expressed as risk ratios (RR)&#xD;
      with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Between-cohort heterogeneity will be assessed by the&#xD;
      Cochran Q (chi-square) statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. The significance level&#xD;
      will be set at p&lt;0.10 and an I2 ≥ 50% will be considered evidence of substantial&#xD;
      heterogeneity. To explore sources of heterogeneity, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed with recalculation of the&#xD;
      summary estimates. If there are &gt;=10 studies, then the investigators will also explore&#xD;
      sources of heterogeneity using a priori subgroup analyses by underlying disease status, sex,&#xD;
      number of lifestyle factors, follow-up (&lt;10 years, ≥10 years), level of adjustment of models,&#xD;
      NOS, ascertainment of outcome, and individual domains of NOS Meta-regression analyses will&#xD;
      assess the significance of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. Dose-response&#xD;
      analyses will be undertaken using random-effects generalized least squares trend estimation&#xD;
      models (GLST) to assess linear relationships and spline curve modeling (the MKSPLINE&#xD;
      procedure) to assess non-linear relationships. If ≥10 cohort comparisons are available, then&#xD;
      publication bias will be assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots and formally tested&#xD;
      with the Egger and Begg tests at a significance level of p≤ 0.10. If publication bias is&#xD;
      suspected, then the investigators will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by&#xD;
      imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of evidence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence profiles will be produced the overall strength and quality of the evidence will be&#xD;
      assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)&#xD;
      system. This system grades the evidence as &quot;high quality&quot;, &quot;moderate quality&quot;, &quot;low quality&quot;,&#xD;
      or &quot;very low quality&quot;. The included prospective cohort studies will start at &quot;low quality&quot; by&#xD;
      default and then be downgraded or upgraded based on pre-specified criteria. Criteria to&#xD;
      downgrade will include study limitations (weight of studies show risk of bias by NOS),&#xD;
      inconsistency (substantial unexplained inter-study heterogeneity, I2&gt;50% and P&lt;0.10),&#xD;
      indirectness (presence of factors relating to the population, exposures, and outcomes that&#xD;
      limit generalizability), imprecision (95% CI are wide or cross a minimally important&#xD;
      difference of 10% [RR 0.9- 1.1]), and publication bias (significant evidence of small-study&#xD;
      effects). Criteria to upgrade will include a large magnitude effect (RR&gt;2 or RR&lt;0.5 in the&#xD;
      absence of plausible confounders), a dose-response gradient, and attenuation by plausible&#xD;
      confounding effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be disseminated through interactive presentations at local, national, and&#xD;
      international scientific meetings and publication in high impact factor journals. Target&#xD;
      audiences will include the public health and scientific communities with interest in&#xD;
      nutrition, physical activity, lifestyle modification, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key&#xD;
      areas for future research will be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects of low-risk&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviours on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and all-cause mortality,&#xD;
      strengthening the evidence-base for recommendations and improving health outcomes through&#xD;
      informing consumers and public health policy makers, stimulating industry innovation, and&#xD;
      guiding future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of the funding sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The funding source will have no role in the research question, design, analysis, results and&#xD;
      interpretation of the results of this study.&#xD;
