  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, 26-weeks clinical trial. The&#xD;
      objective of the trial is to investigate the effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist Bydureon®&#xD;
      (exenatide) vs. placebo on alcohol intake in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Number of patients and target population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      144 patients with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence and 25 healthy participants (described&#xD;
      later).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the trial will be treated for 26 weeks with once-weekly subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection of Bydureon® (exenatide) 2 mg or placebo. The medication will be provided as a&#xD;
      supplement to a standard, psychosocial alcohol treatment program. There will be a long-term&#xD;
      follow up 26 weeks after end of participation in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited from the out-patient treatment clinics &quot;Novavì ambulatorierne&quot;&#xD;
      in suburbs of Copenhagen. All patients will receive psychosocial alcohol treatment based on&#xD;
      psycho educative elements, motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural treatment.&#xD;
      Skilled staff members administer the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment procedure starts when the patients contact Novavì ambulatorierne. The first&#xD;
      contact is often without any appointment - i.e. as &quot;drop-in&quot;. At this point the patients will&#xD;
      be met by a healthcare provider at his/her local Novavì ambulatorie. The healthcare provider&#xD;
      will be a nurse or a doctor. The patient will be treated in accordance to the Novavì&#xD;
      guidelines, i.e. start of abstinence treatment and a plan will be agreed on. At this point,&#xD;
      the health personal will also ask if the patient could be interested in our project.&#xD;
      Information regarding the project will also be available on the web page of Novavì. If he/she&#xD;
      is interested and the patient fits the inclusion criteria the patient will be handed written&#xD;
      information about the trial, and an information meeting will be set up a few days later. The&#xD;
      patient will be informed about his/her right to bring a friend or adviser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment evaluation/screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before screening, all patients will be provided with oral and written information about the&#xD;
      trial, including the most common adverse events, and the procedures involved in the study.&#xD;
      All patients will be fully in-formed, verbally and in writing, of their rights and&#xD;
      responsibilities while participating in the trial. Screening examinations will only be&#xD;
      performed after the patient has agreed to participate and has signed and dated the informed&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening examinations, the patient will be asked about his/her alcohol intake the&#xD;
      previous 30 days. The information will be recorded via TLFB (Time Line Follow Back) method.&#xD;
      The patient will be asked questions about his/her lifetime alcohol consumption, previous&#xD;
      treatment and general information about psychosocial factors, i.e. education level,&#xD;
      employment and marital status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, Alcohol Users Identification Test (AUDIT) score, the Clinical Institute&#xD;
      Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale Revised (CIWA-Ar), The Drug User Identification Test&#xD;
      (DUDIT) score, Major Depression Inventory (MDI) score (related to the SPECT results), Penn&#xD;
      alcohol craving scale (PACS), smoking status (Fagerströms test), height, weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference, blood pressure and pulse will be registered. In order to evaluate psychosocial&#xD;
      status a general assessment including questionnaires regarding health (SF-36), Symptom&#xD;
      checklist (SCL-92) and Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP) - test will be&#xD;
      performed.The patients will also be asked questions regarding somatic symptoms, i.e.&#xD;
      GI-symptoms, in order to obtain baseline information. In addition, other medications than&#xD;
      Bydureon® will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different safety blood samples and a urine test will be collected. A blood sample and a urine&#xD;
      sample will be saved for an investigational biobank and a biobank for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will meet every week to get his/her weekly injection by the un-blinded nurse. The&#xD;
      nurse will collect a weekly alcohol diary and hand them a new one, for the following week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations during and in the end of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 4, 12 and 20, parts of the baseline examinations - including blood samples - will be&#xD;
      conducted. The alcohol diaries collected in relation to the weekly injection-visits will be&#xD;
      used as template for the 30 day TLFB at the examinations, i.e. the examiner will fill out the&#xD;
      TLFB based on the diaries and in close collaboration with the patient. At week 26, the final&#xD;
      examination will take place repeating all the baseline examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow up 26 weeks after end of participation in the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants completing the final week 26 examination, will be contacted after six&#xD;
      months, and invited to a follow up meeting . TLFB, PACS, AUDIT and Fagerstrøms questionnaire&#xD;
      will be repeated. A new questionnaire, which gives us a better characteristic of the&#xD;
      patient's alcohol history, &quot;Alco-life&quot; will be registered. A single blood test, (PEth) will&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study of the possible neuro molecular and -anatomical underpinnings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the clinical outcome parameters, the investigators will explore the neuro&#xD;
      molecular and -anatomical underpinnings of potential therapeutic effects of Bydureon® in two&#xD;
      subgroups of patients who are treated with either Bydureon® or placebo. In order to study&#xD;
      this,two different brain scans will be performed: Single-photon emission computed tomography&#xD;
      (SPECT)-scan (sixty) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)-scan (seventy-five&#xD;
      patients) at baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment. The patients will be included&#xD;
      continuously until the aimed number (i.e. sixty and seventy-five patients for each scan type,&#xD;
      respectively) have completed base line scan. The patients will be asked to undergo both scan&#xD;
      types (except from the last fifteen patients out of the seventy-five patients included for&#xD;
      scans, who will only undergo fMRI scan) as the information from both scans will be paired&#xD;
      during evaluation. When baseline scans are performed, the patients start the treatment they&#xD;
      were randomized for at inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPECT-scan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have lately reported on a GLP-1-induced upregulation of the rat dopamine transporter&#xD;
      activity in vitro. In the present study, the investigators want to investigate whereas GLP-1&#xD;
      receptor stimulation induces changes in the striatal dopamine transporter availability in&#xD;
      humans. The investigators will conduct the SPECT brain scan with the dopamine transporter&#xD;
      ligand 123I-2-b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl) nortropane ([123I]-FP-CIT)&#xD;
      (DaTSCAN, Amersham Health). The SPECT scans will be conducted at the Neurobiology Research&#xD;
      Unit, Rigshospitalet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fMRI-scan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fMRI-scan measures brain blood flow, which reflects activity in different areas of the&#xD;
      brain. We will test two different paradigms: 1) Alcohol cue sensitivity. Sixty&#xD;
      alcohol-related and 45 neutral stimuli are presented using a block design. Following each&#xD;
      block, the patients rate the intensity of their alcohol craving on a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      ranging from 0 (no craving) to 100 (extremely extensive craving). 2) Spatial working memory.&#xD;
      Spatial working memory is assessed using 2-back and 0-back variants of the N-back task for&#xD;
      the active working memory and control conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study-schedule for the 25 healthy fMRI-participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To have comparable standard data in the fMRI alcohol related paradigm, 25 healthy&#xD;
      participants with no record of alcohol dependence will be recruited. The participants will be&#xD;
      matched with gender and age of the patients and have to fulfil the exclusion-criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: The participants will have an interview about physical symptoms, diagnosis and current&#xD;
      medication. They will be asked to fill out the Alcohol Users Identification Test (AUDIT), the&#xD;
      Drug Users Identification Test (DUDIT), have a basic physical examination and a blood and a&#xD;
      urine test done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2: They will start with the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP) test,&#xD;
      and afterwards have the fMRI scan done.&#xD;
