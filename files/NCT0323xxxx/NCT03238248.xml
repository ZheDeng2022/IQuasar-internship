      This study will evaluate the treatment combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine in the&#xD;
      setting of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor(s) failure in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare survival of patients treated with a combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine&#xD;
      after failure of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) to historical survival for patients&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myelodysplastic/&#xD;
      myeloproliferative overlap syndromes (MDS/MPN) who are ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (HSCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of hematologic improvement (HI) in patients with&#xD;
           relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine after DNMTi&#xD;
           failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the complete remission (CR) and marrow CR rates in patients with&#xD;
           relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine after DNMTi&#xD;
           failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the reduction of bone marrow blasts in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
           MDS or MDS/MPN treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine after DNMTi failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate the mutation burden in patients with relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN&#xD;
           with response to treatment with pevonedistat and azacitidine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate genomic aberrations with rate of response and survival in&#xD;
           relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN patients treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the effect of pevonedistat treatment in combination with azacitidine on&#xD;
           quality of life in patients with relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define epigenetic biomarkers for pevonedistat use in relapsed/refractory MDS or&#xD;
           MDS/MPN&#xD;

             research obtained from a procedure performed no more than 28 days prior to initiating&#xD;
             treatment on Cycle 1, Day 1. Requirement for bone marrow biopsy may be waived with&#xD;
             approval of the study chair in the event that a bone marrow biopsy cannot be obtained.&#xD;

             discretion of the investigators and local practice. Rechecking Hgb level prior to&#xD;
             start on Cycle 1 Day 1 is not necessary as long as patients do not have inadequate&#xD;

             or abstain from heterosexual intercourse from the time of signing consent, and until 4&#xD;
             months after patient's last dose of protocol-indicated treatment. Periodic abstinence&#xD;
             (e.g. calendar,ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner)&#xD;

        oophorectomy, or a complete hysterectomy; or has not been amenorrheic for at least 1 year&#xD;
        in the absence of an alternative medical cause, then patient will be considered a female of&#xD;
        childbearing potential. Postmenopausal status in females under 55 years of age should be&#xD;

        women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Men, even if surgically sterilized (i.e. status post-vasectomy), who are sexually active&#xD;
        with women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for effective&#xD;
        barrier contraception from the time of signing consent and until 4 months after last dose&#xD;
        of protocol-indicated treatment. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
        symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner) and withdrawal are not&#xD;
        acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
