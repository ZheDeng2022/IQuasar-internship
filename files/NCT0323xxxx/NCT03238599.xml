      Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) Cancer patients experience significant physical and&#xD;
      psychosocial consequences of cancer and treatment which affect quality of life (QoL). These&#xD;
      consequences may be under-recognized and under-treated in oncology practice, resulting in&#xD;
      greater morbidity that is costly to patients and the health system. Patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      measures (PROMs) are advocated for use in routine cancer clinical practice for early&#xD;
      detection of distress and as a performance metric for evaluating the quality of care on&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A PROM is defined as 'any report coming directly from the patient about a health condition&#xD;
      and its treatment using a self-reported measure. PROMs focus on physical symptoms, treatment&#xD;
      toxicities, psychosocial problems or global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impacts of&#xD;
      a health condition. PROMs that capture the whole-person impact of cancer and treatments on&#xD;
      health outcomes are increasingly recommended by patients, clinicians, and decision makers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of implementation issues related to the use of PROMs data need to be considered: (i)&#xD;
      limiting data collection so as to minimize patient burden and completion time, (ii)&#xD;
      collecting PROM data at baseline and selected follow-up times while minimizing the number of&#xD;
      assessments, (iii) considering whether measurement equivalence has been established when&#xD;
      using different modes of patient-reported data collection (e.g. web, telephone, tablet, or&#xD;
      paper), (iv) collecting data via electronic technologies whenever possible, and (v) employing&#xD;
      methods to minimize missing data including educating site personnel, patients and clinicians,&#xD;
      and real-time monitoring of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step counting devices to monitor physical activity The intensive medical treatment of&#xD;
      patients with hematologic malignancies is associated with numerous long-term adverse effects,&#xD;
      including anemia, fatigue, and reduced physical exercise capacity. Patients with hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies may benefit from physical exercise programs in terms of maintenance or even&#xD;
      improvement in fatigue, physical activity, and fitness levels. Since many patients with&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies are young and professionally active, regaining physical activity is&#xD;
      a prerequisite for timely resuming professional activities, and, thus, of immediate&#xD;
      socio-economic relevance. A major component of daily physical activity and the most common&#xD;
      form of exercise is walking. Walking is self-regulated in intensity, duration, and frequency,&#xD;
      and it can be an important indicator of a person's health and fitness status. The improvement&#xD;
      of functional status is a primary goal in the rehabilitation of cancer patients. It is thus&#xD;
      crucial to be able to document quantitatively the walking activity of patients who are&#xD;
      recovering from intensive medical treatment. An understanding of the quantity (or lack) of&#xD;
      walking activity seems particularly important in addressing the needs of cancer patients who&#xD;
      are recovering from intensive medical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hematologic malignancies recovering from intensive medical treatment such as&#xD;
      after high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) can&#xD;
      benefit from gradually regaining a more physically active lifestyle, typically by increasing&#xD;
      ambulatory activity. Step counting devices (accelerometers and pedometers) offer an&#xD;
      opportunity to monitor daily ambulatory activity. Tudor-Locke and Bassett originally proposed&#xD;
      a graduated step index to describe pedometer-determined habitual physical activity in adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &lt; 5,000 steps/day (sedentary);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 5,000-7,499 steps/day (low active);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 7,500-9,999 steps/day (somewhat active);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ≥ 10,000-12,499 steps/day (active); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. ≥12,500 steps/day (highly active).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognizing a considerable floor effect (i.e., insensitivity to the range of activity levels&#xD;
      below the lowest threshold) when applied to low active populations, Tudor-Locke et al&#xD;
      suggested that the original sedentary level is further divided into two additional&#xD;
      incremental levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt; 2,500 steps/day (basal activity) and 2,500- 4,999 steps/day (limited activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective use of PROMs and step counting devices after ASCT The investigators here propose&#xD;
      a non-randomized prospective non-blinded non-interventional observational clinical phase II&#xD;
      study, assessing physical activity in myeloma and lymphoma patients following high-dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy (HDCT) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The primary objective&#xD;
      is to determine whether regaining a daily activity of at least 5'000 steps (thus, regaining&#xD;
      the &quot;low active&quot; level) 30 days after HDCT with ASCT is associated with a higher probability&#xD;
      to resume professional activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis will be that 50% or more of those patients who achieve &gt;5'000 steps during one&#xD;
      day at least once between 10 and 30 days after ASCT will have resumed their professional&#xD;
      activities at the day 100 assessment, whereas only 30% of those patients, who have not&#xD;
      achieved the 5'000 steps threshold until day 30, will have restarted their professional life&#xD;
      at the day 100 assessment. Physical activity will be assessed by a web-based pedometer&#xD;
      device, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) will be collected using a web-based&#xD;
      tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MIDATA.coop platform The trial will use the MIDATA.coop platform based on the principle&#xD;
      of citizen-controlled data storage and sharing. MIDATA.coop embodies an IT platform managing&#xD;
      personal data and the governance needed to operate it. As a not-for-profit citizen-owned&#xD;
      cooperative, its vision is to allow citizens to collect, store, visualize, and share specific&#xD;
      sets of their personal data with friends and health professionals, and to make anonymized&#xD;
      versions of part of these data accessible to research projects in fields that appeal to them.&#xD;
      The value generated by this secondary use of personal data is managed collectively to operate&#xD;
      and extend the platform and support further research projects.&#xD;
