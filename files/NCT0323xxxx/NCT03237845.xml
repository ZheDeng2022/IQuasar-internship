  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pain Relapse From 2 to 48 Hours Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>From 2 hours up to 48 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain levels were assessed on a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe) using the eDiary. Pain relapse was defined as pain level of mild, moderate, or severe after 2 hours up to 48 hours for the participants who were pain-free at 2 hours post-dose.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 50 sites in United States of which 49 sites enrolled at least 1 participant.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 1499 participants were enrolled, of which 1186 participants were randomized to rimegepant 75 milligram (mg) or placebo. A total of 313 participants failed screening mainly due to failure to meet eligibility criteria. The randomization was stratified in a 1:1 ratio based on use of prophylactic migraine medications (yes or no).</pre_assignment_details>
