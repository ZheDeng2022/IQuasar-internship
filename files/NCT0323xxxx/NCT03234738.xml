  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,&#xD;
      multiple-ascending-dose, inpatient study to assess the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of TP-271 in healthy subjects. Subjects aged 18 to 50 years who fulfill the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 5 cohorts of 8 subjects each (up to a total of 40 subjects) will be enrolled. The 8&#xD;
      subjects within each cohort will be randomized 6:2 to receive multiple IV doses of TP-271 or&#xD;
      placebo. Study drug will be administered IV once daily on the morning of Days 1 through 7&#xD;
      following an overnight fast (minimum 8 hours). The planned doses for study drug for Cohorts A&#xD;
      - E are 0.5 mg/kg TP-271 or placebo, 1.0 mg/kg TP-271 or placebo, 2.0 mg/kg TP-271 or&#xD;
      placebo, 2.5 mg/kg TP-271 or placebo and 3.0 mg/kg TP-271 or placebo respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Screening period (Days -28 to -2 prior to the subject receiving TP-271 or&#xD;
      placebo), each subject will be assessed for eligibility. Each subject must sign and date the&#xD;
      ICF prior to undergoing any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cohorts will follow the same study design. On Day -1, subjects will be admitted to the&#xD;
      study unit and eligibility confirmed. On Day 1, eligible subjects will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized to receive either TP-271 or placebo and will receive the assigned drug from Days 1&#xD;
      through 7. Subjects will be required to stay at the study unit from Days -1 through 11 to&#xD;
      assess safety and obtain the required PK samples. On Day 11, subjects will be discharged from&#xD;
      the study unit. A final safety assessment will be performed once between Days 14 and 20, 7 to&#xD;
      13 days following administration of the subject's final dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all 8 subjects in a cohort have completed study procedures through Day 11, the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator and the Sponsor's Medical Monitor will evaluate all blinded safety and&#xD;
      plasma PK data to determine whether any criteria that would require a meeting of the Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (SMC) are met. If no such criteria are met, the study may proceed to the&#xD;
      subsequent cohort at the next higher dose of TP-271 without consulting the SMC.&#xD;
