  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year, almost all of ½ million infants born prematurely in the US and 15 million&#xD;
      worldwide suffer from abnormal brain maturation resulting from interactions between&#xD;
      immaturity and atypical sensory experiences after birth. The current proposal uses rigorous&#xD;
      scientific methods to measure the effects and determine the mechanisms of action of a&#xD;
      parent-supported multisensory neurorehabilitative intervention for preterm infants, adaptable&#xD;
      to a wide variety of neonatal environments, even when parents cannot be at their child's&#xD;
      bedside. The intervention aims to improve brain multisensory processing, reactions to sensory&#xD;
      stimulation in the home and long term language and motor development.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed is a randomized controlled trial design with intent-to-treat analysis in&#xD;
      hospitalized preterm infants between 32 and 36 weeks post-menstrual age. Both the control and&#xD;
      intervention groups will receive routine neonatal intensive care unit care (i.e.,&#xD;
      skin-to-skin care by parent when available and daily sessions of exposure to recorded&#xD;
      parent's voice). In addition to routine care, the parent-supported multisensory intervention&#xD;
      consists of sessions of standardized, therapist-administered, auditory-tactile stimulation&#xD;
      that combines contingent recorded mother's voice delivered using a pacifier-activated system,&#xD;
      during holding with supportive tactile containment against the therapist's chest, covered by&#xD;
      cloth imprinted with mother's scent. Possible covariates, multi- and uni-sensory processing,&#xD;
      will be measured at entry into the study and immediately after the treatment phase.&#xD;
      Event-related potential (ERP) testing will be performed prior to the prior to intervention&#xD;
      and after intervention is complete, which occurs at 36 weeks PMA on average. ERP testing will&#xD;
      take approximately 30 to 40 minutes. All infants will be seen at the NICU Follow-Up Program&#xD;
      clinics at 9-12 months PMA (Year 1) and 22-24 months PMA (Year 2), where neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed using standardized methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will also have the opportunity to consent separately to a secondary part to the study&#xD;
      in which their infant would participate in one additional ERP testing session in the NICU&#xD;
      between 34-36 weeks PMA and one additional visit to the clinical laboratory for ERP testing&#xD;
      between 3-4 months PMA. This optional, secondary part of the study is observational only and&#xD;
      does not influence randomization for the main trial. For the secondary part of the study, the&#xD;
      population will be 40 of the 200 participants. All parents who are approached for the study&#xD;
      prospectively and are randomized to control group will be asked if they would like to&#xD;
      participate in the secondary part. Enrollment for this secondary part of the study will stop&#xD;
      when 40 participants are reached.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized controlled trial design with intent-to-treat analysis in hospitalized preterm infants between 32 and 36 weeks post-menstrual age. Both the control and intervention groups will receive routine neonatal intensive care protocols (including skin-to-skin care by parent when available and daily sessions of exposure to recorded parent's voice). In addition to routine care, the parent-supported multisensory intervention consists of 10 sessions of standardized, therapist-administered, auditory-tactile stimulation that combines contingent recorded mother's voice delivered using a pacifier-activated system, during holding with supportive tactile containment against the therapist's chest, covered by cloth imprinted with mother's scent. Possible covariates, multi- and uni- sensory processing, will be measured at entry into the study and immediately after the treatment phase. Sensory reactivity will be measured at 1 year and language and motor outcomes will be assessed at 2 years.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Infant/Toddler Sensory Profile (ITSP), for ages 7 to 36 months, is a 48-item questionnaire, completed by caregivers, and is used to measure sensory reactivity and adaptation to the environment. The ITSP assesses five sensory processing sections (Auditory, Visual, Tactile, Vestibular, and Oral Sensory Processing) and a General measure. Responses are given on a 5-point scale where 1 = almost always and 5 = almost never. For children 7 to 36 months there are four quadrant scores and one combined quadrant score available. For children 12 months corrected age, the four quadrant score ranges are as follows:&#xD;
Low Registration: 11-55 (typical performance is 46-54) Sensation Seeking: 14-70 (typical performance is 19-35) Sensory Sensitivity: 11-55 (typical performance is 41-52) Sensation Avoiding: 12-60 (typical performance is 45-56) Low Threshold (combined quadrant score): 23-115 (typical performance is 87-107)</description>

    <description>Preterm infants in the NICU who are randomized to receive a multisensory intervention, in addition to the standard of care. The multisensory intervention uses recordings of the parents' voices and nurturing touch administered in the NICU during 12 to 23 sessions of standardized, therapist-administered, auditory-tactile stimulation, dispersed over a 2 to 3 week period. The intervention includes 2 components: (1) holding and light pressure containment of the infant against the hospital-gown covered chest of the therapist for tactile and non-specific auditory stimulation simultaneous with (2) playing of mother's voice contingent on infant pacifier sucking. Additionally, a gauze square scented with parent's skin will be used to provide olfactory stimulation.</description>

    <description>The Pacifier Activated Lullaby® (PAL®) device, is a digital music delivery system that integrates a sensor, a pacifier routinely used in the NICU, and a receiver. It delivers a predetermined 10 seconds of recorded parent's voice singing lullabies upon detection of a suck that meets a preset pressure threshold. The original systems were modified for research use by decreasing the lower limit of activation thresholds for delivering the recording. Minimal effort is required to trigger the device. However, the settings ensure that regular attempts are needed to continue to receive continual presentation of the recording of mother's voice by requiring another suck after 10 seconds. The auditory stimulation with PAL will be provided when the infants are still awake (i.e., at the beginning of the session).</description>

    <description>The standard of care includes parental skin-to-skin care and exposure to parent's voice. During parental skin-to-skin care, infants are placed in a prone position with head positioned over the sternum, allowing transmission of breath and heart sounds to the developing ear. Deeper pressure is applied to offer support and feedback to the child's bottom. Session length is set to a minimum of 45 minutes per unit protocols.</description>
