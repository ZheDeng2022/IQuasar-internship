  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover study to evaluate PK, safety,&#xD;
      and tolerability of a new tablet formulation of CPI-444 and to evaluate the effect of food on&#xD;
      single oral doses of CPI-444 tablets in healthy male and female subjects. Potential subjects&#xD;
      will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
      first dose administration.&#xD;
