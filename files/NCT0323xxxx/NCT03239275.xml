      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maximum anchorage is commonly required in patients with severe protrusion. Conventional&#xD;
           retraction by sliding mechanics in extraction cases have been associated with variable&#xD;
           degrees of anchorage loss. Use of miniscrew for reinforcement of orthodontic anchorage&#xD;
           has become increasingly popular in recent years. Miniscrews are convenient, save time,&#xD;
           and do not require patient cooperation. However, sliding mechanics with direct anchorage&#xD;
           from mini-screw can have several biomechanical drawbacks. The force used during&#xD;
           retraction is not reciprocal, posteriorly it is negated by the miniscrew, not by teeth.&#xD;
           As a result, either the entire arch or the anterior segment rotates around the center of&#xD;
           resistance. These mechanics produce posterior open bite and anterior deep overbite. To&#xD;
           avoid this problem, Chung et al, introduced the technique that minimizes side effects by&#xD;
           replacing the posterior appliance segments with the partially osteointegrated C-implant.&#xD;
           This system was called &quot;biocreative therapy&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           With the bio-creative approach, true intrusion vectors on the anterior teeth can be&#xD;
           applied without unwanted reactive forces affecting the posterior teeth, the posterior&#xD;
           teeth are left intact.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Labial biocreative therapy type I, a 0.016 × 0.022-in stainless steel utility&#xD;
           archwire is placed from the anterior segment into the implant tube, and gable bends are&#xD;
           used to generate an anterior torque moment on the anterior segment of the teeth to&#xD;
           provide bodily movement during en-masse retraction. On the other hand, in biocreative&#xD;
           therapy type II, en masse anterior retraction is accomplished by applying retraction&#xD;
           force via NiTi coil springs between an anterior retraction hook placed between the&#xD;
           lateral incisor and the canine and the skeletal anchorage. An overlay intrusion arch&#xD;
           wire is used to generate torque on the anterior segment of teeth; thereby various&#xD;
           patterns of tooth movement can be obtained through the combination of intrusion force,&#xD;
           retraction force, and length of the retraction hook. Location and management of the&#xD;
           center of resistance (Cres) with respect to retraction force vectors is critical. The&#xD;
           clinician should select the length of a power arm according to the desired type of tooth&#xD;
           movement; controlled lingual crown tipping, root tipping, or bodily movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adult orthodontics is an increasing part of the orthodontic practice. However, adult&#xD;
           patients are often annoyed by the appearance of labial brackets and tend to delay or&#xD;
           avoid starting orthodontic treatment. Lingual orthodontics is a viable option for these&#xD;
           patients as being &quot;invisible orthodontic treatment&quot;. The disadvantages of lingual&#xD;
           orthodontics include the excessive chair time, complicated bio-mechanics, patient&#xD;
           discomfort, expensive lab procedures, and high material prices. However, several&#xD;
           innovations have improved the use of lingual orthodontics, such as customized lingual&#xD;
           brackets and two-dimensional lingual brackets that can be bonded directly. Nonetheless,&#xD;
           the efficient control of anterior torque and intrusion during retraction continues to be&#xD;
           a limiting challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mini-implants placed on each side of the palate have been used in conjunction with&#xD;
           lingual orthodontics to avoid uncontrolled tipping and the deepening of the anterior&#xD;
           bite during en masse retraction. A lever arm is soldered to the main lingual arch wire.&#xD;
           This moves the force vector apically and closer to the center of resistance, thereby&#xD;
           allowing better control of torque during retraction. However, play within the slot&#xD;
           allows some of the torque to be lost during retraction. In addition, unwanted canting of&#xD;
           the occlusal plane may occur if bilateral mini-implants are not in the same horizontal&#xD;
           plane, due to different force vectors generated during retraction. Moreover, the sliding&#xD;
           mechanics may be adversely affected by friction within bracket slots and tubes, causing&#xD;
           unwanted distalization of posterior teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lingual Biocreative therapy for anterior retraction offers several advantages. En masse&#xD;
           retraction of the maxillary anterior dentition is achieved using C-lingual retractor and&#xD;
           C-palatal plate. The C-lingual retractor is bonded to the lingual surfaces of the upper&#xD;
           six anteriors, providing excellent esthetics. The C-palatal plate is fixed near the&#xD;
           median palatal suture with mini-implants. The upper posterior orthodontic appliances are&#xD;
           not needed as anchorage for 3-dimensional retraction of the upper anteriors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lingual biocreative therapy technique can be used to provide patients with esthetic&#xD;
           treatment, excellent anchorage control offered by skeletal anchorage, rapid and&#xD;
           controlled retraction, simplified orthodontic bio-mechanics, and avoiding unnecessary&#xD;
           use of complex orthodontic devices. Posterior teeth are not disturbed by friction in the&#xD;
           appliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As the majority of research work related to biocreative therapy technique was mainly&#xD;
           case reports, three-dimensional finite element analyses, and three retrospective studies&#xD;
           using two-dimensional cephalometric data, and the fact that no studies; up to the time&#xD;
           of this writing; compared the labial and lingual biocreative techniques, the idea of&#xD;
           this study has aroused as to use the advanced technology of three-dimensional imaging to&#xD;
           clinically evaluate and compare the effects of labial and lingual biocreative therapy&#xD;
           for en masse retraction of the maxillary anterior teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The null hypothesis (H0) of this research is that there will be no statistically&#xD;
           significant differences between labial and lingual biocreative therapy in the mean&#xD;
           change in the upper incisor inclination after en masse retraction of the anterior teeth&#xD;
           in subjects with class II malocclusion requiring upper first premolar extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of this study is to determine if there will be statistically&#xD;
           significant differences between labial and lingual biocreative therapy in the mean&#xD;
           change in the upper incisor inclination after en masse retraction of the anterior teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To compare between labial and lingual biocreative therapy regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in the soft tissue parameters including the nasolabial angle, inter-labial&#xD;
                gap, and position of the upper and lower lips in the antero-posterior dimension;&#xD;
                that would contribute to soft tissue profile correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Molar anchorage loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient satisfaction from treatment with either the labial or lingual biocreative&#xD;
                therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vertical movement of the crown of the six maxillary anterior teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in the transverse dimension of the upper arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Skeletal measurements including the mean change in the position of point A from the&#xD;
                Nasion perpendicular plane and change in the SNA angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time duration required to complete the retraction phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study design According to the norms of the CONSORT STATEMENT, this study will be&#xD;
           clinical with intervention, in which the allocation of the subjects will be randomized&#xD;
           (block randomization). This study will be parallel with blinding for the outcome&#xD;
           assessors. The primary purpose of this study will be treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants - Settings and locations where the data are collected The treatment will be&#xD;
           performed in the outpatient clinics of Department of Orthodontics of Ain Shams&#xD;
           University. This public university predominantly serves low-income population living in&#xD;
           Cairo, Egypt. Data will be collected from January 2016 through November 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Interventions Two groups will receive treatment. Group 1 will be treated with the labial&#xD;
           biocreative therapy group until the achievement of normal overjet (1 to 3 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will be treated with lingual biocreative therapy group until the achievement of&#xD;
      normal overjet (1 to 3 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7a. Sample size Sample size calculation was based on the studies by Kim et al and Kim et al.&#xD;
      For the labial group, a mean change in the upper incisor inclination to SN plane of 15.33&#xD;
      degrees, with a standard deviation of 6.85 was reported by Kim et al who compared&#xD;
      pre-treatment cephalometric radiographs with those taken after en-masse retraction of the 6&#xD;
      anterior teeth using temporary skeletal anchorage devices as the exclusive source of&#xD;
      anchorage. No brackets or bands were placed on the posterior dentition during retraction.&#xD;
      Regarding the lingual group, the mean change in the upper incisor inclination to SN plane of&#xD;
      7.8 degrees, with a standard deviation of 5.5 was reported by Kim et al who compared&#xD;
      pre-treatment cephalometric radiographs with those taken after en-masse retraction of the 6&#xD;
      anterior teeth using the lingual biocreative therapy technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect size ratio was calculated to be 1.212 using G*power software (Universität&#xD;
      Düsseldorf, Germany). A t-test assuming equal variance for two independent groups was used&#xD;
      and the power was set as 0.8, allocation ratio of 1:1 and the Type I error probability&#xD;
      (alpha) associated with this test was set as 0.05. Results of the test showed that &quot;the group&#xD;
      sample sizes of 12 each would achieve 80.09% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal&#xD;
      means with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample equal variance&#xD;
      t-test&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, 24 subjects will be needed, with 12 subjects in each group. To account for patient&#xD;
      loss to follow up (attrition), a sample size of 30 patients will be selected and divided into&#xD;
      two groups, fifteen each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7b. Interim analysis and stopping guidelines In both groups, in case of mobility in the&#xD;
      skeletal anchorage device used in any subject, the load will be removed for about two weeks&#xD;
      and oral hygiene instructions will be reinforced. After that, the load will be restored. If&#xD;
      the mobility persists, surgical exposure of the skeletal anchorage device will be done and&#xD;
      either insertion of longer mini screws or a change in the position of the skeletal anchorage&#xD;
      device will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any harms, adverse effects or unintended effects of the study intervention will be documented&#xD;
      and reported. Post-surgical swelling and pain are anticipated and will be addressed by&#xD;
      antibiotics and pain killers. Other unanticipated surgical harms have to be immediately&#xD;
      managed and will be reported. Harms related to the orthodontic appliances will be managed by&#xD;
      the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Randomization 8a. Sequence generation The randomization of the recruited subjects will be&#xD;
      done with a randomized list, using random.org website. This list is made by an individual not&#xD;
      involved in the clinical trial (A.Z.) 8b. Type The type of randomization will be block&#xD;
      randomization. The number of blocks and block size will be blinded to the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Allocation and concealment mechanism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each patient will be allocated a number from sequentially numbered opaque sealed&#xD;
           envelopes after fulfilment of the inclusion criteria and signing the informed consent to&#xD;
           be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  According to the number, the patients will be then allocated into one of the groups&#xD;
           using a randomization table.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10. Implementation Before the beginning of the research, the allocation sequence will be&#xD;
           generated by a person not involved in the study (Dr A.Z.). The random list will be&#xD;
           sealed from the principal investigator who will enrol participants. After the&#xD;
           participant takes a sealed number, A.Z. will be contacted to implement the allocation.&#xD;
           All the study contributors will have no access to the random list. The envelopes will be&#xD;
           closed with the type of treatment selected for storage of the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11. Blinding Blinding will be carried out only for the data assessment because the&#xD;
           researchers, participants and subjects can not be blinded. Therefore, a person who does&#xD;
           not know the nature of the trial will analyze the data.&#xD;
