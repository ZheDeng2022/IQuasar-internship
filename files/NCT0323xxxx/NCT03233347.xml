    <textblock>
      This phase II trial evaluates how well AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) in&#xD;
      combination with brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab work in treating patients with stage I-II&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma. Drugs used in the chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, vinblastine,&#xD;
      dacarbazine, and brentuximab vedotin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, and/or by stopping them&#xD;
      from spreading. Targeted agent, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread by enhancing the immune system. Giving doxorubicin, vinblastine,&#xD;
      dacarbazine, brentuximab vedotin, and nivolumab may improve survival of patients with stage&#xD;
      I-II Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 years in patients with previously&#xD;
      untreated stage I or II non-bulky Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) who received doxorubicin,&#xD;
      vinblastine, dacarbazine (AVD) plus brentuximab vedotin (BV) induction therapy followed by&#xD;
      nivolumab (N)VB consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the overall survival (OS) rate at 3 years in patients with previously&#xD;
      untreated stage I or II non-bulky HL who received AVD plus BV induction therapy followed by&#xD;
      NVB consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the percentage of patients with untreated stage I or II non-bulky HL who are&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) positive versus PET negative after 3 cycles of AVD plus BV&#xD;
      induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate PFS and OS at 3 and 5 years separately for patients who are PET negative&#xD;
      versus PET positive after 3 cycles of AVD plus BV induction followed by NVB consolidation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate time to progression (TTP) in patients with previously untreated stage I or II&#xD;
      non-bulky HL who received AVD plus BV induction therapy followed by NVB consolidation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate the overall response rate and the number of patients who convert to complete&#xD;
      response (CMR) after NVB in patients with partial response (PMR) at the end of AVD plus BV&#xD;
      induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To estimate the duration of response in patients with previously untreated stage I or II&#xD;
      non-bulky Hodgkin's lymphoma who received AVD plus BV induction therapy followed by NVB&#xD;
      consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of AVD plus BV induction followed by NVB&#xD;
      consolidation therapy as assessed via the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version [v]4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Optional biopsy tissue samples will be collected for future analysis. II. Optional blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected for future analysis. III. Cost-benefit analysis of AVD plus BV&#xD;
      followed by NVB consolidation, compared to the current standard therapy with adriamycin,&#xD;
      bleomycin, vinblastine plus dacarbazine (ABVD) with or without radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive doxorubicin intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes, vinblastine IV over 3-5&#xD;
      minutes, and dacarbazine IV over &gt;= 30 minutes, and brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with PET-positive then receive brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin IV over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      2 weeks for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      PET-positive patients then receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 2 weeks for 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      PET-negative patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 starting after AVD and BV&#xD;
      treatment. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 8 weeks, every 3 or 6&#xD;
      months for 2 years, and then once a year for 3 years.&#xD;
