      INTRODUCTION: Accurate estimation of dry weight (DW) is an important and difficult problem in&#xD;
      clinical practice. DW is defined as the lowest weight after hemodialysis (HD) where the&#xD;
      patient will not develop symptoms of hypotension and edema, in addition to not using&#xD;
      antihypertensives. Achieving a fluid balance benefits the control of blood pressure and&#xD;
      reduces cardiovascular risk. In most HD centers, the DW is estimated using a subjective&#xD;
      method dependent on the signs and symptoms that the patient presents. Recently, several&#xD;
      approaches have been studied to develop a standardized DW evaluation technique. Among these,&#xD;
      the analysis of electric bioimpedance vectors (BIVA) has been recognized as a simple and&#xD;
      promising method with high reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To use BIVA to improve dry weight estimation in patients with chronic renal&#xD;
      failure undergoing hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a non-randomized pre-test / post-test clinical trial, where the universe of&#xD;
      patients comes from the hemodialysis unit of the General State Hospital of Sonora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have limb amputations, pacemakers, metal implants, who are under renal&#xD;
      transplant protocol or who have a renal transplant, and presence of infectious foci will be&#xD;
      restricted from participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of DW in the patients will be performed for modification and follow-up. Fluid&#xD;
      status will be evaluated using BIVA. Measurements will be made before and after HD in three&#xD;
      consecutive weekly periods and one one final assessment at three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of each period, weight, electrolytes, creatinine, total proteins, albumin,&#xD;
      pre-albumin, urea and blood pressure will be measured to calculate the Malnutrition&#xD;
      Inflammation Score and Bilbrey Index. At the end of the HD protocol of each period, body&#xD;
      composition and muscle strength will be evaluated through triceps skinfold, mid-upper arm&#xD;
      circumference and dynamometry. The dialysis dose received will be modified according to BIVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main variables to be considered will be DW, extracellular water and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study will be approximately 6 months. In addition, at the end of each&#xD;
      measurement, each participant will be given a nutritional recommendation (feeding guide)&#xD;
      specific to their energy requirements.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      -  Place of study: General Hospital of the State of Sonora &quot;Dr. Ernesto Ramos Bours&quot; in the&#xD;
           city of Hermosillo, Sonora.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sociodemographic and symptomatological information questionnaire: Questionnaires will be&#xD;
           applied to each participant, which will allow to obtain information of their occupation,&#xD;
           residence, date of birth, their own medical and family history, as well as typical&#xD;
           symptoms of the diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight: The weight will be measured with a SECA Model 813 Portable Floor Scale. The&#xD;
           person should wear light clothing, empty pockets, without shoes, accessories (belts,&#xD;
           necklaces, watches, etc.); In a firm position, facing forward, without movement at the&#xD;
           time of taking the measurement. Weight measurement should be the simplest and most&#xD;
           accurate of anthropometric measurements, the balance should be calibrated periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height: The height will be measured with a portable stadiometer Model 217 SECA. The&#xD;
           participant is presented for the measurement of the height dressed with the minimum of&#xD;
           clothes, at least, without shoes and socks. The participant is instructed to stand on&#xD;
           the stadiometer so that his heels, gluteus, and shoulder blades are in contact with the&#xD;
           back plate, and the heels together. The head should be placed on the &quot;Frankfurt Plane&quot;,&#xD;
           the head of the instrument will move down to make contact with the apex of the skull.&#xD;
           With the subject in the correct position, he is instructed: &quot;take a deep breath and&#xD;
           stand tall&quot;. The height is measured at the point of inspiration without pressure being&#xD;
           applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single-frequency bioimpedance (BIA): The BIA measurement will be performed according to&#xD;
           the established criteria by the National Institute of Health Technology Assessment&#xD;
           Conference Statement. The subject will be placed supine, with arms and legs separated&#xD;
           from the body and palms down. The electrodes will be located in the right extremities,&#xD;
           located on the back of the hand and foot near the phalangeal-metacarpal and&#xD;
           phalangeal-metatarsal joints and in the styloid process of the wrist and between the&#xD;
           medial and lateral malleolus of the ankle, through which an imperceptible electric&#xD;
           current will be introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects should be under the following conditions so that the study can be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fast four hours before the measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not having consumed alcoholic beverages during the 48 hours prior to the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No strenuous exercise 24 hours prior to measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the case of women, do not menstruate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not have any metal objects on the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The approximate measurement time is five minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vector analysis of electric bioimpedance (BIVA): The variables of resistance (R),&#xD;
                Reactance (Xc) and size of each of the individuals measured to be plotted in the&#xD;
                reference ellipses of the Mexican population by sex will be used. The R and Xc&#xD;
                standardized by size (R / size and Xc / size) will be used to plot the vector of&#xD;
                individuals within the percentiles 50, 75 and 95% of tolerance ellipses,&#xD;
                differentiated by sex, using the BIVA program Software 2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical assessment of dry weight and hemodialysis (HD) process: Based on the&#xD;
                traditional practices of the Hospital dialysis unit, the physician / nurse will&#xD;
                perform physical examination and interpret the signs and symptoms associated with&#xD;
                the renal disease, these are blood pressure , heart rate, respiratory rate,&#xD;
                temperature, presence of infection and edema. This will include present and past&#xD;
                health-disease aspects, medications, as well as information on the patient's daily&#xD;
                life. Upon arrival, the patient will be weighed according to the methodology&#xD;
                described above. According to the traditional practice of the Hospital Dialysis&#xD;
                Unit, the patient's target weight will be based on the difference between the&#xD;
                post-dialysis weight of the last session and the current weight, in addition to&#xD;
                taking into account the signs and symptoms Mentioned above, In order to determine&#xD;
                the excess water of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of fluid to be withdrawn to the patient, the ultrafiltration rate and the duration&#xD;
      time are determined by the nephrologist physician in consultation prior to the HD session.&#xD;
      Such information may be modified in the HD session depending on the clinical evaluation of&#xD;
      the patient on the day of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting HD, the patient's vascular access is prepared with three alcohol times and&#xD;
      three times of 10% EXSEPT, and the clot is removed from the access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time, ultrafiltration rate and the amount of liquid to be filtered on the HD machine&#xD;
      (Fresenius Medical Care 4008 S - OCM Kt / V) are then programmed. Once programmed, it&#xD;
      connects To the patient and heparin is administered at an initial bolus and at each hour of&#xD;
      treatment. A total of 100 units per kg of body weight is given and the total is divided&#xD;
      between the initial bolus and each hour of treatment. The mechanism by which the HD machine&#xD;
      works is as follows: A pump directs the patient's blood to a filter of Polysulfone fibers,&#xD;
      blood runs up-down, while a dialysing solution (its content is similar to normal blood&#xD;
      plasma) flows in the opposite direction. By means of osmosis and the pressure exerted by the&#xD;
      filter, excess substances are removed from the patient's blood and, if any of the plasma&#xD;
      components are deficient, is absorbed from the dialysing solution. The blood is returned to&#xD;
      the patient and heparin is supplied at both catheter outlets to avoid coagulation. The&#xD;
      catheter is then sealed with a stopper and a patch is placed to prevent contact with the&#xD;
      outside medium. Finally, the vital signs are reviewed again and the appointment is scheduled&#xD;
      for the next treatment. In case the vital signs are altered, the patient is immediately&#xD;
      referred to the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory parameters: Pre and post-dialysis patient blood samples will be taken to&#xD;
           analyze the following parameters: serum electrolytes, blood biometrics, blood chemistry&#xD;
           and Hepatic function. If feasible, the PCR will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure: Blood pressure will be measured with an automatic monitor included in&#xD;
           the hemodialysis equipment (Fresenius Medical Care 4008 S - OCM Kt / V). To perform the&#xD;
           measurement, the patient has to be relaxed and seated comfortably, at a comfortable&#xD;
           ambient temperature. Do not bathe, drink alcohol or caffeine, smoke, exercise or eat 30&#xD;
           minutes before taking the measurement. The participants should sit in a chair with their&#xD;
           feet flat on the floor, the back straight and the arm band should be at the same level&#xD;
           as their heart with the palm up and relaxed. The nurse will start by palpating the arm&#xD;
           for the pulse of the brachial artery, where the diaphragm of the stethoscope will be&#xD;
           placed. This artery is located between the brachial and brachial biceps muscles; In its&#xD;
           lower-lateral path accompanies the median nerve. The bracelet should be placed to take&#xD;
           the measurement.Special considerations: - In patients with peripheral insertion of&#xD;
           central catheters, the upper arm should be avoided in which there is a central&#xD;
           peripheral insertion catheter. - In patients with a bypass Dialysis, or fistula, blood&#xD;
           pressure should be taken in the opposite arm if the patient has an arteriovenous&#xD;
           insertion or fistula necessary for dialysis, this is to avoid possible trauma or clot&#xD;
           formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutritional intervention: Patients will be made aware of the importance of adherence to&#xD;
           nutritional treatment through individualized sessions, addressing the following topics:&#xD;
           a) how to ensure adequate energy and protein intake, b) how to control fluid, sodium and&#xD;
           potassium intake, identifying foods rich in them, c) Incorrect feeding, d) food&#xD;
           preparation techniques, among others. Also, in each session, depending on the patient's&#xD;
           nutritional status, laboratory values and comorbidities, a personalized feeding guide&#xD;
           will be provided, which will include the foods to be consumed and in what quantities,&#xD;
           using the Mexican equivalents system for renal patients and the current Kidney Disease&#xD;
           Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS), Bilbrey Index and subjective global assessment:&#xD;
           These are instruments that will be used to establish a Nutritional diagnosis of each&#xD;
           patient. Clinical, biochemical and anthropometric parameters are evaluated. Each of the&#xD;
           measurements will be made according to the current standardized methodology.&#xD;
