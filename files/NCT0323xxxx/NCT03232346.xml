  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open--label randomized outpatient trial to evaluate feasibility and efficacy&#xD;
      of rapid buprenorphine (BUP) discontinuation followed by brief course of treatment with&#xD;
      long--acting naltrexone (XR--NTX) and to compare it to the standard method of gradual BUP&#xD;
      taper.Individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) (N=60) who have successfully completed at&#xD;
      least 6 months of buprenorphine treatment and do not wish to remain in a long--term&#xD;
      buprenorphine maintenance program will be recruited. The first phase includes a 4--week&#xD;
      period of stabilization on buprenorphine 4--8 mg at the research clinic to assure that&#xD;
      patients are stable, compliant, and free from illicit opioids. Participants that meet the&#xD;
      above criteria will be randomized 1:1 to: 1) buprenorphine discontinuation and outpatient&#xD;
      transition to XR--NTX with 3 monthly injections, or 2) buprenorphine discontinuation using a&#xD;
      gradual 5-week long taper. In both groups participants will receive weekly relapse prevention&#xD;
      therapy and will be monitored for the duration of the trial, which is 25 weeks post&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
