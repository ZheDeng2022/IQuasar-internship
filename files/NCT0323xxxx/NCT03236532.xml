      This study aimed to investigate the effect of an exercise session with weights associated&#xD;
      with glutamine dipeptide (GLD) supplementation on cognitive function of people living with&#xD;
      HIV/ AIDS. The sample consisted of 10 HIV+ women, who used the Antiretroviral Therapy Highly&#xD;
      Active. The participants were randomized in a double-blind procedure to receive seven days of&#xD;
      supplementation GLD or placebo (PLA). At the end of this first period, the participants held&#xD;
      a workout with weights with cognitive assessments before and immediately after the session.&#xD;
      To evaluate oxidative stress markers blood samples were collected before and 1 hour and 2&#xD;
      hours after the session.Then the participants rested for 7 days for the initial stocks of&#xD;
      glutamine return to baseline levels (washout). Following was realized the crossing of the&#xD;
      groups, so those who had received the GLD in the first week spent extra for 7 days with PLA&#xD;
      and vice versa, and then they repeated evaluations and exercise session. The exercise session&#xD;
      consisted of seven resistance exercises involving different muscle groups, with three sets of&#xD;
      8-12 repetitions with an interval of 90 seconds between sets and 120 seconds between the&#xD;
      exercises. Stroop test was used to cognitive assessments, which aims to assess selective&#xD;
      attention and inhibitory control over the color of conflict and word, and the N-back test,&#xD;
      responsible for evaluating the central executive component of working memory by stimuli&#xD;
      visual. Oxidative stress markers (TBARS, FOX, GSH, GSSG, AOPP) were analyzed in plasma&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;

      The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a short period of&#xD;
      supplementation with glutamine dipeptide (GDP) in the acute responses to resistance training&#xD;
      on people living with HIV/AIDS i the following healthy indicators: executive functions,&#xD;
      stress oxidative markers, cardiovascular functions, inflammatory markers and biochemical&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants 14 women diagnosed with HIV+ participated in this study. As inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      they should be over 18 years old; they should have regularly been using the Antiretroviral&#xD;
      Therapy (ART) for more than six months; they should have a stabilized clinical picture and&#xD;
      viral load; they should not have participated in physical training programs during the&#xD;
      preceding six months; they should not show acute or chronic inflammations that could affect&#xD;
      the practice of physical exercise; they should not have psychiatric disorders; and they&#xD;
      should not be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individuals who met the inclusion criteria received clinical evaluation by the infectious&#xD;
      physician responsible for the treatment based on the history of each patient, the laboratory&#xD;
      tests and the clinical picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Standing Committee on Ethical Research with Humans of the State&#xD;
      University of Maringá - PR - Brazil. The volunteers signed the Free Informed Consent Form,&#xD;
      after being informed about the study proposal and the procedures they would be submitted to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, four participants were not able to attend all the evaluations and&#xD;
      were excluded from the final analysis. Therefore, 10 women participated in all the procedures&#xD;
      and were part of the final sample of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design The study had a total duration of five weeks divided into two phases. The&#xD;
      first phase lasted two weeks and was characterized by the familiarization with the exercises&#xD;
      that would be done in the second phase. This protocol consisted of four sessions of&#xD;
      exercises, every 48 hours, which submitted the individuals to the same procedures that would&#xD;
      be done in the second phase. Four familiarization sessions were chosen, one of which was&#xD;
      aimed at learning the exercises without the insertion of loads. Then, the participants could&#xD;
      rest for a week before starting the second phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase consisted of three stages; each of them lasted one week. In the first stage,&#xD;
      the participants were initially randomly separated in a double-blind way in order to ingest&#xD;
      either the GDP (Condition 1) or maltodextrin as a placebo (Condition 2) for seven days. On&#xD;
      the seventh and last day of supplementation, they were submitted to the resistance training&#xD;
      session. Before the exercise session the cognitive tests were applied, blood samples were&#xD;
      collected for analysis of biochemical, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. Immediately&#xD;
      after the exercise session the cognitive tests were repeated. Blood samples were also&#xD;
      collected 1 and 2 hours after the exercise training. Cardiovascular functions were&#xD;
      monitorated during 1 hour after the exercise session, every 10 minutes. After these&#xD;
      procedures there was one-week rest period (step 2). Then, the procedures performed in the&#xD;
      first step were repeated (step 3). However, the group that had received GDP started to&#xD;
      receive maltodextrin, and the group who had received maltodextrin started to receive GDP,&#xD;
      adopting, thus, a randomized double-blind crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resistance training protocol The exercises were based on the Guideline for the&#xD;
      prescription of exercise to be given to people with HIV/AIDS. The training session consisted&#xD;
      of seven exercises with weights (chest press, leg press 45º, lat pulldown machine, knee&#xD;
      extension, triceps pulley, knee curl, Scott biceps curl machine) involving different muscle&#xD;
      groups with three series per exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recovery interval adopted was of 90 seconds between the series and 120 seconds between&#xD;
      exercises. The number of repetitions used in each one of these series was of 8-12 repetitions&#xD;
      by applying the method of fixed loads. The loads were compatible with the number of&#xD;
      repetitions stipulated for each exercise. The load determination occurred during&#xD;
      familiarization sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OMNI Resistance Exercise Scale (OMNI-RES) of effort subjective perception was used to&#xD;
      determine and control the loads of each exercise. The loads used during the experimental&#xD;
      sessions corresponded to the intensity equivalent to the interval from five to seven (5-7) of&#xD;
      the OMNI-RES scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve such a purpose, prior to the beginning of familiarization with the&#xD;
      exercises, the OMNI-RES scale anchoring was performed. This procedure consists of placing the&#xD;
      patient in the smallest and highest possible load in each exercise so that he/she can&#xD;
      differentiate a smaller and a greater subjective perception of effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation Protocol The participants were randomly double-blinded indicated to receive&#xD;
      either GDP (20g/day) or maltodextrin (20g/day) according to the literature. The substances&#xD;
      were packed in sachets containing GDP or maltodextrin (placebo). The packages were identical&#xD;
      and the substances used had a similar color and texture. Participants were instructed to&#xD;
      dilute GDP or maltodextrin in 300 ml of water and ingest it after lunch. In case of&#xD;
      forgetfulness, they were suggested to ingest it soon after dinner. All participants were&#xD;
      instructed to maintain their routine eating habits throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the cognitive status Considering the general evaluation of possible cognitive&#xD;
      impairments, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used, which provides information on&#xD;
      different cognitive parameters, considering the level of education of the individual&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the indicatives of HIV-associated dementia the International HIV Dementia&#xD;
      Scale was applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Executive Functions The Victoria Stroop color-word test was used to evaluate the executive&#xD;
      functions, which consists of 72 stimuli, distributed in three cards with 24 items each (A, B,&#xD;
      C). The subject must verbalize the name of the colors with which the stimuli of each card&#xD;
      were printed as quickly as possible; the time spent to read each of the cards separately was&#xD;
      registered. The latency time, which is determined by the difference between the time spent&#xD;
      with the responses to the three cards, was used to evaluate selective attention and&#xD;
      inhibitory control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The n-back test was used to evaluate the operational memory. Visual stimuli were used in this&#xD;
      study, which were represented by colors, divided into three levels (N1, N2, and N3) with 150&#xD;
      stimuli each. The score of each participant was obtained from the percentage values of the&#xD;
      hits recorded in the three levels in a computerized version of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical analysis Blood samples (10ml) were collected by venose puncture in heparinized&#xD;
      vacutainer® tubes. Plasma glucose concentration were determined both using a glucose analyzer&#xD;
      and using standard kit. Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were analysed by&#xD;
      standard methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory markers Plasma samples were also used to analyse interleukins 2, 6, 8 and 10 and&#xD;
      TNFα using standard kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress markers Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) was determined by high-performance&#xD;
      liquid chromatography (UV/VIS SPD-20A SHIMADZU, Kioto, Japan) as described by Nielsen et al.&#xD;
      Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and Total hydroperoxide (FOX) were assessed&#xD;
      as plasma lipid peroxidation biomarkers according to method described by Costa et al, and the&#xD;
      advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) were based on the method described by Witko-Sarsat&#xD;
      et al. GSH and GSSG contents were measured using standart kits. Antioxidant enzyme&#xD;
      activities, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were determined according to Somani&#xD;
      et al and Aebi, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular functions The evaluation of the participants' cardiovascular responses were&#xD;
      made through the Checking of Resting Blood Pressure with the use of a Sphygmomanometer. All&#xD;
      measurements were performed with main arm, in triplicate, with patients lying at rest for at&#xD;
      least 10 minutes. The heart rate were continuously monitored, after the exercise session,&#xD;
      through a cardiac frequency monitor over an hour, every 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomic modulation of the cardiovascular system were analyzed by means of the spectral&#xD;
      analysis of heart rate variability. For this, the individuals were in rest, in the pre- and&#xD;
      post-exercise moments.&#xD;
