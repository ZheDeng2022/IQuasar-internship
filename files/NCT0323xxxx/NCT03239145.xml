  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying an investigational combination of drugs as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for advanced solid tumors: melanoma, ovarian, renal, or colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AMG386&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase Ib clinical trial, which tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational combination of drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational drugs to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved of the combination of the study&#xD;
      drugs pembrolizumab and AMG386 as a treatment for any disease. However, the FDA has approved&#xD;
      pembrolizumab by itself for melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, or specialized type of protein, produced in&#xD;
      the laboratory for use in treating patients with the participant disease. Pembrolizumab is&#xD;
      designed to augment the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and target cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMG386 is a drug that may kill tumor cells and blocks blood vessels that supply the tumor&#xD;
      with nutrients and oxygen. Drugs that block blood vessel formation are called&#xD;
      &quot;anti-angiogenic&quot; therapies. AMG386 has been used and is currently being used in other&#xD;
      clinical trials treating different types of cancer. Information from these other clinical&#xD;
      trials suggests that this drug may help stop tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are interested in looking at the combination of&#xD;
      AMG386 with pembrolizumab because research done in the laboratory has suggested that the&#xD;
      immunotherapy effect could be limited by the presence of tumor vessels in a process called&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Adding AMG386 to pembrolizumab may help overcome this limitation and augment&#xD;
      the effect of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This combination of study drugs is being researched to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab and AMG386 at different dose&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the side effects of pembrolizumab and AMG386 when they are given in&#xD;
           combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if pembrolizumab in combination with AMG386 is a possible treatment for cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if pembrolizumab in combination with AMG386 changes immune cells in the blood&#xD;
           or tumor&#xD;
