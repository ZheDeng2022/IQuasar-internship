  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A great medical success is the increase in the median survival age associated with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis (CF). However, this success has led to a new era of research aiming to maximise the&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL) of the aging CF population. Over recent decades, exercise training has&#xD;
      become an integral part of CF management by improving ones aerobic exercise function and QoL.&#xD;
      However, the effects exercise training has upon other aspects of the disease, e.g. metabolic&#xD;
      and vascular abnormalities, remains largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased survival age associated with CF means the non-pulmonary co-morbidities are&#xD;
      becoming increasingly prevalent and clinically important. For example, CF-related diabetes&#xD;
      (CFRD) is one of the most common non-pulmonary co-morbidities of CF, and is associated with&#xD;
      patients having a poorer pulmonary function and nutritional state, which ultimately leads to&#xD;
      a worsened prognosis. Despite the efficacy of exercise training to manage dysglycaemia in&#xD;
      other populations (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus only a single study has investigated its&#xD;
      efficacy in patients with CF, whereby authors reported various encouraging findings (e.g. an&#xD;
      improved OGTT score and insulin sensitivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to build on previous trials by comparing the therapeutic effects of a&#xD;
      single session of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) and moderate intensity exercise&#xD;
      (MIE) upon the 24 hour, ambulatory glycaemic profile of patients with CF. Additionally, the&#xD;
      present study will identify whether HIIE and/or MIE can mediate the consequences of transient&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia when considering: biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress and nitric&#xD;
      oxide (NO2) bioavailability, as well as functional measures of microvascular endothelial&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study supports the top 10 research priorities set by the CF Trust, by further&#xD;
      investigating the potential for exercise training to prevent/manage multiple aspects of CF,&#xD;
      including dysglycaemia.&#xD;

      Participants and recruitment The present study will be a pilot, counter-balanced, cross-over&#xD;
      trial in individuals with CF (n = 16). Furthermore, the present protocol is an extension of&#xD;
      the CFit_BL protocol (Clinical Trials ID to be confirmed). Specifically, 16 participants with&#xD;
      CF will be invited to complete 2 visits (5 in total) within the same 14 day time period.&#xD;
      Briefly, participants will be recruited from adult and paediatric CF outpatient clinics&#xD;
      within the Southampton CF network, and will be tested at a laboratory within the Southampton&#xD;
      General Hospital or the Department of Sport and Exercise Sciences (University of Portsmouth),&#xD;
      depending on participant convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will comprise 2 visits which will be in a randomised, counter-balanced&#xD;
      order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 1 and 2 A session of moderate intensity exercise (MIE) training and high-intensity&#xD;
      interval exercise (HIIE) training visit will be conducted in a randomised, counter-balanced&#xD;
      order. Participants will be required to arrive to the laboratory ~ 96 hours following the&#xD;
      previous visit, at 0800 ± 2 hours, following an overnight fast (&gt; 10 hours). Furthermore,&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to avoid nitrate rich foods, caffeine, alcohol and exhaustive&#xD;
      exercise for 24 hours prior to arrival, as well as mouthwash for the entirety of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival, CGM's will be fixed to the interior surface of the upper arm and worn for the&#xD;
      subsequent 14 days. In addition to this, hip worn accelerometers, as well as hourly specific&#xD;
      physical activity and food diaries will be distributed and completed for 14 days alongside&#xD;
      the CGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival participants will undergo the acetylcholine (ACh) and insulin iontophoresis&#xD;
      protocols described below, including 5 resting blood pressure measurements and a cannula will&#xD;
      be inserted into a vein by a trained phlebotomist, prior to the 3 hour OGTT and a baseline&#xD;
      blood sample will be taken. The participant's pulmonary function will be assessed via&#xD;
      spirometry. Participants will then be asked to complete either a single session of either MIE&#xD;
      or HIIE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function will then be assessed immediately post-exercise. 1 hour following&#xD;
      exercise, the iontophoresis procedures will be repeated. Blood samples will be drawn&#xD;
      immediately pre- and post-exercise for the analysis of plasma TNF-α, soluble vascular cell&#xD;
      adhesion molecule (sVCAM)-1, IL-6, [NO-(₂)] and ET-1. Samples for nitrotyrosine (NT), total&#xD;
      glutathione (tGSH) and total cysteine (tCys) will be drawn pre-exercise only. Subsequently,&#xD;
      participants will partake in either 30 minutes of MIE or a work-matched period of HIIE.&#xD;
      Thirty minutes following the completion of the exercising procedures, the iontophoresis&#xD;
      procedures will be repeated and blood samples will be drawn for the analysis of plasma&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, TNF-α, sVCAM-1, IL-6, [NO-(₂)] and ET-1. NT, tGSH and tCys. Following this,&#xD;
      1.75 g/kg body mass (maximum of 75 g) of anhydrous glucose will be consumed to instigate the&#xD;
      3 hour OGTT, whereby blood samples will be drawn at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes&#xD;
      post-glucose ingestion for the analysis of glucose and insulin. Samples for TNF-α, sVCAM-1,&#xD;
      IL-6, [NO-(₂)] and ET-1 will be drawn at 60, 120 and 180 minutes post-glucose ingestion. NT,&#xD;
      tGSH and tCys will be analysed at 120 minutes post-glucose ingestion. The total volume of&#xD;
      blood collected over each 5 hour visit will be approximately 232 mL. Additionally, the&#xD;
      iontophoresis procedures will be repeated at 30, 90 and 150 minutes post-glucose ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up CGM's, accelerometers and physical activity/food diaries will be completed&#xD;
      throughout this 14 day period. A member of the research team will collect these from the&#xD;
      preferred location of the participant.&#xD;
