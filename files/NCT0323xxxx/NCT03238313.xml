  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if exposure to the &quot;Plan A&quot; video influences&#xD;
      viewers' uptake of LARC, reduces unprotected sexual activity, and increases receipt of STI&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Policy &amp; Research Group (PRG) is evaluating the &quot;Plan A&quot; video, which was designed to&#xD;
      promote effective contraceptive use, use of dual methods of protection (condom use and&#xD;
      prescription birth control use), and HIV/STI testing in African/American and Latina young&#xD;
      women. The video is approximately 23 minutes in length and is shown immediately prior to a&#xD;
      clinical appointment at a reproductive health center. By delivering the intervention prior to&#xD;
      a clinic appointment, developers hope to reach high-risk teens at a teachable moment, when&#xD;
      they can ask a health care provider about what they have learned. The primary focus of the&#xD;
      study is to investigate the impact of the intervention on participants': 1) LARC use; 2)&#xD;
      times having sex without a condom; and 3) STI testing. Secondary outcome measures include&#xD;
      assessing the impact of the intervention on participants': 1) use of dual methods of&#xD;
      protection during vaginal sex; and 2) use of other effective contraceptive methods. Finally,&#xD;
      the evaluation will include exploratory analysis of participants': 1) perception of risk&#xD;
      and/or severity for pregnancy and HIV/STI infection; (2) intention to use LARC; (3) intention&#xD;
      to use other effective contraception methods; (4) provider communication self-efficacy; (5)&#xD;
      condom negotiation self-efficacy; and (6) knowledge/awareness of contraception options/LARC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control (counterfactual) condition consists of a 17-minute video titled &quot;The Toxic Life&#xD;
      Cycle of a Cigarette&quot;. The control video, which discusses the effects of smoking, is shown in&#xD;
      the same manner as the treatment video: immediately prior to a clinic appointment at a&#xD;
      reproductive health center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants who provide the proper consent are randomized and enrolled into the&#xD;
      study by a study coordinator who is an employee of the reproductive health clinic. Outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed using self-reported, participant-level data gathered (by way of a&#xD;
      questionnaire) at three time points: baseline (enrollment, prior to watching the video);&#xD;
      3-month follow-up (3 months after baseline); and 9-month follow-up (9 months after baseline).&#xD;
      The study is taking place at seven clinics within the Planned Parenthood Mar Monte system in&#xD;
      California, all of which serve the target population.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>A dataset will be prepared at the conclusion of the study, which includes de-identified individual-level data on all study participants who contributed self-report data. Respondents will be represented only by a research ID number. Included in the dataset will be self-report data collected across all survey administrations (including demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, and theoretical antecedents to those behaviors) and select information on program participation (e.g., which program sessions were attended). Basic data cleaning steps will be taken in order to ensure data are unidentifiable and to increase usability.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>The individual participant dataset will become available twelve months after the study has concluded.</ipd_time_frame>
