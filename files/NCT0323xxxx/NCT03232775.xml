  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have unique social-communication and behavior&#xD;
      impairments that complicate their medical management. This study aimed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of using a picture schedule paired with a reinforcement system during the&#xD;
      medical exam. Two groups (treatment and control) of children (ages 5 - 10 yrs) diagnosed with&#xD;
      ASD and below average adaptive communication impairment were asked to participate. Following&#xD;
      participation in an overview of autism diagnostic symptoms training, two teams (comprised of&#xD;
      one chief medical resident and one nurse), blind to the study aim, conducted the study exams.&#xD;

      Objective: This pilot study aimed to evaluate the effects of a picture-schedule reinforcement&#xD;
      system on reducing problem behaviors in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) during a&#xD;
      physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, setting, patients, intervention: Fifteen study participants, aged 5-10 years, with&#xD;
      autism and identified by caregivers as typically uncooperative with physical exams were&#xD;
      randomized to one of two physical exam groups (treatment and control) based on their adaptive&#xD;
      communication score. The treatment group exam included use of a picture&#xD;
      schedule-reinforcement book and the control group exam did not introduce the book. Caregivers&#xD;
      rated participants' irritability/stereotypy behaviors before and during study exams. Exam&#xD;
      teams blinded to study aims, recorded participants' total exam items completed and caregivers&#xD;
      rated participants' level of cooperation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Chronological ages 4 to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presumptive diagnosis of Autistic Disorder or Asperger's Disorder prior to study&#xD;
             admission from a psychologist or psychiatrist experienced with children who have&#xD;
             autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Meets research criteria for Autistic Spectrum Disorder:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Meets cut-off scores for autism spectrum on the Social Communication&#xD;
                  Questionnaire (SCQ) (cut-off = 15) and&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Meets empirically-derived algorithm cut-off scores for Autism Spectrum Disorders&#xD;
                  on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. All subjects will have the ADOS administered by a clinician trained in research&#xD;
                  reliability standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. The Principal Investigator, a certified ADOS trainer and research reliable, or&#xD;
                  trained designee under the supervision of the Principal Investigator, will&#xD;
                  administer the ADOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants will represent the typical DSM-IV diagnostic developmental profile of&#xD;
             children on the autism spectrum and no neurological injuries or illnesses before the&#xD;
             age of three years that could account for their symptoms (i.e., meningitis,&#xD;
             encephalitis, severe head injury or seizure disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A Communication standard score â‰¤ 85, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior&#xD;
             Scales - II.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a) The VABS-II will be administered by the Principal Investigator or trained designee&#xD;
             under the supervision of the Principal Investigator as part of the initial phone&#xD;
             screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Children with an ASD, particularly school-aged children and adolescents, may present&#xD;
             with myriad prescribed psychotropic medications. Therefore, we will not exclude&#xD;
             children on a variety of psychotropic medications; rather we will conduct a&#xD;
             qualitative analysis to look at this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No restrictions regarding race or gender will be applied to the autism or&#xD;
             developmental disability sample. Every effort will be made not to over-represent any&#xD;
             particular race and/or gender group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Physically healthy prior to physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Previous exposure to visual systems. This will be assessed based on caregiver report&#xD;
             during the phone screening using one question relating to the use of visual structure&#xD;
             with the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Poor Cooperation&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Completely Uncooperative&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Physical exams rated by caregiver on 4-point scale of cooperation modified from&#xD;
                  Forsberg et al. [56].&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  0 = No problems with cooperation;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  1 = Minor problems with cooperation: Child shows mild behavior problems&#xD;
                       and/or anxiety symptoms;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  2 = Poor cooperation: Child's behavior problems and/or anxiety symptoms&#xD;
                       requires that the medical staff have to spend extra time and effort to&#xD;
                       manage the child and complete the exam;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  3 = Completely uncooperative: Exam is not possible due to child's behavior&#xD;
                       problems and/or anxiety symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants with intelligence quotient standard scores &gt; 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of the following genetic or progressive neurological disorders known to be&#xD;
             causative of or potentially resulting in a phenotype similar to autism:&#xD;
