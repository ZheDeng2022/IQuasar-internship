      Social determinants of health affect patients throughout the life course. They may be&#xD;
      particularly relevant for pediatric emergency department (ED) patients. Computerized&#xD;
      screening for social and behavioral determinants of health has been deemed effective and&#xD;
      acceptable. This pilot study will characterize the cumulative burden of health related social&#xD;
      problems experienced by patients and families in a pediatric ED. It will specifically examine&#xD;
      those patients with a subset of 9 high-risk chief complaints, patients with obesity, patients&#xD;
      with poor asthma control, and patients with a high number of non-urgent visits, who may be at&#xD;
      particularly high risk for health related social problems. Our analysis will compare these&#xD;
      subsets of patients with the general ED population, hypothesizing that these groups will have&#xD;
      a higher number of health related social problems than the general ED population. Parent and&#xD;
      adolescent participants will be approached during ED visits and administered a computerized&#xD;
      screening tool. For patients aged 0-13, a survey administered to parents will test for&#xD;
      thirteen distinct health related social problems. Two surveys will be administered to&#xD;
      adolescent-parent dyads. The adolescent survey will test for thirteen health related social&#xD;
      problems, seven of which overlap with those on the parent survey. The average total number of&#xD;
      health related social problems in patient groups hypothesized to be at high risk will be&#xD;
      compared to the average total number of HRSPs in the general ED population. For adolescent&#xD;
      patients, an intervention group will receive social navigation consisting of rapid referrals&#xD;
      to community resources based on survey responses by a community health liaison. Their ED&#xD;
      recidivism, community resource use and number of unmet social needs at 12-month follow up&#xD;
      will be compared with that of a control group that receives screening and written resources&#xD;
      only.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significant advances have been made in pediatrics in the United States in the last 60 years.&#xD;
      Mortality from infectious disease and cancer, for instance, has declined significantly. The&#xD;
      more stubborn issues in pediatrics include poor asthma control, obesity, suicide and&#xD;
      adolescent homicide. To address these, our profession must begin to systematically address&#xD;
      social determinants of health. Scourges such as poverty, unemployment, and domestic violence&#xD;
      are known contributors to pediatric morbidity, adverse childhood experiences, and poor adult&#xD;
      health and achievement. - The emergency department (ED) may be a strategic venue in which to&#xD;
      identify patients at high risk for multiple social issues. We suspect that certain ED patient&#xD;
      characteristics may be indicative of those families at highest risk and that comprehensive&#xD;
      screening for social determinants of health may be the means by which they can be identified&#xD;
      and targeted for intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social issues in EDs are often addressed individually instead of comprehensively, if done at&#xD;
      all. There have been no studies of comprehensive screening for social determinants of health&#xD;
      in large, urban, full service pediatric EDs. In addition, no study has attempted to identify&#xD;
      those groups of ED patients at highest risk for a large number of social risk factors who&#xD;
      might benefit most from rapid interventions. The immediate objective of this proposal is to&#xD;
      identify groups of patients at high risk for a large number of social risk factors in a&#xD;
      patient-centric manner in a busy pediatric ED, using a single computerized instrument to&#xD;
      administer a comprehensive screen and to provide social navigation services to adolescent&#xD;
      patients. We will sequentially approach caregivers of patients 0-17 years of age and patients&#xD;
      13-21 years of age to complete surveys regarding social risk factors. The outcomes of&#xD;
      interest are 1) the total social risk score and 2) ED recidivism, total social risk score and&#xD;
      community resource use in adolescent patients who receive social navigation services vs.&#xD;
      enhanced usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that patients with the following ED characteristics will have a higher social&#xD;
      risk score than other ED patients: patients with any of nine &quot;high risk&quot; chief complaints&#xD;
      (alleged physical abuse , alleged sexual abuse , peer assault , mammalian bites, adolescent&#xD;
      reproductive and sexual health issues, intoxication/substance abuse , ingestion/poisoning ,&#xD;
      psychiatric/behavioral complaints , any complaint with the lowest estimated severity index );&#xD;
      a body mass index in the obese range; frequent non-urgent visits to the ED; or poor asthma&#xD;
      control. Further, we hypothesize that adolescents who receive social navigation services will&#xD;
      have lower ED recidivism, a lower total social risk score and increased community resource&#xD;
      use at 12-month follow up than adolescents who receive enhanced usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM #1: To characterize the cumulative social risk score for patients and families&#xD;
      in a large, urban pediatric ED Hypothesis #1: Caregivers of pediatric ED patients and&#xD;
      adolescent ED patients will report an increased number of social risks than patients in&#xD;
      primary care settings have reported in prior studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM #2: To compare the cumulative social risk score in pediatric ED patients with a&#xD;
      subset of 9 (nine) high-risk chief complaints, frequent non-urgent visits, obesity, or poor&#xD;
      asthma control to the cumulative burden of social risk factors in the general pediatric ED&#xD;
      population Hypothesis #2: Patients who present to the ED with any of a subset of nine&#xD;
      high-risk chief complaints, frequent non-urgent visits, obesity or poor asthma control will&#xD;
      have a higher social risk score than the general pediatric ED population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM #3: To compare ED recidivism, total social risk score and level of community&#xD;
      resource use at 12-month follow up in adolescents who receive social navigation services&#xD;
      versus those adolescents who receive enhanced usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT: It is our intent to revolutionize emergency care, cementing its place as not only a&#xD;
      medical safety net, but a social one as well. EDs across the country will benefit from&#xD;
      demonstration of a method to intervene on behalf of pediatric patients whose social problems&#xD;
      are as important as their medical ones, if not more so. These interventions have the&#xD;
      potential to decrease unnecessary ED visits and ED recidivism for chronic problems caused or&#xD;
      exacerbated by unmet social needs. The ultimate goal is expansion of social navigation teams&#xD;
      in the ED and creation of a follow up clinic to address the longer term social risk factors&#xD;
      faced by many of our families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Background and Significance: The World Health Organization defines health as &quot;the absence&#xD;
      of physical, psychological and social problems&quot;. Health care, as it has traditionally been&#xD;
      practiced in the United States and Western Europe, has focused primarily on disease and&#xD;
      diagnosis. This has proved insufficient, however, at improving disparities in health among&#xD;
      patients of different incomes, geographic origins and ethnicities. These disparities may be&#xD;
      due, in part, to lack of attention to social determinants of health. Addressing social&#xD;
      determinants is a goal of Healthy People 2020 and has now been mandated by the Institute of&#xD;
      Medicine. - The pediatric age group, as studied by the life course model of human health ,&#xD;
      seems especially sensitive to social determinants, and these effects may persist into&#xD;
      adulthood. , Downstream effects of poverty, substance abuse and child maltreatment can be&#xD;
      seen at each stage in the life course. These issues can strongly affect cognitive&#xD;
      functioning, , chronic disease in adulthood - , adult mortality - and adult substance use and&#xD;
      mental health, , which themselves can negatively affect future educational/professional&#xD;
      achievement and earnings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children exist not in a vacuum, but in the larger context of their families and communities.&#xD;
      It is difficult to improve their health without addressing the well-being of their adult&#xD;
      caregivers and families. Given its accessibility and positioning as both an entry point to&#xD;
      and last resort for health care, the pediatric ED may be an ideal venue for screening and&#xD;
      brief interventions for social problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationships between conditions addressed in the ED and social determinants are well&#xD;
      established. - It is well known, for example, that unaddressed mental health issues and poor&#xD;
      literacy in parents of asthmatic children increase their risk of frequent ED visits and&#xD;
      hospitalizations. , These relationships exist for conditions and chief complaints as diverse&#xD;
      as peer and adolescent violence, depression, diabetes, and sexually transmitted infections,&#xD;
      often seen disproportionately in the ED. Prior work by Fleegler et al. has found that over&#xD;
      50% of patients in a primary care clinic reported two or more unaddressed health-related&#xD;
      social problems (HRSPs). The adult population that visits the ED is at even higher risk for&#xD;
      HRSPs than the general population , and it is likely that this will hold true in children as&#xD;
      well. - Building on previous work in our Division in extending the reach of emergency care to&#xD;
      include screening and secondary prevention, we propose the implementation and testing of&#xD;
      screening for HRSPs in the ED. We have demonstrated success using audio-assisted computer&#xD;
      screening with mobile touch pad technology, a screening method preferred by both patients and&#xD;
      providers. Our long-term goal is to identify and intervene to interrupt the deleterious&#xD;
      effects of HRSPs on pediatric health. The immediate objective of this proposal is to&#xD;
      demonstrate the ability to screen for HRSPs in a patient-centric manner in a busy ED and to&#xD;
      provide social navigation services to an intervention group of adolescent patients. We will&#xD;
      use audio-assisted computerized patient/family surveys and an innovative multidisciplinary&#xD;
      social navigation team to accomplish these objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening for behavioral risk factors is acceptable to adolescents and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We conducted a computerized survey of 276 adolescent patients and 138 caregivers.&#xD;
           Respondents reported &gt;60% acceptability of screening for risk factors such as depression&#xD;
           and suicidality, substance use, sexual risk behaviors, violence, and housing&#xD;
           instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Computerized sexual health surveys to guide clinical decision making improves testing&#xD;
           for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for adolescents in the emergency department&#xD;
           Dr. Goyal's K23 (HD070910) developed a computerized sexual health survey (SHS) to&#xD;
           identify adolescents at high risk for STIs and tested whether implementation of this&#xD;
           tool, with results-based clinical decision support, increased STI testing rates. Through&#xD;
           a multi-step iterative qualitative study using a Delphi panel of key informants for&#xD;
           survey development and content validity, and cognitive interviews with end-users, Dr.&#xD;
           Goyal developed a content-valid audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI) SHS for&#xD;
           the identification of adolescents at risk for STIs. This tool was understandable,&#xD;
           well-accepted, and rated easy to use by adolescents in the ED. Furthermore, Dr. Goyal&#xD;
           demonstrated that it was feasible for successful implementation into the ED workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 * Research Design and Methods: Include a detailed description of all procedures that will&#xD;
      be conducted, including those performed as part of regular care. When applicable, include the&#xD;
      dates for charts that will be accessed and the system used to access them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will utilize two self-administered, computer-based surveys that test thirteen (13)&#xD;
      social domains on a survey administered to caregivers of children 0-17 and thirteen (13)&#xD;
      social domains on a separate survey administered to adolescents 13-21. The caregiver survey&#xD;
      questions parents regarding the following social domains: housing, employment, income and&#xD;
      benefits, safety practices, access to health care, parental depression, food security,&#xD;
      education, substance abuse, immigration, legal issues, intimate partner violence and&#xD;
      literacy. The adolescent survey questions adolescents regarding the following social domains:&#xD;
      housing, food security, education, safety practices, access to health care, mental health,&#xD;
      substance abuse, sexual practices, dating violence, immigration, legal issues, human&#xD;
      trafficking and literacy. The study will be conducted in the emergency departments at the&#xD;
      Children's National Medical Center Sheikh Zayed main campus and the Children's National&#xD;
      Medical Center satellite campus at United Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey Instrument&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey has been developed through adaptation of previously validated questionnaires, as&#xD;
      described below. Once these questionnaires have been collated and adapted for our&#xD;
      comprehensive screening tool, we will then pilot the survey with 5 adolescents and 5&#xD;
      caregivers for understanding. If revisions to the survey are required, we will re-pilot the&#xD;
      survey once revisions are made and repeat this process until no revisions are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basis of the current survey is The Online Advocate, developed and utilized in a previous&#xD;
      study by Eric Fleegler et al and used with permission of the author.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The housing domain includes questions derived from the American Housing Survey. It assesses&#xD;
      household size, current housing status, concerns about impending eviction or foreclosure,&#xD;
      utilities and housing hazards. Housing hazards include leakage, problems with electricity, no&#xD;
      heat for &gt; 24 hours, no toilets functional, any rodent or insect infestation, or no running&#xD;
      water in the home. A patient or family will automatically score positive for a housing&#xD;
      problem if 1) the family is homeless or living with family or friends for financial reasons&#xD;
      (&quot;doubled up&quot;), 2) if there are greater than 8 family members at home, 3) if a family is&#xD;
      concerned about an eviction, transfer or foreclosure, 4) if utilities have been shut off for&#xD;
      nonpayment in the last 12 months, or 5) if there are two or more unaddressed housing hazards&#xD;
      in the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The food security domain questions are the two-item screen designed by Hager et al. and&#xD;
      endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics in its 2015 guideline Promoting Food Security&#xD;
      for All Children. This screen has 97% sensitivity and 83% specificity for identifying food&#xD;
      insecurity in a family. , A patient or family will score positive for food insecurity if they&#xD;
      answer both questions in the affirmative. An adolescent will also score positive for food&#xD;
      insecurity if they qualify for WIC and don't receive it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The employment and income security domains use questions from the Philadelphia Survey of Work&#xD;
      and Family and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. A parent will score positive&#xD;
      if they are 1) out of work or unable to work and not receiving disability benefits, 2) not&#xD;
      receiving benefits (WIC, SNAP, CSFP, TANF or Medicaid) for which they qualify according to&#xD;
      household income, or 3) earning less than $10,000 per year. A positive score will be reversed&#xD;
      if the parent is out of work because they are 1) in school or a job training program, 2) on&#xD;
      family or maternity leave, or 3) retired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety domain includes questions about car seat use, helmet use, smoke alarms, and guns&#xD;
      in the home. A patient or parent will score positive if 1) they are not using a car&#xD;
      seat/booster seat if appropriate for age and height, 2) their child does not use a helmet&#xD;
      regularly, 3) there are no working smoke alarms in the home, or 4) there are guns at home.&#xD;
      The adolescent survey adds a question about being a witness to shootings/stabbings/murder.&#xD;
      The adolescent will score positive if they 1) sometimes or frequently carry weapons, 2) have&#xD;
      been a witness to shooting/stabbing/murder, 3) do not use helmets, or 4) if there are guns at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The access to health care domain includes questions from the Behavioral Risk Factor&#xD;
      Surveillance System . It assesses health insurance status for both parent and child.&#xD;
      Additionally, it assesses availability and utilization of primary medical care (if&#xD;
      appropriate) for parent and child. A parent or patient will score positive if either she or&#xD;
      her child does not have or has not used their primary medical provider within a 5- or 2-year&#xD;
      time frame, respectively, or does not have medical insurance. Questions regarding asthma&#xD;
      control were adapted from the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) for adolescents and the&#xD;
      Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument for the Emergency Department (PACCI-ED)&#xD;
      for children under 13 and will be used to test an association between poor asthma control and&#xD;
      number of HRSPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parental and adolescent depression questions are the PHQ-2 screen, which has been&#xD;
      validated against longer depression screens in adolescents and adults. , A patient or parent&#xD;
      will score positive if they earn a score of ≥ 3. ). If they earn a score of ≥3, the screen&#xD;
      will convert to the PHQ-9 screen (for adults) or the PHQ-A (for adolescents), which includes&#xD;
      questions regarding suicidality. If either the patient or parent has a child under 3 months&#xD;
      old, the depression screen will instead be a 3-question subscale of the Edinburgh Postpartum&#xD;
      Depression Screen (EPDS), shown to have sensitivity for postpartum depression for adults and&#xD;
      adolescents and tested in the pediatric emergency department ; if their score on the&#xD;
      3-question subscale is greater than 3, the survey will automatically branch to a question&#xD;
      regarding suicidality. Additional questions exist about recent deaths in the household and&#xD;
      bullying. They will score positive if they have had a recent death in the household, have&#xD;
      ever lost a parent or guardian, or if they admit to bullying or being bullied frequently (or&#xD;
      the parent is concerned that the child is being bullied or is bullying others).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions regarding parental education include highest grade completed and number of adults&#xD;
      in the household with fluency in English. The child's or adolescent's education is assessed&#xD;
      with questions regarding school attendance, failing grades, and truancy. A parent survey will&#xD;
      automatically score positive for education if 1) the parent did not complete high school and&#xD;
      has not earned a GED, 2) there are no adults in the household who can speak English fluently,&#xD;
      3) if their child has had more than 5 unexcused absences or days home due to suspension in&#xD;
      the past month, or 4) if the child has received 3 or more Ds or Fs in the last grading&#xD;
      period. An adolescent will automatically score positive for education if they self-report&#xD;
      either of the last two items in the affirmative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRAFFT questions screen adolescents for problematic drug or alcohol use. The TICS&#xD;
      (two-item conjoint screen) questions screen parents for drug or alcohol abuse or dependence.&#xD;
      It was shown to have nearly 80% sensitivity for detection of problematic drug and alcohol&#xD;
      use. Two positive answers on either survey constitute a positive screen for potential&#xD;
      problematic alcohol or substance use. Parents and adolescents are also questioned regarding&#xD;
      household members that they think may be addicted to drugs or alcohol and will earn a point&#xD;
      if they answer in the affirmative. They will also screen positive if they admit to smoking&#xD;
      cigarettes and the patient has asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immigration issues are assessed by asking about current immigration status, whether any adult&#xD;
      at home is a U.S. citizen or legal resident and any recent deportations or arrests for&#xD;
      immigration issues. Undocumented status, no adult U.S. citizen or legal resident in the home,&#xD;
      no adult English speakers at home or any deportations in the last 12 months will constitute a&#xD;
      positive screen for immigration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for intimate partner violence is accomplished via the STaT screen. It was tested in&#xD;
      an urban emergency department population and has a sensitivity of approximately 96% for&#xD;
      intimate partner violence. Any positive response will constitute a positive screen for&#xD;
      intimate partner violence. Questions regarding child witnesses to domestic violence are&#xD;
      included to screen for possible child protection issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Legal issues assessed include involvement in the criminal justice system of either&#xD;
      parent/guardian or the child. Involvement of any parent/guardian or the child with the&#xD;
      criminal justice system will constitute a positive screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adolescent survey will include questions regarding sexual health. An adolescent will&#xD;
      score positive if he/she has had 5 or more lifetime partners, has ever been pregnant or&#xD;
      gotten someone pregnant, has had 2 or more partners in the last 3 months, is sexually active&#xD;
      with opposite sex partners and is not using any reliable birth control method, or is sexually&#xD;
      active with any partner and not using any reliable sexually transmitted infection (STI)&#xD;
      prevention method. In addition, an adolescent will score positive if they have had an STI in&#xD;
      the last 12 months or if they have not been tested for an STI in the last 12 months (unless&#xD;
      not sexually active).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low literacy by patient or parent as assessed on the initial literacy questions will earn an&#xD;
      extra point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers of patients ages 0-17 and adolescents ages 13-21 who speak English or Spanish will&#xD;
      be approached for survey completion following physician evaluation. Patients will be excluded&#xD;
      if they are triaged at estimated severity index (ESI) Level 1 or if they are unable to&#xD;
      complete the survey due to developmental level, inability to speak English or Spanish,&#xD;
      inability to read the survey when a private area/interpreter is not available to have the&#xD;
      survey administered verbally, or mental status. Patients will also be excluded if they are&#xD;
      ≥22 years of age or if they present in police custody or as wards of the state. Caregivers&#xD;
      will be excluded if they are unable to complete the survey due to developmental level,&#xD;
      inability to speak English or Spanish, inability to read the survey when a private&#xD;
      area/interpreter is not available to have the survey administered verbally, or mental status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a child presents with more than one parent or legal guardian, the researcher will ask that&#xD;
      only one parent complete the survey. If an adolescent presents with a parent/legal guardian&#xD;
      but is either unwilling or unable to complete the survey, the survey will be scored as if the&#xD;
      adolescent presented for care alone (i.e., in the &quot;adolescent alone&quot; group, maximum score 12&#xD;
      [twelve]). If a parent/legal guardian presents with an adolescent who is unwilling or unable&#xD;
      to complete the survey but the parent does consent to complete it, the survey will be scored&#xD;
      in the &quot;parent alone&quot; group (maximum score 13 (thirteen)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenience sample of consecutive ED patients during time blocks structured to reflect the&#xD;
      variability of ED arrival times will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent but prior to survey completion, the research assistant will enter into the&#xD;
      survey the time of day, the patient's chief complaint and chief complaint characteristics,&#xD;
      age, ESI level, number of non-urgent visits to CNMC in the last 12 months, ED campus, height&#xD;
      and weight in a blank electronic survey identified only by the patient's study number. This&#xD;
      information will be accessed from the Cerner FirstNet emergency department tracking software.&#xD;
      The adolescent and parent surveys will be linked only by a common study number without&#xD;
      utilizing any other identifying information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If not completed at triage, the research assistant will measure the patient's height using&#xD;
      the emergency department stadiometer and standardized technique. Patients who are unable or&#xD;
      unwilling to stand will have their length measured if able to lie flat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literacy and computer facility will be assessed with four validated screening questions&#xD;
      administered to the parent and/or adolescent patient prior to initiation of the body of the&#xD;
      survey. If the patient is deemed to have high reading and computer literacy by this&#xD;
      standardized assessment, the research assistant will then provide the laptop, equipped with a&#xD;
      privacy screen and headphones, to the family for completion of the survey. If they are deemed&#xD;
      to have low literacy, the patient or parent will be instructed to use the audio feature of&#xD;
      REDCap for each question and will be offered a touch screen laptop or iPad option, or the&#xD;
      research assistant will read the questions to the patient and enter the answers. If the&#xD;
      research assistant is required to read the questions to the parent, the survey will be&#xD;
      conducted in a private room. If none is available within a reasonable time frame, the patient&#xD;
      will be excluded from the study. If not required to read the questions to the patient, he/she&#xD;
      will conduct a brief tutorial, then exit the room while the survey is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research assistant will review survey answers immediately following completion. If any of&#xD;
      the following occur in any patient or caregiver on non-social navigation days, the procedures&#xD;
      described below will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the study subject indicates that they wish to speak with a social worker, the&#xD;
           emergency department social worker will be notified. Study recruitment will only be&#xD;
           carried out when an emergency department social worker is available in the ED. The&#xD;
           social worker will only be notified of the fact that the patient would like to speak&#xD;
           with them (i.e., not about specific survey answers), unless any of the contingencies&#xD;
           described below exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If an adult study subject indicates that he/she is suicidal, the clinician in charge of&#xD;
           the medical care for the adult study subject's child will be notified. The DC Mobile&#xD;
           Crisis Services unit of the Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program will be&#xD;
           activated. This service is available between 9 a.m. and 1 a.m. Study recruitment will&#xD;
           not be carried out outside these hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If a study subject 17 years of age or under indicates that he/she is suicidal, the&#xD;
           clinician in charge of the medical care for that study subject will be notified. An&#xD;
           emergency psychiatric consult in the CNMC emergency department will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If an adult study subject indicates that he/she is currently experiencing intimate&#xD;
           partner violence, the study subject will be asked face to face by the research assistant&#xD;
           if they 1) would like to speak with a social worker, 2) would like to activate police&#xD;
           services in the appropriate jurisdiction, 3) if they feel safe going home, and 4) if&#xD;
           their child has witnessed or been physically affected by intimate partner violence in&#xD;
           the household. The ED social worker will be notified and will initiate appropriate&#xD;
           procedures, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Police services will be activated at the patient's request.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If the patient does not feel safe going home, they will be referred to the nearest&#xD;
                24 hour shelter and a warm handoff will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. If the study subject's child has witnessed or been physically affected by intimate&#xD;
                partner violence, a Child Protective Services report will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If a study subject 17 years or under indicates that they are currently experiencing&#xD;
           intimate partner violence, the study subject will be asked face to face (but away from&#xD;
           their caregiver) by the research assistant if they 1) would like to speak with a social&#xD;
           worker, 2) would like to activate police services in the appropriate jurisdiction, 3) if&#xD;
           they feel safe going home, or 4) if applicable, if their child has witnessed or been&#xD;
           physically affected by intimate partner violence in the household. The ED social worker&#xD;
           will be notified and will initiate appropriate procedures, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Police services will be activated at the patient's request.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If the patient does not feel safe going home, they will be referred to the nearest&#xD;
                24 hour shelter and a warm handoff will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. If the study subject's child has witnessed or been physically affected by intimate&#xD;
                partner violence, a Child Protective Services report will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If in the course of conversations about any of the above items a concern for physical,&#xD;
           sexual or emotional abuse or neglect, or human trafficking of a person under the age of&#xD;
           18 is uncovered, the child's clinician and social worker will be notified and a Child&#xD;
           Protective Services report made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. If the patient screens positively for human trafficking, the patient will be questioned&#xD;
           privately. If there is continued concern, the National Human Trafficking Hotline will be&#xD;
           called.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescent patients in this study will be randomized into an intervention group, which will&#xD;
      receive social navigation services and an enhanced usual care group, which will receive&#xD;
      screening, the procedures described above, and a packet of community resources. The&#xD;
      intervention group will have access to the services of a social navigation team. The social&#xD;
      navigation team will consist of trained community health liaisons (undergraduates and&#xD;
      graduate students in medicine, public health and social work from neighboring institutions&#xD;
      including George Washington University, University of Maryland, Howard University, Catholic&#xD;
      University, and Georgetown University), a clinician and a social worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The social navigation team will function as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Once the computerized screening tool has been completed by the enrolled patient, the&#xD;
           results will be printed by the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The research assistant will then instruct the community health intern to review the&#xD;
           results of the completed computerized survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The community health intern will review the results, create a plan of action, i.e.&#xD;
           specific referrals to community agencies and next steps needed by the caregiver and or&#xD;
           adolescent (e.g., documents to gather, appointments to make, etc.), following&#xD;
           pre-developed protocols for each risk area. Each plan will be reviewed with the social&#xD;
           worker prior to presentation to the family. Each family will also receive a packet of&#xD;
           community resources relevant to each social domain covered in the screening survey,&#xD;
           similar to that provided to the enhanced usual care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If emergency social concerns are uncovered, e.g., homelessness, abuse, or intimate&#xD;
           partner violence compromising safety, the social worker will be notified immediately and&#xD;
           she will proceed as per her usual practice, as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If adolescents report suicidality, abuse or high risk sexual activity, the team&#xD;
           clinician will, as necessary, consult psychiatry, order STI testing and prophylaxis,&#xD;
           order emergency contraception, notify child protective services or complete any required&#xD;
           medicolegal forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the enhanced usual care group will receive risk-tailored printed information&#xD;
      regarding community resources from the research assistant based on responses to the&#xD;
      computerized survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each enrolled adolescent participant will receive phone follow up at 3, 6 and 12 months by&#xD;
      the community health intern. The interviewer conducting the 3-month phone follow up will&#xD;
      assess whether any community resources were accessed. If not accessed, reasons for non-use&#xD;
      will be assessed. If accessed, satisfaction with resources will be assessed. If participants&#xD;
      have not accessed services, the navigator will provide additional resources to the&#xD;
      participant to enable access by addressing identified barriers (e.g. making appointments or&#xD;
      helping with transportation). If the phone number given is out of service, we will attempt&#xD;
      follow up using email or the second phone number provided by the participant. Each&#xD;
      participant will be allowed three unsuccessful phone calls and 1 email before being&#xD;
      considered lost to follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6-month phone follow up will be answer any patient or caregiver questions, paying strict&#xD;
      attention to confidentiality, and will confirm contact information for subsequent 12-month&#xD;
      follow up. At 12-month follow-up, the patient's chart will be reviewed to assess for follow&#xD;
      up ED visits. A phone call will obtain contact information to 1) ask about non-Children's&#xD;
      National Health System ED visits, 2) quantify continued community resource use, and 3) to&#xD;
      obtain email or phone contact information through which the patient will complete the same&#xD;
      computerized screening tool. If adolescents report new suicidality, child-witnessed intimate&#xD;
      partner violence, physical or sexual abuse or human trafficking on the follow up survey, we&#xD;
      will proceed as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All emergency intervention(s) the provider uses if a patient or caregiver screens positive&#xD;
      will be documented on an enrollment form. On non-social navigation days, providers will sign&#xD;
      a form acknowledging receipt of positive emergency screens and intervention materials. This&#xD;
      form will also allow the provider to ask research to contact social work on their behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescent participants will be randomized to either receive or not receive social navigation&#xD;
      services using a random time and date generator to create social navigation and control&#xD;
      shifts that cover morning and evening shifts at both the Sheikh Zayed campus and UMC. This&#xD;
      study will employ a consecutive enrollment sampling technique during randomly selected blocks&#xD;
      to minimize selection bias. On social navigation shifts, the community health liaison, social&#xD;
      worker and clinician will be available. On non-social navigation shifts (control shifts),&#xD;
      patients will receive screening, a packet of community resources and follow-up phone calls to&#xD;
      confirm contact information and inquire about community resource use, but no social&#xD;
      navigation services.&#xD;
