  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, successful prevention of migraine is not sufficiently achieved by (prophylactic)&#xD;
      drug therapy. In contrast, neurophysiologically guided treatments might provide an&#xD;
      alternative avenue, since these can normalize brain alterations without side effects.&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) appears useful in the acute and prophylactic&#xD;
      treatment of migraine, probably because of its modifying and re-balancing influence on&#xD;
      neuronal activity. Yet, to test for the efficacy of tDCS in a clinically acceptable way, it&#xD;
      is necessary to apply not only tDCS but also a &quot;sham&quot; placebo, which is often neglected in&#xD;
      tDCS stimulation studies. Further, tDCS needs to be applied in a large (n &gt; 20) sample of&#xD;
      well-defined migraine patients, which would be advantageous, compared to previously published&#xD;
      work. Monitoring sources of regional neuronal alterations in migraineurs prior and after tDCS&#xD;
      is essential to investigate physiological mechanisms of tDCS. There is an increasing interest&#xD;
      towards non-pharmacological treatment alternatives for migraine (and headache disorders) with&#xD;
      reduced side effects to established prophylactic medications. The primary outcome of this&#xD;
      project is to demonstrate that repetitive sessions of neurostimulation lead to a significant&#xD;
      and permanent reduction of the primary symptom severity (i.e. migraine attacks) for patients&#xD;
      suffering from chronic and episodic migraine. Since neurostimulation tools are nowadays&#xD;
      accepted as therapeutic tools, our study might provide evidence that tDCS can be a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological alternative for treating migraine.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients from age 18 upwards (max. 80 years) suffering from chronic or episodic migraine.&#xD;
        Medication overuse headache (MOH) patients are included as well (as chronic migraine&#xD;
        patients do often show MOH).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy volunteers (18-80 years) are included if they don't fulfil the exclusion criteria&#xD;
        and do not suffer from migraine or other headache disorders, except infrequent episodic&#xD;
        tension-type headache All volunteers are able to read and sign the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients and healthy volunteers are excluded if they fulfil one of the following exclusion&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Common MR exclusion criteria: such as metallic items in the body (i.e. eye splinter, MR&#xD;
        incompatible implants*), pacemaker, claustrophobia or obesity (body mass index &gt; 35).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Also pregnant participants and participants suffering from a degenerative disorder of the&#xD;
        Central Nervous System, such as Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease,&#xD;
        Alzheimer's Disease and Huntington's Disease will be excluded. Participants with major&#xD;
        psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder will also be excluded.&#xD;
