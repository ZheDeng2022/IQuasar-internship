    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the safety, effectiveness and&#xD;
      tolerability of the study medication in the treatment of people with chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus infection who regularly attend a psychiatrist-staffed clinic for opiate addiction&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 3.2 million people in the United States are currently infected with hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus (HCV). Since 1990, when the US introduced screening of the blood supply for HCV,&#xD;
      injection drug use has been the primary mode of HCV transmission in the United States. It is&#xD;
      widely recognized that addressing the HCV epidemic among people who inject drugs (PWID)&#xD;
      depends on increasing access to: 1) clean injection equipment; 2) opiate substitution therapy&#xD;
      (OST); 3) curative HCV treatment; and 4) assistance with comorbid psychiatric conditions and&#xD;
      social issues (Robaeys, C et al, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, access to HCV treatment among current and former injection drug users is&#xD;
      thought to be limited by several factors including: 1) insufficient number of infectious&#xD;
      disease and gastroenterology providers and 2) provider and third-party payor concerns about&#xD;
      adherence to medication and the risk of reinfection (Aspinall, EJ et al, 2013). Strategies to&#xD;
      increase access among current and former injection drug users to direct acting antiviral&#xD;
      drugs are urgently needed. The purpose of the current study is to assess the impact of&#xD;
      co-treating chronic hepatitis C infection and opiate dependence within the context of an&#xD;
      outpatient addiction clinic staffed by psychiatrists. The beneficial impact of co-treating&#xD;
      opiate dependence and an infectious illness has been demonstrated in the case of HIV&#xD;
      infection. Altice and colleagues conducted an observational study of HIV-infected&#xD;
      opiate-dependent patients who were offered OST with buprenorphine/naloxone at 10 different&#xD;
      HIV clinics. Subjects initiating buprenorphine/naloxone were more likely to initiate or&#xD;
      remain on ART (antiretroviral therapy) (Altice, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) program has demonstrated that with&#xD;
      proper training and mentorship, primary care providers with no prior experience in managing&#xD;
      HCV are able to treat the disease effectively (Arora et al, 2011). Since the publication of&#xD;
      the ECHO study, the treatment of HCV has become considerably less complicated due to the&#xD;
      widespread availability of safe, highly effective single tablet regimens, such as Epclusa.&#xD;
      The investigators believe that treatment of HCV is now well within the grasp of physicians&#xD;
      and other healthcare providers without training in internal or family medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single arm pilot study will assess HCV treatment with Epclusa at an outpatient addiction&#xD;
      clinic staffed by psychiatrists. The investigators hypothesize that with proper training and&#xD;
      mentorship, psychiatrists who are also a licensed buprenorphine/naloxone providers will be&#xD;
      able to effectively assess liver health and treat chronic hepatitis C infection with Epclusa.&#xD;
      Further, the investigators hypothesize that patients with chronic hepatitis C infection on&#xD;
      buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance therapy who are treated for HCV by a psychiatrist during&#xD;
      regularly scheduled visits to an addiction clinic will have high rates of adherence to HCV&#xD;
      treatment and achieve SVR12 (sustained virologic response, 12 weeks post-treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that subjects will receive standard of care evaluation and treatment for their chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C infection, the investigators believe that study participation poses minimal risk.&#xD;
      Indeed, The investigators believe that subjects will benefit from improved access to this&#xD;
      important treatment which will be provided at a convenient location by a known physician&#xD;
      under the guidance of an infectious disease physician with extensive experience treating HCV&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

          <description>The level of liver fibrosis was determined by the FibroSure HCV blood test which uses a combination of six serum markers plus age and gender in a patented algorithm to generate a measure of fibrosis. The stages of fibrosis range from 0 (no fibrosis) to 4 (liver cirrhosis). Stage F1 refers to portal fibrosis, stage F2 to bridging fibrosis with few septa, and stage F3 to bridging fibrosis with many septa.</description>
