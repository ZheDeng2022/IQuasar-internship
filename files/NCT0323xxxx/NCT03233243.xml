  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic plaque uptake of 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) in positron emission tomography&#xD;
      with computed tomography (PET-CT) was recently shown to correlate with clinical instability&#xD;
      in patients with CV disease. We hypothesize that rosuvastatin reduces 18F-NaF plaque uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group will scan coronary, aortic and carotid arteries of high-risk CV subjects with 18F-&#xD;
      NaF-PET-CT. Individuals with 18F-NaF-positive plaques will be treated with rosuvastatin for&#xD;
      six months, followed by 18F-NaF-PET-CT re-evaluation.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the main cause of mortality in developed countries; its&#xD;
      prevention is challenging. Advances in molecular imaging of the atherosclerotic plaque&#xD;
      enhanced the study of its pathophysiology, including the positron emission tomography with&#xD;
      computed tomography (PET-CT) scan. The marker 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) has been studied in&#xD;
      peripheral arteries plaque imaging as an in vivo marker of on-going calcification. The 18F&#xD;
      ions deposit in the bone by exchange of hydroxyl group on the surface of the hydroxyapatite&#xD;
      matrix to form fluoroapatite, so this tracer detects areas of active calcification and&#xD;
      osteogenic remodeling. Coronary imaging with 18F-NaF labelled PET-CT was recently described&#xD;
      and proposed to be able to discriminate between active and inactive coronary calcification,&#xD;
      possibly identifying high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statin therapy is approved for primary and secondary CVD prevention due to both its&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering effect and positive pleiotropic properties in the plaque. In particular,&#xD;
      rosuvastatin diminishes mortality and vascular events when used in primary and secondary&#xD;
      prevention. High doses of rosuvastatin resulted in atherosclerosis regression as assessed&#xD;
      with coronary intravascular ultrasound, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and lipid&#xD;
      content reduction of the atherosclerotic plaque (near-infrared spectroscopy analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We do not know the effects of statins in the 18F-NaF uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator's initiative prospective study of 18F-NaF-PET-CT coronary, aortic and carotid&#xD;
      plaques imaging in primary prevention subjects, with a before and after experiment with&#xD;
      rosuvastatin treatment and long-term follow-up. The protocol was approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of Faculty of Medicine of the University of Coimbra and written according to Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening - visit 0:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients followed at the Arterial Hypertension clinic of Centro Hospitalar e&#xD;
           Universitário de Coimbra will be screened and selected if they meet all of the inclusion&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical questionnaire and standard physical examination. CV risk will be estimated&#xD;
           according to SCORE equations and the American Heart Association atherosclerotic&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease calculator. Patients' medical history and CV risk factors will be&#xD;
           recorded, as well as physical examination findings, including age, race, gender, smoking&#xD;
           status (current, past, quantification with pack-years), diabetes mellitus (type 1, 2,&#xD;
           pre- diabetes), family history of premature coronary heart disease (first degree: men &lt;&#xD;
           55 and women &lt; 65 years old), relevant past medical history, blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
           weight and height. Levels of total cholesterol, high and low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
           cholesterol (HDL and LDL), triglycerides, creatinine, creatine kinase, alanine&#xD;
           amino-transferase, aspartate amino- transferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline&#xD;
           phosphatase, glycated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein&#xD;
           and haemoglobin will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline 18F-NaF labelled PET-CT - visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will undergo whole body 18F-NaF-PET-CT for identification of coronary, carotid,&#xD;
           thoracic and abdominal aorta arteries plaques and quantification of 18F-NaF uptake&#xD;
           (tissue-to-background ratio (TBR)). Scans will be reviewed and analysed by experienced&#xD;
           observers blinded to the clinical diagnosis. Subjects without 18F-NaF-positive plaques&#xD;
           will be excluded from the pharmacological intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rosuvastatin treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           At visit 1, patients with 18F-NaF-positive plaques will be treated with 20 mg of&#xD;
           rosuvastatin daily for six months, except in patients who need a 55% LDL reduction to&#xD;
           achieve recommended targets (rosuvastatin 40 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Second 18F-NaF labelled PET-CT - visit 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a second PET-CT scan six months after statin treatment to assess&#xD;
      changes in 18F-NaF plaque uptake. Medication compliance will be monitored, as well as adverse&#xD;
      events reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-NaF uptake after rosuvastatin treatment will be compared to baseline values with paired&#xD;
      samples T student test or Wilcoxon text according to the normality of the distribution.&#xD;
      Sample size was estimated according to the preliminary results of 25 subjects (pilot study)&#xD;
      and the primary endpoint of reducing maximum 18F-NaF uptake as assessed by TBR. Individuals&#xD;
      with no significant 18F-NaF uptake were excluded from this analysis (n=4): mean TBR 2.16 and&#xD;
      SD 0.40. At 90% power and a significance level of 0.05, assuming a correlation of 0.8 and 10%&#xD;
      difference in TBR, the calculated sample size is 32. As only 21 out of 25 subjects in the&#xD;
      pilot study displayed criteria for the pharmacological study, it is necessary to perform 44&#xD;
      baseline studies, followed by 36 subjects re-evaluation (drop-out margin of 4 subjects),&#xD;
      totaling 80 PET-CT scans.&#xD;
