      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV affects millions of people. The disease may &quot;hide&quot; in the brain, even in people with&#xD;
      well-controlled HIV without cancer. Then it may &quot;wake up&quot; and continue. The drug&#xD;
      pembrolizumab uses the body s immune system to fight cells like cancer cells. It is approved&#xD;
      to treat some cancers but not HIV. Researchers want to see if it is safe for HIV-positive&#xD;
      people without cancer. This study is not for HIV treatment; only one dose of the drug will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if the drug pembrolizumab, used to treat certain cancers, is safe for HIV-positive&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with HIV who are in another NIH protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical and neurological exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture. The lower back will be numbed. A needle will remove fluid from between&#xD;
           back bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FDG-PET/CT. A radioactive sugar will be injected in a thin plastic tube (catheter)&#xD;
           inserted in an arm vein. Participants will rest for an hour, urinate, then lie in the&#xD;
           scanner. A mask will hold the head still.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis. An optional procedure at baseline. White blood cells are removed from you&#xD;
           using a serum cell separator machine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who can become pregnant cannot take pembrolizumab. Men who take it must use 2 kinds of&#xD;
      contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 7 more visits, which repeat some screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1 visit, participants will get one dose of pembrolizumab by catheter for 30 minutes. They&#xD;
      will get allergy and pain medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 2 visits, participants will have a brain MRI. They will get a contrast agent by catheter.&#xD;
      They will lie in a metal cylinder that takes pictures for 1-2 hours. They will get earplugs&#xD;
      for loud sounds.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Phase I, proof-of-concept study, we aim to determine the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody against programmed cell death protein&#xD;
      (PD)-1, in viremically suppressed human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) positive patients. We&#xD;
      will also examine the correlation of immune activation and suppression markers in viremically&#xD;
      suppressed HIV positive patients with the effects of pembrolizumab on immune restoration&#xD;
      function (e.g. CD4 count, HIV viral load) and immune activation (e.g. HIV-specific T-cell&#xD;
      responses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV is estimated to infect 36.7 million people globally, with 1.1 million deaths and 2.1&#xD;
      million new infections occurring yearly. There is no cure. Opportunistic infections and&#xD;
      neoplasms contribute to a large portion of mortality and morbidity within the HIV-positive&#xD;
      population. Even in well- controlled, viremically suppressed patients, neurologic&#xD;
      complications including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, continue to contribute to&#xD;
      disease morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that HIV reservoirs contribute to the inability to cure HIV infection. In&#xD;
      the brain, macrophages and astrocytes harbor HIV. It is theorized that the brain is a&#xD;
      potential reservoir for replication competent HIV. PD-1 expression is elevated in patients&#xD;
      with HIV compared to uninfected controls. Upregulated PD-1 expression is associated with&#xD;
      higher viral load and increased mortality in infections.1 PD-1 co-expression on regulatory&#xD;
      T-cells has been shown to correlate with disease progression in perinatally-infected&#xD;
      HIV-positive children. Drugs targeting the PD-1 pathway in HIV infection have shown&#xD;
      upregulation of T-cell responses that are potentially critical to eradication of infection.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is an attractive option due to its mechanism of action, although it has been&#xD;
      rarely used in the HIV population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single-center, single-arm, open label, baseline-versus-treatment phase I clinical&#xD;
      trial, twelve patients with HIV-1 infection will receive a one-time dose of 200mg&#xD;
      pembrolizumab with a baseline study period of 3 weeks, a one-day treatment phase, and a&#xD;
      6-month post treatment phase. Outcome measures will be collected every 3 to 6 weeks for the&#xD;
      duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab, which will be&#xD;
      measured by clinical exam, laboratory studies and adverse event tabulations using the Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, viral and immunologic outcome measures investigating the impact of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      on HIV-1 biology and its effects on immune function will be measured in the CSF and&#xD;
      periphery, including single copy HIV analysis, CD4+ T-cell count, PD-1 lymphocyte expression&#xD;
      and T-cell phenotype analysis, T-cell proliferation against HIV-proteins, CSF cytokine&#xD;
      analysis and/or CSF antibody profiling (LIPS). These additional studies will offer indirect&#xD;
      proof of a HIV viral reservoir in the CNS as well as potential efficacy of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      reversing immune exhaustion against latent HIV&#xD;
