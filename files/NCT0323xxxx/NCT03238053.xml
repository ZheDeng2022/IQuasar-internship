    <textblock>
      Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is characterized by symptoms such as vaginal&#xD;
      dryness, dyspareunia, irritation, urinary incontinence, overactive bladder , and urinary&#xD;
      tract infections. GSM replaces the previous term vulvovaginal atrophy as agreed upon by a&#xD;
      joint terminology conference sponsored by the North American Menopause Society and the&#xD;
      International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health. GSM is a new terminology more&#xD;
      accurate than the terms of VVA/atrophic vaginitis, because it describes the clinical signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of the vulva, vagina and lower urinary system. In contrast, VVA/atrophic&#xD;
      vaginitis describes the appearance of the vulvovaginal structures only. The GSM has a&#xD;
      prevalence of more or less 50%, depending on country of origin, with a negative impact on&#xD;
      sexuality, quality of life and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aging process is genetically determined and environmentally modulated. Estrogen&#xD;
      deficiency occurring after menopause causes a series of modifications in many different areas&#xD;
      of the female body, including the pelvic floor. Menopause can, therefore, lead to functional&#xD;
      genital or urinary symptoms impacting women's quality of life. It is debatable to which&#xD;
      extent modifications and symptoms occurring after menopause are related to estrogen&#xD;
      deficiency or to the aging process per se. Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) involves histological,&#xD;
      morphological, microbiological, and clinical changes. These include alteration in collagens,&#xD;
      decreased quantity of elastic fibers, reduced vascularization, thinning and flattening of the&#xD;
      vaginal epithelium, and production of glycogen, an essential factor for the growth of vaginal&#xD;
      lactobacilli. As a consequence, the vaginal canal becomes shorter and narrower, and the&#xD;
      vaginal epithelium becomes paler and more likely to develop petechiae. Further, a decrease in&#xD;
      Lactobacillus species and a rise of vaginal pH values over 4.5 are observed, resulting in the&#xD;
      loss of the local vaginal defense mechanisms against bacterial pathogens, which may&#xD;
      predispose to local inflammation and/or infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with VVA commonly complain of vaginal dryness, burning, irritation or itching, and&#xD;
      dyspareunia. Local estrogens represent the first-line therapy for VVA. However, women's&#xD;
      compliance with and preference for this treatment are poor; alternatives and palliative&#xD;
      solutions, such as moisturizing or lubricant local creams or gels, are commonly proposed. In&#xD;
      recent years, fractional CO 2 laser has become a popular, efficient, precise, and safe&#xD;
      system, particularly for dermatologists and plastic surgeons. CO 2 laser has many&#xD;
      applications, including treatment of skin lesions (ie, seborrheic keratosis, syringomas, and&#xD;
      xanthelasmas around the eye), warts, and toenail diseases, as well as anti-aging function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various therapeutic strategies, hormonal or not, oral or local, have been proposed for the&#xD;
      improvement of the vaginal microecosystem of postmenopausal women (e.g. estrogens,&#xD;
      probiotics, combination of vaginal estrogens with live Lactobacillus). Hormonal therapy (oral&#xD;
      or local) has been associated with a healthier vaginal microecosystem by repopulating the&#xD;
      Lactobacillus species to a premenopausal status and by reducing the pH of vaginal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In women treated for estrogen dependent cancer i.e. endometrial and breast cancer women and&#xD;
      practioners are reluctant to use estrogens and favor non-hormonal treatment modalities. The&#xD;
      effect of these on the histological, microbiological and clinical symptoms is poorly&#xD;
      understood and lack randomized trials to evaluate effect. Several proof of concept and&#xD;
      feasibility studies have shown clinical effects of laser as potential treatment but little is&#xD;
      known if it can stand alone or if supplementation with estrogens may benefit the clinical&#xD;
      symptoms and vulvovaginal environment further. Thus, the ideal management for the achievement&#xD;
      of the optimal benefit - risk balance is still under investigation. The choice of treatment&#xD;
      is often guided by clinical experience and patient preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In postmenopausal women, the disturbance of Lactobacillary flora was correlated with the&#xD;
      presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, enterococci, group B streptococci,&#xD;
      and Escherichia coli. Available data indicate that pre-existing vaginal colonization with&#xD;
      pathogenic enterobacteria is essential for the appearance and recurrence of urinary tract&#xD;
      infections (UTIs). Indeed, postmenopausal women are prone to UTIs with an incidence of about&#xD;
      8% per year and a 4% likelihood of recurrence, while symptomatic bacteriuria was estimated in&#xD;
      up to 15% of women. The general population of lactobacilli, as assessed in the routine&#xD;
      practice, provides indirect information regarding the estrogenic status. To our knowledge&#xD;
      there is currently no evidence regarding the potential impact that the intravaginal laser&#xD;
      therapy may have on the vaginal microenvironment in women with symptoms of GSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser treatment improves significantly the VVA symptoms, sexual function and quality of life&#xD;
      of postmenopausal women, as well as the vaginal health index. Other studies found restored&#xD;
      thickness of the squamous stratified epithelium of the vaginal mucosa with a significant&#xD;
      storage of glycogen in the epithelial cells and remodelling the vaginal connective tissue&#xD;
      with the production of new collagen and ground substance molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in Denmark, annually ca. 4600 women are&#xD;
      diagnosed with the disease, of whom 30% are under the age of 55. Most patients undergo breast&#xD;
      conserving surgery followed by adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy varies according to stage&#xD;
      of disease, but radiotherapy is often added, as well as chemotherapy. If the cancer is&#xD;
      hormonally responsive, long term antihormonal treatment is also given, such as the selective&#xD;
      estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen for pre-menopausal women, that works as a&#xD;
      inhibitor of estrogen in breast tissue, but as an estrogen in other tissues such as the&#xD;
      endometrium. Post-menopausal women with hormone responsive breast cancer are treated with&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors for five years. Most side effects associated with tamoxifen (TAM) and&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are related to estrogen deprivation, and the symptoms are similar&#xD;
      to those experienced during natural menopause. It has been reported that up to 50-75% of&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors experience one or more genitourinary symptoms and puts the sexual&#xD;
      life of women under stress. Postmenopausal women may have many common age-related symptoms&#xD;
      but also have the above mentioned iatrogenic factors entering their lives to aggravate the&#xD;
      symptom complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study was to assess the effect of laser laser therapy with and without&#xD;
      local estrogens. The study groups consist of 1) postmenopausal women and 2 ) women treated&#xD;
      for breast cancer. The laser treatment was given randomized to these women. The effects were&#xD;
      evaluated in the histopathology of the vagina, the vaginal microenvironment, and health&#xD;
      related questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>a sterile swab is inserted into the vaginal canal and a sample obtained from the posterior fornix of the vagina. Vaginal samples are placed in a transport gel (Stuart). pH indicator strips (MColorpHastTM, Merck, Germany) are applied against the lateral vaginal wall using sterile forceps, followed by a vaginal lavage for wet mount. Smears from vaginal samples are placed on a glass slide, observed under microscope for Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida species and stained afterwards according to standard Gram stain procedure. Cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria species are performed, using MacConkey agar, blood agar, Sabouraud dextrose agar, chocolate agar as culture media, focusing on bacteria with potential clinical impact (e.g. aerobic vaginitis39, UTIs, vaginal candidiasis).</description>
