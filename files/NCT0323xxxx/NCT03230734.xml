      Randomized, multicentre phase II trial of the sequencing of Radium-223 and Docetaxel plus&#xD;
      prednisone in symptomatic bone-only metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, randomized phase II trial in patients with symptomatic bone-only metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. Eligible patients are randomly assigned into two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: radium-223 initially followed by docetaxel plus prednisone at the time of&#xD;
           progression (the second step is optional according to clinical evolution of disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: docetaxel plus prednisone initially followed by radium-223 at the time of&#xD;
           progression (the second step is optional according to clinical evolution of disease).&#xD;

      Randomized, multicentre phase II trial of the sequencing of Radium-223 and Docetaxel plus&#xD;
      prednisone in symptomatic bone-only metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine the effects of sequential treatment between radium-223 and&#xD;
      docetaxel on the percentage of symptomatic bone-only CRPC patients experiencing improvement&#xD;
      or worsening in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) Secondary objective: To compare&#xD;
      survival in patients treated with sequential therapy between radium-223 and docetaxel and to&#xD;
      identify predictive factors of Radium-223 for clinical outcome (progression free survival and&#xD;
      overall survival) in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radium-223: administered at the dose of 55 kBq per kg body weight, given at 4 week intervals&#xD;
      for 6 injections, by slow intravenous injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel: administered at the dose of 75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over a period of 1&#xD;
      hour every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. It is associated with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily&#xD;
      administered continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methodology A responder analysis investigating treatment effects on percentage of&#xD;
      patients experiencing meaningful HRQoL improvement/worsening on treatment will be conducted.&#xD;
      When defining meaningful improvement/worsening, the upper limit of the minimally important&#xD;
      difference (MID) range will be used. The MIDs for FACT-P total score and subscales that will&#xD;
      be used in this study will be 10 and 3, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients experiencing a QoL increase &gt;=MID from baseline at week 12 will be considered&#xD;
      responders while patients experiencing a decrease in HRQoL score &gt;=MID at this time point&#xD;
      will be considered to have experienced worsening HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to primary endpoint, considering a type I error 0.10, type II error 0.20,&#xD;
      proportion of responder patients in the standard arm 0.10 and in the experimental arm of&#xD;
      0.40, a total of 70 patients (35 for each arm) will be enrolled in the study. Chi-square&#xD;
      tests will be used to test for an association between treatment and meaningful improvement&#xD;
      (i.e. responder) or worsening in HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to secondary endpoints, PFS, TPFS and OS will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      method. The treatment groups will be compared with a two-sided log rank test. All analyses&#xD;
      will be done in the intention-to-treat population. For translational studies, we will conduct&#xD;
      a prognostic and predictive factor analysis for time-to-event clinical outcomes using a&#xD;
      univariate Cox model; significant factors subsequently will be included in a multivariable&#xD;
      Cox regression model (cutoff p&lt;0•05).&#xD;
