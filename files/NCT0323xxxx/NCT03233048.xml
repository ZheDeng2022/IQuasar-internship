  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason we are doing this research is to get information about the ORBERA™ Intragastric&#xD;
      Balloon to learn if it is safe and if it works. We want to learn if older teenagers who are&#xD;
      overweight will lose weight and if their other medical problems will get better. ORBERA™ is a&#xD;
      special balloon approved by the FDA for overweight adults, and we would like to try using it&#xD;
      for overweight teenagers.&#xD;

      After obtaining consent and determining that participants meet the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, participants will have baseline tests and initial visits with a physician,&#xD;
      dietitian, and psychologist. Next, the ORBERA™ Intragastric Balloon (IGB) will be inserted&#xD;
      into the stomach and then removed after 6 months. Participants will continue to be followed&#xD;
      for 6 months after the balloon is removed. Throughout the year, participants will have&#xD;
      additional tests along with ongoing visits with a physician, dietitian, and psychologist.&#xD;
