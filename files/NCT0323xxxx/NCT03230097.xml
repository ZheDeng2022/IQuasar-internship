    <textblock>
      This is a study in people between 16 and 30 years of age who have a specific type of mental&#xD;
      illness called attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS). The purpose of this study is to find out&#xD;
      whether BI 409306 helps reduce the symptoms of APS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are in the study for 1 year and 2 months. During this time, they visit the study&#xD;
      site about 15 times and get about 10 phone calls. Participants are put into 2 groups by&#xD;
      chance. They get either BI 409306 or placebo. Placebo tablets look like BI 409306 tablets but&#xD;
      do not contain any medicine. Participants take a BI 409306 or placebo tablet two times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants answer questions in interviews and complete questionnaires so&#xD;
      the doctors can check whether the APS symptoms change. The doctors also check the general&#xD;
      health of the participants.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet diagnostic criteria for attenuated psychosis syndrome as defined in DSM-5 and&#xD;
             determined by SIPS administered at screening and diagnosis confirmed by NeuroCog&#xD;
             Trials after review of video-taped SIPS interview.&#xD;

                  effective methods of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure&#xD;
                  rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Patients must&#xD;
                  agree to use birth control throughout the trial and for at least 28 days after&#xD;
                  treatment has ended. Acceptable methods of birth control include combined&#xD;
                  estrogen-progestin oral, intravaginal or transdermal contraceptives,&#xD;
                  progestogen-only oral, injectable or implantable contraceptives, intrauterine&#xD;
                  devices (IUDs), intrauterine hormone releasing systems (IUSs), bilateral tubal&#xD;
                  occlusion, vasectomized sexual partner, and complete sexual abstinence (if&#xD;
                  acceptable by local health authorities) is allowed when this is in line with the&#xD;
                  preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,&#xD;
                  calendar, ovulation, symptom-thermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are&#xD;
                  not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male patients who are able to father a child must be ready and able to be&#xD;
                  abstinent or use adequate contraception for the duration of study participation&#xD;
                  and for at least 28 days after treatment has ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
             (GCP) and local legislation prior to any study-related procedures OR signed and dated&#xD;

             the patient prior to any study-related procedures in accordance with GCP and local&#xD;
             legislation. If the patient has a legal representative, then this legal representative&#xD;
             must give written informed consent as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Present or past diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform, schizoaffective&#xD;

             and other psychotic disorder (except attenuated psychosis syndrome), and unspecified&#xD;
             schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, according to DSM-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking antipsychotic medication for less than 8 weeks, or patients taking&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who begin taking an antipsychotic between Visit 1 and Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have discontinued an antipsychotic medication less than two weeks prior&#xD;

             potential lethality of 2, or that in the judgement of the investigator would&#xD;
             jeopardize the patient's safety while participating in the trial. The&#xD;
             investigator/qualified rater must review all screening C-SSRS reports prior to&#xD;

             metabolizers of CYP2C19. (A list of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 inhibitors can be found in the&#xD;
             ISF.).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Previous participation in any BI 409306 study.&#xD;
