  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Mexico is lacking guidelines that provide an integral approach for the prevention&#xD;
      and control of respiratory diseases in adults. The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a&#xD;
      &quot;Practical Approach to Lung Health&quot; (PAL) using generic guidelines to be used in primary&#xD;
      health care settings for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases. These guidelines&#xD;
      were adapted to the Mexican context as AIRE campaign by the Instituto Nacional de&#xD;
      Enfermedades Respiratorias, Mexico. Objective. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness&#xD;
      of implementing a model of care for respiratory diseases in adults based on AIRE guidelines,.&#xD;
      Materials and methods. Prospective quasi-experimental pre-post study. During 03-08/2013&#xD;
      (phase 1), investigators recruited consenting subjects older than 15 years of age seeking&#xD;
      medical care in primary care centers in Orizaba, Veracruz. Researchers investigated&#xD;
      sociodemographic, epidemiological and clinical information before consultation. On patients&#xD;
      who had been diagnosed with respiratory disease by a physician, researchers investigated&#xD;
      prescribed treatment on leaving the physician´s office. A month later conducted a home visit&#xD;
      to investigate clinical outcome. During 09/2014 we trained doctors from the participating&#xD;
      health centers in &quot;AIRE&quot; guidelines. From 10/2014 to 03/2015 (phase 2) researchers again&#xD;
      surveyed all consenting subjects older than 15 years of age who received health services in&#xD;
      the same health centers following the same procedures as in phase 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design was that of a prospective quasi-experimental pre-post study. A pre-survey and a&#xD;
      follow-up survey were used.Investigators selected 4 health centers in the Sanitary&#xD;
      Jurisdiction in Orizaba, Veracruz, two located in rural areas (Potrerillo and Tlilapan) and&#xD;
      two located in urban areas (Río Blanco and Orizaba). The pre-survey (phase1) was conducted on&#xD;
      all consenting individuals older than 15 years seeking health services in selected health&#xD;
      centers. Before the physician consultation, researchers investigated sociodemographic,&#xD;
      epidemiologic, clinical characteristics and reason for seeking health services. Immediately&#xD;
      after consultation, researchers asked the patient his/her diagnoses. Investigators confirmed&#xD;
      all diagnoses with treating physicians. If the patient had been diagnosed with respiratory&#xD;
      disease, researchers collected information on prescribed treatment, and classified the type&#xD;
      of respiratory disease and comorbidities based on the 10th International Classification of&#xD;
      Diseases (ICD-10). Researchers conducted a home visit one month after the consultation to&#xD;
      determine clinical evolution, occurrence of referral to a specialist, if the patient had&#xD;
      obtained prescribed drugs at the health center or at a private drugstore and if the patients&#xD;
      had been hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During September 2014 researchers trained health personnel from the participating health&#xD;
      centers on implementation of the proposed model based on the AIRE guidelines previously&#xD;
      approved by the AIRE committee of the INER. The AIRE guidelines have been adapted from WHO&#xD;
      &quot;Practical Approach to Lung Health&quot; and include management of asthma, acute respiratory&#xD;
      infections (ARI, that comprises acute bronchitis and pneumonia), chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD), infections of the upper respiratory airways, and preventive&#xD;
      measures for smoking, tuberculosis and breathing disorders during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model was presented to the authorities of the participating health services and of the&#xD;
      local hospital (Regional Hospital in Río Blanco (HRRB, its acronym in Spanish) as well as to&#xD;
      health personnel involved in treatment of respiratory diseases, to promote their&#xD;
      participation, counseling and support for the referral and counter-referral of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of the guidelines included: 1) availability of the guidelines for the&#xD;
      management of respiratory diseases in primary care &quot;AIRE&quot;, that were revised and modified&#xD;
      based on the analysis of the first phase of the study. Physicians providing primary care in&#xD;
      the health centers and at the local hospital revised the guidelines to ensure that language&#xD;
      was understandable. 2) Distribution of educational materials to health personnel including&#xD;
      printed and electronic versions of AIRE guidelines, algorithm for management of acute and&#xD;
      severe respiratory disease, and operational and good clinical practices manuals; 3) Training&#xD;
      at the INER of the pulmonologist of the local hospital on AIRE guidelines and certification&#xD;
      in spirometry. 4) Development of two workshops for 97 physicians and nurses of the&#xD;
      participating health centers on AIRE Guidelines, oximetry tests, spirometry, referral and&#xD;
      counter-referral of patients and clinical cases with the participation of specialized&#xD;
      physicians from the INER, HRRB and the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP); 5)&#xD;
      Creation of a respiratory health network between primary care facilities, hospital and public&#xD;
      health offices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers considered that patients participated in one of the two phases according to the&#xD;
      period in which they sought health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers defined a patient with a respiratory disease as any patient who after&#xD;
      consultation with a physician was diagnosed with a respiratory disease according to the&#xD;
      ICD-10. The medical diagnosis was obtained from the patient and confirmed with the treating&#xD;
      physician and classified according to ICD-10. Respiratory diseases were classified in the&#xD;
      following categories: emphysema, asthma and bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, lung cancer,&#xD;
      chronic bronchitis, COPD and TB. Researchers also used a second categorization as follows:&#xD;
      viral infections, bacterial infections and chronic diseases following the national clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines . Comorbidities were classified in the following categories: diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, HIV and heart disease. The reason for seeking medical attention was classified&#xD;
      into 20 categories. Researchers defined timeliness in requesting of health services measuring&#xD;
      the interval from the onset of symptoms to request of physician consultation both as a&#xD;
      continuous variable and as a dichotomic variable using as cut off &gt;3 days. Researchers&#xD;
      obtained the physician prescription and classified prescribed drugs as antibiotics,&#xD;
      corticosteroids, cough suppressants, expectorants, bronchodilators, analgesics and&#xD;
      antihistamines. Researchers also grouped cough suppressants, expectorants, analgesics and&#xD;
      antihistamines in one category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers categorized age in 3 groups: 15 to 44 years, 45 to 59 years and &gt;60 years. The&#xD;
      variable &quot;type of floor&quot; was classified in two categories (hard floor/earth floor) according&#xD;
      to the material of the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking was categorized as whether the patient was a current smoker or not. Alcohol&#xD;
      consumption was dichotomized in more or equal or less than 14 alcoholic drinks per week. Use&#xD;
      of drugs was categorized as to whether the patient reported using drugs during the study&#xD;
      period. Researchers considered a patient was exposed to dust or smoke if he/she had worked&#xD;
      for more than a year in a place with dust, smoke or vapors. Researchers considered&#xD;
      occupational exposure to asbestos if the patient had worked for more than a year in a place&#xD;
      with asbestos. Biomass exposure was categorized as whether the patient was currently exposed&#xD;
      or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers compared sociodemographic, epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of patients&#xD;
      demanding physician consultation and of patients who were diagnosed with respiratory disease&#xD;
      according to study period. In the bivariate analysis researchers used U of Mann Whitney test&#xD;
      for continuous variables that didn't follow a normal distribution, chi-squared of Pearson&#xD;
      test for dichotomous variables and binomial test for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers compared by bivariate analyses the following outcomes according to study phase:&#xD;
      1) Acquisition of prescribed drugs in the pharmacy of the health center; 2) Treatment based&#xD;
      on guidelines; 3) Clinical outcome; 4) Referral to a specialist. Using multivariate&#xD;
      unconditional logistic regression, we built three models to investigate the association&#xD;
      between phase of the study and 1) Acquisition of prescribed drugs in the pharmacy of the&#xD;
      health center; 2) Treatment based on guidelines; 3) Clinical outcome. Variables with p &lt; 0.20&#xD;
      in the bivariate analysis and biological plausibility were included in multivariate models.&#xD;
      Multivariate models were built considering patients as clusters given that each patient could&#xD;
      have had more than one drug prescription. Researchers estimated the odds ratio (OR) and 95&#xD;
      per cent confidence intervals (95% CI), and identified the covariates that were independently&#xD;
      associated with each outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package STATA V13.3 (StataCorp&#xD;
      LP).&#xD;
