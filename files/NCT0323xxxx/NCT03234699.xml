  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to investigate the influence of cenobamate on the activity of CYP3A4/5,&#xD;
      CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9 by using drugs recommended by both the FDA and EMA as in vivo&#xD;
      probes. In order to avoid a potential pharmacokinetic interaction between the probes,&#xD;
      midazolam (CYP3A), warfarin (CYP2C9), and omeprazole (CYP2C19) will be administered together&#xD;
      as a validated cocktail and separately from bupropion (CYP2B6) using an adequate washout time&#xD;
      period between the 2 assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting daily dose of cenobamate will be 12.5 mg, which will be administered for 2&#xD;
      weeks. Then, daily cenobamate doses will be increased every 2 weeks to 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg,&#xD;
      150 mg, and 200 mg. The CYP probes will be tested before cenobamate administration, at steady&#xD;
      state at 100mg/day of cenobamate for midazolam only and finally at steady state at 200mg/day&#xD;
      of cenobamate for all CYP probes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this DDI study will provide a basis to make appropriate dose recommendation&#xD;
      for a safe use of concomitant drugs with cenobamate using these isoenzymes in their metabolic&#xD;
      pathway.&#xD;
