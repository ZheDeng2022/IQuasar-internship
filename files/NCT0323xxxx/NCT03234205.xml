  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measurement of T2 transversal relaxation time by magnetic resonance has a major interest in&#xD;
      cardiac imagery. It has been initially used for quantitative evaluation of heart viability&#xD;
      and more recently for edema characterization. It allows to prematurely detect a cardiac&#xD;
      transplant rejection. This technique needs successively around ten FSE sequences during&#xD;
      apnea. Weak reproducibility of successive apneas and discomfort of patient limit the&#xD;
      precision of this measurement and consequently its use in standard care. The ARTEMIS study&#xD;
      method allows the examination during free respiration without prolonging the duration of&#xD;
      examination compared to the examination during apnea. Moreover, image processing is&#xD;
      simplified and correction of respiratory movements renders results more reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study of evaluation of ARTEMIS technique of image reconstruction. ARTEMIS is&#xD;
      a method of MRI image reconstruction for measurements of T2 transversal relaxation. It allows&#xD;
      to obtain diagnostic images without movement artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective si to show the feasibility of ARTEMIS method for measurement of&#xD;
      myocardial T2 relaxation time during free respiration in cardiac transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to collect quantitative data to compare ARTEMIS method of&#xD;
      measurement of T2 during free respiration and standard clinical practice during apnea.&#xD;
