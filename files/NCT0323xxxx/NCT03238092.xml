  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vitro fertilization(IVF) with Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist is one of&#xD;
      the most used protocol for the treatment of infertile couples nowadays. Despite several&#xD;
      advantages over GnRH agonist, the antagonist may be associated with a slightly reduction in&#xD;
      pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several medications have been tested in order to increase ovarian response to ovulation&#xD;
      induction, including estradiol and testosterone. A clinical trial in women with IVF&#xD;
      indication will be performed and this women will be randomly assigned to receive topic&#xD;
      testosterone, oral estradiol or no pre-treatment prior to IVF with human Chorionic&#xD;
      Gonadotropin (hMG) and GnRH antagonist. The primary endpoint will be the size and number of&#xD;
      follicles on the beginning of the cycle, after pre-treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the key-words to a successful IVF it is the response to the ovarian controlled&#xD;
      stimulation. Nowadays, one of the most common protocols includes exogenous gonadotropins and&#xD;
      GnRH antagonist, followed by IVF. The GnRH antagonist avoids the premature peak of LH and has&#xD;
      advantages in relation to the GnRH agonist; however it might have a negative effect over the&#xD;
      pregnancy rate. One possible explanation is the heterogeneity of the follicular cohort at the&#xD;
      moment of ovarian puncture, due to the rise of FSH at luteal-follicular transition. The&#xD;
      estrogen can inhibits this rise of Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), resulting in a more&#xD;
      synchronic cohort. Previous studies have demonstrated a reduction in the cancellation rates&#xD;
      with estradiol in the luteal phase of the cycle prior to the beginning of IVF using GnRH&#xD;
      antagonist protocol, with a trend towards better quality of transferred embryos and better&#xD;
      implantation rates when compared to the standard protocol with antagonist. The use of&#xD;
      androgens is based on the assumption that they generate an increase in FSH receptors in the&#xD;
      granulosa cells, increase in follicular growth and estrogen production, according to animal&#xD;
      and human studies. Despite promising initial results, further studies are needed to evaluate&#xD;
      the benefit of testosterone as a pretreatment in women undergoing IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol is the following: Around the 20th day of the cycle prior to the choice of&#xD;
      IVF, transvaginal pelvic ultrasound and serum progesterone dosage will be performed in all&#xD;
      patients. After confirmation of ovulation and no contraindications for the continuation of&#xD;
      the study, according to the randomization, testosterone gel, estradiol oral or no treatment&#xD;
      will be initiated. Both medications will be continued until the first day of subsequent&#xD;
      menstruation. After the menses, between the second and third day of the cycle, a new&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound will be performed and blood tests will be collected for the dosage of&#xD;
      FSH, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), progesterone and estradiol. On the same day, subcutaneous hMG&#xD;
      (Menopur®) will be started at a dose between 150 and 300 IU / day, according to age and HAM,&#xD;
      which will be subsequently adjusted according to the ovarian response on serial&#xD;
      ultrasonography. When the largest follicle reaches a mean diameter of 14 mm, the GnRH&#xD;
      antagonist (Orgalutran ®) will be initiated to prevent early LH peak, and monitored&#xD;
      follicular growth with echography every 1-2 days. HCG will be administered at a dose of&#xD;
      10,000 IU (Choriomon®) when three or more follicles reach a mean diameter of 17 mm. After&#xD;
      36h, follicular puncture will be performed transvaginally, under general anesthesia. Embryo&#xD;
      transfer will occur between the third and fifth day after in vitro fertilization. Luteal&#xD;
      support will be given with administration of progesterone 600 mg / day vaginally, initiated&#xD;
      after the transfer and maintained until the first trimester of pregnancy if it occurs. Serum&#xD;
      beta-HCG measurement will be performed on the 12th day after transfer, for evaluation of&#xD;
      pregnancy implantation. Clinical gestation will be considered when there is evidence of&#xD;
      intrauterine embryo with cardiac beats present on the ultrasound, after 6 weeks of transfer&#xD;
      of the embryo (s).&#xD;
