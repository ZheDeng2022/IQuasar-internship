  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for the development and validation of new teaching strategies and resources&#xD;
      for surgical training that can occur outside of the operating room. The use of surgical&#xD;
      videos is not novel however it has not been validated as an effective approach for&#xD;
      gynecologic surgical training. The goals of our study are to (1) develop an educational&#xD;
      surgical video for laparoscopic salpingo-oophrectomy (LSO) and (2) to evaluate and test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this tool in preparing residents for performance in the operating room.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the rapidly changing face of surgical education and with a pressure to adopt&#xD;
      competency-based training and assessment nationwide, obstetrics and gynecology residency&#xD;
      programs will be forced to implement effective strategies to ensure that learners acquire the&#xD;
      skill set required to become competent gynecologists. However, very few instructional tools&#xD;
      have been validated in gynecologic surgery. The use of surgical videos as a teaching strategy&#xD;
      may be one piece to this puzzle. Surgical videos are becoming increasingly popular, however,&#xD;
      their value as an effective instructional technique has yet to be validated. Should surgical&#xD;
      videos prove to be of benefit in surgical training it would offer an alternate modality to&#xD;
      optimize operating room experiences and learning for gynecology residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstetrics and gynecology residents in years one and two of their training (junior&#xD;
      residents), will view a teaching video about LSO (intervention group) compared to not&#xD;
      watching a video (control group) to assess if our intervention results in better performance&#xD;
      in the operating room for this procedure as rated by an objective structured assessment of&#xD;
      technical skills tool (OSAT) (primary outcome). Secondary outcome measures will include a&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire grading knowledge and confidence, and a 5-point Likert scale&#xD;
      grading resident satisfaction with the video.&#xD;
