    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify whether pregnant women with chronic hypertension are&#xD;
      at significantly higher risk of having undiagnosed OSA and should be routinely screened with&#xD;
      home sleep tests. The investigators will recruit 120 pregnant subjects between 10-20 weeks&#xD;
      gestation from the Duke High Risk Obstetrics Clinic over a 20-month period. They will be&#xD;
      enrolled into one of two groups: 1) chronic hypertension (on medication or hypertensive blood&#xD;
      pressures documented at 3 clinic visits); 2) normal blood pressure, and not on any treatment&#xD;
      for chronic HTN and no history of chronic HTN, and matched for BMI (+/- 3 kg/m2) with the&#xD;
      chronic HTN group. The two groups will be matched for BMI to control for the effect of&#xD;
      obesity on OSA diagnosis and cHTN. The primary hypothesis, that OSA prevalence differs&#xD;
      between patients with chronic HTN and normotensive controls, will be assessed with a&#xD;
      two-group two-sided Fisher's exact test. A Fisher's exact test with a 0.05 two-sided&#xD;
      significance level will have 92% power to detect the difference between a normotensive OSA&#xD;
      rate of 0.10 and a chronic hypertensive OSA rate of 0.40 when the sample size in each group&#xD;
      is 50. There are no risks associated with the use of the home sleep test device, but subjects&#xD;
      that have a severe latex allergy should not participate, as the device&#xD;
