  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to use a three arms randomized clinical trial study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a video-led intervention in helping male smokers whose partner got pregnant&#xD;
      in Mainland China to quit smoking.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With a globally growing number of smokers, up to about half of men and one tenth of women are&#xD;
      becoming smokers and relatively few stopping, especially in Mainland China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been proved that tobacco is responsible for even more deaths and diseases. Smokers&#xD;
      have two to three times mortality in middle age among otherwise similar persons who had never&#xD;
      smoked. According to the literature review, smoking has been confirmed to be an important&#xD;
      risk factor to most chronic diseases and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the male smokers at their reproductive ages, who is preparing to have a baby, smoking may&#xD;
      negatively influence their reproductive capacity. Sufficient studies found that the quantity&#xD;
      and duration of smoking, especially the current smoking is positively associated with the&#xD;
      risk of erectile dysfunction. Smoking may increase the risk of a higher risk of developing&#xD;
      oligospermia, asthenozoospermia and teratozoospermia for man in the reproductive years, which&#xD;
      may lead to the inefficiency of fertilization and even give birth to abnormal fetus. Besides,&#xD;
      secondhand Smoking (SHS) exposure also have further and longer negative effects on their&#xD;
      female partner and their baby born in the future. The non-smoking population is much more&#xD;
      sensitive to the nicotine in the passive smoking than smokers. The SHS may increase the risk&#xD;
      of respiratory infections, ear problem, immediate adverse effects on cardiovascular system,&#xD;
      lung cancer and so on to adults. For the children, the passive smoking make children have a&#xD;
      higher chance to get severe asthma, slow lung growth. Hence, children and women live with&#xD;
      smokers may have a higher risk of premature death and disease. Besides, newborns whose&#xD;
      mothers were exposed to secondhand smoke showed significantly lower scores in the habituation&#xD;
      cluster and motor system cluster, as well as the delay of neurobehavioral development&#xD;
      regardless of socio-demographic, obstetric and pediatric factors. Conclusively, smoking has&#xD;
      direct and indirect negative effect to male smokers in reproductive ages themselves and their&#xD;
      family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the official statistic figures in 2010, about one third of people in China were&#xD;
      current smokers, and the number of young smokers is increasing. While most current smokers&#xD;
      (83.9%) report having no intention to quit smoking (WHO, 2011). On average, between 60% and&#xD;
      70% of Chinese men continue to smoke into middle age, which is different with the western&#xD;
      countries. Hence, finding out a solution to decrease the married reproductive male smoking&#xD;
      rate is extremely crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall awareness of the health hazards of tobacco has improved in the last 15 years in&#xD;
      China, but is still relatively poor. Even there were several patterns of propaganda and&#xD;
      education applied in China, the efficiency is not very satisfactory. Hence, an effective&#xD;
      education interventions that delivery the health hazards of tobacco to male smokers and&#xD;
      secondhand smoking to their wives and baby born in the future should be developed and&#xD;
      implemented for reproductive male smokers in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different patterns of interventions, such as counselling, advertising, leaflets and so on&#xD;
      have been implemented, however the effect is not so well as we expected. Thus, a more&#xD;
      efficient intervention should be developed. As the high usage rate of smart phone,&#xD;
      interventions implemented by cellphone can be considered as a new approach. Watching video&#xD;
      has been proven to be significantly associated with prevalence abstinence. Video, combining&#xD;
      with the advantage of text, image, and tones, will take visual, auditory and reading&#xD;
      stimulation to the brain, consequently, enhance the delivery and memory of information for&#xD;
      people. Hence video is an efficient intervention medium for smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that, a video-led intervention will be applied to help male smokers whose partner got&#xD;
      pregnant in Mainland China to quit or reduce the cigarette smoking.&#xD;
