  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial that will be done in the state of Kuwait, at the physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation medicine hospital. the participants will be recruited from all over Kuwait,&#xD;
      there is a clinical registry upon the ethical committee in Kuwait assigned by the ministry of&#xD;
      health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical therapy approaches continue evolving. During the last years, minimally invasive&#xD;
      techniques such as percutaneous needle electrolysis (PNE) was being developed, obtaining&#xD;
      promising results for tendon pathology. PNE technique is a minimally invasive treatment that&#xD;
      consists of an application of a galvanic electrolytic current that causes a controlled local&#xD;
      inflammatory process in the target tissue. This allows for phagocytosis and the subsequent&#xD;
      regeneration of the affected tissue. Nowadays, PNE is being used in clinical practice to&#xD;
      manage MTrP, but there are no studies supporting that they have an additional beneficial&#xD;
      effect over DN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a biological point of view, it seems reasonable to ascertain that a patient will obtain&#xD;
      benefits thanks to the mechanical effects provided by the needle and that patients may&#xD;
      benefit more if the electrolysis effect is added to the mechanical stimuli provided by the&#xD;
      needle. Therefore, the aim of this randomized controlled study is to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of DN versus PNE for the level of pain in patients suffering from PHP.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a prospective, two parallel-groups (participant) randomized controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment at baseline, and at 4, 8, 12, 26 and 52 weeks.

    <masking_description>Participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria will receive the standardized oral and written information, and, once they consent to participate in the trial, will be randomized in a block system by blocks of 10 patients. Allocation to the groups will be achieved using a computer program (Randomizer, https://www.randomizer.org/) generated a random patient file numbers sequence by a third person not involved in the study from the file section in Kuwait. This person will be responsible for guarding the envelope with the information of the randomization. The envelopes will be closed until the moment of the intervention to maintain the blinding. This professional also will ask the patients for informed consent. The consent form is recruited upon the ethical medical committee at the ministry of health in the state of Kuwait.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Foot Health Status Questioner (FHSQ) PAIN</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks, 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the FHSQ at baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks post-treatment. The FHSQ consists of 13 questions reflecting fourfoot health-related domains: pain (4 questions), function (4 questions), footwear (3 questions), and general foot health (2 questions). Individual item scores will then be re-coded, tabulated, and finally transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 for each of the four domains. Greater scores reflect better foot health and quality of life. The FHSQ has been validated and has been used in similar trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of different interventions for plantar heel pain</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS Maximum</measure>
    <time_frame>1st session (baseline), 2nd session (week 2), 3rd session (week 3), 4th session (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the visual analogue scale (VAS) before each treatment session, considering the level of pain they have just before start the treatment session and the highest level of pain they have had during the last 48 hours. The exact words of the questions will be: 1) what is the level of pain, as average, you have feel during last 48 hours?; and 2) what is the maximum level of pain you have feel during last 48 hours? Participants will be explained that a score of 0 indicates the absence of pain whereas a score of 10 represents the maximum tolerable pain. The VAS is widely used and is valid and reliable</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Quality of Life (QoL) Will be Assessed With the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks, 52 weeks&quot;</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L self-report questionnaire is a descriptive system with five questions, each representing one dimension of health-related QoL, that is, mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain/discomfort and depression/anxiety. Each dimension can be rated on five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. Scoring is based on a 0 to 100% scale, where 100% represent the best QoL.</description>

    <description>Once the clinician locates the MTrP, he will insert the needle over it and he will do a quick entry of the needle. The chosen technique to manipulate the needle will be Hong technique, which consist of quick entry and exit of the needle (fast in/fast out) to get local twitch response (LTR), it will be repeated 5 times with a rhythmic movement of 1Hz/sec. LTRs will be counted and registered.</description>

        <description>Participants will complete the FHSQ at baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks post-treatment. The FHSQ consists of 13 questions reflecting fourfoot health-related domains: pain (4 questions), function (4 questions), footwear (3 questions), and general foot health (2 questions). Individual item scores will then be re-coded, tabulated, and finally transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 for each of the four domains. Greater scores reflect better foot health and quality of life. The FHSQ has been validated and has been used in similar trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of different interventions for plantar heel pain</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L self-report questionnaire is a descriptive system with five questions, each representing one dimension of health-related QoL, that is, mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain/discomfort and depression/anxiety. Each dimension can be rated on five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. Scoring is based on a 0 to 100% scale, where 100% represent the best QoL.</description>

          <title>The Quality of Life (QoL) Will be Assessed With the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)</title>
          <description>The EQ-5D-5L self-report questionnaire is a descriptive system with five questions, each representing one dimension of health-related QoL, that is, mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain/discomfort and depression/anxiety. Each dimension can be rated on five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. Scoring is based on a 0 to 100% scale, where 100% represent the best QoL.</description>

        <title>Foot Health Status Questioner (FHSQ) PAIN</title>
        <description>Participants will complete the FHSQ at baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks post-treatment. The FHSQ consists of 13 questions reflecting fourfoot health-related domains: pain (4 questions), function (4 questions), footwear (3 questions), and general foot health (2 questions). Individual item scores will then be re-coded, tabulated, and finally transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 for each of the four domains. Greater scores reflect better foot health and quality of life. The FHSQ has been validated and has been used in similar trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of different interventions for plantar heel pain</description>

            <description>Once the clinician locates the MTrP, he will insert the needle over it and he will do a quick entry of the needle. The chosen technique to manipulate the needle will be Hong technique, which consist of quick entry and exit of the needle (fast in/fast out) to get local twitch response (LTR), it will be repeated 5 times with a rhythmic movement of 1Hz/sec. LTRs will be counted and registered.&#xD;
dry needling: The electrotherapy equipment used (Enruf) produces a continuous galvanic current through the cathode (modified electrosurgical scalpel with the needle) while the patient holds the anode (handheld electrode) (42). Once the needle have reach the relevant treatment area, a continuous current of 3 pulses at an intensity of 3 1.5 mA for 5 seconds conveyed to the muscle will be applied.</description>

It will be done exactly the same way as in the DN group with the only difference that the needle will be transmitting the electrical current.&#xD;
