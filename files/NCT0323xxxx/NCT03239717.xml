  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are essential nutrients that the body obtains from&#xD;
      proteins found in food, especially meat, diary products, and legumes. Data from rodent&#xD;
      studies suggest that reduction of dietary BCAAs will promote fat mass loss and improved&#xD;
      control of blood glucose. The purpose of this study is to test if reduction of dietary BCAAs&#xD;
      without reducing calorie intake will lead to similar metabolic benefits in humans. Here the&#xD;
      investigators test the feasibility of reducing dietary BCAAs using BCAA-free meal replacement&#xD;
      beverages for two months.&#xD;

      This study, which will be completed over three months, involves replacing two meals a day&#xD;
      with meal replacement beverages for two months, with a one month follow-up visit. These&#xD;
      beverages will be made up by subjects using either a complete protein powder or BCAD2, a&#xD;
      BCAA-free medical food. Participants will complete food diaries at baseline and at one month&#xD;
      intervals during the study, and compliance will be assessed via food diaries, weekly&#xD;
      telephone contact, and measuring returned food powder.&#xD;

    <description>The principle outcome of this study is to determine if replacing 2/3rds of the subjects baseline protein intake with BCAA-free meal replacement beverages are a feasible method of selectively reducing BCAA consumption. Our principle outcome is to reduce BCAA intake by 50% or more in the Experimental Arm (BCAD2) of the study as compared to baseline intake.</description>
