    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of brief, intermittent stair climbing exercise on key&#xD;
      cardiovascular and metabolic markers of health in individuals completing a cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation program. Participants of this study will be placed into one of two exercise&#xD;
      groups: one group will perform the standard exercise protocol currently being used by the&#xD;
      Cardiac Health and Rehabilitation Centre at Hamilton General Hospital and the second group&#xD;
      will perform a variation of interval exercise training, high intensity interval stair&#xD;
      climbing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a recognized health service for the secondary prevention of&#xD;
      CVD, unfortunately, CR is vastly underutilized, due to low referral rates and patient-related&#xD;
      factors such as time commitment, travelling distance or user fees. After 2 weeks of CR&#xD;
      exercise prescription, ~80% of patients opt to exercise independently rather than join a&#xD;
      structured rehabilitation program in the community, suggesting that alternatives for current&#xD;
      centre-based CR should focus on at-home programming with the intention of enhancing adherence&#xD;
      and maintaining the lifestyle benefits long-term. The implementation of high-intensity&#xD;
      interval exercise in CR programming has proven to be time-effective, enjoyable, safe, and&#xD;
      capable of inducing similar if not superior cardiorespiratory responses, when compared to&#xD;
      traditional, continuous CR programs. Recently, the benefits of interval stair climbing&#xD;
      exercise in sedentary women were established, in that completing 3, 60 second bouts of high&#xD;
      intensity stair climbing, 3 days/week for 6 weeks improved cardiorespiratory fitness, and&#xD;
      represents a model of low-volume high-intensity interval training which is tolerable,&#xD;
      effective and easily accessible for sedentary adults.&#xD;

    <measure>brachial endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline FMD at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This technique involves the placement of a blood pressure cuff around the forearm distal to the olecranon process (elbow). The cuff is inflated above systolic blood pressure to ~200 mmHg (in order to attain cessation of arm blood flow) and is held at this pressure for a period of five minutes. Continual measures of brachial artery diameter and blood flow velocity will be obtained using Doppler ultrasound. A 10 MHz probe will be placed on the upper arm (below the biceps) and moved around until the best signal is found. Images of brachial artery diameter and blood flow velocity will be taken at rest (before cuff inflation), prior to cuff deflation (end of five minute ischemic period), and following cuff deflation for two minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>skeletal muscle capillary content</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline capillary content at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle capillaries will be detected in frozen cross-sections of muscle biopsies based on positive staining with fluorescent lectin Ulex europaeus, and quantified relative to muscle fibre number (capillary:fibre ratio).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>cardiac diastolic function</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline left ventricular values at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The heart must be imaged at both the base (top) and apex (bottom) of the left ventricle. Images will be taken in the parasternal short axis view with the participant lying in the left lateral decubitus position to allow the expansion of the rib cage and proper orientation of the heart within the chest cavity. Doppler ultrasound (5MHz sector probe) will be applied to the upper-middle section of the chest for the best images. Basal images will be taken at the tips of the mitral valves, while apical images will be taken at the most distal aspect of the left ventricle, with the LV cavity representing ~50% of the left ventricle wall thickness.</description>
