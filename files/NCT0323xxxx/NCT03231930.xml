    <textblock>
      The Rapid-EC pilot study will determine feasibility of providing rapid point-of-care (POC)&#xD;
      testing for HCV in community clinics, and whether the availability of POC testing increases&#xD;
      uptake of testing, engagement in care and completion of treatment among people who inject&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The POC tests being utilised in this study are the OraQuick mouth swab test for the presence&#xD;
      of HCV antibodies, and the Xpert HCV RNA viral load test using serum.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies has meant the elimination of&#xD;
      hepatitis C (HCV) as a public health issue in Australia is a very real possibility. The&#xD;
      challenge that remains is to ensure that all people living with HCV can access testing to&#xD;
      become aware of their status, and then get treated and cured. Given that people who inject&#xD;
      drugs (PWID) account for the vast majority of new HCV infections in Australia, this group&#xD;
      will be key to elimination efforts. Innovative approaches are needed to overcome the barriers&#xD;
      to accessing health services that are faced by PWID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rapid-EC pilot study will determine feasibility of providing rapid point-of-care (POC)&#xD;
      testing for HCV in community clinics, and whether the availability of POC testing increases&#xD;
      uptake of testing, engagement in care and completion of treatment among PWID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rapid-EC pilot study will be delivered by a multi-disciplinary team in three community&#xD;
      clinics in Melbourne, Australia. After providing informed consent and receiving pre-test&#xD;
      counselling, participants will undergo an OraQuick mouth swab test for the presence of HCV&#xD;
      antibodies, which indicates whether a person has ever been exposed to HCV. This result is&#xD;
      available in 20 minutes. If this test is positive they will then be offered a test for the&#xD;
      presence of virus in the blood, known as a PCR or RNA test. The Xpert HCV RNA POC test uses a&#xD;
      5ml sample of blood from the vein and is run on the GeneXpert machine, which will be on-site&#xD;
      at each clinic. This machine provides results in 105 minutes, allowing participants to&#xD;
      receive a HCV diagnosis on the day of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the OraQuick HCV Ab test and the Xpert HCV RNA test are highly accurate tests; however&#xD;
      they are currently awaiting approval for diagnostic use in Australia. As such,&#xD;
      standard-of-care testing will be performed for all participants to confirm the result and&#xD;
      inform clinical care. Participants who have a positive HCV Ab result will have a follow-up&#xD;
      visit with the study nurse where they will review all test results. Those who are found to&#xD;
      have a current HCV infection (positive RNA result) will have an assessment of liver health&#xD;
      and, where appropriate, commence HCV treatment from the clinic. Participants will be&#xD;
      reimbursed for the time taken to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of the study participants will be asked to complete two&#xD;
      questionnaires: 1) at the beginning of the study to record demographics, risk behaviours, and&#xD;
      previous experience of HCV testing; and 2) after completing the POC tests to provide feedback&#xD;
      on their experience and preferences for testing. These responses, as well as clinical&#xD;
      information collected by staff, will be de-identified. Data linkage with Medicare and&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme data will be used to determine if the participant followed up&#xD;
      with their healthcare provider and collected a prescription for HCV treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide valuable insights into the feasibility and effects of offering POC&#xD;
      testing for HCV, particularly the effect on uptake of testing and treatment. The results will&#xD;
      inform a larger trial, with greater numbers of participants and sites, and the introduction&#xD;
      of finger prick testing for HCV RNA, which is likely to become available for research use in&#xD;
      towards the end of 2017.&#xD;

    <description>Rapid point of care testing will be done using the OraQuick HCV Ab test and the Xpert HCV RNA viral load test. All participants will undergo rapid point of care testing for hepatitis C antibodies using the OraQuick test with oral fluid, followed by point of care testing for the detection of hepatitis C virus RNA using the Cepheid Xpert HCV viral load test on the GeneXpert system. Participants who are found to have current HCV infection will be worked up for treatment at the clinic and referred to appropriate practitioners for HCV treatment. As these tests are not yet licensed for diagnostic use in Australia, confirmatory testing using standard laboratory tests will be performed for all participants.</description>
