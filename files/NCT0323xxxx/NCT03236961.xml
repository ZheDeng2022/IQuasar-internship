    <textblock>
      Appendicectomy has been the treatment of acute appendicitis for over a hundred years.&#xD;
      Appendicectomy, however, includes operative and postoperative risks despite being a routine&#xD;
      procedure. Several studies have proved promising results of the safety and efficiency of&#xD;
      antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. The APPAC study by the&#xD;
      investigators, published in 2015 in the Journal of American Medical Association, also proved&#xD;
      promising results with 73% of patients with uncomplicated appendicitis treated successfully&#xD;
      with antibiotics. None of the patients initially treated with antibiotics that later had&#xD;
      appendectomy had major complications. The results of the APPAC trial suggest that CT proven&#xD;
      uncomplicated acute appendicitis is not a surgical emergency and antibiotic therapy is a safe&#xD;
      first-line treatment option. Reducing unnecessary appendectomies has also been shown to lead&#xD;
      to significant economic savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized prospective study is to optimize antibiotic therapy for&#xD;
      uncomplicated acute appendicitis by comparing different antibiotic regimens; intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotic (ertapenem) followed by per oral antibiotic (levofloxacin and metronidazole) with&#xD;
      only per oral antibiotics (moxifloxacin). Before randomization, the diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      uncomplicated appendicitis is confirmed with a CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics requiring additional hospital&#xD;
      resources are not necessary for the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis and that&#xD;
      per oral mono therapy is non-inferior to the combination of intravenous and per oral&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal pain in emergency departments and&#xD;
      appendectomy is the most common emergency abdominal surgery. The lifetime risk of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis in males is 8.6% and 6.7% in females. In Finland according to Stakes data there&#xD;
      were 6 377 appendectomies (3242 in males, 3135 in females, median age 35 years) performed in&#xD;
      2010. The total number of days in hospital care was 16 111 days and the mean length of&#xD;
      hospital stay was three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although acute appendicitis is the most common reason for surgical emergency department&#xD;
      visit, its diagnosis still remains challenging. The clinical diagnosis has previously been&#xD;
      based on patient history, physical examination and laboratory findings as well as the&#xD;
      clinical surgical diagnosis. Several scoring systems have been created to aid in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of acute appendicitis18-20, but the accuracy of clinical diagnosis without&#xD;
      preoperative imaging is about 76 - 80 % for combined patient groups of males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As acute appendicitis has historically been thought to always progress to perforation&#xD;
      requiring emergency appendectomy, high negative appendectomy rates even up to 40 % in some&#xD;
      patient populations have been previously accepted as good surgical practice. For the last two&#xD;
      decades, the use of dedicated imaging in acute abdomen in general and also in acute&#xD;
      appendicitis has led to improved diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on large epidemiological studies, it is now known that complicated (perforated) and&#xD;
      uncomplicated (non-perforated) appendicitis have followed different epidemiological trends.&#xD;
      These unassociated epidemiologic trends suggest different pathophysiology for the two form of&#xD;
      appendicitis. The differential diagnosis is essential as patients with an uncomplicated acute&#xD;
      appendicitis may not require surgical intervention and might experience even spontaneous&#xD;
      resolution without perforation. The majority (approximately 80 %) of acute appendicitis cases&#xD;
      are of uncomplicated nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complicated acute appendicitis defined as a finding of a perforation, appendicolith, abscess&#xD;
      or a suspicion of a tumor, requires emergency appendectomy with the exception of cases with&#xD;
      abscess as they are often managed conservatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appendicolith is a calcified fecal concretion in the appendix resulting in internal luminal&#xD;
      obstruction and it is the most common form of complicated acute appendicitis. In the first&#xD;
      randomized study by Vons et al. comparing operative treatment and antibiotic therapy using CT&#xD;
      as a diagnostic inclusion criterion, the presence of an appendicolith in preoperative CT scan&#xD;
      was the only factor that significantly increased the risk of complicated appendicitis and it&#xD;
      was also the only factor associated with the failure of antibiotic therapy for acute&#xD;
      appendicitis. Indeed, if Vons et al had excluded the patients with an appendicolith from&#xD;
      their analysis, no significant difference in the incidence of post-intervention peritonitis&#xD;
      between the treatment groups would have been noticed in their study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT imaging is the primary imaging modality and the golden standard in the diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis as it establishes the diagnosis with almost perfect diagnostic accuracy. The&#xD;
      advantages of CT imaging are high accuracy, availability, ease of performance and&#xD;
      interpretation, and that it is rarely affected by bowel gas, severe abdominal pain or extreme&#xD;
      body habitus. The main disadvantage of CT is exposure to radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased use of preoperative CT imaging has been evaluated thoroughly by evaluating its&#xD;
      impact on the negative appendectomy rate reducing the number of unnecessary appendectomies.&#xD;
      In 2010, a mandatory imaging guideline for suspected acute appendicitis was implemented in&#xD;
      the Netherlands. After implementation the negative appendectomy rate dropped significantly&#xD;
      from 23 % to 6 % (p&lt;0.001) reducing the surgical complication rate from 20% to 14 % and&#xD;
      resulting in average cost-per-patient decrease by 594€.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The favorable diagnostic performance of CT imaging has encouraged optimization of the&#xD;
      protocol to minimize exposure to radiation through the development of low-dose CT protocols.&#xD;
      Low-dose protocols balance with as low as reasonably achievable-principle while maintaining&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy. However, low-dose protocols with intravenous contrast are still not&#xD;
      implemented in routine clinical practice. These protocols require more advanced optimization&#xD;
      and validation because of the wider need for contrast enhanced assessment. Kim et al showed&#xD;
      that contrast enhanced low-dose CT (median radiation dose 116mmGy in dose-length product) was&#xD;
      not inferior to standard-dose contrast enhanced CT (median radiation dose 521 mmGy), with&#xD;
      negative appendectomy rates of 3.5% and 3.2% respectively and no statistical significance in&#xD;
      appendiceal perforation rates or patients requiring additional imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have performed a prospective observational study (OPTICAP trial,&#xD;
      NCT02533869, Ethical committee of Turku University Hospital approval) in order to optimize a&#xD;
      low-dose CT scan for both diagnosing acute appendicitis and to differentiate uncomplicated&#xD;
      acute appendicitis from a complicated acute appendicitis. In this study, phantom imaging with&#xD;
      15 different imaging protocols were performed aiming to minimize radiation with optimal&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy. The phantom protocols were assessed by blinded evaluation of two&#xD;
      gastrointestinal radiologists and the two best performing protocols were chosen for the&#xD;
      clinical phase. The clinical evaluation included performing both of these imaging protocols&#xD;
      for patients with suspected uncomplicated acute appendicitis evaluated by a senior digestive&#xD;
      surgeon. All of the enrolled patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy to evaluate the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of the imaging protocols. The most optimal imaging protocols were&#xD;
      selected for use in the APPAC II trial; one low-dose CT protocol for patients with BMI under&#xD;
      30 and one optimised standard CT protocol for patients with BMI exceeding 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For over a century appendectomy has been the standard treatment for all patients with acute&#xD;
      appendicitis. However, the results of our APPAC trial have now shown that the majority (73%)&#xD;
      of patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis were successfully treated with antibiotics&#xD;
      alone. We also showed that none of the patients treated initially with antibiotics and later&#xD;
      undergoing appendectomy had major complications or increased morbidity defining antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy as a safe first-line treatment. Patients with a complicated acute appendicitis&#xD;
      require emergency appendectomy and early identification of these patients is of vital&#xD;
      importance. Laparoscopic appendectomy has become the golden standard for appendectomy&#xD;
      providing lower morbidity and faster recovery compared with open appendectomy. For patients&#xD;
      with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, the time has come to evaluate abandoning routine&#xD;
      appendectomy and evaluating the optimal use of antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of study is to optimize the antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis&#xD;
      by evaluating the success of treatment in both study groups and by comparing intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy followed by per oral antibiotics with per oral antibiotic monotherapy. The&#xD;
      study hypothesis is that broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics requiring additional hospital&#xD;
      resources are not necessary for the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis and that&#xD;
      per oral monotherapy is non-inferior to the combination of intravenous and per oral&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy. The secondary aim is to evaluate the results of the randomized APPAC&#xD;
      trial in a prospective patient cohort by implementing antibiotic therapy as the first-line&#xD;
      treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in clinical practice.&#xD;
