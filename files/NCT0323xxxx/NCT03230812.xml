  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the results from animal studies and preliminary human studies show that carnitine&#xD;
      availability and acetylcarnitine concentrations are low in insulin resistant states such as&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, in humans, carnitine supplementation is sometimes&#xD;
      beneficial, but not in everyone. We hypothesize that this variability in response might be&#xD;
      due to differences between individuals in the amount of carnitine in the muscle i.e. subjects&#xD;
      with a low initial carnitine status will benefit more from supplementation. The state of the&#xD;
      art non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy method allows us to identify patients muscle&#xD;
      acetylcarnitine status. Here we aim to test whether carnitine improves insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      furthermore, whether acetylcarnitine concentration at baseline or other characteristics are&#xD;
      associated with the response (in insulin sensitivity) to carnitine supplementation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will examine the potentially positive effect of carnitine supplementation in&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes patients on intrahepatic lipid content, acetylcarnitine formation, blood&#xD;
      plasma metabolites, body composition, physical performance and quality of life&#xD;

      Rationale: Type 2 diabetic patients are characterized by a decreased metabolic flexibility: a&#xD;
      reduced capability to switch from fat oxidation in the basal state to carbohydrate oxidation&#xD;
      in the insulin-stimulated state. This metabolic inflexibility is an early hallmark in the&#xD;
      development of diabetes. Recent evidence suggests that a low carnitine availability may limit&#xD;
      acetylcarnitine formation, thereby reducing metabolic flexibility. Thus, when substrate flux&#xD;
      in the muscle is high, acetyl-CoA concentrations increase, leading to inhibition of pyruvate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (PDH) and thereby reducing glucose oxidation. The conversion of acetyl-CoA to&#xD;
      acetylcarnitine relieves this acetyl-CoA pressure on PDH. In humans, carnitine&#xD;
      supplementation is sometimes also beneficial, but not in everyone. Here we aim to test&#xD;
      whether carnitine improves insulin sensitivity, furthermore, whether acetylcarnitine&#xD;
      concentration at baseline or other characteristics are associated with the response (in&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity) to carnitine supplementation. Furthermore, we will examine the&#xD;
      potentially positive effect of carnitine supplementation in type 2 diabetes patients on&#xD;
      intrahepatic lipid content, acetylcarnitine formation, blood plasma metabolites, body&#xD;
      composition, physical performance and quality of life Objective: The primary objective is to&#xD;
      investigate whether carnitine improves insulin sensitivity, furthermore, whether&#xD;
      acetylcarnitine concentration at baseline or other characteristics are associated with the&#xD;
      response (in insulin sensitivity) to carnitine supplementation. Furthermore, we will examine&#xD;
      the potentially positive effect of carnitine supplementation in type 2 diabetes patients on&#xD;
      intrahepatic lipid content, acetylcarnitine formation, blood plasma metabolites, body&#xD;
      composition, physical performance and quality of life Study design: The current study is an&#xD;
      interventional design with one study arm. Subjects will not be blinded for the intervention&#xD;
      since all subjects will receive oral carnitine supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: n=32, patient with type 2 diabetes (BMI 25-38, age 40-75 years) male and&#xD;
      female will be included. Only subjects with relatively well-controlled non-insulin depended&#xD;
      diabetes will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Participants will be asked to take three chewing tablets of&#xD;
      L-carnitine (330mg), three times a day (breakfast, lunch and dinner), for 96 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary study endpoints are insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      metabolic flexibility, measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      are maximal acetylcarnitine concentrations after exercise, Intrahepatic lipid content, body&#xD;
      composition, metabolites in the blood before (i.e. glucose, free fatty acids, triglycerides,&#xD;
      cholesterol, insulin), functional markers of physical performance, cognition, quality of life&#xD;
      and quality of sleep.&#xD;
