      Eligible subjects in this study will have either a known abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) or&#xD;
      because they do not have an AAA (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aorta serves as the main artery to supply blood flow to the body. It is approximately the&#xD;
      size of a garden hose. Due to the effects of high blood pressure (hypertension),&#xD;
      atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and tobacco use, the aorta may widen and enlarge&#xD;
      to form an aneurysm. An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a dilation (enlargement) or&#xD;
      ballooning out of a section of blood vessel caused by disease or weakness in the wall of the&#xD;
      aorta below the level of the kidney arteries. As an AAA dilates and increases in size,&#xD;
      rupture of the AAA may occur. AAA rupture carries a significant risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, aortic size is the primary factor used to assess aortic rupture risk. There are&#xD;
      other imaging procedures (imaging modalities) that are being used and developed to assess AAA&#xD;
      rupture risk. Finite element analysis (FEA) is a way to study the mechanical properties of&#xD;
      the aortic wall, including areas of stress and strength that are used to calculate rupture&#xD;
      risk. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) utilizes glucose (a form of sugar) labeled with a&#xD;
      radioactivity to look at the metabolic activity and inflammation in the aortic wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to further study, through FEA, changes that occur in&#xD;
      the mechanical properties of the aortic wall. The investigator will compare two radiotracers,&#xD;
      18F-FDG and 11C-PBR28 to determine if one provides more useful and reliable information about&#xD;
      inflammation. 18F-FDG and 11C-PBR28 are radioactive drugs that will be used for imaging&#xD;
      during the PET-CT scan. The investigator will also compare the results describing the&#xD;
      mechanical properties of the AAA wall to the degree of inflammation in that wall as&#xD;
      determined by PET-CT imaging to define new and better predictors of AAA growth and/or&#xD;
      rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radioactive tracers that are used in this study are 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) and&#xD;
      11C-PBR28 (PBR) which stands for Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptor. 11C-PBR28 is considered&#xD;
      investigational, which means that it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration. FDG is an approved drug by the FDA, however in this study it is considered&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: Twenty-four subjects will be recruited for this study. Six control subjects (three&#xD;
      males and three females), will be considered. Control subjects will have known&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, without aneurysmal disease. Six subjects (three males and three females)&#xD;
      with small AAAs (diameter 3.0-4.5cm), six subjects (three males, AAA &gt;5.5cm and three&#xD;
      females, AAA &gt;5.0cm) with AAAs that are indicated for treatment, and six subjects (three&#xD;
      males and three females) with rapidly expanding AAAs (&gt;0.5cm over 6 months and/or &gt;1.0cm over&#xD;
      12 months) will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have blood drawn to perform a genetic test that will look at genes and proteins&#xD;
      to determine subject eligibility. Once the blood work is assessed for eligibility, subjects&#xD;
      will undergo the PET-CT scan. The imaging will take approximately 3 hours to complete.&#xD;

    <description>Rupture potential index (RPI) is defined as the ratio of the acting wall stress to the wall strength, and the maximum RPI for AAA represents its rupture risk. Currently, the primary factor considered for risk of human AAA rupture is aortic diameter; however, it is well documented that small AAAs (&lt;5cm) rupture, while many large AAAs (&gt;8cm) are incidentally discovered.&#xD;
We will assess the ability of imaging techniques to determine abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture risk individually and in concert.</description>

    <measure>Qualitative Comparison of SUV and RPI</measure>
    <time_frame>9-10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Finite element analysis (FEA) is a computerized numerical method used for the prediction of how the aorta may behave under stress. This software will be used to assess the same aortic volume comparing areas of greatest stress and lowest strength. Co-registration of images obtained by different imaging modalities will allow for comparison between imaging modalities. With direct co-registration of the data sets for each subject, qualitative comparisons will be made regarding areas of 18F-FDG and 11C-PBR28 uptake, as well as stress, strength, and RPI.</description>

        <title>Rupture Potential Index (RPI)</title>
        <description>Rupture potential index (RPI) is defined as the ratio of the acting wall stress to the wall strength, and the maximum RPI for AAA represents its rupture risk. Currently, the primary factor considered for risk of human AAA rupture is aortic diameter; however, it is well documented that small AAAs (&lt;5cm) rupture, while many large AAAs (&gt;8cm) are incidentally discovered.&#xD;
We will assess the ability of imaging techniques to determine abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture risk individually and in concert.</description>

To assess AAA rupture risk by PET-CTA scans, participants will undergo PET-CT scan using 11C-PBR28 and 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer. Participants will have a blood draw for genetic testing, pregnancy testing if female and creatinine testing.&#xD;

          <title>Rupture Potential Index (RPI)</title>
          <description>Rupture potential index (RPI) is defined as the ratio of the acting wall stress to the wall strength, and the maximum RPI for AAA represents its rupture risk. Currently, the primary factor considered for risk of human AAA rupture is aortic diameter; however, it is well documented that small AAAs (&lt;5cm) rupture, while many large AAAs (&gt;8cm) are incidentally discovered.&#xD;
We will assess the ability of imaging techniques to determine abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture risk individually and in concert.</description>
          <population>Recruitment was difficult. We enrolled 1 subject with a small AAA and 1 subject with a rapidly expanding AAA, however, we were unable to recruit the number of subjects in each category to provide meaningful outcomes.</population>

        <description>Finite element analysis (FEA) is a computerized numerical method used for the prediction of how the aorta may behave under stress. This software will be used to assess the same aortic volume comparing areas of greatest stress and lowest strength. Co-registration of images obtained by different imaging modalities will allow for comparison between imaging modalities. With direct co-registration of the data sets for each subject, qualitative comparisons will be made regarding areas of 18F-FDG and 11C-PBR28 uptake, as well as stress, strength, and RPI.</description>
