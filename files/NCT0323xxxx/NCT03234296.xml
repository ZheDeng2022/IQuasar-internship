      Appendicectomy has been the treatment of acute appendicitis for over a hundred years.&#xD;
      Appendicectomy, however, includes operative and postoperative risks despite being a &quot;routine&quot;&#xD;
      operation. At the same time other similar intra-abdominal infections, such as diverticulitis,&#xD;
      are treated with antibiotics. Several studies have proved promising results of the safety and&#xD;
      efficiency of antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. Our previous&#xD;
      APPAC study, published in 2015 in the Journal of American Medical Association, also proved&#xD;
      promising results with 73% of patients with CT-diagnosed uncomplicated appendicitis treated&#xD;
      successfully with antibiotics within one-year follow-up. None of the patients initially&#xD;
      treated with antibiotics that later had appendectomy had major complications. The results of&#xD;
      the APPAC trial suggest that CT proven uncomplicated acute appendicitis is not a surgical&#xD;
      emergency and antibiotic therapy is a safe first-line treatment option. Reducing unnecessary&#xD;
      appendectomies has also been shown to lead to significant economic savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Already in 1886 Fitz noted that 1/3 of patients in a large series of autopsies from the&#xD;
      pre-appendicectomy era had evidence of prior appendices inflammation suggesting spontaneous&#xD;
      resolution of acute appendicitis. Acute appendicitis is thought to be similar to acute&#xD;
      diverticulitis (&quot;left-sided appendicitis&quot;) and this similarity has been shown in&#xD;
      epidemiological studies. Recent studies have shown no benefit of antibiotic treatment in the&#xD;
      treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis with outpatient management without antibiotics&#xD;
      proving safe and well-functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomised double-blinded study is to compare antibiotic therapy with placebo&#xD;
      to evaluate the role of antibiotic therapy in the resolution of CT-diagnosed uncomplicated&#xD;
      acute appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that antibiotic therapy is necessary in the treatment of acute&#xD;
      uncomplicated appendicitis and that antibiotic therapy is superior to spontaneous resolution&#xD;
      (placebo) with the primary endpoint evaluated at ten days after the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal pain in emergency departments and&#xD;
      appendectomy is the most common emergency abdominal surgery. The lifetime risk of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis in males is 8.6% and 6.7% in females.In Finland according to Stakes data there&#xD;
      were 6 377 appendectomies (3242 in males, 3135 in females, median age 35 years) performed in&#xD;
      2010 with a total number of days in hospital care was 16 111 days and the mean length of&#xD;
      hospital stay was three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although acute appendicitis is the most common reason for surgical emergency department&#xD;
      visit, its diagnosis still remains challenging. The clinical diagnosis has previously been&#xD;
      based on patient history, physical examination and laboratory findings as well as the&#xD;
      clinical surgical diagnosis. Several scoring systems have been created to aid in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of acute appendicitis18-20, but the accuracy of clinical diagnosis without&#xD;
      preoperative imaging is about 76 - 80 % for combined patient groups of males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As acute appendicitis has historically been thought to always progress to perforation&#xD;
      requiring emergency appendectomy, high negative appendectomy rates even up to 40 % in some&#xD;
      patient populations have been previously accepted as good surgical practice. For the last two&#xD;
      decades, the use of dedicated imaging in acute abdomen in general and also in acute&#xD;
      appendicitis has led to improved diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on large epidemiological studies, it is now known that complicated (perforated) and&#xD;
      uncomplicated (non-perforated) appendicitis have followed different epidemiological trends.&#xD;
      These unassociated epidemiologic trends suggest different pathophysiology for the two form of&#xD;
      appendicitis. The differential diagnosis is essential as patients with an uncomplicated acute&#xD;
      appendicitis may not require surgical intervention and might experience even spontaneous&#xD;
      resolution without perforation. The majority (approximately 80 %) of acute appendicitis cases&#xD;
      are of uncomplicated nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complicated acute appendicitis defined as a finding of a perforation, appendicolith, abscess&#xD;
      or a suspicion of a tumor, requires emergency appendectomy with the exception of cases with&#xD;
      abscess as they are often managed conservatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appendicolith is a calcified fecal concretion in the appendix resulting in internal luminal&#xD;
      obstruction and it is the most common form of complicated acute appendicitis. In the first&#xD;
      randomized study by Vons et al. comparing operative treatment and antibiotic therapy using CT&#xD;
      as a diagnostic inclusion criterion, the presence of an appendicolith in preoperative CT scan&#xD;
      was the only factor that significantly increased the risk of complicated appendicitis and it&#xD;
      was also the only factor associated with the failure of antibiotic therapy for acute&#xD;
      appendicitis. Indeed, if Vons et al had excluded the patients with an appendicolith from&#xD;
      their analysis, no significant difference in the incidence of post-intervention peritonitis&#xD;
      between the treatment groups would have been noticed in their study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT imaging is the primary imaging modality and the golden standard in the diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis as it establishes the diagnosis with almost perfect diagnostic accuracy. The&#xD;
      advantages of CT imaging are high accuracy, availability, ease of performance and&#xD;
      interpretation, and that it is rarely affected by bowel gas, severe abdominal pain or extreme&#xD;
      body habitus. The main disadvantage of CT is exposure to radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased use of preoperative CT imaging has been evaluated thoroughly by evaluating its&#xD;
      impact on the negative appendectomy rate reducing the number of unnecessary appendectomies.&#xD;
      In 2010, a mandatory imaging guideline for suspected acute appendicitis was implemented in&#xD;
      the Netherlands. After implementation the negative appendectomy rate dropped significantly&#xD;
      from 23 % to 6 % (p&lt;0.001) reducing the surgical complication rate from 20% to 14 % and&#xD;
      resulting in average cost-per-patient decrease by 594€.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The favorable diagnostic performance of CT imaging has encouraged optimization of the&#xD;
      protocol to minimize exposure to radiation through the development of low-dose CT protocols.&#xD;
      Low-dose protocols balance with as low as reasonably achievable-principle while maintaining&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy. However, low-dose protocols with intravenous contrast are still not&#xD;
      implemented in routine clinical practice. These protocols require more advanced optimization&#xD;
      and validation because of the wider need for contrast enhanced assessment. Kim et al showed&#xD;
      that contrast enhanced low-dose CT (median radiation dose 116 mmGy in dose-length product)&#xD;
      was not inferior to standard-dose contrast enhanced CT (median radiation dose 521 mmGy), with&#xD;
      negative appendectomy rates of 3.5% and 3.2% respectively and no statistical significance in&#xD;
      appendiceal perforation rates or patients requiring additional imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have performed a prospective observational study (OPTICAP trial,&#xD;
      NCT02533869, Ethical committee of Turku University Hospital approval) in order to optimize a&#xD;
      low-dose CT scan for both diagnosing acute appendicitis and to differentiate uncomplicated&#xD;
      acute appendicitis from a complicated acute appendicitis. In this study, phantom imaging with&#xD;
      15 different imaging protocols were performed aiming to minimize radiation with optimal&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy. The phantom protocols were assessed by blinded evaluation of two&#xD;
      gastrointestinal radiologists and the two best performing protocols were chosen for the&#xD;
      clinical phase. The clinical evaluation included performing both of these imaging protocols&#xD;
      for patients with suspected uncomplicated acute appendicitis evaluated by a senior digestive&#xD;
      surgeon. All of the enrolled patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy to evaluate the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of the imaging protocols. The two most optimal imaging protocol&#xD;
      were selected for use in the APPAC III trial; one low-dose CT protocol for patients with BMI&gt;&#xD;
      30 and one optimised standard CT for patients with BMI exceeding 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For over a century appendectomy has been the standard treatment for all patients with acute&#xD;
      appendicitis. However, the results of our APPAC trial have now shown that the majority (73%)&#xD;
      of patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis were successfully treated with antibiotics&#xD;
      alone. We also showed that none of the patients treated initially with antibiotics and later&#xD;
      undergoing appendectomy had major complications or increased morbidity defining antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy as a safe first-line treatment. Patients with a complicated acute appendicitis&#xD;
      require emergency appendectomy and early identification of these patients is of vital&#xD;
      importance. Laparoscopic appendectomy has become the golden standard for appendectomy&#xD;
      providing lower morbidity and faster recovery compared with open appendectomy. For patients&#xD;
      with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, the time has come to evaluate abandoning routine&#xD;
      appendectomy and evaluating the optimal use of antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency appendectomy was first advocated because of the very high mortality of perforated&#xD;
      appendicitis combined with the assumption of the natural course of acute appendicitis&#xD;
      evolving always to perforated disease. This was first reported in 1886 by Reginald Fitz, who&#xD;
      initially originated the term appendicitis and identified appendix as a cause for right lower&#xD;
      quadrant infections. Fitz also noted that one-third of patients in a large autopsy series&#xD;
      from the pre-appendectomy era had evidence of prior appendiceal inflammation suggesting&#xD;
      spontaneous resolution of acute appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute appendicitis is similar to acute diverticulitis (&quot;left-sided appendicitis&quot;) and this&#xD;
      similarity has been shown in epidemiological studies suggesting a common underlying&#xD;
      pathogenesis. There is one multicenter randomized trial, one population-based study, one&#xD;
      case-control study and one prospective observational study that have shown no benefit of&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. The reported complication rates in&#xD;
      these studies is low (approximately 2 %) and even outpatient management without antibiotics&#xD;
      in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis has been shown to be feasible, well-functioning and&#xD;
      safe. The APPAC III trial will first recruit 3-5 pilot patients in order to finalise the&#xD;
      hospital pharmacy procedures in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the APPAC III study is to compare antibiotic therapy with placebo in the treatment&#xD;
      of uncomplicated acute appendicitis to evaluate the role of antibiotic therapy in the&#xD;
      resolution of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. The study hypothesis is that antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy is necessary in the treatment of acute uncomplicated and that antibiotic therapy is&#xD;
      superior to spontaneous resolution (placebo) with the primary endpoint evaluated at ten days&#xD;
      after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations were based on one-sided Pearson's χ2 -test for two proportions.&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated from an estimated success rate of 94% during the hospitalization&#xD;
      in antibiotic group 7. A decrease of 15 percentage points in success rate is considered&#xD;
      clinically important difference leading to estimated 79% success rate in placebo group. We&#xD;
      estimated that to detect a 15 percentage points difference (antibiotics - placebo) between&#xD;
      groups with a power of 0.8 (1-β) and one-sided significance level (α) of 0.05 64 patients per&#xD;
      group is needed. Before the trial initiation, 3-5 pilot patients will be recruited in order&#xD;
      to finalize the hospital pharmacy procedures and drug delivery in clinical practice. Based on&#xD;
      the pilot study enrollment speed and the recognized challenges in conducting trial, in&#xD;
      real-life emergency setting we need to take into account the anticipated enrolment delays to&#xD;
      assure the completion of this trial within reasonable time. These challenges consisting of&#xD;
      emergency surgery patient enrolment dependent on hospital pharmacy services available only&#xD;
      during standard working hours, the requirement for senior surgeon enrolment and the&#xD;
      discrepancy between the admission hours of appendicitis patients and hospital pharmacy&#xD;
      working hours mandated us to create three scenarios for study power analysis and the number&#xD;
      of patients to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In scenario A, a decrease of 15 percentage points in success rate is considered clinically&#xD;
      important difference leading to estimated 79% success rate in placebo group. We estimated&#xD;
      that to detect a 15-percentage points difference (antibiotics - placebo) between groups 64&#xD;
      patients per group is needed. With an estimated dropout rate of 10% total of 142 patients, 71&#xD;
      patients per group will be enrolled in the study. In scenario B, clinically important&#xD;
      difference is 20 percentage points, estimated success rate in placebo group is 74% and to&#xD;
      detect this difference 41 patients per group is needed. With an estimated dropout rate of 10%&#xD;
      total of 92 patients, 46 patients per group will be enrolled in the study. In scenario C,&#xD;
      clinically important difference is 25 percentage points, estimated success rate in placebo&#xD;
      group is 69% and to detect this difference 29 patients per group is needed. With an estimated&#xD;
      dropout rate of 10% total of 64 patients, 32 patients per group will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Targeted minimum sample size per study hospital will be 10 patients. One-sided test&#xD;
      will be used as our hypothesis is that antibiotic treatment is more effective treatment than&#xD;
      placebo. Sample size calculations were performed using Power procedure in SAS System for&#xD;
      Windows, Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On April 1st, 2019, a study committee consisting of the outside safety monitoring committee&#xD;
      and the core research group will assess which one of these scenarios is most feasible based&#xD;
      on patient enrolment with plan A being the target scenario. Active recruitment at this point&#xD;
      will be continued until a decision is made on the clinically realistic enrolment scenario.&#xD;
      The date of evaluation is set exactly one year after the last study hospital has initiated&#xD;
      enrolment.&#xD;
