  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Inherited CAncer REgistry (ICARE) Initiative is to provide individuals&#xD;
      interested in participating in studies focused on inherited cancer predisposition the&#xD;
      opportunity to enroll in a research registry. Efforts through the registry include, but are&#xD;
      not limited to, contribution of data to observational studies, targeted gene-specific&#xD;
      studies, and education and outreach efforts for both participants and recruiting healthcare&#xD;
      providers. Participants are given the opportunity to learn about and participate in other&#xD;
      efforts for which they may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants and recruiting healthcare providers receive educational newsletters twice&#xD;
      per year which contain research and clinical updates in the field of cancer genetics.&#xD;
      Providers who recruit patients can also access monthly web-based genetics case conferences&#xD;
      which focus on different topics each month and are generally attended by a guest expert who&#xD;
      provides background information on the topic as well as comments on the case presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in ICARE involves completion of an informed consent form, baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire, follow-up questionnaires every two years, and medical record/tumor releases,&#xD;
      as applicable. There is no cost to participate and all correspondence can be facilitated&#xD;
      through phone, email, or mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment can be completed either through a traditional paper-based consenting method (i.e.&#xD;
      postal mail) or through the online enrollment option available on the ICARE website&#xD;
      (InheritedCancer.net). If you are a patient interested in learning more or a provider&#xD;
      interested in recruiting to ICARE, please visit our website where you may complete an online&#xD;
      contact form requesting a study team member contact you.&#xD;
