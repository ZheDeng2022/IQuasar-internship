      We speculate that the use of combined oral contraceptives may be a possible solution to&#xD;
      promote the management of retained pregnancy products versus expectant management. By&#xD;
      withdrawing the pill, the endometrium is expected to shed in a synchronized fashion (estrogen&#xD;
      and progestin withdrawal bleeding and may also shed the retained products of conception and&#xD;
      avoid a surgical procedure with its related potential complications.&#xD;

      Miscarriage is a common event in general gynaecological practice, and is an age-dependent&#xD;
      outcome. It is estimated -that approximately 20 percent of clinically recognized pregnancies&#xD;
      will result in a miscarriage, and the prevalence is much higher if preclinical pregnancies&#xD;
      are included as well .Failure to pass the contents of the pregnancy is reported in 15% of&#xD;
      patients going through a spontaneous 1st trimester miscarriage and a similar rate in patients&#xD;
      going through an induced medical abortion after a spontaneous pregnancy loss (miscarriage)&#xD;
      and planned pregnancy termination using PGE1 (MisWe speculate that the use of combined oral&#xD;
      contraceptives may be a possible solution to promote the management of retained pregnancy&#xD;
      products versus expectant management. The exposure to combined oral contraceptives is known&#xD;
      to induce secretory and decidual changes in the endometrium .By withdrawing the pill, the&#xD;
      endometrium is expected to shed in a synchronized fashion (estrogen and progestin withdrawal&#xD;
      bleeding). We hypothesize that such withdrawal bleeding may also shed the retained products&#xD;
      of conception and avoid a surgical procedure with its related potential complications.&#xD;
      oprostol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with RPOC according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria , will be&#xD;
      asked to give their informed consent to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent forms are signed, the patient will be randomized (using a randomization&#xD;
      table handled by a 3rd party) into one of 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Expectant management of 3 weeks and a follow up visit a week after.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Oral contraceptive agent, given for free, for 3 weeks and a follow up visit a week after&#xD;
           treatment withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to emphasize that the current management in our ward is expectant management in the&#xD;
      population eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All US scans will be performed by 2 qualified sonographers using a 7.5 MHz transvaginal&#xD;
      transducer. 2D images in both sagittal and axial planes will be obtained. Sonographic&#xD;
      features to be evaluated are: endometrial maximal thickness measured in the sagittal plan,&#xD;
      presence or absence and size of an endometrial mass (3 dimensions) and grading of endometrial&#xD;
      vascularity. Vascularity will be graded as type 0, 1, 2 or 3 defining no detectable, minimal&#xD;
      (less then myometrium), moderate (nearly equal to myometrium) or marked vascularity&#xD;
      respectively (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrollment the patient will be monitored and interviewed for the following variables :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, BMI, OB - GYN history, smoking status, Blood pressure, pulse rate,Temperature, blood&#xD;
      count, HCG levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be invited to a follow up visit 3 weeks after randomization. The follow up&#xD;
      visit will include again an ultrasound scan as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any case the patient is reporting a menstrual bleeding/ abdominal pain/ fever she will&#xD;
      contact the 24hr available ER of the ward and will be evaluated for complications. After&#xD;
      evaluation is completed the principal investigator will be contacted and the case will be&#xD;
      discussed as for the need for additional measures and documented in the research file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the planned 4 week post randomization visit the following parameters will be monitored:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure, pulse rate, Temperature, blood count, HCG levels as well as a review of any&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the interview a trans-vaginal scan will be performed in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      cavity and any retained products existence and any presence of blood flow in case of a&#xD;
      positive diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any case of retained products detected by ultrasound we will recommend a surgical&#xD;
      hysteroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral contraceptives will be donated by DEXCEL LTD, ISRAEL to the hospital pharmacy, where&#xD;
      it will be stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brand name :FLAME containing 0.02 mg Ethinylestradiol and 0.075 mg Gestodene. Israeli&#xD;
      authorities demand that a drug which is tested in a research will be provided to the&#xD;
      participant without charging.&#xD;
