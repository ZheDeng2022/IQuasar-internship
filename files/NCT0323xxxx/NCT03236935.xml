  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase Ib study is to test the safety of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA)&#xD;
      and pembrolizumab when used together in participants with melanoma, non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), classical Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (cHL), urothelial carcinoma, Cervical Cancer, Esophageal Cancer, Gastric Cancer,&#xD;
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Merkel Cell Carcinoma, Primary Mediastinal Large B-cell Lymphoma,&#xD;
      Renal Cell Carcinoma, Small Cell Lung Cancer, microsatellite instability-high&#xD;
      (MSI-H)/mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) cancer or for the Treatment of Adult Patients with&#xD;
      Unresectable or Metastatic Tumor Mutational Burden-High Solid Tumors. Pembrolizumab is a type&#xD;
      of treatment that stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells. The immune system is&#xD;
      normally the body's first defense against threats like cancer. However, sometimes cancer&#xD;
      cells produce signals like programmed death-1 (PD-1) that prevent the immune system from&#xD;
      detecting and killing them. Pembrolizumab blocks PD-1 so your immune system can detect and&#xD;
      attack cancer cells. To help further boost the cancer-fighting ability of your immune system,&#xD;
      L-NMMA will be used along with pembrolizumab. L-NMMA is a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor.&#xD;
      The presence of nitric oxide synthase in the area around the cancer cells blocks the&#xD;
      cancer-fighting ability of the immune system. Thus, the use of L-NMMA and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      together may make the immune system work harder to attack and destroy the cancer cells.&#xD;

      together may make the immune system work harder to attack and destroy the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, up to 3 different doses of L-NMMA will be studied (12.5, 15, and 20 mg/kg).&#xD;
      Participants will only receive one of the three L-NMMA doses. The first several study&#xD;
      participants will receive the 15 mg/kg dose. If the 15 mg/kg dose of L-NMMA causes serious&#xD;
      side effects, L-NMMA will be given to other study participants at the lower dose of 12.5&#xD;
      mg/kg. If the 15 mg/kg dose of L-NMMA does not cause serious side effects, L-NMMA will be&#xD;
      given to other study participants at the higher dose of 20 mg/kg. All study participants will&#xD;
      be given the same dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg). This study will allow us to see the highest&#xD;
      dose of L-NMMA that can be used safely with pembrolizumab in participants with melanoma,&#xD;
      NSCLC, HNSCC, cHL, urothelial carcinoma, or MSI-H/dMMR cancer.&#xD;

The dose levels of L-NMMA are as follows: Dose Level -1, 12.5 mg/kg; Dose Level 0 (starting dose), 15.0 mg/kg; and Dose Level 1, 20 mg/kg. L-NMMA dose will escalate/de-escalate based on the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities. Pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of 200 mg will be IV infused over 30 minutes on Day 5 at each cycle. Pembrolizumab will be administered 1 hour after L-NMMA infusion on Day 5 at each cycle. Subjects without disease progression after 6 cycles of L-NMMA and pembrolizumab will continue pembrolizumab until disease progression or unacceptable AEs.</description>
