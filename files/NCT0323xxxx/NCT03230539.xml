  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UPA doses to be tested in this new IUS, 5, 20 or 40 μg per day, are not expected to&#xD;
      suppress ovulation, however they should prevent endometrial growth resulting in endometrial&#xD;
      atrophy, minimal bleeding, or even amenorrhea. It is anticipated that with low UPA doses,&#xD;
      women will continue to ovulate and secrete progesterone (P) during the secretory phase of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle. As a result, PRM associated endometrial changes (PAECs) that have been&#xD;
      described in previous UPA studies when ovulation was suppressed and associated with&#xD;
      amenorrhea should not occur and endometria should retain normalcy. These expectations are&#xD;
      based on our findings from a previous study in which the UPA doses tested were insufficient&#xD;
      to block ovulation and participants maintained P secretion with normal endometria (protocol&#xD;
      349). Further evidence regarding the benefit of using low doses of UPA in a copper IUS stems&#xD;
      from a small rhesus macaque proof of principle study that included an UPA-IUS delivering 40&#xD;
      or 60 μg/d of UPA, and fixed doses of E2 and cyclic P delivered via implants over 3 cycles.24&#xD;
      Indices of endometrial proliferation were significantly reduced in 3 out of 5 animals in that&#xD;
      study; the endometria were atrophied with some glandular cysts, and typical PAECs were&#xD;
      limited. Glands were generally small and tubular, however, in some animals they were large&#xD;
      and dilated; resembling cysts with minimal evidence of proliferative activity.24 No bleeding&#xD;
      was observed in the treated monkeys during progesterone withdrawal over the 3 cycles.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intrauterine devices (IUD) such as the Copper IUD (Paragard) and the levonorgestrel (LNG) IUS&#xD;
      (Mirena®) are considered highly safe and effective long acting reversible methods of&#xD;
      contraception (LARC). Nevertheless discontinuations are high due to user complaints of heavy&#xD;
      bleeding during the first few months after insertion of IUDs or irregular bleeding in the&#xD;
      first year of use of an IUS. To prevent these bleeding problems and enhance the overall&#xD;
      safety profile, a new IUS is being developed that will deliver copper to provide its well&#xD;
      described contraceptive efficacy in combination with UPA, a progesterone receptor modulator&#xD;
      (PRM) that may decrease the amount of bleeding associated with use of a Cu IUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since results of human studies delivering antiovulatory doses of UPA orally or with vaginal&#xD;
      rings have shown endometrial changes characterized as typical PAECs, the occurrence of these&#xD;
      endometrial effects with lower doses of the PRM delivered in the endometrium via this&#xD;
      investigational IUS requires evaluation with both histology assessments and measures of&#xD;
      proliferation markers. We need to determine if small doses of UPA administered locally with a&#xD;
      new Cu-IUS with UPA can result in reduced bleeding or amenorrhea, as observed in the monkey&#xD;
      study, and whether or not endometrial modifications occur.&#xD;
