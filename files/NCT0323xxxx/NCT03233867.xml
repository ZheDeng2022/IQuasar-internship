  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional study in children and adolescents (ages 6-17 years) with&#xD;
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to assess CNVs in specific genes involved in&#xD;
      glutamatergic signaling and neuronal connectivity. The screening in this study will be&#xD;
      conducted through a combination of online and site performed activities.&#xD;
