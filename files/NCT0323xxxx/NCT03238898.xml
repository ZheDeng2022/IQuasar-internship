      Objective: previous studies suggest that botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A) can reduce muscle&#xD;
      hyperactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods: a single-center, double-blind and placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      investigating the efficacy and safety of BoNT/A intramuscular injection for treating calf or&#xD;
      foot cramps refractory to common pharmacological drugs in patients with diabetic peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy. Fifty patients were subdivided in two matched groups (cases and controls) and&#xD;
      BoNT/A (100 or 30 units) was injected for each side into the gastrocnemious or the small&#xD;
      flexor foot muscles, respectively, according to the predominance of leg or foot cramps.&#xD;
      Responders were evaluated again with a second BoNT/A administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes of pain intensity (primary outcome) and the changes in cramp frequency, the and&#xD;
      the Cramp Severity Scale (CSS) were evaluated over the course of 20 weeks after BoNT/A&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consecutive series of 303 out-patients with type 2 diabetes was screened for muscle&#xD;
      cramps.Patients were asked to report in a questionnaire the frequency, localization,&#xD;
      intensity and time of the day of cramps. Out of these 303 diabetic patients with cramps,&#xD;
      fifty patients satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria and entered the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cramp Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Clinical evaluation All patients completed a baseline diary in the week before treatment.&#xD;
      Every day the number of muscle cramp episodes was reported three times a day and the&#xD;
      intensity of pain was rated on a scale 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating&#xD;
      &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot; (Brief Pain Inventory-Modified Short Form, BPI-MSF, point 1).&#xD;
      Daily data in this pre-treatment week were averaged and considered &quot;basal&quot; values. A similar&#xD;
      daily diary, reporting the number of pain episodes, their intensity, time of the day and&#xD;
      duration (less or more than 1 min) was kept throughout the study for the three days before&#xD;
      each control visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of cramps interference on daily life was graded according to the functional&#xD;
      scale Cramp Severity Score (CSS): 0= no cramps; 1= occasional day or night cramps not&#xD;
      interfering with daily activities or with nocturnal sleep; 2= frequent muscle cramps&#xD;
      triggered by muscle exercise not significantly interfering with daily activity or with&#xD;
      nocturnal sleep; 3= continuous or subcontinuous muscle cramps limiting daily activities or&#xD;
      nocturnal sleep; 4= continuous cramps severely interfering with daily activities and&#xD;
      nocturnal sleep (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: patients were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control groups&#xD;
      according to a computer-generated list. Randomization was stratified in order to match age,&#xD;
      gender, duration of diabetes and the frequency and severity of cramp episodes in the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At time 0 each patient received four i.m. injections, two injections for each side,&#xD;
      containing either BoNT/A (100 units diluted in 1 ml saline) or saline. The total dose, for&#xD;
      each side, was 100 units for the gastrocnemius muscle or 30 units for the small flexor foot&#xD;
      muscles. The calf or the foot muscles were chosen according to the patient predominant leg or&#xD;
      foot cramps. Patients in the control group received the same volumes of normal saline in the&#xD;
      same muscles. The injections were prepared by a research nurse and both the treating&#xD;
      physician and the patients were left blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten visits were scheduled after initial evaluation: at weeks 1 and 2 after BoNT/A injection&#xD;
      and, thereafter, every other week until week 16 and then at week 20. Ratings of the three&#xD;
      days before each control visit were averaged to obtain values for each post-injection&#xD;
      evaluation. The number of cramp episodes and cramp severity score (both self-reported in the&#xD;
      daily diary) were obtained at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks after BoNT/A or placebo&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive response to treatment: a 30% or greater reduction of the primary outcome score.&#xD;
