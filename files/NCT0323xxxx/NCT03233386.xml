    <textblock>
      Sharp increases in substance use rates among youth in Mexico are a major concern, both in&#xD;
      Mexico and the US. Although the Mexican government has elevated substance abuse prevention as&#xD;
      a national priority, there are few school-based universal prevention programs to choose from&#xD;
      that are culturally grounded, empirically tested, and shown to be efficacious. This study&#xD;
      aims to address this gap by adapting, implementing, and testing the keepin' it REAL (kiR)&#xD;
      prevention intervention in Mexico's three largest cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and&#xD;
      Monterrey. kiR is a model program for middle school students on the US National Registry of&#xD;
      Effective Programs and Practices, shown to be efficacious and cost-effective in reducing&#xD;
      substance use among large multi-ethnic and Mexican American samples in the US. The proposed&#xD;
      study will leverage the bi-national research team's expertise in developing and adapting kiR&#xD;
      and build upon a series of feasibility studies across Mexico which showed that kiR's core&#xD;
      elements are applicable there. However, evidence also suggested that further adaptation is&#xD;
      needed to enhance the intervention's cultural fit. During the proposed study's Phase 1,&#xD;
      students and teacher-implementers in three schools-one from each of the cities-will provide&#xD;
      feedback about the original curriculum and identify culturally and contextually relevant&#xD;
      scenarios and examples. The bi-national research team-including original kiR curriculum&#xD;
      designers-will collaborate to ensure cultural applicability in Mexico and fidelity to core&#xD;
      elements of kiR. In Phase 2, the efficacy of the culturally adapted Mexican version of kiR,&#xD;
      relative to the original version of kiR and to a control condition, will be tested through an&#xD;
      intent-to-treat analysis in a randomized controlled trial with 7,768 7th grade students in 36&#xD;
      middle schools, 12 from each city. The study will investigate and incorporate into the&#xD;
      curriculum gender specific experiences with drug offers and appropriate drug resistance&#xD;
      strategies in the Mexican context that may impact the youths' risk of substance use and their&#xD;
      responsiveness to prevention programs. In light of rising violence in Mexico, a secondary aim&#xD;
      of the study is to investigate how youths' perpetration, victimization, and witnessing of&#xD;
      violence may moderate the efficacy of kiR in Mexico. The study will create knowledge relevant&#xD;
      to efficacious prevention approaches for Mexican-heritage youth on both sides of the&#xD;
      US-Mexico border. Prevention science will be advanced by understanding how culturally&#xD;
      influenced gender norms affect substance use offers, attitudes, and behaviors, as well as the&#xD;
      success of universal prevention programs. In addition, the study will add to knowledge on how&#xD;
      to execute collaborative, cross-national, translational prevention intervention research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for more effective prevention efforts in Mexico is clear and increasingly urgent,&#xD;
      with important ramifications for the US. In the US immigrant adolescents from Mexico&#xD;
      historically have had lower drug use rates than US-born Mexican Americans, but these trends&#xD;
      are changing rapidly. To fill the gap in evidence-based universal prevention programs in&#xD;
      Mexico, this study proposes to adapt, implement, and test the efficacy of kiR-a school-based&#xD;
      substance use prevention program in use in the US and several other countries-among a sample&#xD;
      of youth from the three largest urban areas in Mexico. This study will directly impact&#xD;
      factors influencing sustainability - leadership, capacity, and relationship building. The&#xD;
      research team is partnering with Dr. Medina-Mora and the National Psychiatric Institute of&#xD;
      Mexico, which oversees substance use prevention nationwide. This study will build long-term&#xD;
      relationships with Mexican scientists, educators, government agencies, social workers, and&#xD;
      community stakeholders; demonstrate the feasibility of coordinated strategies for&#xD;
      implementing school-based prevention programs involving national and local stakeholders; and&#xD;
      will increase the capacity of schools and communities to deliver future interventions to&#xD;
      additional students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      keepin' it REAL (kiR), a SAMHSA recognized model program on the National Registry of&#xD;
      Effective Programs and Practices (NREPP), is a school-based, manualized curriculum for&#xD;
      substance use prevention among middle school students. The kiR curriculum includes: 10 weekly&#xD;
      classroom lessons; 5 videos demonstrating drug resistance strategies that were scripted,&#xD;
      acted and filmed by students; and school-wide booster activities (e.g., replaying the videos)&#xD;
      to reinforce the classroom lessons. The curriculum is implemented by regular classroom&#xD;
      teachers who receive a two-day long training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The curriculum includes the mix of elements found to have the largest effect sizes in&#xD;
      school-based prevention interventions: those that teach comprehensive life skills to increase&#xD;
      knowledge of substance use, address affective and motivational aspects of substance use&#xD;
      (e.g., anti-drug attitudes, beliefs and values) and build risk assessment, decision making,&#xD;
      and drug refusal skills. kiR emphasizes the mastery and expansion of a repertoire of the drug&#xD;
      resistance strategies most commonly and effectively employed by adolescents: to refuse&#xD;
      substance offers with a simple &quot;no&quot;, to explain or provide an excuse to decline the offer; to&#xD;
      avoid situations where substances might be offered; and to leave when substances are offered.&#xD;
      kiR teaches a variety of communication techniques to reject risky or undesirable influences,&#xD;
      and the flexibility to select appropriately from a repertoire of strategies in different&#xD;
      situations. Youths equipped with multiple strategies can assess situations where substances&#xD;
      are offered, decide which resistance strategies will be most effective, and try additional&#xD;
      strategies (repertoire) if the first one does not work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several reasons the original kiR curriculum is an appropriate foundation for&#xD;
      developing efficacious school-based prevention approaches in Mexico: its attention to Mexican&#xD;
      American cultural and social contexts of substance use; evidence of the applicability of&#xD;
      kiR's core components in Mexico; and its ideal developmental timing for implementation. There&#xD;
      are also theoretical and empirical reasons that additional adaptation to the cultural and&#xD;
      social contexts of Mexico is needed. The cultural communication patterns of youth and the&#xD;
      context of substance use offers needs to be incorporated when adapting it for use in Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional studies in Mexico show that kiR's core elements and approach are relevant and&#xD;
      effective for Mexican youth from different regions. Surveys of Mexican high school youth&#xD;
      found that kiR strategies were not only used in Monterrey and in Guanajuato State, but that&#xD;
      the use of these strategies is associated with decreased alcohol and tobacco use. A&#xD;
      longitudinal randomized pilot field trial of kiR in two Guadalajara middle schools reported&#xD;
      significant effects in reducing use of alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use, but in ways&#xD;
      that differed for males and females, suggesting that additional tailoring of the curriculum&#xD;
      to gendered substance use cultural and social contexts may be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to testing the efficacy of kiR in Mexico, the potential moderating influence of&#xD;
      gender role norms and violence will be explored. Despite rapid cultural changes in gender&#xD;
      socialization in Mexico and women's attainment of higher levels of education and workplace&#xD;
      participation, traditional gender role norms for women continue to be influential. Young&#xD;
      women adhering to more traditional gender role norms also tend to use substances less because&#xD;
      females are more closely monitored by parents, more restricted to the home, and less exposed&#xD;
      to risky environments such as unsupervised parties or bars. However, among the growing&#xD;
      proportion of female adolescents in Mexico who are questioning traditional gender role norms,&#xD;
      these cultural restraints are lessening and the risk of substance use is growing. Female and&#xD;
      male adolescents in Mexico are nearing parity in rates of alcohol use, although females still&#xD;
      report less use. Norms for men that promote hyper-masculinity, aggressiveness and&#xD;
      impulsiveness encourage behaviors like heavy drinking and risky sex that have severe health&#xD;
      consequences. The persistence of traditional male gender role norms underscores the pressing&#xD;
      need for effective drug resistance strategies that provide male adolescents with ways to&#xD;
      counterbalance unhealthy cultural messages with positive cultural norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender differences among adolescents in Mexico have been reported in the use of the REAL drug&#xD;
      resistance strategies, in the association between use of these strategies and actual&#xD;
      substance use, and in the effects of kiR in a pilot feasibility field trial in Guadalajara.&#xD;
      While both males and females used the REAL strategies to resist substance use offers, the&#xD;
      relationship between substance use and the use of REAL strategies was either stronger for&#xD;
      males than for females or only significant for males. The field trial found short-term&#xD;
      effects in reducing females' use of alcohol and cigarettes and in the long-term use of&#xD;
      alcohol, while desirable effects for males were found for long-term use of marijuana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pervasive violence in some Mexican communities has the potential to influence youths'&#xD;
      vulnerability to using substances and the effectiveness of strategies to prevent or resist&#xD;
      substance use. Experiencing violence as a perpetrator, victim, or witness is a complex and&#xD;
      interconnected phenomenon. Among urban minority youth in the US, 95% of perpetrators also&#xD;
      report violence victimization or witnessing community violence. Although an investigation of&#xD;
      the mechanisms linking violence to youth substance use is beyond its scope, the proposed&#xD;
      study will investigate how youths' perpetration, victimization, and witnessing of violence&#xD;
      may moderate the efficacy of kiR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a highly innovative study which will conduct the first national RCT of a school-based&#xD;
      and evidence-based universal prevention intervention that is systematically culturally&#xD;
      adapted for Mexico, using a NREPP model program. The proposed cultural adaptation design is&#xD;
      innovative because it includes a bi-national team of stakeholders: students, teachers, school&#xD;
      administrators, and researchers participating on an equal footing throughout the adaptation&#xD;
      and testing phases. Second, the study advances knowledge on the transferability to emerging&#xD;
      economies of prevention interventions that were developed, implemented, and tested in the US&#xD;
      and based on a science of prevention. Third, the study will investigate and incorporate the&#xD;
      gendered nature of substance use risk in the design of an adapted universal prevention&#xD;
      program, and assess the differential efficacy of the program on male and female adolescents&#xD;
      who adopt more and less traditional gender role norms in a societal context where those norms&#xD;
      are rapidly changing. Fourth, the study will examine if Mexican adolescents experiencing&#xD;
      different types of violence (exposure, perpetration, and victimization) derive differential&#xD;
      benefits from universal school based substance use prevention programs like kiR. Fifth, a&#xD;
      bi-national research team with a long-standing history of collaboration and productivity will&#xD;
      lead the study, bringing together leading scientists in prevention in Mexico with the&#xD;
      original designers of the kiR intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASU-based research team has a long trajectory starting in the 1990s related to the&#xD;
      original development, testing, sub-group analysis, and dissemination of kiR. Over more than a&#xD;
      decade, the research team has conducted three exploratory studies across different regions of&#xD;
      Mexico in order to advance understanding of the social and cultural contexts of substance use&#xD;
      among Mexican youth and the bi-national applicability of kiR. Study 1. A cross-sectional&#xD;
      study conducted in Monterrey, Mexico with 327 students in two high schools (grades 10-12)&#xD;
      demonstrated: the use of the REAL strategies to resist alcohol, tobacco and marijuana offers;&#xD;
      gender differences in use of the strategies; and an inverse relationship between use of the&#xD;
      strategies and actual substance use. Study 2. Similar findings emerged in a larger&#xD;
      probability-based sample conducted in Guanajuato (State) with 702 students in eight high&#xD;
      schools. The Monterrey and Guanajuato studies provided initial evidence that the use of REAL&#xD;
      strategies is associated with less substance use among Mexican youth; however, the studies&#xD;
      did not directly address the effectiveness of kiR in a Mexican cultural context. Study 3. To&#xD;
      test the cultural fit of kiR in Mexico and to prepare for possible adaptation of the program&#xD;
      to the Mexican context, a longitudinal randomized pilot feasibility trial was conducted in&#xD;
      Guadalajara, Mexico with 432 middle school students in two schools. In this study, kiR was&#xD;
      implemented with only minor linguistic adaptations (e.g. English-to-Spanish translation,&#xD;
      Spanish dubbing of videos) and showed promising signs of effectiveness. The intervention had&#xD;
      significant short-term effects in reducing females' use of alcohol and cigarettes, and the&#xD;
      long-term use of alcohol, and desirable effects for males were found for long-term use of&#xD;
      marijuana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study design is guided by communication competency theory and aims at testing&#xD;
      the main hypothesis that by incorporating elements of the social and cultural contexts in&#xD;
      which children live, prevention interventions will be more efficacious. Phase 1 (2 years):&#xD;
      Aim 1, in this adaptation phase, the original kiR will be implemented in one school each in&#xD;
      Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Monterrey. Students will participate in guided discussions and&#xD;
      focus groups assessing the applicability in the Mexican context of the curriculum lessons'&#xD;
      examples, substance offer scenarios, and drug resistance strategies. Implementing teachers&#xD;
      from all sites will also complete feedback forms after each lesson and meet later in focus&#xD;
      groups to discuss the implementation of the curriculum and suggest revisions. Student and&#xD;
      teacher focus groups will be transcribed and analyzed to identify recurring themes and&#xD;
      recommendations. Project Coordinators from each site and developers of the original&#xD;
      curriculum will meet to decide on and incorporate revisions of the original curriculum to&#xD;
      ensure cultural relevance. Special attention will be given to scenarios related to gender&#xD;
      differences in drug offers and appropriate responses to them. Phase 2 (3 years): Aims 2, 3 &amp;&#xD;
      4, a longitudinal RCT of the adapted version of kiR will be conducted in 36 public middle&#xD;
      schools in Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey, with schools randomized within each city&#xD;
      into three conditions: (A) culturally adapted kiR, (B) original kiR, and (C) control. In&#xD;
      addition to questions relating to substance use and its psychosocial antecedents, pretest&#xD;
      (T1), post-test (T2) and long-term follow-up surveys (T3) will assess traditional gender role&#xD;
      norms and violence (victimization, perpetration and witnessing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The curriculum will be modified through a targeted adaptation process in which the original&#xD;
      kiR is implemented in translated form in one school in each study site. Prior to program&#xD;
      initiation, implementing teachers will receive training provided by the site Project&#xD;
      Coordinators, the Mexican co-PI and supported by ASU master trainers. After each weekly&#xD;
      lesson of the curriculum, students will complete a short curriculum feedback form and then&#xD;
      participate in group discussions facilitated by a project team member and recorded. This will&#xD;
      allow the research team to identify and address cultural and practical barriers to&#xD;
      implementation and areas that need to be adapted or changed. State and local educational&#xD;
      authorities as well as school principals will be invited to participate in the teachers'&#xD;
      focus groups to identify system level issues with implementation, dissemination and&#xD;
      sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After curriculum feedback data have been collected, transcribed, and analyzed, Project&#xD;
      Coordinators from each site will meet with members of the original US curriculum development&#xD;
      team to incorporate the examples and scenarios provided by students. Core components of the&#xD;
      curriculum will be preserved, e.g. overall structure, topics, and skills training in the use&#xD;
      of the REAL strategies. During the curriculum adaptation process, the study's Bi-National&#xD;
      Scientific Leadership Team led by the Mexican co-PI will review and approve suggested changes&#xD;
      to ensure the cultural applicability and preservation of core components of kiR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the adaptation is complete, the randomized control trial will be conducted in&#xD;
      Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Monterrey, with 12 schools from each site assigned at random&#xD;
      into three conditions: (A) culturally adapted kiR, (B) original kiR (translated only), and&#xD;
      (C) control. All students will complete a pretest survey before the start of the intervention&#xD;
      (T1) and post-tests to assess short-term (T2) and long term (T3) program effects on substance&#xD;
      use behaviors and antecedents (drug use intentions, norms and attitudes), and drug resistance&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites, Schools, and Participants. The Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara metropolitan&#xD;
      areas will serve as the three sites for the study. These sites were chosen as the largest&#xD;
      metropolitan and economic hubs in Mexico (accounting for over a fourth of the Mexican&#xD;
      population), as major sending communities to the US, and as prime destinations or stop-overs&#xD;
      for migrants coming from rural Mexico, Central and South America, many on an intended&#xD;
      migration path to the US. From these three sites, the sample of 7th grade children will be&#xD;
      drawn from 36 public schools (Total N ≈ 7,768). The nine schools within each site will be&#xD;
      randomized into conditions A, B and C, three schools per condition. Implementation in each&#xD;
      site will be led by the research partners in México: 1) Instituto Nacional Psiquiatrico de&#xD;
      México - Ciudad de México, 2) Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, and 3) Instituto Milton&#xD;
      Erickson Guadalajara.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Recruitment. At the beginning of the school year, schools will distribute a&#xD;
      general &quot;letter-to-parents&quot; that describes the study. About a week later, and with the&#xD;
      schools' assistance, a letter to the 7th grade parents will be sent home via the children.&#xD;
      This letter will again describe the study but will also invite parents to indicate if the&#xD;
      child will not participate. Children whose parents do not want the children to participate&#xD;
      will be excluded from all surveys. Children whose parents do not opt out will be randomized&#xD;
      according to the treatment condition assigned to the child's school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection. Data collection will be the responsibility of the Mexican research partners,&#xD;
      assisted by data collection, instrumentation, and quality assurance protocols developed by&#xD;
      the US research team. A baseline pretest survey (T1) will be administered to consented 7th&#xD;
      grade students at all sites at the start of the school year and before the beginning of kiR.&#xD;
      The 10-lesson intervention will begin immediately after. An initial post-test (T2) will be&#xD;
      administered two months after implementation ends (the end of 7th grade), at a time when the&#xD;
      program effects on short-term psychosocial antecedents of substance use (e.g., drug-related&#xD;
      intentions, norms,and attitudes) are expected to be strongest. An additional follow-up&#xD;
      posttest (T3) will be administered one year later, at the end of 8th grade, to assess the&#xD;
      long-term efficacy of the intervention. Fidelity measures will be collected during&#xD;
      implementation. Project team members will observe implementation on a standardized schedule&#xD;
      to ensure fidelity to kiR program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Database and Tracking. The Mexican research partners will enter the data at each&#xD;
      site and securely transfer it to the US research team. The US team will develop a database&#xD;
      using REDCap which will track youth throughout the RCT. Unique identifiers will allow for&#xD;
      matching across survey waves. The database will contain the participant's name, unique&#xD;
      identifier, and site, school and teacher when first entering the study. Participant tracking&#xD;
      through REDCap has been used successfully in previous studies by the team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Evaluation Measures. In the adaptation phase, teacher and student written feedback&#xD;
      after each lesson will be self-reported on lesson feedback forms, using instruments and&#xD;
      measures initially developed for the original kiR trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the RCT phase, the process of recruitment of the schools in the three cities will be&#xD;
      documented to capture challenges and solutions. Fidelity is captured by items assessing the&#xD;
      implementer's adherence to the program manual when delivering the lesson's key&#xD;
      components-instructions, video, practice, and homework-as well as the implementer's&#xD;
      enthusiasm, preparedness, implementation self-efficacy, and program acceptance (implementer&#xD;
      comfort using program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey Measures. Key measures in the survey instrument are connected to communication&#xD;
      competence theory to assess the repertoire of drug resistance strategies that the students&#xD;
      use in different social and cultural contexts and how each may influence substance use.&#xD;
      Traditional measures of substance use behaviors and the psychosocial antecedents were chosen&#xD;
      for internal consistency over time through prior evaluations of kiR and use in other&#xD;
      prevention trials, and are supplemented by measures of gender role norms and experience of&#xD;
      violence. Table 1 summarizes key measures and psychometric properties. Spanish language&#xD;
      back-translated versions of most items were employed successfully in the research team's&#xD;
      preliminary pilot Mexico studies in Monterrey, Guanajuato, and Guadalajara (see Section C1).&#xD;
      Prior to employing the questionnaire items in the proposed RCT, the items will be tested&#xD;
      during the Phase I pilot test in three schools, one in each city, to reconfirm suitability,&#xD;
      accurate translation, and psychometric properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substance Use Behaviors: Key student outcomes include the youths' self-reports of recent&#xD;
      (last 30 days) frequency and amount of substance use (alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and&#xD;
      inhalants). While no independent validation of actual substance use will be obtained through&#xD;
      biochemical measures, there is sufficient evidence of the validity of self-reports under the&#xD;
      proposed conditions: comparing self-reports over time and across treatments, focusing on&#xD;
      recent substance use, and using administrative procedures that minimize bias (e.g.,&#xD;
      establishing rapport, insuring confidentiality, placing sensitive questions toward the end).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substance Use Antecedents: Key psychosocial antecedents of substance use will be assessed as&#xD;
      program outcomes to test whether the kiR intervention reinforces important protective factors&#xD;
      against substance use: substance use intentions, attitudes (positive expectancies of&#xD;
      substance use), antidrug norms (personal, injunctive, and descriptive), and drug offer&#xD;
      refusal confidence (or efficacy). A 3-item measure will assess the students' intentions to&#xD;
      accept offers of alcohol, cigarettes or marijuana if offered to them the coming weekend. The&#xD;
      positive substance use expectancies measure assesses perceptions of the positive consequences&#xD;
      of substance use, e.g. whether using substances makes it easier to be part of a group,&#xD;
      reduces nervousness, or makes parties more fun. Substance use personal norms will be gauged&#xD;
      by asking: &quot;Is it OK for someone your age to...&quot; &quot;drink alcohol,&quot; &quot;smoke cigarettes,&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;smoke marijuana&quot;. The injunctive drug norms items measure expected negative or positive&#xD;
      reactions by parents and best friends to the respondents' use of substances. The items ask&#xD;
      how angry the students' parent(s) would be if they found out that the student &quot;smoked&#xD;
      marijuana,&quot; &quot;smoked cigarettes,&quot; or &quot;drank alcohol&quot;, and how best friends would act towards&#xD;
      them if they used the same substances. Two descriptive norms items (perceptions of the extent&#xD;
      of substance use among age peers) ask respondents to estimate the proportion of school peers,&#xD;
      and of friends, who have tried alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana. Refusal confidence is&#xD;
      measured by three items that ask the extent to which the student is sure that he or she would&#xD;
      decline an offer of alcohol from a family member, of marijuana from a close friend, and of a&#xD;
      cigarette from a school peer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Resistance Strategies: The drug resistance strategies measures will assess students'&#xD;
      responses to actual and hypothetical substance use offers: the frequency or likelihood of&#xD;
      turning down an offer by &quot;just saying no&quot; (refuse); give an explanation or excuse (explain);&#xD;
      stay away from situations where people the same age are using substances (avoid); leave the&#xD;
      situation (leave); or some other resistance strategy. These items will be posed in two ways:&#xD;
      as questions about resistance strategies actually used in the last 30 days, and as likely&#xD;
      responses in a hypothetical situation, being offered a beer at a party next weekend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender Role Norms: Adherence to traditional gender role norms will be measured by the&#xD;
      five-item Gender Roles subscale of the Mexican American Cultural Values Scales for&#xD;
      Adolescents. The scale assesses adolescents' beliefs in having distinct roles for males&#xD;
      (bread-winner and head of household) and females (child-rearing and protecting daughters).&#xD;
      The subscale was validated and shown reliable with a sample of 750 fifth grade&#xD;
      Mexican-heritage males and females in the Southwestern US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to Violence: A modified version of the Exposure to Violence and Violent Behaviors&#xD;
      Committed checklists will be used to measure middle-school students' violence perpetration&#xD;
      and violence victimization in the home, school, and neighborhood context. A modified 10-item&#xD;
      subscale of Things I Have Seen and Heard will assess exposure to community violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and Controls: Finally, a set of socio-demographic and control questions will&#xD;
      include gender, usual academic grades, age and birth date (the latter useful for verifying&#xD;
      tracking and matching across waves), and family and household composition. Socioeconomic&#xD;
      status will be measured by utilizing information about the educational attainments of the&#xD;
      respondents' parents and reports of household financial strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Evaluation Analysis. The goal of the process evaluation in the adaptation phase is to&#xD;
      identify further adaptations that are necessary to refine kiR for use in Mexico. The process&#xD;
      will involve assembling, extracting, coding and comparing information from the open-ended&#xD;
      discussion group and focus group data, and lesson feedback provided by students and teachers.&#xD;
      Investigators will follow strategies that are designed to increase the rigorousness of&#xD;
      analysis and interpretations including triangulation, analyst cross-checking, and an audit&#xD;
      trail. Overall assessments of the salience of these patterns will then inform decisions about&#xD;
      cultural adaptations to kiR that should be incorporated into the revised Mexican version of&#xD;
      the curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT Program Efficacy Analyses. Student questionnaire data will be employed to test hypotheses&#xD;
      about the efficacy of the adapted kiR curriculum, using intent-to-treat analyses comparing&#xD;
      all students at pretest who were in condition A schools with (1) students in condition B&#xD;
      schools, and with (2) students in condition C schools. Prior to conducting hypothesis tests,&#xD;
      measures will be assessed for adequate variability and scale reliability, and exploratory&#xD;
      factor analysis will be employed in data reduction. For the hypothesis tests, the dependent&#xD;
      variables will include T2 and T3 post-test measures of the outcomes listed above in section&#xD;
      C5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1. Program efficacy: students receiving the culturally adapted version of kiR will&#xD;
      report relatively lower undesirable outcomes (e.g. recent substance use, intentions to use&#xD;
      substances) and relative increases in desirable outcomes (e.g. anti-drug personal norms and&#xD;
      attitudes, use of REAL strategies) when compared to students receiving the original kiR&#xD;
      (translated only) and those in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses 2a, b. Gender role norms as moderators: The efficacy of the intervention will vary&#xD;
      for males and females who differ in adherence to traditional gender role norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3. Violence as a moderator: The intervention will produce stronger desired effects&#xD;
      among youth who report more experience of violence (as victim, perpetrator, or witness).&#xD;
      These youth may benefit more from the intervention because of being at higher risk for using&#xD;
      substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use both baseline adjusted general linear model procedures (i.e., variants&#xD;
      of multiple regression) and growth curve modeling to test Hypothesis 1 concerning program&#xD;
      efficacy. The first method will predict short-term (T2) and then long-term (T3) post-test&#xD;
      outcome measures (substance use, antecedents, and drug resistance strategies) with dummy&#xD;
      variable contrasts of intervention conditions, while controlling simultaneously for the&#xD;
      baseline pre-test (T1) measure of the particular outcome. Condition A (adapted kiR) will be&#xD;
      compared with Condition B (original kiR) and then compared in a separate analysis with&#xD;
      Condition C (Control). Growth curve models will test whether and how changes over time in the&#xD;
      outcomes (trajectories from T1 to T2 to T3) differ significantly by these same contrasts of&#xD;
      conditions. Hypotheses 2a, 2b and 3 will be tested employing mean centered interactions of&#xD;
      the measures of traditional gender role norms and experience of violence with the dummy&#xD;
      variable contrasts of study conditions (A v. B, A v. C). Prior to these tests of moderation&#xD;
      investigators will check the applicability of the assumption under the risk moderation&#xD;
      argument that substance use behaviors (measured before intervention) vary according to&#xD;
      traditional gender role norms and experience of violence as described in sections A5 and A6.&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed using multilevel statistical models (e.g., SAS Proc Mixed), with&#xD;
      individual students clustered within schools, to adjust for any school-level random effects&#xD;
      that may result in biased standard errors. All analyses will introduce controls for the&#xD;
      metropolitan site of the intervention and any demographic characteristics of participants&#xD;
      that are shown to differ significantly across sites at the pretest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing Data, Attrition and Retention Strategies. As in any longitudinal study, there is&#xD;
      likely to be attrition and item missing data, but our preliminary research suggests that it&#xD;
      will be readily manageable with available statistical techniques. Investigators will employ&#xD;
      multiple imputation methods to adjust for missing data, which have been used successfully in&#xD;
      studies of prevention program efficacy. Using the PROC MI procedure in SAS, creating multiple&#xD;
      complete datasets, analyze them with complete-data methods, and combine the results of these&#xD;
      analyses to arrive at a single estimate that properly incorporates the uncertainty in the&#xD;
      imputed values. The number of imputations will be adjusted, as recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Power. The sample size of 7,768 students within 36 schools was determined through&#xD;
      a power calculation to be able to detect small to medium effect sizes. A minimal expected&#xD;
      effect size of 0.15 for main outcomes was determined through the Guadalajara pilot&#xD;
      feasibility study and prior US-based studies testing adaptations of kiR. Interclass&#xD;
      correlations (ICCs) were calculated using data from the original RCT of kiR in 35 schools in&#xD;
      the Southwestern US (Note: with only two schools, ICCs could not be calculated in the&#xD;
      Guadalajara pilot feasibility study). Among the twelve main outcomes, the highest ICC was&#xD;
      0.02. Thus, given an ICC of 0.02, an effect size of 0.15, and a moderately effective pretest&#xD;
      that explains 60 percent of the between school variation, our design has 0.80 power with 12&#xD;
      schools per treatment, 150 students per school (n = 7,768). Power was calculated for a&#xD;
      two-level cluster randomized design using RDPOWER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decade the US research team has systematically developed research partnerships&#xD;
      with colleagues in different regions of Mexico to better understand the substance use needs&#xD;
      of Mexican youth and to test the applicability of kiR in the Mexican cultural and social&#xD;
      context. These partnerships have also enriched the team's work in the US with Mexican&#xD;
      American youth. The proposed study is a natural outgrowth of these bi-national&#xD;
      collaborations. Mexican researchers who have collaborated with the US team on prior pilot&#xD;
      studies in Mexico will also participate in the proposed study, advancing the partnership and&#xD;
      enhancing prevention research capacity in Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responsibilities for completing the research will be shared by the Mexican and US research&#xD;
      teams. Dr. Medina-Mora will serve as the Mexican Co-PI and will oversee the quality assurance&#xD;
      procedures including fidelity and research protocols. Dr. Medina-Mora is a national and&#xD;
      international distinguished researcher and Director of the National Psychiatric Institute of&#xD;
      Mexico. The three teams of Mexican researchers will be responsible for recruitment and&#xD;
      retention, collection of process evaluation and student survey data, and data entry at each&#xD;
      respective site. The US research team will design the protocols for data collection,&#xD;
      instrumentation, and quality assurance, and conduct the statistical analyses of program&#xD;
      efficacy and tests of hypotheses. Both the US and Mexican teams will be involved in the&#xD;
      curriculum adaptation process, interpretation of findings, manuscript development and&#xD;
      dissemination activities.&#xD;
