  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a database of keratoconic eyes with two or more&#xD;
      corneal topographies/tomographies, at least 5 months apart&#xD;

      Title: Keratometry values such as K1, K2 and the angle between these two; Value and location&#xD;
      of the thinnest corneal point; Pachymetry progression (radial change of pachymetry); IS value&#xD;
      (i.e., ratio of average curvature in superior and inferior sections)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to obtain a database, containing at least two valid corneal biometry&#xD;
      measurements (Scheimpflug) recorded at least 5 months apart, for a predetermined number of&#xD;
      suitable keratoconus patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be used to create a personalized three-dimensional model of the cornea at&#xD;
      each time point, which permits classifying corneas according to shape and stage, as well as&#xD;
      assessing the influence of patient age, gender, family history and ophthalmic habits (e.g.&#xD;
      eye rubbing) on keratoconus progression. Based on corneal changes over time, an estimate of&#xD;
      the underlying biomechanical changes will be made. All these data will then be combined to&#xD;
      develop software for automated keratoconus detection and progression risk assessment to help&#xD;
      ophthalmologists decide when to perform crosslinking on their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary variables are the elevation parameters derived directly from the Scheimpflug&#xD;
      measuring device export files, along with the demographic and medical information (if&#xD;
      available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame: 5 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a predictive model for keratoconus progression speed based on multiple measurements,&#xD;
      this can be improved to make predictions based on a single measurement. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      database obtained in this work will also be a valuable resource to analyse the variation in&#xD;
      keratoconus shape, which may lead to an improved classification of keratoconus types&#xD;
