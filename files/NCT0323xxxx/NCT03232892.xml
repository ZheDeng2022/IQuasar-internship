      Phase II trial to evaluate trametinib in patients with locally advanced non-squamous,&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor a non-synonymous NF-1 mutation, with&#xD;
      progressive disease on at least one prior line of therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of trametinib monotherapy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC&#xD;
      whose tumors non-synonymous NF1 mutations and are KRAS wildtype. Eligible patients must have&#xD;
      documented disease progression either during or after treatment with most recent therapy and&#xD;
      may not have received prior treatment with a MEK inhibitor. Patients with activating&#xD;
      alterations in EGFR, ALK, and ROS-1 must also have received appropriate TKI treatment.&#xD;
      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive trametinib monotherapy and followed for&#xD;
      the primary endpoint of objective response rate and additional secondary endpoints. A total&#xD;
      of 27 patients will be enrolled into the study, with the goals of obtaining 24 evaluable&#xD;
      patients. Patients may continue treatment until disease progression or up to 24 months from&#xD;
      the time of study entry or until the study is closed. All patients will be followed for 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>For participants receiving at least one dose of study treatment, the ORR is defined as the best overall response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression or recurrence as assessed over a 1-year period from the start of treatment. The frequency and percentages of patients with a best overall response rate of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) will be determined. We will test the hypothesis that the ORR is greater than the null hypothesis of 10% using the Fisher's exact test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The DR for Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) will be measured from the date that the best response is first recorded until the date that PD is documented. For patients who continue treatment post progression, the date of Disease Progression (PD) documentation will be used for analysis. The DR will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR) According to RECIST Version 1.1 Criteria.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>DCR will be defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved CR, PR, or SD for at least 12 weeks. The DCR will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST Version 1.1 Criteria.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be calculated as 1+ the number of days from the first dose of study drugs to documented radiographic progression or death due to any cause over a period of 1 year. For patients who continue treatment post-progression, the date of radiographic progression will be used for PFS analysis. For patients who continue treatment post-progression, the date of radiographic progression will be used for PFS analysis. The Kaplan-Meier analysis will be used to calculate the median PFS with 95% confidence interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be calculated as 1+ the number of days from the first dose of study drugs to death due to any cause over a period of 1 year. The Kaplan-Meier analysis will be used to calculate the median OS with 95% confidence interval.</description>

&#xD;
         15. Adequate baseline organ function defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Hematologic:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count: ≥ 1.2 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin: ≥ 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets: ≥ 100 x 10^9/L&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 3 days prior to study enrollment. The effects of trametinib on the developing&#xD;
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because animal studies with trametinib&#xD;
             have shown reproductive toxicity, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree&#xD;
             to use effective methods of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 4&#xD;
             months following discontinuation of trametinib. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of study drug&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication and does not have any&#xD;
             clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such&#xD;
             as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. All prior treatment- related toxicities must be CTCAE (Version 4.03) ≤ Grade 1 (except&#xD;
             alopecia) at the time of randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign&#xD;
             it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord&#xD;
             compression. Treated brain metastases are allowed as long as they are stable for at&#xD;
             least 28 days post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated with trametinib . Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             trametinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of another malignancy. Exception: Subjects who have been disease-free for 3&#xD;
             years, or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer&#xD;
             and/or subjects with indolent second malignancies are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical disorder (aside from malignancy&#xD;
             exception above), psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with&#xD;
