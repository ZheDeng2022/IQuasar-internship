    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effect of celecoxib treatment on Ki-67 expression, a marker of cell&#xD;
           proliferation, in the bronchial epithelium of current and former smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the toxicity associated with celecoxib administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the effect of celecoxib treatment on arachidonic acid metabolites in the&#xD;
           bronchial epithelium of current and former smokers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COX-2 is an enzyme thought to be involved in the development of some cancer. Celecoxib is a&#xD;
      COX-2 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment begins, participants will have a bronchoscopy (tissue sample from the lung).&#xD;
      This is taken to see if different elements (biomarkers) in the tissue can predict which&#xD;
      individuals are at higher risk for developing cancer. In a bronchoscopy a tube will be placed&#xD;
      through the nose into the lung (while under sedation) to remove tissue samples for laboratory&#xD;
      analysis (biopsy). Cells will also be collected during the bronchoscopy by spraying the lungs&#xD;
      with a small amount water and then removing the water (bronchial lavage, bronchial washing).&#xD;
      In addition, a sputum sample will be taken and the inside of the cheek will be scraped&#xD;
      (buccal sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete physical exam will be performed before beginning treatment and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,&#xD;
      and 6 months. During these visits, participants will be asked questions about tobacco/alcohol&#xD;
      exposure. Participants will have blood taken before beginning treatment and at 1, 3, 4, and 6&#xD;
      months. Urine samples will be taken before beginning treatment and at 3 and 6 months. The&#xD;
      research nurse will also ask participants about any adverse signs or symptoms that they have&#xD;
      experienced. Participants who smoke will be encouraged to stop smoking. Sources for&#xD;
      assistance to stop smoking will be provided for all study participants who continue to smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will be randomly picked (as in the toss of a coin) to be in one&#xD;
      of four treatment groups. Treatment in this study will last 6 months. Participants in the&#xD;
      first group will receive a placebo during all 6 months. A placebo is a substance that looks&#xD;
      like the study drug but is inactive. Participants in the second group will receive a placebo&#xD;
      during Months 1-3 and Celecoxib during Months 4-6. Participants in the third group will&#xD;
      receive Celecoxib during Months 1-3 and placebo during Months 4-6. Participants in the fourth&#xD;
      group will receive Celecoxib during all 6 months. Neither the participant nor the&#xD;
      participant's doctor will know to which treatment group the participant was assigned.&#xD;
      Participants have an equal chance of being assigned to any of these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take 2 capsules twice a day for the 6-month treatment period. The capsule&#xD;
      could be either a placebo or the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 and 6 months, participants will have a physical exam, blood tests, and a bronchoscopy.&#xD;
      Participants should take their study medication with a sip of water 2 hours before each&#xD;
      bronchoscopy with a sip of water. Sputum and buccal samples will also be taken at these&#xD;
      times. The research nurse will ask participants questions about changes and/or additions to&#xD;
      the medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The use of Celecoxib in the prevention of lung cancer is&#xD;
      investigational. Up to 250 individuals will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at&#xD;
      the M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
