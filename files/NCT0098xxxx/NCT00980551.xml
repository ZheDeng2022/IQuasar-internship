  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing subtenon carboplatin in combination with vincristine and&#xD;
      topotecan given by vein in the hopes of finding a drug combination that may be effective&#xD;
      against retinoblastoma that has come back (recurrent) or is resistant to other treatment&#xD;
      (refractory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To decide if the drug combination is a useful treatment for recurrent or refractory&#xD;
           retinoblastoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the safety of the drug combination and to see what kind of effects (good and&#xD;
           bad) can be expected from the drug combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure visual changes before and after the study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To use a special MRI scan to measure brain function involved in vision processing, both&#xD;
           before and after the study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators are also testing a new experimental way of giving&#xD;
      carboplatin &quot;subtenon carboplatin&quot;. The carboplatin will be given directly in the eye through&#xD;
      a needle placed under the covering of the eye. This is to try to get more carboplatin to the&#xD;
      retinoblastoma inside the eye.&#xD;
