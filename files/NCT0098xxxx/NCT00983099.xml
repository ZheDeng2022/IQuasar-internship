&#xD;
      Primary parameters&#xD;
&#xD;

           maximum plasma concentration [Cmax] of Japanese and Caucasian subjects for each dose&#xD;
           group&#xD;

        -  If at least 20% of the Japanese or of the Caucasian subjects have an area under the&#xD;
           plasma concentration curve extrapolation [AUCextrap%] &gt;20% relative to AUC0-inf for one&#xD;
           of the dose groups area under the plasma concentration curve from zero to the last&#xD;
           measurable concentration [AUC0- tz] becomes primary parameter for Japanese and Caucasian&#xD;

      Other parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacogenetics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount of N-OH Neramexane excreted in urine [Ae0-tz] if a validated method will be&#xD;
           available at the time of analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolite determination (N-OH Neramexane) in plasma and urine, optional (may be&#xD;
           analyzed and evaluated if a validated method will be available at the time of analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
