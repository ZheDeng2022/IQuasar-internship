  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pharmacokinetic (PK) study designed to investigate a combination product containing&#xD;
      sumatriptan succinate and naproxen sodium administered at 3 single doses (10mg&#xD;
      sumatriptan/60mg naproxen sodium, 30mg sumatriptan/180mg naproxen sodium, 85mg&#xD;
      sumatriptan/500mg naproxen sodium) in adolescent migraine patients. The same doses will be&#xD;
      also administered to a group of healthy volunteer (HV) adult subjects and the PK parameters&#xD;
      will be compared between these two groups and between doses.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label, single dose, randomised, parallel group study. Approximately 27&#xD;
      adolescent patients with migraine and 27 healthy volunteer (HV) adult subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled so that a total of 24 evaluable subjects complete in each group. The treatment&#xD;
      procedures for these two groups are almost identical but some flexibility has been allowed&#xD;
      for the timing of some of the PK samples in adolescents. All subjects will be required to&#xD;
      attend a screening visit within 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Each&#xD;
      subject will participate in one dosing session with one of the 3 doses of sumatriptan/&#xD;
      naproxen sodium. Sequential PK samples will be collected through 48 hours after dosing and&#xD;
      the PK parameters will be compared between these two groups and between doses.&#xD;

             more hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has at least 2, but not more than 8, migraine attacks per month in each of the&#xD;
             2 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has at least a 6-month history of moderate to severe migraine attacks,&#xD;
             sufficient to establish a definitive diagnosis of migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is able to distinguish migraine from other headaches (e.g., tension-type&#xD;
             headaches).&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must fall between following age ranges:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adolescent subjects between 12 and 17 years old inclusive at the screening visit&#xD;
                  and 18 years at dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adult healthy subjects between 18 to 55 years old inclusive at the screening&#xD;
                  visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject BMI and weight must fall between the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adolescent subject body weight less than 33.4 kg and a healthy weight using&#xD;
                  age-based BMI range 5th-85th percentile (see Appendix 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adult healthy subject BMI within the range 18-32 kg/m2 inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation&#xD;
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG. A subject&#xD;
             with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for&#xD;
             the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk&#xD;
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140&#xD;
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. For younger adolescent migraine subjects,&#xD;
                  non-childbearing potential also defined as premenarchal is a young female who has&#xD;
                  not yet entered puberty as evidenced by lack of breast development of palpable&#xD;
                  glandular breast tissue. Females on hormone replacement therapy and whose&#xD;
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception&#xD;
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.&#xD;
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will&#xD;
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends&#xD;
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a&#xD;
                  contraceptive method.]&#xD;

                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the&#xD;
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects who are sexually active must&#xD;
                  agree to use contraception until 5 day after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to read and write English or Spanish and give written informed&#xD;
             consent as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adult: subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adolescent: subject is capable of giving written assent with an informed consent&#xD;
                  from their parents or legal guardian, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
                  requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible subjects should meet the QT criteria as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adolescent: QTcB or QTcF &lt;450 msec; and without Bundle Branch Block&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adult: QTcB or QTcF&lt;450 msec; or QTc &lt;480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch&#xD;
