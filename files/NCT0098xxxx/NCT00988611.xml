      The goals of this research proposal are to further our understanding of the reproductive&#xD;
      aging process in women and to improve our ability to clinically assess and model reproductive&#xD;
      aging. Reproductive aging is a continuous process that begins many years prior to menopause.&#xD;
      Women in their late 30s and early 40s usually maintain normal menstrual function and&#xD;
      ovulatory status, yet fertility in these women is considerably compromised compared to&#xD;
      younger women. The primary mechanism of reproductive aging is through the process of ovarian&#xD;
      primordial follicle (egg) depletion, a process that exhibits considerable variation between&#xD;
      women. As a result, the age at which an individual begins to experience infertility and&#xD;
      menstrual cycle changes secondary to follicle depletion also varies significantly and is&#xD;
      difficult to predict. The clinical assessment of the number of primordial follicles remaining&#xD;
      in the ovary has traditionally relied upon the measurement of ovarian or pituitary hormones&#xD;
      such as FSH, estradiol, and inhibin B. Unfortunately, these measures are all indirect and&#xD;
      poorly sensitive in the assessment of ovarian reserve. More recently, serum levels of&#xD;
      anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) and the ovarian antral follicle count have been utilized as&#xD;
      clinical measures of ovarian reserve. Both have been correlated with chronological age and&#xD;
      have some predictive power in determining stimulation quantity (the number of oocytes&#xD;
      obtained at the time of egg-recovery) in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment cycles.&#xD;
      Reproductive aging in women; however, is more than just the depletion of oocytes from a&#xD;
      woman's ovaries, but also involves a decline in oocyte quality. The predictive value of these&#xD;
      clinical markers of ovarian reserve with regards to oocyte quality is unknown. Additionally,&#xD;
      new tools developed to assess biological aging in other organ systems such as white blood&#xD;
      cell telomere length and the measurement of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) through&#xD;
      skin autofluorescence have not been evaluated with respect to the reproductive aging process.&#xD;
      This proposal seeks to develop better models of normal female reproductive aging by&#xD;
      identifying novel markers of ovarian reserve and determining their relationship with both&#xD;
      oocyte quantity and quality obtained during IVF treatment cycles.&#xD;

      To test our hypotheses, we will enroll 120 healthy women undergoing ART cycles at OU&#xD;
      Physicians Reproductive Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing an ART treatment cycle at the OU Physicians Reproductive Health clinic&#xD;
      will be approached regarding enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collection of baseline demographic data (height, weight, ethnicity, age)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cycle-day 3 measurements of FSH, estradiol, inhibin B, AMH, white-blood cells for&#xD;
           telomere length assay, and measurement of hemoglobin A1C to control for blood glucose&#xD;
           levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AFC as determined by transvaginal ultrasound exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  skin autofluorescence measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  subjects then undergo IVF as directed by their physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  outcome measures include number of oocytes recovered, peak estradiol, quantity of&#xD;
           gonadotropins utilized during the course of treatment, and assessment of oocyte quality&#xD;
           by morphology assessment with light microscopy.&#xD;
