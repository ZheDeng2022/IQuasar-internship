    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia (PE) complicates 2-8% of pregnancies. It is associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      adverse maternal (death, eclampsia, abruptio placenta, HELLP syndrome) and perinatal&#xD;
      (perinatal death, growth restriction, prematurity) outcomes. The only definite treatment of&#xD;
      PE remains pregnancy termination. Therefore, prevention of PE remains an important challenge.&#xD;
      Low dose aspirin may be used in the prevention of PE, particularly in women who had a severe&#xD;
      preeclampsia before 34 weeks. Its efficiency, however, is very weak. Recently, it has been&#xD;
      suggested that low molecular weight heparin might be useful in the prevention of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to analyze the usefulness of the enoxaparin 4000 UI/day in the&#xD;
      prevention of a composite maternal or perinatal morbidity (occurrence of one of the following&#xD;
      events: maternal death, PE, fetal growth retardation, abruptio placenta, perinatal death) in&#xD;
      women who previously had a severe preeclampsia at less than 34 weeks' gestation. To answer&#xD;
      this question, the investigators propose to conduct a multicenter prospective randomized&#xD;
      trial that will compare two groups in parallel: a group where women will have an association&#xD;
      of enoxaparin 4000 U/day and aspirin 100 mg/day and another group where women would have only&#xD;
      aspirin 100 mg/day. The number of patients needed is 255 (amendment n°2-approved 06/12/2011)&#xD;
      .&#xD;

      1. Purpose of the study: To determine whether low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)&#xD;
           enoxaparin decreases the rate of maternal and perinatal composite morbidity in women who&#xD;
           previously had a severe preeclampsia that occurred at less than 34 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients and methods: Multicenter, prospective, randomized trial comparing 2 groups of&#xD;
           patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  First group treated with aspirin 100 mg/day until 35 weeks' gestation and&#xD;
                enoxaparin subcutaneous 4000 UI/day until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Second group treated with aspirin 100 mg/day alone until 35 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At first prenatal visit between 7-13 weeks, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
           searched. Randomization will be performed by internet software. It will be performed by&#xD;
           center.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After randomization at first prenatal visit patients will be allocated to&#xD;
           aspirin-enoxaparin or aspirin alone as mentioned above. Enoxaparin will be stopped the&#xD;
           day of delivery or after the occurrence of a complication that necessitates delivery.&#xD;
           Pregnancy management will be performed as recommended by standard care. Each month,&#xD;
           blood samples will be drawn for platelets count and the analysis of angiogenic factors&#xD;
           (sFlt1, sEng, free PlGF and VEGF). In addition, blood sample will be drawn at first&#xD;
           prenatal visit for thrombophilia work-up (Prot C, Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin gene&#xD;
           polymorphism). Only results of platelet count will be given to local investigators&#xD;
           during the study. All other analysis will be performed at the end of the study by Pr&#xD;
           Gris at NIMES, and will be blinded to clinical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical analysis: Women with previous severe preeclampsia at less than 34 weeks'&#xD;
           gestation have a 40% risk of occurrence of a composite morbidity (primary outcome&#xD;
           defined above) at the next pregnancy. A 33% decrease of the composite morbidity defined&#xD;
           above in women treated with LMWH enoxaparin is considered to be efficient. With an alpha&#xD;
           risk of .05 and a beta risk of .20, the number of patients needed is 255 (amendment&#xD;
           n°2-approved 06/12/2011) . This trial will be analyzed as an &quot;Intention to treat study&quot;.&#xD;
           No interim analysis for the primary outcome will be performed. Results will be&#xD;
           stratified by center.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcome (categorical variable) will be analyzed by chi-square test. Secondary&#xD;
           outcomes will analyzed by chi-square test for categorical variables or ANOVA for&#xD;
           continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical significance will be considered with a p value &lt;.05. Statistical analysis&#xD;
           will be performed by STATA software (StataCorp, 2003, TX).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Registry of non-included patients: Each patient that has been non-eligible for the trial&#xD;
           will be noted in a registry as well as the reason of exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Independent committee for analysis of adverse outcome: An independent committee will&#xD;
           analyze adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes before statistical analysis at the end&#xD;
           of the study. This analysis will be blinded for the treatment allocated for the&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preeclampsia: Preeclampsia is defined by the association of gestational&#xD;
                hypertension (after 20 weeks' gestation, a systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg&#xD;
                and/or a diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg, persistent at least at 4 hours apart,&#xD;
                or a persistent diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg) and proteinuria (24 hours&#xD;
                proteinuria &gt; 300 mg, or at least 1+ persistent at least at 4 hours apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fetal growth restriction: Fetal growth restriction is defined by a birthweight &lt;&#xD;
