  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard therapy for high-risk or locally advanced salivary gland malignancies is surgery&#xD;
      followed by postoperative radiation therapy. Retrospective studies have shown the superiority&#xD;
      of combined modality therapy compared to surgery alone for patients with advanced T or N&#xD;
      stage. Despite the addition of postoperative radiation therapy, the five-year survival for&#xD;
      locally advanced salivary gland malignancies is poor (less than 60%). In salivary gland&#xD;
      malignancies, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed in 25-85%; in certain&#xD;
      histological types, like salivary duct carcinomas, the expression is higher. EGFR is a&#xD;
      promising target of anticancer therapy. In squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, a&#xD;
      phase III trial utilizing cetuximab added to radiation therapy improved both locoregional&#xD;
      control and overall survival compared to radiation alone. Panitumumab is a novel, human, IgG2&#xD;
      EGFR monoclonal antibody that may be better tolerated and more efficacious than cetuximab.&#xD;
      Here, the investigators suggest that the addition of panitumumab to standard radiotherapy in&#xD;
      locally-advanced salivary gland malignancies will improve recurrence-free survival (RFS).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically determined salivary gland cancer of the major or minor salivary glands&#xD;
             of the head and neck (any histology) status post potentially curative surgical&#xD;
             resection with no macroscopic residual disease. Patients should have AJCC 6th edition&#xD;
             stage III with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. extracapsular extension,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. perineural invasion,&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. positive surgical margins or&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. high grade histology (i.e., high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenocarcinoma&#xD;
                  except basal cell adenocarcinoma, salivary duct carcinoma, squamous cell&#xD;
                  carcinoma, or adenoid cystic carcinoma) or stage IVA or IVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No distant metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy, biologic/targeted therapy (including any prior therapy which&#xD;
             specifically and directly targets the EGFR pathway), or radiotherapy for head and neck&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than 10 weeks (minimum of 3 weeks) should elapse between surgery and treatment&#xD;
             on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count: Greater than or equal to 1500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets: Greater than or equal to 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin: Greater than or equal to 10g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin: &lt; 1.5x normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance: &gt; 45 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Magnesium level: &gt; lower limit normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior invasive malignancy unless the disease-free survival is 3 years or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded (see exclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent must be obtained from all patients prior to beginning therapy.&#xD;
             Patients should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant history of uncontrolled cardiac disease; i.e., uncontrolled hypertension,&#xD;
             unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction (within prior 6 months), uncontrolled&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, and cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection fraction. All&#xD;
             patients will have a baseline EKG. If abnormalities consistent with active coronary&#xD;
             artery disease are detected, the patient will be referred to a cardiologist for&#xD;
             appropriate evaluation and management prior to treatment on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of prior malignancy, with the exception of basal carcinoma of the skin or&#xD;
             in situ cervical cancer, or malignancy that has been treated with a curative intent&#xD;
             with a 3-year disease-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because chemotherapy and radiation therapy&#xD;
             have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with chemotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with chemotherapy. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (WOCBP) must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial&#xD;
             participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. In&#xD;
             addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner&#xD;
             of childbearing potential and should practice an effective method of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All WOCBP MUST have a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline, or within 7 days&#xD;
                  prior to receiving investigational product. The minimum sensitivity of the&#xD;
                  pregnancy test must be 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG. If the urine pregnancy&#xD;
                  test is positive, a serum pregnancy test will then be performed to confirm the&#xD;
                  result. In the event that both the urine and serum pregnancy tests are positive,&#xD;
                  the subject must not receive investigational product and must not be enrolled in&#xD;
                  the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In addition, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact the Investigator&#xD;
                  immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late&#xD;
                  menstrual period) at any time during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The Investigator must immediately notify Amgen in the event of a confirmed&#xD;
                  pregnancy in a patient participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior severe infusion reaction to a human monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy or EGFR inhibitor for head and neck cancer.&#xD;
