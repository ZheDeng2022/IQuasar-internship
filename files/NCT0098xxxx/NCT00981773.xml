  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine whether switching from an antiretroviral regimen&#xD;
      containing abacavir and/or didanosine to one containing maraviroc will lead to a reduction in&#xD;
      platelet reactivity and inflammatory markers at weeks 12 and 24 thereby conferring a&#xD;
      reduction in cardiac risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the study will assess the efficacy of a maraviroc containing regimen in&#xD;
      combination with a boosted protease inhibitor in terms of tolerability and achieving long&#xD;
      term viral suppression as assessed at week 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that there will be a rapid reduction in platelet reactivity on&#xD;
      switching to maraviroc and that a boosted protease inhibitor in combination with maraviroc&#xD;
      will provide a safe and efficacious antiretroviral regimen enabling a reduction in cardiac&#xD;
      risk whilst maintaining virological suppression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety, changes in platelet reactivity, plasma cardiac biomarkers and metabolic&#xD;
      parameters in HIV 1 infected subjects undergoing a switch in ART from a nucleoside containing&#xD;
      regimen which includes abacavir and / or didanosine to a maraviroc containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 HIV-1 infected subjects currently receiving stable antiretroviral therapy consisting of a&#xD;
      boosted protease inhibitor and two NRTIs including abacavir and / or didanosine will be&#xD;
      recruited. Subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to one of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 (immediate switch in antiretroviral therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continue current boosted protease inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Switch NRTI backbone to maraviroc 150 mg bid&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 (continue current antiretroviral therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No change to current antiretroviral therapy for twelve weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After twelve weeks switch therapy as per Arm 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed up for 48 weeks and will attend for clinic visits at screening,&#xD;
      baseline, weeks 4, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48. Platelet reactivity, inflammatory and cardiac&#xD;
      biomarkers and markers of T cell activation will be assessed at baseline, week 12 and week&#xD;
      24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the study subjects may continue their study antiretroviral regimen or&#xD;
      switch to an alternative regimen at their clinician's discretion.&#xD;
