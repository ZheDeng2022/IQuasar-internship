      Background Recently, the CDC issued recommendations calling for HIV screening for patients&#xD;
      aged 13-64, when the individual accesses the health care system. For many patients, the&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) is the primary or only contact point for health care. The rapid HIV&#xD;
      test can be done as a point of care test in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To initiate HIV testing in the Baystate ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate the resources involved in initiating a rapid HIV testing program in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the process of initiating a rapid HIV testing program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the yield of testing for HIV in patients with known HIV risk factors compared&#xD;
           to those without known risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To describe the characteristics of the population tested for HIV in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the number of patients who declined testing and the reasons for declining&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To analyze ED staff attitudes re: HIV rapid testing in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A trained HIV Educator/counselor will approach patients in the ED to offer free rapid&#xD;
      HIV testing, at a time they are not currently engaged with the health care provider. Study&#xD;
      informed consent and HIV consent will be obtained prior to testing. The HIV educator will&#xD;
      obtain demographic and clinical information on the enrolled subjects including prior HIV&#xD;
      testing and HIV risk factors. Patients testing negative will be counseled regarding HIV risk&#xD;
      reduction strategies. Patients with an initial positive rapid HIV test will have blood drawn&#xD;
      for confirmation (Western Blot) and will be referred to an HIV clinic for follow-up and&#xD;
      treatment. Additionally, to assess acceptability of rapid testing in the ED, a brief&#xD;
      anonymous electronic survey will be conducted of health care providers in the ED prior to&#xD;
      starting this pilot program and following the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The yield of testing will be calculated as will the seroprevalence of those&#xD;
      tested. Among patients who decline HIV testing but agree to study participation (sign consent&#xD;
      form), the number refusing testing will be recorded and reasons for refusing will be&#xD;
      analyzed. The yield of testing will be compared in patients with to those without known HIV&#xD;
      risk factors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      I. Background Recently, CDC issued recommendations calling for HIV screening for patients&#xD;
      aged 13-64, when the individual accesses the health care system 1. For many patients,&#xD;
      especially those without a primary care provider, the emergency department (ED) is the&#xD;
      primary or only contact point for the health care system. Testing individuals while they are&#xD;
      in the ED has the potential to identify persons who do not perceive themselves to be at risk&#xD;
      for HIV. Several academic EDs have begun to offer HIV testing 10, and have initially&#xD;
      indicated promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Rationale for testing in ED Testing in the ED has several potential advantages. It leads&#xD;
      to shorter hospital stays, increases the number of newly diagnosed patients with HIV who are&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital aware of their HIV status, and improved entry into outpatient&#xD;
      care for patients admitted at the time of their initial HIV diagnosis. Another advantage of&#xD;
      HIV testing in the ED is the ability to link newly diagnosed patients to an HIV clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal approach to testing for HIV in the ED is not known. Testing without risk&#xD;
      assessment can identify persons with undiagnosed HIV infection and reduce reluctance&#xD;
      assessing risk behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While widespread routine HIV screening (e.g. testing as many patients as possible presenting&#xD;
      to the ED) is likely to result in the highest number of positive tests, this strategy is&#xD;
      expensive, burdensome and will not be practical in a busy city ED. In the setting of limited&#xD;
      resources, a strategy of targeted testing (testing patients with established risk factors for&#xD;
      HIV) may be a more cost-effective strategy. It may also be more practical and may be more&#xD;
      acceptable to ED staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another issue which needs further study is identifying the optimal personnel to conduct rapid&#xD;
      HIV testing in the ED. There are advantages and disadvantages to requiring ED staff to&#xD;
      counsel and consent patients for HIV testing. The ED staff may believe the testing is not in&#xD;
      their purview and may not believe they have time to devote to testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important issue is the feasibility of conducting rapid testing in the ED. How many&#xD;
      individuals can be tested in an eight hour day by one HIV educator? What are the barriers to&#xD;
      conducting rapid testing in the ED and what solutions can be implemented to overcome these&#xD;
      barriers? Finally, what are the attitudes of the ED staff regarding HIV testing in the ED? By&#xD;
      collecting data during the implementation of this pilot project we hope to optimize the&#xD;
      approach to HIV testing in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary - Initiation of a rapid HIV testing program in the ED of a community teaching&#xD;
      hospital is feasible but will require substantial resources and cooperation between multiple&#xD;
      departments and stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary- Patients with known HIV risk factors will have a higher HIV seroprevalence&#xD;
      compared to patients without known risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To initiate HIV testing in the Baystate ED in order to increase the number of new HIV&#xD;
      diagnoses and to link these patients to HIV care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate the resources involved in initiating a rapid HIV testing program in the ED&#xD;
           of a large community teaching hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the process of initiating a rapid HIV testing program and the barriers to&#xD;
           implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the yield of HIV testing in patients with known HIV risk factors compared to&#xD;
           those without known risk factors in patients presenting to the ED in order to estimate&#xD;
           the feasibility of a random screening strategy compared to a targeted screening&#xD;
           strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To describe the characteristics of the population tested for HIV in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the number of patients who decline testing and the reasons for declining&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           .&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine the number of newly diagnosed individuals who were successfully linked to&#xD;
           an HIV provider and the number who received antiretroviral therapy within one year of&#xD;
           initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To analyze ED staff attitudes re: HIV rapid testing in the ED&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Operations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained HIV Health Educator will offer HIV counseling and testing to ED patients interested&#xD;
      in HIV testing. The number of patients studied will be determined by how many patients can be&#xD;
      approached by the HIV Health Educator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following initial counseling the HIV Health educator will obtain an Informed Consent for&#xD;
      study participation and HIV testing as well as HIPPA authorization from the study&#xD;
      participants. Patients who decline testing will be asked to consent to participate in the&#xD;
      study by signing a research consent form and will be asked the reason(s) they decline&#xD;
      testing. The reasons for declining testing will be recorded among those who agree to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ED patients may also be referred to the HIV Health Educator by the ED nurse or clinician&#xD;
      (physician or midlevel clinician) if the nurse or clinician believes HIV testing is indicated&#xD;
      based on potential risk factors for HIV or conditions possibly related to (as a part of the&#xD;
      patient's social and medical history). Finally, a patient who is an ED patient (and has not&#xD;
      otherwise been approached for testing) may also request to be tested for HIV while in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After identification of potential patients according to one of the above methods, the health&#xD;
      educator will approach patients who are not otherwise engaged with an ED staff person and&#xD;
      prior to discharge from the ED. Patients will be approached in a fashion that does not&#xD;
      interfere with the normal flow of the ED visit. Patients too ill to approach (in the opinion&#xD;
      of the HIV health educator or ED staff) will be excluded, as will patients who have&#xD;
      previously tested positive for HIV. The HIV Health Educator will do an initial risk&#xD;
      assessment and brief pretest counseling prior to obtaining verbal and written consent for HIV&#xD;
      testing. Counseling and consent will be in Spanish for patients whose primary language is&#xD;
      Spanish. (A consent form will be translated into Spanish.) The Health Educator will then&#xD;
      obtain blood via finger stick from the patient. The test will be run (according to the&#xD;
      instructions in the package insert) by the Health Educator in a designated area of the ED.&#xD;
      Results will be read as reactive or non-reactive. In the event of a non-reactive test the&#xD;
      patient will be informed of the result. During the post-test counseling session patients will&#xD;
      be given risk reduction information and shown harm reduction skills and techniques and&#xD;
      counseled on appropriate behaviors to minimize risk of HIV acquisition. The patient will also&#xD;
      be offered an opportunity to be retested in the future and encouraged to visit an I-CTR&#xD;
      program for sexually transmitted disease and hepatitis testing and vaccinations as needed.&#xD;
      Testing will be entirely voluntary and will be confidential&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of a reactive rapid test the client will be brought to the consultation room in the&#xD;
      ED to ensure privacy and will be informed that the result is a preliminary reactive result&#xD;
      for HIV and that a confirmatory test is required. In the case of a reactive test (initial&#xD;
      positive), a venous blood sample will be drawn by the HIV Health Educator for confirmation&#xD;
      via HIV Western blot. The HIV Health Educator is licensed to draw blood. A separate written&#xD;
      consent for HIV will be obtained prior to obtaining blood for the HIV Western blot. The&#xD;
      Western blot will be sent to the MA State laboratory with an expected result in &lt; 5 business&#xD;
      days. The results of the initial test and the confirmatory test will not be entered into the&#xD;
      patient medical record. The state of Massachusetts Department of Health will not have the&#xD;
      names of patients tested. The only reporting to the state of positive HIV results will be&#xD;
      done when the patient accesses medical care as per state law e.g. the patient's health care&#xD;
      provider will report the results to the state. This reporting is not part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HIV health educator has extensive experience in informing patients/clients of positive&#xD;
      HIV test results and has a plan in place to counsel such patients. The PI or his&#xD;
      representative will also be available to counsel patients with a positive HIV test result. In&#xD;
      the rare case of a catastrophic emotional reaction to a positive test result the HIV health&#xD;
      educator will involve the crisis team (Behavioral Health Network (BHN) Crisis Services). The&#xD;
      BHN crisis services team is stationed in the ED and has experience counseling patients who&#xD;
      are severely emotionally distraught. The BHN crisis team is aware of the HIV rapid testing&#xD;
      program and is willing to participate when needed. If the patient has problems after he/she&#xD;
      leaves the ED, he/she will be able to contact the HIV health educator who, in conjunction&#xD;
      with the PI, can then make a referral (if needed) for psychological/psychiatric follow-up.&#xD;
      Once the patient has followed up with a health care provider in the HIV/ID clinic (generally&#xD;
      within 5 days) (see below for details) if psychological issues arise that health care&#xD;
      provider will make an appropriate referral to a mental health provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where the rapid HIV test is reactive, the HIV Health Educator will be responsible&#xD;
      for linking the patient to appropriate medical care. An appointment in the HIV/ID clinic will&#xD;
      be given to the patient prior to discharge from the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient can be referred to any of the three Baystate Health Centers In the event where&#xD;
      the tested patient leaves the ED prior to receipt of test results the counselor will notify&#xD;
      the patient by phone or mail to schedule an appointment for receipt of results. A supportive&#xD;
      referral for mental health assessment and counseling will also be made, as needed (see&#xD;
      above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey Prior to the start of rapid HIV testing in the ED, a brief electronic survey (using&#xD;
      Survey Monkey software) will be conducted. The survey will be sent via email to ED physicians&#xD;
      and midlevel providers. The survey instructions will explain that the survey is voluntary and&#xD;
      confidential and that participants will not be identified. The same survey will be sent to&#xD;
      the same individuals after the first six months of this pilot program to assess any changes&#xD;
      in attitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Data Management/Security&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HIV Health Educator will collect data for clinical and study purposes. Data will be&#xD;
      stored in paper records, not electronically. All patient information will be kept in&#xD;
      individual folders by barcode. A barcode is assigned to each patient and is used as a&#xD;
      specific identifier for each specimen tested. Once testing had been completed these folders&#xD;
      will be stored in a locked file in the office of the principal investigator. There is a&#xD;
      policy in place to maintain confidentiality and privacy throughout the entire testing&#xD;
      process: written consent, test performance, disclosure of test results, and storage of&#xD;
      records. We will not allow access to other researchers or answer any other questions without&#xD;
      IRB approval. All files will be kept for seven years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. ANALYSIS PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information obtained from the patient at the time of testing as part of the pilot&#xD;
      testing will be recorded on a data collection sheet. Data collected will include risk factors&#xD;
      for HIV, ethnicity, sex, age, payer status, zip code, homeless status, prior testing status&#xD;
      (and dates of prior testing), co-morbid medical conditions possibly related to HIV diagnosis&#xD;
      and chief complaint on presentation to ED. In addition, general demographic information about&#xD;
      patients admitted to the ED during the study period will be requested and de-identified and,&#xD;
      if appropriate, will be extrapolated for calculation of seroprevalence e.g. the&#xD;
      characteristics of the patients tested for HIV will be compared to the overall ED population&#xD;
      in order to ascertain whether the tested sample is representative of the ED population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients approached for testing will be recorded as will the total number of&#xD;
      patients registered in the ED during the period of testing (eight hours per day, five days&#xD;
      per week). The number of reactive tests as well as the number of positive confirmatory tests&#xD;
      will be determined. In order to determine the yield of testing and to estimate seroprevalence&#xD;
      in the ED, the number of patients testing positive (confirmed by Western blot) will be&#xD;
      divided by the total number tested. Further calculations will incorporate the yield of&#xD;
      testing in those with risk factors and compare to those with no reported risk factors. In&#xD;
      addition, the number of patients with reactive tests attending an initial and subsequent HIV&#xD;
      clinic visit as well as the number presenting with an AIDS diagnosis and the number&#xD;
      commencing antiretroviral therapy within one year after testing will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HIV health educator will observe and record barriers to testing in the ED staff..&#xD;
      Modifications in the testing policy will be implemented based on the assessment of the HIV&#xD;
      health educator in order to maximize the number of patients tested. No identifying&#xD;
      information concerning ED staff members will be recorded. Modifications in the testing policy&#xD;
      will be implemented based on this assessment in order to maximize the number of patients&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ascertain the sustainability of the program, following the initial pilot program,&#xD;
      the cost of HIV testing will be estimated by including the following costs: health educator&#xD;
      salary plus benefits, program administration, materials, test kits, postage and confirmatory&#xD;
      testing. The cost per test, cost per approached patient, cost per enrolled patient, and cost&#xD;
      per confirmed infection detected will be calculated, as will the annualized direct cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the survey will be tallied. Pre and post surveys will be compared using Chi square&#xD;
      for categorical data (e.g. for yes, no questions) and Student's T test for continuous data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the main study will be entered into Microsoft Excel. StatView statistical software&#xD;
      will be used to analyze data. Categorical data will be analyzed by the appropriate test e.g.&#xD;
      Chi Square or Fisher's exact test. Continuous data will be analyzed using the Student's&#xD;
      T-test.&#xD;
