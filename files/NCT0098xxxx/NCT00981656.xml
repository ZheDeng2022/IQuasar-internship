      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized&#xD;
      radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      cisplatin, mitomycin C, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation&#xD;
      therapy together with cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy given together with&#xD;
      chemotherapy works in treating patients with stage I bladder cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the rate of freedom from radical cystectomy at 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the rate of freedom from radical cystectomy at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the rate of freedom from the development of distant disease progression at 3&#xD;
           and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the rate of freedom from progression of bladder tumor to stage T2 or greater&#xD;
           at 3 and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate disease-specific survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the incidence of acute and late pelvic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of this treatment approach in preventing the recurrence of any&#xD;
           local bladder tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the potential value of tumor histopathology plus molecular genetic, DNA&#xD;
           content, and urine proteomics parameters as possible significant prognostic factors for&#xD;
           tumor control with this treatment approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect American Urological Association symptom scores at baseline and at 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Beginning within 10 weeks of transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, patients&#xD;
      undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy once daily 5 days per week during weeks 1-7 (34&#xD;
      fractions). Patients also receive 1 of 2 radiosensitizing chemotherapy regimens concurrently&#xD;
      with radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen I: Patients receive cisplatin IV on days 1-3 of weeks 1, 3, and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen II: Patients receive mitomycin C IV on day 1 of radiotherapy and fluorouracil IV&#xD;
           continuously over days 1-5 of weeks 1 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a persistent tumor on re-evaluation may undergo radical cystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue, blood, and urine samples may be collected periodically for biomarker and other&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,&#xD;
      every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter.&#xD;
