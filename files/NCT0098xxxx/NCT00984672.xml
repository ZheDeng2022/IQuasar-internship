  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinician directed use of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in ways other than FDA approved,&#xD;
      has increased recently due to the morbidity associated with harvest of iliac crest bone graft&#xD;
      in spinal arthrodesis procedures. FDA approved for the use in anterior lumbar fusions with LT&#xD;
      Cage, other clinical applications of these proteins is becoming widely adopted due to their&#xD;
      effectiveness in forming bone and facilitating fusion. Clinicians have realized while these&#xD;
      proteins are potent stimulators of bone formation there have been anecdotal reports of&#xD;
      increased rates of radicular pain in the postoperative period when used in interbody&#xD;
      arthrodesis procedures. Speculation as to the mechanism of this radiculitis is postulated to&#xD;
      be due to the inflammatory effects of these proteins. Excess bone overgrowth around the&#xD;
      spinal nerves in proximity to the fusion cage has been reported. No prospective studies have&#xD;
      been performed assessing the incidence and etiology of this complication. The investigators&#xD;
      propose a prospective study evaluating the incidence of this complication as well as&#xD;
      postoperative imaging studies to help determine whether bony overgrowth is indeed occurring&#xD;
      adjacent to the effected spinal nerves.&#xD;
