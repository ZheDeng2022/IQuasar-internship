      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of nerve stimulation for treating and controlling a variety of medical, psychiatric,&#xD;
      and neurological disorders has seen significant growth over the last several decades. In&#xD;
      particular, vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has been the subject of considerable research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vagus nerve extensively innervates the thoracic and abdominal viscera (afferent 80% of&#xD;
      fibres) and is an important route of information into the central nervous system (efferent&#xD;
      20% of fibres). One of the vagus main functions is to monitor and control the activity of the&#xD;
      internal organs and glands such as the heart, lung, stomach, bladder and pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation of the parasympathetic pathway leads to negative chronotropic, negative&#xD;
      dromotropic, and negative inotropic changes in the heart. 11 The postganglionic neurons in&#xD;
      the vagus nerve project to the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes, as well as to&#xD;
      the atrial and ventricular musculature. In the adult, the right vagus nerve innervates&#xD;
      predominantly the SA node, the atrial muscle and, to a much lesser degree, the AV node. On&#xD;
      the other hand, the left vagus nerve innervates the SA node and atrial muscle to a lesser&#xD;
      degree than it innervates the AV node. However, there can be significant overlap in the&#xD;
      anatomical distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation of the right vagus slows the rate of discharge of the pacemaker cells in the SA&#xD;
      node thus slows the SA node rate and thereby reduces the HR. Stimulation of the left vagus&#xD;
      nerve produces some slowing of the SA node, prolongation of AV conduction and partial or&#xD;
      total AV block. Detailed human data of the vagus nerve stimulation and its effects on heart&#xD;
      rate are not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of present study is to find clinically acceptable frequency of biphasic VNS, which&#xD;
      could allow gradual decrease of heart rate and systemic arterial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing carotid end-arterectomy and coronary bay-pass surgery will be included in&#xD;
      the study. Study was approved by The National Medical Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health,&#xD;
      Republic of Slovenia (No. 142/02/07, 13 February 2007). Before any trial activity will be&#xD;
      performed, the Informed Consent in accordance with the Informed Consent Procedure will be&#xD;
      properly obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of a Multi-electrode Spiral Cuff:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-sizing spiral design was chosen for the cuff. A detailed description of the&#xD;
      39-electrode cuff, having thirteen circumferential groups of three electrodes (GTE 1-13) and&#xD;
      fabrication can be found in our previous report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hour before surgery, patients will be premedicated orally with diazepam 5 mg and&#xD;
      pantoprazole 40 mg. For induction into anesthesia short-acting intravenous anaesthetic agent&#xD;
      propofol will be used in doses 1 - 2 mg/kg of body weight (BW) administered as a slow bolus&#xD;
      doses (20 - 30 s), while remifentanyl (Ultiva, GlaxoSmithKline, GSK Export VB) as a&#xD;
      short-acting synthetic μ-opioid agonist will be used in initial loading dose of 1 - 1.5 µg/kg&#xD;
      of BW administered in 30 to 60 s period.To facilitate endotracheal intubation a muscle&#xD;
      relaxant vecuronium bromide will be administered intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For maintenance of general anesthesia an inhalation anesthetic isoflurane will be used in&#xD;
      inspired concentrations of 1.5 to 3.0 % and analgesia will be assured by a continuous&#xD;
      infusion of 0.3 - 0.5 µg/kg/min of remifentanyl. Vecuronium bromide will be administered if&#xD;
      muscle relaxation of higher degree was needed of any reason. Low-flow anesthetic technique&#xD;
      will be performed by further continuously inhaled fresh gas flow up to 1.5 L/min of oxygen&#xD;
      and air mixture to reach 40% of FiO2. Patients will be mechanically ventilated with&#xD;
      predetermined tidal volume (VT) (5 - 7 ml/kg of BW), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&#xD;
      between 3 - 5 cm H2O and respiratory rate (RR) between 12 and 15 per minute to maintain ETCO2&#xD;
      between 30 and 35 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During maintenance, an excessive decrease of systemic blood pressure occurred due to depth of&#xD;
      anesthesia, was corrected by lightening anaesthesia. To avoid eventual myocardial ischemia,&#xD;
      maintenance of normal haemodynamics was strictly controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG Recording:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG from the first bipolar limb lead (Lead I) will be recorded via self-adhesive, disposable&#xD;
      and pre-gelled Ag/AgCl Monitoring Electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemodynamic monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure at airway opening (Pao) will be monitored using a transducer for invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring and attached to a cuffed endotracheal tube. Invasive systemic arterial&#xD;
      pressure (SAP) will be measured by the same transducers attached to intra-arterial line&#xD;
      placed in left or right radial artery. The central venous catheter for central venous&#xD;
      pressure (CVP) and Swan-Ganz catheter (Swan-Ganz CCOmbo Pulmonary Artery Catheter and&#xD;
      Vigilance II Monitor, Edwards Inc., USA) for continuous cardiac output and pulmonary artery&#xD;
      pressure (PAP) measurements will be inserted after the induction into general anesthesia via&#xD;
      right jugular internal vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All signals were amplified by a custom designed battery powered bridge amplifier with an&#xD;
      adjustable gain. All amplified signals, including amplified ECG, will then be fed to a&#xD;
      high-performance data acquisition A/D converter for notebook PC. Data will be stored on a&#xD;
      personal computer hard drive for off-line reanalysis. Graphical presentations of results will&#xD;
      be performed using the AxoScope 10.2, software developed by Axon Instruments, Inc., 3280&#xD;
      Whipple Road, Union City, CA 94587 USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cuff implantation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After internal carotid endarterectomy and off-pump coronary artery by-pass surgery cuff&#xD;
      around left vagus nerve will be implanted. The vagus nerve passes vertically down the neck&#xD;
      within the carotid sheath, lying between the internal jugular vein and internal carotid&#xD;
      artery as far as the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and then between the same vein&#xD;
      and the common carotid artery to the root of the neck. The further course of the nerve&#xD;
      differs on the two sides of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vagus nerve will be identified in the carotid sheath in a posterior groove between the&#xD;
      carotid artery and the jugular vein. Vessel loops will be used to mobilize the vagus nerve so&#xD;
      that about 2.5 to 3 cm will be available for attachment of the spiral cuff. After, the nerve&#xD;
      segment will be completely freed from its surrounding tissues and the cuff was then carefully&#xD;
      attached to the exposed nerve. Since the need to &quot;seal&quot; the cuff on the nerve with a suture&#xD;
      will be unnecessary, the cuff implantation was a relatively simple operation. Namely, the&#xD;
      self-fitting nature of the spiral design made it easy to fit snug cuff on a nerve.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the spiral cuff design was devised to induce very low pressure when installed on&#xD;
      the nerve so that any passively-induced nerve damage will be eliminated. A special care&#xD;
      however, will be taken to route the leads to the connector to avoid as much as possible a&#xD;
      mechanical tension being transmitted to the cuff. Special care will be taken during surgery&#xD;
      also to avoid of causing any mechanical trauma to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vagus nerve stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulus Stimulus will be combination of quasi-trapezoidal cathodic and rectangular anodic&#xD;
      current pulses. Precisely, the resulting current, biphasic and charge balanced combination&#xD;
      will be composed of a quasi-trapezoidal cathodic phase with a square leading edge with&#xD;
      different intensity ic , a plateau tc of 300 μs, and exponentially decaying phase texp of 500&#xD;
      μs, followed by a wide rectangular anodic phase ta of alow current magnitude ia. Anodic phase&#xD;
      ia will be one-tenth of the magnitude in the cathodic phase. However, the width of the anodic&#xD;
      phase ta will be dependent upon the charge injected in the cathodic phase: the greater the&#xD;
      charge, the wider the anodic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of Particular Nerve Compartments and groups of tree electrodes (GTE) Stimuli&#xD;
      with intensity ic of a quasi-trapezoidal cathodic phase of 2 mA with frequency of 20 Hz will&#xD;
      be delivered for approximately 10 seconds quasi-bipolarly to all 13 GTEs within the cuff.&#xD;
      Stimulation of the separate GTE will be performed 1 minute apart. The GTE that elicited the&#xD;
      largest change in heart rate, namely GTE1, will be considered as relevant for further&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vagus stimulation with different frequency and increasing current Approximately 10-second&#xD;
      long pulse trains with intensities ic of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 mA at different&#xD;
      frequencies of stimulation (10Hz, 20Hz and 30Hz) will be delivered to aforementioned GTE1&#xD;
      until the absence of cardiac contraction occurred. VNS will be terminated instantly after the&#xD;
      absence of cardiac contraction was noticed. The time interval between different two&#xD;
      simulations will be at least 2 minute or lasted till heart rate or SAP have not reached basal&#xD;
      value before stimulation train. Stimulation will be recorded on the same system as ECG, SAP,&#xD;
      PAP, CVP and PAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to find optimal frequency/current relationship of selective VNS which could allow&#xD;
      clinical useful manipulation of heart rate and systemic arterial pressure.&#xD;
