  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential pharmacokinetic (absorption,&#xD;
      distribution and excretion of the drug by the body) interaction between, and the safety of,&#xD;
      topiramate and risperidone administered in combination in patients with a history of either&#xD;
      bipolar spectrum or schizoaffective (bipolar type) disorders as defined by DSM-IV criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label (both the investigator and the patient knew the identity of the study&#xD;
      drug), nonrandomized pharmacokinetic (PK) study evaluating the interaction of topiramate and&#xD;
      risperidone in patients with bipolar disorder. The study enrolled a sufficient number of&#xD;
      patients to obtain 24 completed patients. Patients were men or women aged 18 to 55 years,&#xD;
      inclusive, with a diagnosis of Bipolar Spectrum or Schizoaffective Disorder, who were not in&#xD;
      the midst of an acute episode, and had not experienced an acute manic, major depressive, or&#xD;
      schizoaffective episode for a minimum of 30 days prior to screening (enrollment was monitored&#xD;
      to ensure that at least one-third of the study sample was of the same sex.) The study&#xD;
      consisted of a screening phase and 3 treatment periods. In Period I, patients were stabilized&#xD;
      to a clinically appropriate dose of risperidone within the range of 1 to 6 mg/day,&#xD;
      administered in divided doses every 12 hours during a 2- to 3-week period (or longer as&#xD;
      clinically necessary). Upon risperidone stabilization, serial blood and urine samples were&#xD;
      obtained through 12 hours postdose for estimation of risperidone and its metabolite&#xD;
      9-OH-risperidone (metabolites are formed by metabolism of the drug) concentrations in Period&#xD;
      I. In Period II, which lasted up to 6 weeks or longer as clinically necessary, topiramate was&#xD;
      gradually escalated to 3 steady-state target doses, while risperidone therapy continued&#xD;
      unchanged. There were up to 3 PK sampling periods (days when multiple blood and urine samples&#xD;
      are taken to estimate the amount of topiramate and /or risperidone and its metabolite&#xD;
      9-OH-risperidone in blood or urine) when the patient achieved steady state at 100 mg/day&#xD;
      topiramate (consistent amount of drug in blood with each dose); when/if the patient achieved&#xD;
      steady state at 250 mg/day topiramate or maximum tolerated dose (MTD); and when/if the&#xD;
      patient achieved steady state at 400 mg/day topiramate or MTD. During each PK sampling visit&#xD;
      in Period II, serial blood and urine samples were obtained through 12 hours postdose for&#xD;
      estimation of risperidone, 9-OH risperidone, and topiramate concentrations. In Period III,&#xD;
      risperidone was gradually tapered while the 400-mg/day dose (or MTD) of topiramate was&#xD;
      maintained. There were 2 PK sampling visits: when patients had attained steady state at a&#xD;
      dose of 50% of the maximal risperidone dose reached in Period I; and when risperidone was&#xD;
      discontinued for 7 days and patients were maintained on topiramate 400 mg/day or their&#xD;
      respective MTD. During each PK sampling visit in Period III, serial blood and urine samples&#xD;
      were obtained through 12 hours postdose for estimation of risperidone, 9-OH risperidone, and&#xD;
      topiramate concentrations. Period I (risperidone stabilization): risperidone 1-6 mg/day for 2&#xD;
      to 3 weeks. Period II (topiramate dose escalation): topiramate administered for approximately&#xD;
      6 weeks titrated up to 3 potential target doses (100 mg/day, 250 mg/day and 400 mg/day), and&#xD;
      risperidone continues unchanged. Period III (risperidone dose reduction): risperidone dose&#xD;
      tapered to zero over a 4-week period while topiramate maintained at the target dose of 400&#xD;
      mg/day (or MTD).&#xD;
