      The focus of the present study is to examine the relative efficacy of a mind-body method,&#xD;
      know as Mind-Body Bridging, of treating DV offenders as compared to a &quot;treatment as usual&quot;&#xD;
      (TAU) approach. The study will be conducted on-site at ACES, a non-profit agency that&#xD;
      provides licensed domestic violence offender and substance abuse treatment services in the&#xD;
      Salt Lake City area.&#xD;

      Mind-Body Bridging Program (MBBP) was developed by Stanley Block, M.D. over the last decade&#xD;
      drawing from his more than 30 years of experience in clinical psychiatry and awareness&#xD;
      training. In his book Come To Your Senses: Demystifying the Mind-Body Connection (Block &amp;&#xD;
      Block, 2005, 2007), he demonstrates how people can regulate their emotions through&#xD;
      &quot;bridging&quot;, a technique that brings one back to the present moment to experience and&#xD;
      recognize thoughts, emotions and physical sensations. Bridging aims to reduce the impact of&#xD;
      negative thought patterns that facilitate stress in the body. Bridging allows individuals to&#xD;
      reconnect with a mind-body state that inherently relaxes and restores healthy natural&#xD;
      functioning. MBBP is built on awareness practices that enable individuals to investigate&#xD;
      their mental states at deeper levels for the purpose of calming their minds and relaxing&#xD;
      their bodies. This can lead to reductions in activation of the stress system (stress is&#xD;
      consistently implicated in the progression of many mental and physical diseases), with the&#xD;
      prospect of potentially alleviating many detrimental health conditions. According to Block &amp;&#xD;
      Block (2005, 2007), the critical source of ill-being in humans is rooted in the &quot;Identity&#xD;
      System&quot; (IS), which is composed of self-centered thoughts, beliefs and emotions. The IS&#xD;
      emphasizes separation, incompleteness, and self-interest, creating an identity that lacks&#xD;
      authenticity. In essence, the IS interferes with one's natural functioning in everyday life&#xD;
      by effectively cutting one off from one's natural self-healing abilities, and this typically&#xD;
      results in constricting and closing down the present-moment awareness that is provided by&#xD;
      one's senses. MBBP teaches how using bridging techniques, one can identify and &quot;rest&quot; the IS&#xD;
      with its associated negativity and bodily tension, thereby creating more opportunities for&#xD;
      improving quality of life and for functioning more naturally.&#xD;
