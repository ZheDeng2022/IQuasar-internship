  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of TEAhM is to determine if telehealth blood pressure stations can be installed&#xD;
      and used in senior nutrition centers and to do a preliminary comparison of blood pressure&#xD;
      outcomes among nutrition center clients who use the telehealth blood pressure stations&#xD;
      compared to participants who do not use the stations. Specifically, the goals of the project&#xD;
      are to determine if these monitors can be successfully implemented in this community-based&#xD;
      setting, the degree to which older adults with hypertension are comfortable using the&#xD;
      technology, and whether remote nurse monitoring of blood pressure using this technology is a&#xD;
      feasible supplement to office-based care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TEAhM will be conducted in four senior nutrition centers in the state of Ohio. Using these&#xD;
      facilities as field centers, we will recruit 144 older, hypertensive adults who receive&#xD;
      nutrition assistance at these centers. Wright State staff will obtain permission from&#xD;
      enrolled participants in the intervention centers to contact primary care physicians for the&#xD;
      purpose of obtaining recommended intervention protocols and defining referral criteria for&#xD;
      changes in blood pressure treatment. We will install telehealth kiosks at two of the four&#xD;
      nutrition centers. Participants who enroll at the two centers with kiosks will be considered&#xD;
      &quot;intervention participants&quot; and those who enroll at the two centers without the kiosks will&#xD;
      be considered &quot;control participants.&quot; The kiosks will enable participants to conduct&#xD;
      self-monitoring of their blood pressure at the nutrition facility. Blood pressure data from&#xD;
      intervention participants will be sent to a central server managed by Healthanywhere, the&#xD;
      telehealth partner in this project. Nurse-researchers from WSU will receive email alerts&#xD;
      about out of range blood pressure measures, monitor blood pressure readings once a week, and&#xD;
      make referrals for medical care according to criteria defined by participants' primary care&#xD;
      physicians at the time of enrollment. Control and intervention participants will receive&#xD;
      educational materials on general wellness that are publicly available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information, background health, comfort with technology, and baseline blood&#xD;
      pressure measures will be collected at baseline in on paper forms by WSU nurse researchers.&#xD;
      Follow up blood pressure measures and other health utilization measures and reported health&#xD;
      events will be collected from both intervention and control facilities during follow-up phone&#xD;
      contacts with study personnel every two months. Blood pressure will be measured for all&#xD;
      participants at the end of the study.&#xD;
