  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressive disorders are common in patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), occurring in&#xD;
      up to 47% of patients. Left untreated, these symptoms not only have a strong negative impact&#xD;
      on quality-of-life, but also increase risk of future cardiac events and death. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      about 64% of CAD patients do not respond to current antidepressant treatments.&#xD;
      Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are two omega-3 (ω-3) fatty acids&#xD;
      found in fatty fish that are important for brain function. Recent evidence showed that&#xD;
      depressed CAD patients have lower levels of EPA and DHA than non-depressed CAD patients. This&#xD;
      information, taken together with the known roles of ω-3 fatty acids in brain function,&#xD;
      suggests that deficiencies may contribute to depression. However, it is unknown if increasing&#xD;
      consumption of ω-3 fatty acids would alleviate depression and improve quality of life. While&#xD;
      intake of adequate levels of ω-3 fatty acids is difficult to obtain through diet,&#xD;
      concentrated supplements containing EPA and DHA that are safe, readily available, and&#xD;
      inexpensive are now obtainable in Canada. CAROTID (CAD Randomized Omega-3 Trial In&#xD;
      Depression) will randomize patients with CAD, with and without depressive symptoms, after 6&#xD;
      months of cardiac rehabilitation and usual care to receive either ω-3 fatty acid supplements&#xD;
      or placebo daily during their final 6 months of cardiac rehabilitation. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that CAD patients randomized to receive ω-3 fatty acid supplements will show&#xD;
      greater improvement in depressive symptoms and quality-of-life over time. The investigators&#xD;
      will also evaluate possible improvements in other important determinants of quality of life:&#xD;
      memory and other cognitive abilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) poses a serious risk to the health and well-being of the&#xD;
      elderly. Depression is common among CAD patients and has a major negative impact on treatment&#xD;
      outcomes and life expectancy. Late-life depression is also associated with symptoms of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and subsequent nonresponse to medications. Coronary artery disease and&#xD;
      depression together can detrimentally affect autonomous seniors, resulting in increased&#xD;
      caregiver dependence and health care resource use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-seven percent of patients with CAD have depressive disorders. About 64% of these do not&#xD;
      respond to antidepressant treatments. Recent evidence shows that depressed CAD patients have&#xD;
      lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids than do non-depressed CAD patients. Along with the known&#xD;
      role of omega-3 fatty acids in brain health, this suggests that deficiencies may affect&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study, CAROTID (CAD Randomized Omega-3 Trial In Depression), is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial in persons with CAD who are attending a&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation program. Patients will receive either omega-3 fatty acids supplements&#xD;
      or placebo daily during three months of cardiac rehab. We hypothesize that patients who&#xD;
      receive omega-3 fatty acids will show greater improvements in depressive symptoms and quality&#xD;
      of life. This research will determine whether there is an antidepressant effect of omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids in CAD patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. If successful, then CAROTID&#xD;
      will provide evidence to guide health care providers in the recommendation and use of these&#xD;
      supplements.&#xD;
