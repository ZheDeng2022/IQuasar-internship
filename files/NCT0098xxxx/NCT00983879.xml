  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this natural history study is to understand more about the progression of&#xD;
      infantile Krabbe disease, a very rare genetic disease. There is very little published&#xD;
      longitudinal data with only anecdotal cases. This natural history study will be important in&#xD;
      understanding the effect of future therapies that are presently in the preclinical phase.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Infantile globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD, or Krabbe disease) is a rare, inherited&#xD;
      degenerative disorder of the central and peripheral nervous systems. It is characterized by&#xD;
      the presence of globoid cells (multinucleated cells), the breakdown of the nerve's protective&#xD;
      myelin coating, and destruction of brain cells. Globoid cell leukodystrophy is one of a group&#xD;
      of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies. These disorders impair the growth or&#xD;
      development of the myelin sheath, and causes severe degeneration of mental and motor skills.&#xD;
      Myelin, which lends its color to the &quot;white matter&quot; of the brain, is a complex substance made&#xD;
      up of a number of different glucoproteins and glucolipids, the most important of which is&#xD;
      galactocerebroside. Each of the leukodystrophies affects one of these substances. Globoid&#xD;
      cell leukodystrophy is caused by a deficiency of galactocerebroside ß-galactosidase (GALC),&#xD;
      an essential enzyme for myelin metabolism. The disease most often affects infants, with onset&#xD;
      before the age of 6 months, but can occur in adolescence or adulthood. Symptoms include&#xD;
      irritability, unexplained fever, limb stiffness (hypertonia), seizures, feeding difficulties,&#xD;
      vomiting, and slowing of mental and motor development. Other symptoms include muscle&#xD;
      weakness, spasticity, deafness, and blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no cure for globoid cell leukodystrophy. Generally, treatment for the disorder is&#xD;
      symptomatic and supportive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infantile globoid cell leukodystrophy is generally fatal before age 2 years. Patients with&#xD;
      juvenile- or adult-onset disease generally have a milder course of the disease and live&#xD;
      significantly longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globoid cell leukodystrophy is a autosomal recessive disorder with a wide geographic&#xD;
      distribution. The incidence in the United States is estimated as 1 in 100.000 births.&#xD;
      However, the incidence appears to be higher in the Scandinavian countries. 32 Swedish cases&#xD;
      were reported during the period from 1953 through 1967 with calculated incidence at 1.9 per&#xD;
      100.000 births.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be able to compare the benefits experienced by infants with globoid cell leukodystrophy,&#xD;
      who receive a possible future treatment, to those untreated, a better understanding of the&#xD;
      natural course of infantile GLD is necessary. The current literature contains only case&#xD;
      studies of individual or small groups of GLD patients. A longitudinal study of a larger&#xD;
      population of patients with infantile GLD has yet to be performed. This protocol is a 1.5&#xD;
      years longitudinal observational study to capture natural history data in patients with&#xD;
      infantile GLD. This data will provide information on the range and diversity of clinical&#xD;
      disease parameters that can in the future be used to evaluate treatment effects.&#xD;

        Patients will be enrolled regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. Patients will be&#xD;
        identified through clinical referrals from other physicians or medical centers and also&#xD;
        those patients receiving clinical care at the Program for Neurodevelopmental Function in&#xD;
        Rare Disorders.&#xD;
