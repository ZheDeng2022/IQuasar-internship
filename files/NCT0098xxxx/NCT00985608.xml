  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      H pylori gastric infection is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases worldwide. The&#xD;
      discovery that most upper gastrointestinal diseases are related to H pylori infection and&#xD;
      therefore can be treated with antibiotics is an important medical advance. Currently, a&#xD;
      first-line triple therapy based on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or ranitidine bismuth citrate&#xD;
      (RBC) plus two antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxicillin or nitroimidazole) is recommended&#xD;
      by all consensus conferences and guidelines. Even with the correct use of this drug&#xD;
      combination, infection can not be eradicated in up to 23% of patients. Therefore, several&#xD;
      second line therapies have been recommended. A 7 d quadruple therapy based on PPI, bismuth,&#xD;
      tetracycline and metronidazole is the more frequently accepted. However, with second-line&#xD;
      therapy, bacterial eradication may fail in up to 40% of cases. When H pylori eradication is&#xD;
      strictly indicated the choice of further treatment is controversial. When available,&#xD;
      endoscopy with culture and consequent antibiotic susceptibility testing remains the most&#xD;
      appropriate option for patients with two eradication failures to avoid a widespread use of&#xD;
      expensive antibiotics. The use of these drugs may also induce severe side-effects and&#xD;
      development of H pylori resistant strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistant strains of Helicobacter pylori can display a dense biofilm with mucus and&#xD;
      microorganisms in a coccoid shape on the mucosal surface of stomach that may have a role in&#xD;
      determining the resistance to the antibiotic therapies. Possibly, N-acetil-cysteine (NAC) may&#xD;
      dissolve biofilm architecture and help to eradicate resistant strains of H pylori.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the usefulness of NAC as pre-treatment attempt associated with a culture-guided&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy as rescue therapy after multi-attempts antibiotic failure, in the first&#xD;
      phase of the study, the effect of NAC on biofilm formation and on its demolition will be&#xD;
      tested in vitro by adding NAC in cultured H pylori isolates from a limited number of patients&#xD;
      (n10) with an history of at least 4 failed eradicating attempts. Two biopsy samples of&#xD;
      gastric mucosa will be obtained during endoscopy for microbiological purpose. Specimens will&#xD;
      be used for H pylori culture. In specimens from 5 patients, H pylori will be cultured&#xD;
      together with NAC 2 mg, while in the other 5 cases, H pylori culture will be carried out&#xD;
      without NAC. In these latter, after the biofilm formation, H pylori isolates will be faced&#xD;
      with different doses of NAC (2 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg) to observe the behavior of biofilm. In&#xD;
      the second phase of the study, 40 patients, after at least four unsuccessful H pylori&#xD;
      eradication attempts, will be consecutively recruited. During endoscopy, in each patient, at&#xD;
      least 4 mucosal biopsies will be obtained from the gastric body. Two of these biopsies will&#xD;
      be used for biofilm study at the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The remaining biopsies&#xD;
      will be used for H pylori culture. From culture, the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility&#xD;
      testing together with genetic analysis of H pylori isolates will be performed. On the basis&#xD;
      of antibiotic susceptibility testing alone, patients will then randomly assigned to receiving&#xD;
      two different eradication schedules: Group A, patients receiving NCA 600 mg once a day for a&#xD;
      week and subsequently a culture-guided one-week regimen including a PPI plus two antibiotics&#xD;
      against H pylori; group B (control), patients receiving solely a culture-guided one-week&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment including a PPI plus two antibiotics. Sensitive antibiotics will be&#xD;
      always chosen on the basis of the more favorable minimum inhibiting concentration value. all&#xD;
      patients will have a diary to record the side effects and symptoms during therapy. Compliance&#xD;
      will measured by counting the tablets returned after the 7-day treatment. Patients will take&#xD;
      a control C13 urea breath test at least two months after the end of therapy. They will be&#xD;
      also invited to repeat endoscopic examination for monitoring biofilm persistence or absence.&#xD;
      Finally, results obtained with the two treatment arms will be compared and evaluated also on&#xD;
      the light of genetic analyses of H pylori isolates.&#xD;
