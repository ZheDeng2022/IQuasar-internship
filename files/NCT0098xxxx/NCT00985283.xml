    <textblock>
      The goals of this project are to implement an innovative intervention for older adults and&#xD;
      assess both its feasibility and effects on health and well-being. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the intervention group will show a significantly better slope for a range of&#xD;
      outcomes during and after the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging in place is now recognized as a goal of most older adults. While medically driven&#xD;
      interventions such as home health care assist older adults to age in place, these occur not&#xD;
      as true preventive measures but as reactions to losses in function or health. The search for&#xD;
      preventive methods to mitigate decline and unwanted moves from home and community is&#xD;
      important. One such method, Preventive Home Visits (PHVs), has been utilized in parts of&#xD;
      Europe for approximately two decades. The PHV model is based on infrequent but regular visits&#xD;
      to an older adult's home by a trained practitioner (typically an occupational therapist or&#xD;
      nurse). The visit is designed to assess the older person's situation and provide information&#xD;
      and advice to optimize function and well-being. Evidence about PHV efficacy is mixed but&#xD;
      generally supportive, and there is a distinct need to create and examine a preventive&#xD;
      non-medical intervention model in the USA. A successfully developed and implemented approach&#xD;
      could enhance lives and save costs. We plan to implement an intervention informed by a&#xD;
      framework based on a synthesis of the World Health Organization function and disability model&#xD;
      and the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework. We aim to implement and evaluate this PHV&#xD;
      intervention in Orange County, North Carolina to assess the feasibility and effects of&#xD;
      preventive home visits with older adults. We will use an experimental, repeated measures&#xD;
      design in which approximately 120 older (75+ years) community-dwelling adults who are at-risk&#xD;
      for functional decline are randomly assigned to experimental and comparison groups. The&#xD;
      experimental group will receive the PHV intervention four times across a 12 month period. The&#xD;
      comparison group will receive a minimal intervention of two informational phone calls and&#xD;
      printed materials about local services during the same period. An occupational therapist with&#xD;
      the requisite training and experience in home-based evaluation and intervention will conduct&#xD;
      the experimental intervention. We will independently administer a set of standardized scales&#xD;
      to both groups immediately pre-intervention, and again at regular intervals after each&#xD;
      intervention. These outcome measures will cover the primary dimensions on which we&#xD;
      hypothesize PHVs will have a positive influence: functional ability, participation,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and self-reported health. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      hospitalization and institutionalization. Analyses will compare the differences in outcomes&#xD;
      for the two groups as well as assess several dimensions of intervention feasibility. These&#xD;
      data will be the basis for a subsequent, enhanced intervention and study.&#xD;
