      To replace Sandostatine® in three daily subcutaneous injections by a single intramuscular&#xD;

      Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemias of infancy (HI) are characterized by an&#xD;
      inappropriate secretion of insulin responsible for profound hypoglycemias which require&#xD;
      aggressive treatment to prevent severe and irreversible brain damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to the complementarity and to the synergy between paediatricians, paediatric surgeons,&#xD;
      radiologists, pathologists and geneticists, an important stage was reached: the recognition&#xD;
      of two clinically similar forms of HI but requiring a radically different treatment: a&#xD;
      diffuse form and a focal form in the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical treatment is based on proglycem, or diazoxide, then octreotide (Sandostatine ®,&#xD;
      Novartis) with a dose of 10 to 50 µg/Kg/jour divided to three subcutaneous injections. Most&#xD;
      neonates are resistant to diazoxide and side effects are observed (important edema and&#xD;
      hypertrichosis). The Sandostatine® is a much more effective treatment, unfortunately with a&#xD;
      short half-life and painful injections. In the cases of resistance to the medical treatment,&#xD;
      the distinction of the two forms is essential to guide the surgical treatment : partial&#xD;
      pancreatectomy in the focal forms, curing definitively hypoglycemia; subtotal pancreatectomy&#xD;
      in the diffuse forms resisting to the medical treatment, leading to a diabetes and a&#xD;
      pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Also, the medical treatment is essential in the case of&#xD;
      the diffuse forms to avoid a subtotal pancreatectomy. Mutations in two genes encoding the&#xD;
      potassium channels, SUR1 and KIR6.2, are responsible for hyperinsulinism resistant to&#xD;
      diazoxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sandostatine® marketed by Novartis exists in two forms, a &quot;rapid&quot; form and a &quot;retarded&#xD;
      liberation form&quot;. These two molecules have been approved in the treatment of adults in the&#xD;
      following indications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of the clinical symptoms of digestive endocrine tumours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of acromegaly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of primitive thyrotrope adenomata&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of unfunctional adenoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of corticotrope adenoma during (Nelson syndrome) and of functional gonadotrope&#xD;
           adenomata&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After pancreatic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency treatment of bleeding secondary to cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sandostatine® has neither approval for hyperinsulinism, nor in children even though many&#xD;
      international publications reported efficacy of treatment by Sandostatine® in&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic children since 1983. Also, by consensus most international teams taking care&#xD;
      of hyperinsulinism in infancy propose this treatment to their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten children who have a diffuse form of hyperinsulinism have been treated in our department&#xD;
      by Sandostatine® given in three subcutaneous injections for several years, in order to avoid&#xD;
      a sub-total pancreatectomy. The only possible adverse effect is the appearance of vesicular&#xD;
      lithiasis which can be treated by ursodesoxycholic acid . We changed the Sandostatine®&#xD;
      treatment of one of our patients by the Sandostatine® LP (retarded liberation form) after&#xD;
      written consent of his two parents. Thus we could stop the three injections per day of&#xD;
      Sandostatine®. Sandostatine® LP proved to be as efficient on hypoglycemias as the&#xD;
      subcutaneous multi-daily injections (SC). The glycemia values were strictly normal, and no&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia was observed. Following this observation, we propose to try to substitute the&#xD;
      treatment of Sandostatine® given in several subcutaneous injections by one injection of&#xD;
      Sandostatine® LP in 10 children followed in the department of Metabolism for hyperinsulinism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The awaited result of this study is to demonstrate efficacy of Sandostatine® LP and thus&#xD;
      replace Sandostatine® in three daily subcutaneous injections by a single intramuscular&#xD;
      injection of Sandostatine® LP per month. This study will contribute to an undeniable&#xD;
      improvement of the quality of life for the patients and their families.&#xD;
