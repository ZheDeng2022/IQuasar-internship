      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is one of the most common invasive procedures performed by&#xD;
      pulmonologists (1) . Typically performed under topical anesthesia and conscious sedation, the&#xD;
      procedure is considered to be safe, effective and well tolerated in patients with a wide&#xD;
      variety of pulmonary diseases (2). Complications associated with the procedure are rare and&#xD;
      studies have estimated an incidence of 0.5-4% (3) The most commonly recognized complications&#xD;
      include hypoxia, bleeding, bronchospasm, cardiac dysrhythmias, pneumothorax, and vagal&#xD;
      reactions (4). Several conditions increase the risk of complications including pre-existent&#xD;
      hypoxemia, use of mechanical ventilation, uremia, profound thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) (5). Although previous reports suggest that transbronchial&#xD;
      biopsies increase the risk for hemorrhage in this population, data are is limited to survey&#xD;
      analyses and isolated reports. Recently Guzman et al. reported a retrospective analysis about&#xD;
      the safety of FB in PH. (6) They found that FB can be performed safely in patients with mild&#xD;
      and moderate PH. However, the study was small and retrospective analysis. Furthermore, there&#xD;
      is no consensus regarding levels of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) considered to be safe for&#xD;
      invasive diagnostic interventions such as TBLB or transbronchial needle aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety of FB in patients with PH and to study the occurrence of complications&#xD;
      associated with different diagnostic bronchoscopic procedures.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is one of the most common invasive procedures performed by&#xD;
      pulmonologists (1) . Typically performed under topical anesthesia and conscious sedation, the&#xD;
      procedure is considered to be safe, effective and well tolerated in patients with a wide&#xD;

      include hypoxia, bleeding, bronchospasm, cardiac dysrhythmias, pneumothorax, and vagal&#xD;
      reactions (4). Several conditions increase the risk of complications including pre-existent&#xD;
      hypoxemia, use of mechanical ventilation, uremia, profound thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) (5). Although previous reports suggest that transbronchial&#xD;
      biopsies increase the risk for hemorrhage in this population, data are is limited to survey&#xD;
      analyses and isolated reports. Recently Guzman et al. reported a retrospective analysis about&#xD;
      the safety of FB in PH. (6) They found that FB can be performed safely in patients with mild&#xD;
      and moderate PH. However, the study was small and retrospective analysis. Furthermore, there&#xD;
      is no consensus regarding levels of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) considered to be safe for&#xD;
      invasive diagnostic interventions such as TBLB or transbronchial needle aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To assess the safety of FB in patients with PH and to study the occurrence of&#xD;
      complications associated with different diagnostic bronchoscopic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Study Population 100 patients that will undergo a bronchoscopy&#xD;
      according to the regular indications during the study period (12 months) will be eligible for&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for exclusion Exclusion criteria will be age under 18 years and patients who are&#xD;
      unable to obtain informed consent. Patients with known severe pulmonary hypertension (PAP&#xD;
      above 70 mmHg) will be exclude from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural Conduct All procedures will be performing in the bronchoscopy suite of the&#xD;
      Pulmonary Department in Meir Medical center. Fluoroscopy will be available for all&#xD;
      procedures. FB will be performed by a training pulmonary physician that will be blinded to&#xD;
      the echocardiograpgic findings. Oxygen will be administered to all patients to ensure SpO2&#xD;
      &gt;90% prior to the introduction of the bronchoscope. Continuous pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and noninvasive blood pressure monitoring will be obtained throughout the&#xD;
      procedure. Sedation will be achieved using midazolam. Topical anesthesia (was) will be&#xD;
      obtained using 2% lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subjects All the patients will undergo a Doppler echocardiogram in the day of the&#xD;
      bronchoscopy after the bronchoscopy. The diagnosis of PH will define as (1) mean PAP (mPAP)&#xD;
      &gt;25 mm Hg measured by right heart catheterization (RHC), or (2) right ventricular systolic&#xD;
      pressure (RVSP) &gt;40 mm Hg estimated by Doppler echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAP will be calculated as the sum of tricuspid regurgitation gradient and estimated right&#xD;
      atrial pressure, provided there is no increase in pulmonic valve flow velocity .Maximal&#xD;
      tricuspid regurgitation velocity (taken from all available views) will be measured by&#xD;
      continuous wave Doppler echocardiography to evaluate the pressure gradient from the right&#xD;
      ventricle to the right atrium. Right atrial pressure will be estimated on the basis of&#xD;
      inferior vena cava (IVC) size and inspiratory collapse (7,8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Data will be collected from all patients including baseline characteristics&#xD;
      of age, sex, medications and electrocardiogram. Blood tests including blood count, indication&#xD;
      for bronchoscopy, duration and bronchoscopic procedures. All echocardiogram findings will be&#xD;
      collected by physicians that will be blinded to the bronchoscpoic details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures The primary outcome will be the incidence of complications after FB.&#xD;
      Complications will define as hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt;90% and need of supplemental oxygen within 30&#xD;
      min of a completed procedure), hypotension (mean arterial pressure &lt;60 mm Hg or systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg for more than 5 min and/or need for administration of intravenous&#xD;
      solution or vasopressors), cardiac dysrhythmias (new onset of arrhythmia or worsening of&#xD;
      underlying arrhythmia that caused hemodynamic instability and/or required urgent&#xD;
      intervention), bleeding, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of bleeding will be estimated as: no bleeding - minimal bleeding that does not&#xD;
      require suctioning; mild bleeding - the need to continually suction the airways; moderate&#xD;
      bleeding - the need to wedge FB in the segment involved; severe bleeding - the need for&#xD;
      additional interventions or transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Results will express as the mean Â± SD for continuous variables.&#xD;
      Qualitative data will express as the percentage of patients with a 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
      Nominal variables will be compared with Pearson's 2 or Fisher's exact test. Continuous&#xD;
      outcome variables will be compared using Student's t test or rank-sum tests as appropriate.&#xD;
      Statistical significance will be defined as p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using a statistical software package (SPSS, version&#xD;
      13.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill., USA).&#xD;
