      The purpose of this study is to provide etravirine (ETR) through this trial until&#xD;
      participants can be switched to locally available ETR-based treatment regimens (that is,&#xD;
      commercially available and reimbursed, or accessible through another source [example, access&#xD;
      program or government program]), or local standard of care, as appropriate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is open label continued access trial for HIV-1 infected children/adolescents who have&#xD;
      completed treatment in clinical (parent) trial with etravirine (ETR) sponsored by/in&#xD;
      collaboration with Janssen Research &amp; Development and who continue to benefit from use of&#xD;
      ETR. At baseline visit, eligibility criteria will be checked. If eligibility criteria are&#xD;
      met, participants will either continue on ETR dose they received in previous ETR (parent)&#xD;
      trial or on adjusted dose if required by investigator.ETR dose adjustment will be based on&#xD;
      weight using dosing guidelines. Assessment visits are recommended every 3 months (pediatric)&#xD;
      and 6 months (adults). For most of participant, their next visit will be final visit with&#xD;
      data collection. New participants entering study, will have baseline visit without data&#xD;
      collection. Thereafter visits and assessments will be performed per local standard of care&#xD;
      and documented in the participant's medical records only. Investigators will continue to&#xD;
      report SAEs possibly related to ETR and pregnancies to sponsor using regular reporting.&#xD;
      Treatment will be continued until: investigator determines that participant no longer&#xD;
      benefits from ETR treatment (e.g based on viral load); treatment limiting toxicity; loss to&#xD;
      follow-up; consent withdrawal; pregnancy; program termination by Sponsor; ETR-based treatment&#xD;
      regimen becomes commercially available for participant's use, and is reimbursed, or accessed&#xD;
      by another source (e.g access/government program) in region participant is living, or&#xD;
      participants switched to local standard of care, as appropriate. Adult participants will&#xD;
      receive ETR 200mg BID.Pediatric participants will receive ETR, doses as received in previous&#xD;
      ETR(parent) trial, with weight based dose adjustment if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 to &lt;20kg:100mg BID (4*25mg or 1 tablet 100mg) 20 to &lt;25kg:125mg BID (5*25mg or 1 tablet&#xD;
      100mg+1 tablet 25mg) 25 to &lt;30kg:150mg BID (6*25mg or 1 tablet 100mg+2 tablets 25mg) &gt;=&#xD;
      30kg:200mg BID (8*25mg or 2*100mg)&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. Treatment will continue until one of the following criteria is met: participant no longer benefits from ETR treatment, toxicity, loss to follow up, etravirine becomes commercially available for participants' use.</description>
