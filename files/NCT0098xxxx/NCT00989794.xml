    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label multi-center study to determine safety and the performance&#xD;
      of the treatment of cartilage lesions located on the femoral condyle with GelrinC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening will be enrolled into the study,&#xD;
      and will receive treatment implantation into their cartilage lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will consist of GelrinC implantations at the symptomatic lesion of femur rated as&#xD;
      ICRS III, or IVA with less than 6 mm of bone loss below the subchondral plate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will undergo a rehabilitation program during the follow up period.&#xD;
