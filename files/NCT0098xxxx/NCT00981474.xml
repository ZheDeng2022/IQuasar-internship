    <textblock>
      Neurological complications from cardiac surgery are an important source of operative&#xD;
      mortality, prolonged hospitalization, health care expenditure, and impaired quality of life.&#xD;
      New strategies of care are needed to avoid rising complications for the growing number of&#xD;
      aged patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This study will evaluate novel methods for reducing&#xD;
      brain injury during surgery from inadequate brain blood flow using techniques that could be&#xD;
      widely employed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain injury during cardiac surgery results primarily from cerebral embolism and/or reduced&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow (CBF). The latter is of particular concern for the growing number of&#xD;
      surgical patients who are aged and/or who have cerebral vascular disease. Normally, CBF is&#xD;
      physiologically autoregulated (or kept constant) within a range of blood pressures allowing&#xD;
      for stable cerebral O2 supply commensurate with metabolic demands. Cerebral autoregulation is&#xD;
      impaired in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who have cerebral vascular disease and in&#xD;
      many others due to other conditions. This could lead to brain injury since current practices&#xD;
      of targeting low mean arterial blood pressure empirically (usually 50-70 mmHg) during&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass may expose patients with impaired cerebral autoregulation to cerebral&#xD;
      hypoperfusion. The hypothesis of this proposal is that targeting mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      during cardiopulmonary bypass to a level above an individual's lower autoregulatory threshold&#xD;
      reduces the risk for brain injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Monitoring of&#xD;
      cerebral autoregulation will be performed in real time using software that continuously&#xD;
      compares the relation between arterial blood pressure and CBF velocity of the middle cerebral&#xD;
      artery measured with transcranial Doppler and with cerebral oximetry measured with near&#xD;
      infrared spectroscopy. The primary end-point of the study will be a comprehensive composite&#xD;
      outcome of clinical stroke, cognitive decline, and/or new ischemic brain lesions detected&#xD;
      with diffusion weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Delirium assessed using a validated&#xD;
      procedure that includes validated tools is a secondary outcome measure. Autoregulation is&#xD;
      mediated by reactivity of cerebral resistance vessels. A secondary aim of this proposal is to&#xD;
      evaluate whether near infrared reflectance spectroscopy can be used to trend changes in&#xD;
      cerebral blood volume and provide a reliable monitor of vascular reactivity (the hemoglobin&#xD;
      volume index). Assessments for extra-cranial and intra-cranial arterial stenosis will be&#xD;
      performed using MR angiography to control for this potential confounding variable in the&#xD;
      analysis. Finally, an additional aim of the study will be to assess whether preoperative&#xD;
      transcranial Doppler examination of major cerebral arteries can identify patients who are&#xD;
      prone to the composite neurological end-point. Near infrared oximetry is non-invasive,&#xD;
      continuous, requires little care-giver intervention and, thus, could be widely used to&#xD;
      individualize patient blood pressure management during surgery. Brain injury from cardiac&#xD;
      surgery is an important source of operative mortality, prolonged hospitalization, increased&#xD;
      health care expenditure, and impaired quality of life. Developing strategies to reduce the&#xD;
      burden of this complication has wide public health implications.&#xD;
