      This study is a multi-site study examining the use of Quetiapine XR for psychotic aggression&#xD;
      in an acute psychiatric setting. The study aims to demonstrate that management with&#xD;
      Quetiapine XR significantly reduces aggressive behaviour in acute patients with psychosis,&#xD;
      significantly reduces psychotic symptoms and decreases the requirement for sedation using&#xD;
      benzodiazepines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aggression is a common occurrence in acute psychiatry as the experience of schizophrenia or&#xD;
      related psychotic symptoms significantly increases the risk of aggressive behaviour. This can&#xD;
      have detrimental effects on the provision of therapy and safety for staff and other patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practice in managing aggression in acute psychiatry often involves the addition of a&#xD;
      sedating antipsychotic or benzodiazepine to a main atypical antipsychotic that is continued&#xD;
      as a primary treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quetiapine IR (immediate release) has been found effective in the treatment and management of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Quetiapine acts in the brain on cell receptors to which serotonin (a chemical&#xD;
      produced in the brain) binds. Serotonin is proposed to play a significant role in impulsive&#xD;
      aggression. Additionally, sedation is a side effect of Quetiapine, which may also facilitate&#xD;
      its use in aggression. However, Quetiapine is not commonly used in the management of&#xD;
      aggression in acute psychiatry due to the amount of time required to achieve an optimal dose&#xD;
      (up to 5 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quetiapine XR (extended release) is an extended release formulation of Quetiapine that can be&#xD;
      initiated at a higher dose, a therapeutic dose can be achieved more rapidly and is taken once&#xD;
      per day instead of twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multi-site study examining the use of Quetiapine XR for psychotic aggression&#xD;
      in an acute psychiatric setting. The study aims to demonstrate that management with&#xD;
      Quetiapine XR significantly reduces aggressive behaviour in acute patients with psychosis,&#xD;
      significantly reduces psychotic symptoms and decreases the requirement for sedation using&#xD;
      benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be in-patients experiencing psychotic aggression (determined by&#xD;
      psychiatrist). For those patients experiencing aggression (which is not severe enough to&#xD;
      require intramuscular injection), the treating clinician will make a decision whether or not&#xD;
      to treat with Quetiapine XR. Those patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      observed over 8 days using measures that rate symptoms, aggression and possible side effects&#xD;
      (these include observation, questionnaire and review of patient files).&#xD;
