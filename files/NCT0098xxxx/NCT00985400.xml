      The goal of this study is to compare the effects of exercise with the effects of relaxation&#xD;
      training on physical function (how well participants perform normal daily activities) and&#xD;
      symptoms related to your cancer diagnosis (such as tiredness, pain, and nausea).&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the exercise group, you will receive a doctor's recommendation to exercise&#xD;
      (in-person advice and letters), newsletters on behavior change methods, resistance bands, a&#xD;
      pedometer, and telephone counseling. A pedometer is a small device used to measure the number&#xD;
      of steps you take.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the relaxation group, you will receive a doctor's recommendation to practice&#xD;
      relaxation training (in-person advice and letters), newsletters on behavior change methods,&#xD;
      written and video instructions for doing the relaxation techniques, and telephone counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  You will receive advice from your doctor (in person), physician's assistant, or other&#xD;
           mid-level provider about exercising. You will be given advice on the use of your&#xD;
           pedometer and resistance bands provided to you in this study, about the exercises&#xD;
           provided and about keeping track of your progress on the exercise logs provided to you.&#xD;
           You will also be given this advice in a letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive encouragement and support from a telephone counselor. The telephone&#xD;
           counselor will contact you once a week for the first 4 weeks and then once a month for&#xD;
           12 weeks. The call will take about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive newsletters with stories about other cancer survivor experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be do resistance exercises using the resistance bands 2 days a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the Relaxation Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive advice from your doctor (in person), physician's assistant or other&#xD;
           mid-level provider about relaxation techniques. You will be given advice on practicing&#xD;
           the breathing and meditation techniques provided to you in this study, on how long and&#xD;
           how often you are performing your relaxation techniques, and on keeping track of your&#xD;
           relaxation practice on the relaxation logs provided to you. -You will also be given this&#xD;
           advice in a letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive encouragement and support from a telephone counselor. The telephone&#xD;
           counselor will contact you once a week for the first 4 weeks and then once a month for&#xD;
           12 weeks. The call will take about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive newsletters with stories about other cancer survivor experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be perform the relaxation techniques at least 15 minutes a day for 5-7 days a&#xD;
           week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will continue the group exercises or relaxation techniques for 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a follow-up visit during Weeks 16-20. At this visit, you will complete the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the 11 questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the exercise tests to measure how your body uses oxygen, to test your&#xD;
           lower body strength, to test your upper body strength, and to test your flexibility and&#xD;
           balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on study for 16-20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 154 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 154 may be enrolled at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
