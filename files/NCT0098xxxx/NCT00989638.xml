  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a coordinated, standardized screening program for the&#xD;
      early detection of breast cancer in high-risk women. This would include Breast Mammography&#xD;
      and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination of your breasts. The University of Chicago&#xD;
      Department of Radiology is performing research to develop better ways of imaging the breast.&#xD;
      The investigators would like to be able to reliably identify abnormal tissue and determine&#xD;
      whether abnormal areas contain cancer without surgical procedures (i.e., a biopsy which&#xD;
      involves removing breast tissue with a needle or surgical instrument). Annual mammography has&#xD;
      already been recommended for the patient based on family history or personal history of&#xD;
      cancer. In young women, dense breasts sometimes make it difficult to find abnormal changes on&#xD;
      breast cancer screening (mammograms). MRI, in combination with mammography, may increase the&#xD;
      rate of detection of early cancers. In addition, MRI can provide better images of breast&#xD;
      tissue. The investigators hope to prove that combining multiple screening measures including&#xD;
      biomarkers improves the chances that, if you have a small cancer or pre-cancer, it will be&#xD;
      found early. This study will also evaluate quality of life measures during breast cancer&#xD;
      screening and compare breast MRI and mammogram in a high-risk population. The investigators&#xD;
      will establish a database of clinical characteristics, blood biomarkers and interventions&#xD;
      that will be saved for future analysis and aid in the development of more effective screening&#xD;
      in high-risk women. This research will also help us develop tools for studies in the future.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each woman will meet one or more of the criteria below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known BRCA1 or BRCA2 carrier (must be older than 21 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any mutation carrier in hereditary breast cancer susceptibility genes that is known to&#xD;
             increase the risk for breast cancer (regardless of age). Some examples of these would&#xD;
             include TP53, PTEN, BRCA1 and BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, and CDH1 and other identified genetic&#xD;
             markers conferring greater than 2.5 fold increased breast cancer risk in a polygenic&#xD;
             model.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women who chose not to have genetic testing or test negative, probability of being&#xD;
             a BRCA1 or BRCA2 carrier of 20% or greater based on BRCAPRO analysis or â‰¥ 25% risk of&#xD;
             being a mutation carrier by any Genetic model such as Couch, Myriad, BODICEA, in&#xD;
             addition to a lifetime breast cancer risk &gt;=20% by CARE, Tyler Cuzick, or Claus model&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Personal history of breast cancer before age 35 years and no evidence of disease&#xD;
             recurrence for at least two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any woman of African ancestry whose 1st degree relative (mother or sister) or 2nd&#xD;
             degree relative (aunt, grandmother) if paternal lineage suspected diagnosed with&#xD;
             breast cancer under age 40, regardless of risk model calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a personal history of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed at or before age&#xD;
             35 AND a first degree relative who had been diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50&#xD;
             OR has a first degree relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any female cancer survivor who received chest irradiation before age 30 for any&#xD;
             disease including Hodgkin's, a sarcoma, neuroblastoma, or other medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to meeting one of the above criteria, women must meet all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  willing to travel to University of Chicago Medical Center for imaging studies as well&#xD;
             as any necessary follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have at least one breast that has not been irradiated for cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  be at least 25 years of age or at least 5 years younger than the first case of breast&#xD;
             cancer diagnosis in the family. (This applies only to high risk women who are not&#xD;
             BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  be able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women will be excluded if they meet one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  active cancer at the time of enrollment. A prior history of breast cancer is permitted&#xD;
             if the subject has completed chemotherapy and is considered disease-free at the time&#xD;
             of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  current pregnancy or plans for pregnancy within two years of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  presence of a pacemaker or any other metallic foreign objects in their body that&#xD;
             interferes with an MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  breast surgery within two weeks of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  previous bilateral mastectomy (prophylactic or therapeutic)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history of kidney disease or abnormal kidney tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who test negative in a family with identifiable BRCA mutations are ineligible&#xD;
             regardless of risk calculation&#xD;
