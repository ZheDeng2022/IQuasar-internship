  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fructan is a carbohydrate polymer that is composed of fructose and a terminal glucose moiety&#xD;
      . Fructans are naturally found in artichokes (6.1 grams/serving), leeks (5.9 grams/serving),&#xD;
      onion bulbs (1.01 grams/serving), flour (4.0 grams/serving), garlic (.52 grams/serving),&#xD;
      watermelon (.92 grams/serving), nectarines (.27 grams/serving) and white peaches (.50&#xD;
      grams/serving). Because fructans are present in many common foods, people typically ingest&#xD;
      high levels of fructan. The most common structural forms of fructan are inulin, levanare and&#xD;
      geraminan . The human body absorbs only 5% of fructan, however it is estimated that the daily&#xD;
      intake in the USA may vary between 1-20 grams, and possibly higher due to the recently&#xD;
      discovered benefits of inulins . Dietary trends indicate that high levels of fructans are&#xD;
      common in the European and American diet, as more wheat based products such as breakfast&#xD;
      cereal, pasta, and bread are consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fructans may not be well tolerated by some subjects and its malabsorption may result in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as heartburn, belching, abdominal pain, diarrhea, gas,&#xD;
      and bloating; and this is especially true when higher doses are ingested. Unlike glucose,&#xD;
      fructans are not efficiently digested or absorbed by the small intestine. The mechanism for&#xD;
      malabsorption is related to the inability to hydrolyze glycosidic linkages in the complex&#xD;
      polysaccharide, resulting in the delivery of malabsorbed fructans to the large bowel1. In the&#xD;
      colon, the malabsorbed fructans are rapidly fermented, and byproducts of this fermentation&#xD;
      include H2, CH4, and other gases that may contribute to bowel symptoms. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      small molecular nature of fructans results in an osmotic effect which draws more water into&#xD;
      the small intestine and causes bloating and diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ingestion of high doses of fructans can cause symptoms in healthy adults, but may cause more&#xD;
      bothersome symptoms in subjects with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Earlier studies have&#xD;
      identified that IBS affects between 10 and 15% of the population in the United States.&#xD;
      Ingestion of 10-20 grams of fructan daily may cause symptoms of IBS, and restricting fructan&#xD;
      intake in a diet may reduce symptoms in a variety of gastrointestinal disorders. One study&#xD;
      recently published found that dietary restriction of fructan and fructose was responsible for&#xD;
      symptomatic improvement in patients with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that healthy individuals will absorb fructan 7.5 gram and 10&#xD;
      gram doses, and will experience malabsorption at the 12.5 gram fructan dose.&#xD;
