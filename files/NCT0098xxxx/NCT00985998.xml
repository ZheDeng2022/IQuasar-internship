    <textblock>
      Nimotuzumab (hR3) is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located&#xD;
      in the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical&#xD;
      efficacy has been shown in adult with head and neck cancer. The study assessed the safety,&#xD;
      and efficacy of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concomitantly with chemotherapy&#xD;
      in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Altered expression or constitutive activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor&#xD;
      (EGFR/HER1/erbB1) commonly occurs in primary NSCLC, and is often a critical factor in&#xD;
      progressive growth and resistance to normal mechanisms of cell death. Epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor expression in lung cancer has been correlated with tumor aggressiveness. Clinical&#xD;
      trials already suggest that EGFR targeted therapy may improve the antitumor activity of&#xD;
      chemotherapy for treatment of lung carcinoma. Monoclonal antibodies specific to EGFR can be&#xD;
      combined safely and effectively with chemotherapy. Nimotuzumab (hR3) is a humanized&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the EGFR. In preclinical studies the antibody has&#xD;
      shown potent antitumor activity. A previous phase II study in children with high grade brain&#xD;
      tumors showed activity of Nimotuzumab as a monotherapeutic agent, even in prognostic very&#xD;
      unfavourable diffuse, intrinsic pontine glioma. No drug related side effects were reported.&#xD;
      Nimotuzumab (hR3) in combination with radiotherapy for treatment of locally advanced squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinomas of the head and neck resulted in high rates of antitumor response, and was&#xD;
      accompanied by a favourable safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose-escalation study of Nimotuzumab. Nimotuzumab in combination with chemotherapy&#xD;
      will be administered to the patients with advanced NSCLC. The patients' blood test and liver&#xD;
      and renal function tests will be monitored weekly, a physical exam and reassessment of the&#xD;
      tumor will be performed and every 6 weeks. When the total result is the CR or PR, the results&#xD;
      of the 6th, 12th, 18th and the 22th week should be compared.&#xD;
