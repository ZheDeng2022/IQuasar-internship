  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' long-term goal is to identify, and then provide general practitioners with&#xD;
      evidence-based recommendations for therapeutic interventions for unexplained chronic fatigue&#xD;
      (UCF). The investigators' central hypothesis guiding this application is that some&#xD;
      complimentary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners have developed management&#xD;
      approaches that are more helpful to patients with UCF than usual care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An objective is to identify certain types of clinicians (or individual physicians) who appear&#xD;
      to have identified effective treatments for patients with UCF, or to find that clinicians who&#xD;
      report themselves to be effective are not. Study subjects will be UCF patients new to the&#xD;
      practice of one of four groups of participating clinicians: 1) a control group of MDs in&#xD;
      practice-based research networks, 2) MDs trained in CAM, 3) naturopathic doctors (non MDs&#xD;
      trained in special naturopathic schools), and 4) MDs who specialize in chronic fatigue. Our&#xD;
      rationale for this comparison is that its successful completion will potentially guide future&#xD;
      searches for effective medical strategies for the treatment of UCF that may have been&#xD;
      developed outside the mainstream medical community. It may also provide necessary information&#xD;
      for follow-up studies that will help to identify specific effective treatments. This&#xD;
      information includes which clinicians provide the best treatments (as evidenced by having&#xD;
      patients with the best results), what are the characteristics of patients who respond to a&#xD;
      particular treatment, how the data collection procedures might need to be refined and what&#xD;
      sample sizes are necessary.&#xD;

        The primary analyses will compare outcomes for 240 patients in four main groups (60 in each&#xD;
        group) defined by the background of the treating clinicians. Study subjects will be UCF&#xD;
        patients new to the practice of one of four groups of participating clinicians.&#xD;
