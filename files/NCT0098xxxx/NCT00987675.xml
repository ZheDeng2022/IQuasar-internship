      RATIONALE: High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation uses high-energy sound waves to kill&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of high-intensity focused&#xD;
      ultrasound ablation and to see how well it works in treating patients with progressive&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the side effects and patient-reported quality of life outcomes of the index&#xD;
           (largest) lesion treatment with high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation in patients&#xD;
           with progressive ≤ T3b, N0, M0 prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the success of this treatment by demonstrating the absence of cancer in the&#xD;
           treated or ablated area on the 6 month post-treatment transrectal ultrasound biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after index lesion ablation&#xD;
           treatment in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the proportion of these patients who, after undergoing index lesion control&#xD;
           treatment, require androgen blockade at the 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients undergo transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation (HIFU) to&#xD;
      the index lesion and other identifiable secondary lesions. Patients are evaluated at 6 months&#xD;
      and may repeat HIFU treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo MRI and ultrasound at baseline and periodically thereafter, and blood&#xD;
      samples are collected periodically for PSA, renal function, full blood count, and&#xD;
      testosterone levels. Patients also complete questionnaires (IPSS, IPSS-QOL, ICS, FACT-P, and&#xD;
      IIEF-5) at baseline; at 6 weeks; and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2 and 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 9,&#xD;
      and 12 months.&#xD;
