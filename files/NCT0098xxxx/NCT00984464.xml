  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to investigate whether intravenous administration of&#xD;
      REOLYSIN therapeutic virus in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin is effective and&#xD;
      safe in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most rapidly increasing cancers in the US and around the&#xD;
      world with an increase in incidence of about 3-7% per year for fair-skinned Caucasian&#xD;
      populations. An estimated 62,480 cases of invasive melanoma will be diagnosed in the US in&#xD;
      2008 with an estimated 8,420 deaths. An additional 46,170 cases of melanoma in situ are&#xD;
      predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melanoma that has spread to distant sites (stage IV) is rarely curable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 2 study is designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of REOLYSIN given&#xD;
      intravenously in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response is a primary endpoint of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue to receive chemotherapy in combination with REOLYSIN for up to 8 cycles&#xD;
      and may continue indefinitely on REOLYSIN monotherapy under this protocol, provided they have&#xD;
      not experienced either progressive disease or unacceptable drug-related toxicity that does&#xD;
      not respond to either supportive care or dose reduction.&#xD;
