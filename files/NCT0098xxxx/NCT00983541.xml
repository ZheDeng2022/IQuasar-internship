      OBJECTIVES: This study proposes to evaluate the feasibility of delivery of this treatment in&#xD;
      terms of toxicity. If toxicity is not acceptable, the treatment is not feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a preliminary assessment whether toxicity rates are acceptable in patients&#xD;
           with locally advanced intra or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma when treated with a&#xD;
           regimen of gemcitabine every two weeks and continuous fluorouracil (5-FU) given&#xD;
           concurrently with external beam radiation therapy to a total dose of 45 gray(Gy),&#xD;
           followed by a brachytherapy or Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy(SBRT) boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the overall survival rate, progression free survival rate, tumor response&#xD;
           rate, local control rate and the rate of distant metastases following gemcitabine and&#xD;
           continuous 5-FU concurrent with radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
           intra or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the rate at which patients with unresectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma&#xD;
           become resectable following gemcitabine and radiation therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cholangiocarcinoma is an uncommon tumor arising from the biliary tract. It can be stratified&#xD;
      into two categories based on location, intrahepatic and extrahepatic. In the United States,&#xD;
      approximately 4,000-5,000 cases of cholangiocarcinoma are diagnosed each year. The most&#xD;
      common location is at the bifurcation of the common hepatic duct and is classified as&#xD;
      extrahepatic, also known as a Klatskin tumor. Approximately 60-80% of tumors are found in&#xD;
      this perihilar location. A history of primary sclerosing cholangitis confers 10% lifetime&#xD;
      risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. Other known risk factors include ulcerative colitis,&#xD;
      liver fluke infestations, hepatolithiasis, thorotrast exposure and choledochal cysts.&#xD;
      Cholecystectomy decreases the risk. Most patients are lymph node positive at diagnosis,&#xD;
      approaching 55-60%, and less than half are resectable at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the rare nature of the tumor, there are limited prospective trials addressing the&#xD;
      roles for surgery, chemotherapy (CT) and radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma. Despite advances in surgical and radiotherapy techniques, the prognosis&#xD;
      for cholangiocarcinoma remains dismal. Historically, survival is poor with a 0-10% 5-year&#xD;
      survival. In more recent years, a median survival of 2-15 months is expected. Patients who&#xD;
      are able to undergo surgical resection at diagnosis have longer survival of approximately&#xD;
      20-24 months. Recent investigations in the area of neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by&#xD;
      orthotopic liver transplant in a select group of patients report promising results, with 1-,&#xD;
      3- and 5-year overall survival of 92%, 82% and 82%, respectively. Although this approach may&#xD;
      be appropriate for select patients, namely younger patients with small tumors, no or limited&#xD;
      nodal involvement, and no encasement of the major vasculature, the majority of patients&#xD;
      presenting with cholangiocarcinoma will present with unresectable disease at initial&#xD;
      diagnosis, often due to nodal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy The role of chemotherapy (CT) in cholangiocarcinoma has not been established.&#xD;
      Most chemotherapy trials have been small single institution phase II trials, and there have&#xD;
      been no large prospective randomized trials. Additionally, most chemotherapy trials include&#xD;
      patients with intrahepatic, extrahepatic and gallbladder carcinomas, as well as patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced and metastatic disease. Response rates have ranged from 0-40% with no&#xD;
      complete remissions. The most extensively investigated CT agent has been 5-fluorouracil&#xD;
      (5-FU), which has disappointing response rates of 9% as a single agent. Response rates were&#xD;
      not improved by the addition of streptozotocin or methyl-CCNU (Semustine) to 5-FU in a&#xD;
      randomized trial performed by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG).6 Multiple&#xD;
      combination CT regimens have been investigated in small clinical trials, and none have shown&#xD;
      a survival benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine has shown some promise as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma. A multicenter retrospective analysis out of Japan examining a multitude&#xD;
      of different CT regimens in patients with intrahepatic, extrahepatic or gallbladder&#xD;
      carcinomas reported gemcitabine was the most effective treatment, with a reduction in&#xD;
      mortality by about 50%.7 Fifty-eight patients of the 413 identified in this study were&#xD;
      treated with gemcitabine, 6.9% showed partial response, 50% remained stable, and 39.7%&#xD;
      progressed despite therapy. Median survival was 8.05 months with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.50&#xD;
      (95% confidence interval 0.35-0.72). Sixteen out of the 58 patients treated with gemcitabine&#xD;
      had extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In numerous phase II trials of gemcitabine as a single&#xD;
      agent, response rates have ranged from 6-30%, with greater than 50% of treated patients&#xD;
      having either a partial response or stable disease. 7-12 Median survival (MS) has ranged from&#xD;
      6.5-14 months in these trials. In 2008, guidelines for CT in biliary tract cancers were&#xD;
      published in the Journal of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery.13 Seven trials using&#xD;
      gemcitabine as a single agent were identified, with response rates ranging from 0-36% and MS&#xD;
      ranging from 4.6-14 months. In this article the use of gemcitabine in unresectable cancers of&#xD;
      the biliary tract was given a recommendation level C1, meaning that its use may be&#xD;
      considered, although there is a lack of high-level evidence.13&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of 5-FU or it's oral analog capecitabine and gemcitabine chemotherapy alone&#xD;
      (without radiation) in the advanced metastatic setting has improved response rates and median&#xD;
      overall survivals from around 10% or 6.1 months to 10-36% and 9.7 to 14 months&#xD;
      respectively.13a Based on this data it likely should have synergy if both agents are given&#xD;
      concurrently with external beam RT. The combination of continuous 5-FU and gemcitabine with&#xD;
      external beam radiation in locally advanced pancreatic cancer has been shown to be safe and&#xD;
      resulted in a complete response in 2 patients (6.3%), a partial response in 18 patients&#xD;
      (56.3%), with an overall all response rate of 62.5% 13b. Based on this data and the similar&#xD;
      dose of external RT therapy it seems reasonable and safe to combine the two agents 5-FU and&#xD;
      gemcitabine with RT in advanced cholangiocarcinoma. We chose to use 5-FU rather than oral&#xD;
      capecitabine due to occasional problems obtaining prescription coverage for this more&#xD;
      expensive alternative and the prior available safety data and our own institutional&#xD;
      experience using 5-FU and gemcitabine combination with RT for pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy Data for the use of radiation therapy (RT) alone in the setting of&#xD;
      unresectable disease is sparse. In a report from Johns Hopkins, a total of 23 patients were&#xD;
      treated with a surgical procedure followed by RT.14 Complete resection was accomplished in 14&#xD;
      of these patients and palliative stenting for 9. Postoperative RT doses ranging from 45-63 Gy&#xD;
      delivered by external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) followed by brachytherapy boost or EBRT&#xD;
      with cone down boost. RT had no effect on overall survival of patients who had undergone&#xD;
      complete resection or on patients who were being treated with palliative intent. Of note,&#xD;
      none of the patients in this study were treated with concurrent chemotherapy. The subgroup of&#xD;
      patients who were stented and then treated with palliative RT applies to our current&#xD;
      investigational study group, and in this subset of patients there was no survival benefit for&#xD;
      RT alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Because of the success of combined CT and RT in other&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancers, and the unsuccessful attempts at CT and RT alone, multimodality&#xD;
      treatment has been applied to cholangiocarcinoma. There is limited data on the use of EBRT in&#xD;
      combination with 5-FU specifically for extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In a retrospective&#xD;
      review, Kim et al looked at ≥40 Gy EBRT with concomitant bolus 5-FU (500mg/m2) for the first&#xD;
      3-days of each of two weeks of radiation, followed by monthly maintenance chemo with 5-FU for&#xD;
      one year.15 Eighty four patients were included, of which 72 had a gross total resection (47&#xD;
      negative margins, 25 microscopically positive margins) and the remaining 12 had palliative&#xD;
      procedures prior to the chemoradiation. The 5-year survival was 31%. Although this trial was&#xD;
      specifically looking at postoperative chemoradiotherapy, the subset of patients that did not&#xD;
      undergo gross total resection would apply to our study population. The 5-year actuarial&#xD;
      survival was 14% overall for this subgroup.&#xD;
