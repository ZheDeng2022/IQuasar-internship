    <textblock>
      Combination therapy with peginterferon plus ribavirin has become the current standard of care&#xD;
      for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients, with an overall sustained virologic response (SVR)&#xD;
      rate of 54-63%. Based on the ample evidence, a 48-week course of peginterferon plus&#xD;
      weight-based ribavirin therapy is widely recommended to treat HCV genotype 1 infection in&#xD;
      different parts of the world. Despite the increased SVR rates with the improved medical&#xD;
      therapies, about 25-50% and 10-20% of HCV genotype 1 and HCV genotype 2/3 patients may&#xD;
      experience relapse after the cessation of therapy with undetectable HCV viremia at the end of&#xD;
      treatment. Moreover, combination therapy is costly and may cause various adverse events.&#xD;
      Therefore, individualized therapy based on outcome analysis should be adopted to save medical&#xD;
      cost as well as to lessen inadequate treatment. Few studies are aimed to evaluate the host&#xD;
      responses of micro RNA regulation during interferon-based therapy and its relationships to&#xD;
      the overall treatment responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micro RNA (miRNA) is a single-stand RNA composed of 21-23 nucleotides, which may regulate the&#xD;
      function of messenger RNA (mRNA). The regulating mechanisms involving micro RNA between the&#xD;
      hosts and the HCV virus include (1) auto-regulation of HCV mRNA by HCV miRNA; (2) regulation&#xD;
      of host mRNA by HCV miRNA; and (3) regulation of HCV mRNA by host miRNA. MiR-122 is the&#xD;
      abundant liver-specific miRNA which is crucial for efficient HCV replication in culture Huh7&#xD;
      cells stably expressing HCV replicons. Recently, an in vivo study for hepatic miR-122 of 42&#xD;
      patients with CHC who received IFN-based therapy showed that patients who did not respond to&#xD;
      IFN therapy had markedly decreased pretreatment miR-122 levels. Although miR-122 is abundant&#xD;
      in the liver, liver biopsy is still considered an invasive procedure, which prevents its&#xD;
      widespread use in routine clinical practice. The miRNA can be detected in the sera and is&#xD;
      stable after 24 hours of room temperature store or repeated freezing and de-freezing. The&#xD;
      serum miR-122 levels can reflect the severity of liver injuries in a rat acetaminophen&#xD;
      toxicity model. Because miR-122 is liver specific and the miRNA is stable in the sera, the&#xD;
      investigators aimed to evaluate the role of serum and hepatic miR-122 on the viral kinetics&#xD;
      and the treatment responses and in HCV patients receiving peginterferon and ribavirin&#xD;
      combination therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) and liver transplantation, affects approximately 170 million individuals worldwide. In&#xD;
      Asian-Pacific regions, the prevalence of HCV infection ranges from 0.3-12%, with a&#xD;
      geographical variation. Therefore, prevention of HCV transmission and early intervention of&#xD;
      HCV infection are urgently needed to reduce or halt the liver-related morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination therapy with peginterferon plus ribavirin has become the current standard of care&#xD;
      for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients, with an overall sustained virologic response (SVR)&#xD;
      rate of 54-63%. Treatment with weekly peginterferon and weight-based ribavirin for 48 weeks&#xD;
      had a significantly higher SVR rate than that for 24 weeks in Caucasian patients with HCV&#xD;
      genotype 1 infection (52% to 42%). Based on ample evidence from Western countries, a 48-week&#xD;
      course of peginterferon plus weight-based ribavirin therapy is widely recommended to treat&#xD;
      HCV genotype 1 infection in different parts of the world. However, recent studies for Asian&#xD;
      CHC genotype 1 patients showed favorable treatment response to Caucasian patients with either&#xD;
      24 or 48 weeks of peginterferon plus weight-based ribavirin therapy (50 to 60% for 24 weeks;&#xD;
      75 to 80% for 48 weeks). In contrast, the overall SVR rates were similar across different&#xD;
      ethnicity in patients with HCV genotype 2/3 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the increased SVR rates with the improved medical therapies, about 25-50% and 10-20%&#xD;
      of HCV genotype 1 and HCV genotype 2/3 patients may experience relapse after the cessation of&#xD;
      therapy with undetectable HCV viremia at the end of treatment. Moreover, combination therapy&#xD;
      is costly and may cause various adverse events. Therefore, individualized therapy based on&#xD;
      outcome analysis should be adopted to save medical cost as well as to lessen inadequate&#xD;
      treatment. Currently, HCV viral kinetics is considered to predict treatment response.&#xD;
      Patients with rapid virologic response (RVR) are good predictors of SVR; those who fail to&#xD;
      achieve RVR but achieve complete or partial early virologic response (cEVR or pEVR) should be&#xD;
      put on prolonged therapy; those who fail to achieve EVR should be considered for treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation because of low chance for SVR. Various host and viral factors, including&#xD;
      race, gender, body weight, baseline viral load, and viral genotype, were considered to&#xD;
      predict RVR. However, few studies are aimed to evaluate the host responses of micro RNA&#xD;
      regulation during interferon-based therapy and its relationships to the overall treatment&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micro RNA (miRNA) is a single-stand RNA composed of 21-23 nucleotides, which may regulate the&#xD;
      function of massager RNA (mRNA). The regulating mechanisms involving micro RNA between the&#xD;
      hosts and the HCV virus include (1) auto-regulation of HCV mRNA by HCV miRNA; (2) regulation&#xD;
      of host mRNA by HCV miRNA; and (3) regulation of HCV mRNA by host miRNA. MiR-122 is the&#xD;
      abundant liver-specific miRNA which is crucial for efficient HCV replication in culture Huh7&#xD;
      cells stably expressing HCV replicons. This observation raised much interest in the role of&#xD;
      mir-122 in HCV infection and its potential as a therapeutic target. It was recently reported&#xD;
      that the levels of miR-122 and several other miRNAs are regulated by IFN in Huh7 cells and&#xD;
      primary mouse hepatocytes and that miRNAs might mediate at least some effects of IFN on HCV&#xD;
      RNA replication in vitro. Recently, an in vivo study for hepatic miR-122 of 42 patients with&#xD;
      CHC who received IFN-based therapy showed that patients who did not respond to IFN therapy&#xD;
      had markedly decreased pretreatment miR-122 levels. Although miR-122 is abundant in the&#xD;
      liver, liver biopsy is still considered an invasive procedure, which prevents its widespread&#xD;
      use in routine clinical practice. Considering the abundant blood flow through the liver, we&#xD;
      speculated that miR-122 can be detected in the sera, and can be used for screening and&#xD;
      monitoring the responses by serial blood tests. The miRNA can be detected in the sera and is&#xD;
      stable after 24 hours of room temperature store or repeated freezing and de-freezing. In&#xD;
      addition, miRNA is resistant to RNase and can be sustained for more than 10 years after&#xD;
      adequate freezing. Recent studies have shown the serum miRNA was potentially useful for the&#xD;
      detection of cancer and its treatment responses. Furthermore, the serum miR-122 levels can&#xD;
      reflect the severity of liver injuries in a rat acetaminophen toxicity model. Because miR-122&#xD;
      is liver specific and the miRNA is stable in the sera, the investigators aimed to evaluate&#xD;
      the role of serum and hepatic miR-122 on the viral kinetics and the treatment responses and&#xD;
      in HCV patients receiving peginterferon and ribavirin combination therapy.&#xD;
