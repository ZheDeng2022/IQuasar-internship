    <textblock>
      At least 60% of patients with constipation and dyssynergic defecation (anismus) and between&#xD;
      30-50% of patients with fecal incontinence exhibit impaired rectal sensation. The problem may&#xD;
      be improved by biofeedback therapy. Traditionally, biofeedback therapy was performed by using&#xD;
      a syringe-assisted technique. Although some respond to this method, many, particularly those&#xD;
      with severe rectal hyposensitivity have proved to be refractory. Also, repeated inflation and&#xD;
      deflation of a large volume of air, using a hand-held syringe is cumbersome and time&#xD;
      consuming. Recently, in pilot observations, the investigators have seen that a&#xD;
      barostat-assisted technique of biofeedback therapy was simpler and easier to perform and&#xD;
      could possibly be more effective. The investigators' aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To perform a randomized controlled study that compares the syringe-assisted sensory&#xD;
           conditioning (biofeedback therapy) technique with the barostat assisted sensory&#xD;
           conditioning for improving the rectal sensation in patients with rectal hyposensitivity&#xD;
           and bowel dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the impact of sensory conditioning on psychosocial issues and quality of&#xD;
           life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the cost-effectiveness of each therapeutic modality The specific hypotheses&#xD;
           that will be tested are;&#xD;
&#xD;
      When compared to those who receive syringe-assisted training, patients receiving barostat&#xD;
      training will demonstrate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lower sensory thresholds for rectal perception (first sensation, desire to defecate and&#xD;
           urgency)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Greater satisfaction with bowel function (VAS Score), stool frequency,consistency &amp;&#xD;
           straining.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Better learning ability and greater ease of administering this training.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients categorized as having dyssynergic defecation or slow transit constipation or&#xD;
             normal transit constipation will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must demonstrate rectal hyposensitivity during a manometry with values&#xD;
             that are outside 2 S.D. of normal range and demonstrate any two of the following: a)&#xD;
             Threshold for 1st sensation &gt; 40 cc. b) Threshold for desire to defecate &gt; 130 cc. c)&#xD;
             Threshold for urgency to defecate &gt;180 cc.&#xD;
