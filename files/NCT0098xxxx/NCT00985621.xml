        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Score at Week 8: ITT Population</title>
        <description>The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis (OA) in the index joint (knee/hip) during past 48 hours. It is calculated as the mean of the scores from the 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher pain.</description>

        <description>The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in the index joint (knee/hip) during past 48 hours. It is calculated as the mean of the scores from the 17 individual questions scored on an NRS of 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate worse function. Total score range for WOMAC physical function subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate worse function. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With At Least (&gt;=) 30 Percent (%), 50%, 70% and 90% Reduction From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Score at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16: ITT Population</title>
        <description>The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA in the index joint (knee/hip) during past 48 hours. It is calculated as the mean of the scores from the 5 individual questions scored on an NRS of 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher pain.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With At Least (&gt;=) 30 Percent (%), 50%, 70% and 90% Reduction From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Score at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16: ITT Population</title>
          <description>The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA in the index joint (knee/hip) during past 48 hours. It is calculated as the mean of the scores from the 5 individual questions scored on an NRS of 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher pain.</description>
          <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized intravenous study medication (either tanezumab or placebo). Missing data were imputed using LOCF.</population>

It is calculated as the mean of the scores from the 5 individual questions scored on an NRS of 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher pain. Participants with specified reduction (as percent) from baseline at Week 8 are reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Pain Score in the Index Knee or Index Hip at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16: ITT Population</title>
        <description>Participants assessed daily average pain in the index joint (knee/hip) during the past 24 hours on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Higher score indicated greater pain. The baseline mean was calculated using the daily pain scores in the index joint (knee/hip) over the 3 days in the initial pain assessment period and the weekly mean was calculated using the daily pain scores in the index joint (knee/hip) within each assessment week.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Stiffness Subscale Score at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16: ITT Population</title>
        <description>The WOMAC stiffness subscale is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to OA in the index joint (knee/hip) during past 48 hours. It is calculated as the mean of the scores from the 2 individual questions scored on NRS of 0 to 10; with higher scores indicating more stiffness. Total score range for WOMAC stiffness subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate more stiffness. Stiffness is defined as a sensation of decreased ease in moving the index joint (knee/hip).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Physical and Mental Component Aggregate Scores at Week 12: ITT Population</title>
        <description>SF-36v2: standardized survey evaluating 8 health concepts (physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health). Total score for each health concept was scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). For obtaining physical and mental component scores, z-score for each scale = (observed score - mean score for general 1990 United States [US] population)/corresponding standard deviation. The 2 component scores were obtained by multiplying each aspect z-score by physical or mental factor score coefficient (1990 general US population) and summing the eight products. Component scores indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive z-score [better functioning])/lower (in case of negative z-score [worse functioning]) participant's value was relative to the mean of the reference population. Change from baseline &gt;0 indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Physical and Mental Component Aggregate Scores at Week 12: mITT Population</title>
        <description>SF-36v2: standardized survey evaluating 8 health concepts (physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health). Total score for each health concept was scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). For obtaining physical and mental component scores, z-score for each scale = (observed score - mean score for general 1990 United States [US] population)/corresponding standard deviation. The 2 component scores were obtained by multiplying each aspect z-score by physical or mental factor score coefficient (1990 general US population) and summing the eight products. Component scores indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive z-score [better functioning])/lower (in case of negative z-score [worse functioning]) participant's value was relative to the mean of the reference population. Change from baseline &gt;0 indicates an improvement.</description>

        <population>mITT analysis set included all participants in ITT analysis set who had Week 8 visit on or before 23 June 2010 (effective date of the US FDA imposed clinical hold). Missing data were imputed using BOCF.</population>

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains/items: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. Each item has 3 possible responses: no problems (level 1), some problems (level 2), and extreme problems (level 3). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Euro Quality of Life-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) - Health State Profile Utility Score at Week 12: mITT Population</title>
          <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains/items: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. Each item has 3 possible responses: no problems (level 1), some problems (level 2), and extreme problems (level 3). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Euro Quality of Life-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) - Individual Dimensions at Week 12: mITT Population</title>
        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 dimensions/domains/items: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. Each item has 3 possible responses: no dysfunction (level 1), moderate/some dysfunction (level 2), and extreme dysfunction (level 3). Change from baseline at Week 12 is defined as: Improved (positive change), No change, and Worsened (negative change). Number of participants with response is reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>mITT analysis set. Here 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies participants who were evaluable for this measure and 'number anlayzed' signifies participants who were evaluable at specified time-point for each treatment arm, respectively.</population>

          <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Euro Quality of Life-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) - Individual Dimensions at Week 12: mITT Population</title>
          <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 dimensions/domains/items: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. Each item has 3 possible responses: no dysfunction (level 1), moderate/some dysfunction (level 2), and extreme dysfunction (level 3). Change from baseline at Week 12 is defined as: Improved (positive change), No change, and Worsened (negative change). Number of participants with response is reported.</description>
          <population>mITT analysis set. Here 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies participants who were evaluable for this measure and 'number anlayzed' signifies participants who were evaluable at specified time-point for each treatment arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 18</title>
        <description>NIS: 74 items, assess muscle weakness, reflexes and sensation; scored separately for left, right limbs (37 items for each side). Components of muscle weakness are 24 items and scored on scale 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis), higher score=greater weakness. Components of reflexes and sensation are 13 items and scored 0 = normal, 1= decreased, or 2 = absent. Total NIS score is the sum of the left and right limb scores. Total possible NIS score range 0 to 244, higher score=greater impairment.</description>
