      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of indapamide SR 1.5 mg on blood pressure,&#xD;
      blood tests (glucose metabolism, lipids, minerals, and uric acid), cardiac function,&#xD;
      endothelial and arterial function, by comparison with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, in patients&#xD;
      with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In order to achieve a better control of blood&#xD;
      pressure in these patients, each diuretic treatments will be added to an ACE inhibitor&#xD;
      (quinapril 10-40 mg/day). Therefore, eventually, the study will provide data on the&#xD;
      comparison between combination indapamide SR 1.5 mg + quinapril versus hydrochlorothiazide 25&#xD;
      mg + quinapril.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypertension treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is still a difficult&#xD;
      clinical problem. New European and American guidelines recommend a target blood pressure of&#xD;
      less than 130/80 mmHg. Indeed, it was shown by the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study (HOT&#xD;
      study) that reducing diastolic blood pressure to 81 mm Hg instead of 84 mm Hg, the number of&#xD;
      major cardiovascular events is reduced by 51%. However, only 25% of the patients with&#xD;
      hypertension and diabetes reach the target of 130/80 mm Hg in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
      Therefore, combination therapy is always recommended (8, 9). This should include a diuretic;&#xD;
      however, none of the two guidelines makes any recommendations regarding which is the best&#xD;
      diuretic therapy in hypertensive patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indapamide is a diuretic with special characteristics, which was shown in experimental&#xD;
      studies to provide cardio- and renal- protection in hypertensive patients. In the same time&#xD;
      it has similar antihypertensive effects with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Intrinsic&#xD;
      mechanisms are probably related to the antioxidant properties, and also to the action on the&#xD;
      calcium channels. Moreover, when compared with hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide has no adverse&#xD;
      effects on lipid metabolism and seems to have no negative impact on the renal function.&#xD;
      However, a recent study in patients with hypertension and diabetes suggested no superiority&#xD;
      of indapamide over hydrochorothiazide on different metabolic parameters. Therefore, new&#xD;
      research looking in more detail to the comparison between the two diuretics is mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of indapamide SR 1.5 mg on blood pressure,&#xD;
      blood tests (glucose metabolism, lipids, minerals, and uric acid), cardiac function,&#xD;
      endothelial and arterial function, by comparison with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, in patients&#xD;
      with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In order to achieve a better control of blood&#xD;
      pressure in these patients, each diuretic treatments will be added to an ACE inhibitor&#xD;
      (quinapril 10-40 mg/day). Therefore, eventually, the study will provide data on the&#xD;
      comparison between combination indapamide SR 1.5 mg + quinapril versus hydrochlorothiazide 25&#xD;
      mg + quinapril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to a Prospective, parallel, Randomized,&#xD;
      active-controlled, Open, Blinded Endpoint evaluation (PROBE design), in one centre, in at&#xD;
      least 50 male and female patients with mild to moderate hypertension and type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, for a total period of 18 months (12 months of enrollment and 6 months follow-up).&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 using a&#xD;
      permuted block design. They will receive an ascending number from 1 to 50. The&#xD;
      investigator(s) performing and analyzing the echocardiograms, and the central laboratory&#xD;
      measuring the BNP blood tests will be blinded to the patient medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either indapamide prolonged-release 1.5 mg/day or&#xD;
      hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day, given orally. Quinapril will be added from the beginning of&#xD;
      the study to allow consistent blood pressure control. Dose of quinapril will be titrated from&#xD;
      10 mg/day to 15 mg/day, and then to 20 mg/day, and up to 40 mg/day, as needed for the blood&#xD;
      pressure control. The treatment will be administered to randomized patients for 6 months.&#xD;
      Assignment of the study medication will be performed through randomization process. The&#xD;
      patients will receive the medication from the Investigator/Co-investigator at every visit&#xD;
      scheduled; they will be asked to return, at every visit scheduled, the unused medication and&#xD;
      the empty boxes, in order to verify their compliance to the treatment. A treatment compliance&#xD;
      of 80-120% is considered satisfactory for the study. If compliance is out of the limits&#xD;
      mentioned above, the investigator can decide withdrawal of the patient from the study. In&#xD;
      exceptional situations, the treatment can be interrupted for a period of maximum 3 days,&#xD;
      without withdrawal of the patient from the study. The administration of the study medication&#xD;
      will be documented in appropriate source documents and in the CRF and certified by the&#xD;
      Investigator.&#xD;
