      The aim of this study focuses on obtaining accurate information on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      interventions involving physical activity and/or nutrition education developed in the school&#xD;
      environment. This study is intended to assist in future assembly and development of effective&#xD;
      school practices related to preventing and reducing levels of overweight in children and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;

      Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, SPORTDiscus)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1,228 were excluded as duplicates by Eppi Reviewer&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The inordinate increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity at the international&#xD;
      level today is one of the targets of concern the department of public health, and gradually&#xD;
      has been the focus of many studies and interventions which emphasize the need for more&#xD;
      evidence to clear and effective its prevention and reduction. Obesity can affect the short or&#xD;
      long term health of individuals, through problems such as left ventricular hypertrophy in&#xD;
      young-adult and atherosclerosis, which is due to the formation of plaques of fat in the&#xD;
      arterial wall and may lead to coronary artery disease , cerebrovascular disease and&#xD;
      peripheral vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The promotion of regular practice of physical activity through physical education school can&#xD;
      be an effective way to prevent obesity among children, especially girls. There is an inverse&#xD;
      relationship between physical activity and incidence of hypertension. The earlier the&#xD;
      entrance to the practice of physical activities, there will be more effective in combating&#xD;
      the increase in body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition Education is to extend the knowledge on nutrition and the ability to understand the&#xD;
      practices and eating behavior, improving the relationship of the individual in the&#xD;
      environment which is introduced, allowing the taking of decisions under the situation&#xD;
      presented.&#xD;
