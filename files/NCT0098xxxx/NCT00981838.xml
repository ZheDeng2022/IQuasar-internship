      Background. Patients, especially children, with steroid-dependent or multirelapsing nephrotic&#xD;
      syndrome (NS) secondary to minimal change disease (MCD) or idiopathic focal and segmental&#xD;
      glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) on continuous treatment with steroids and/or other&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents to limit or prevent recurrences are at increased risk of severe&#xD;
      drug-related adverse events. Case reports suggest that Rituximab, a B cell depleting&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody, could be a safe and effective alternative to steroid or&#xD;
      immunosuppressants to achieve and maintain remission in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The study is primarily aimed at evaluating whether Rituximab may maintain stable&#xD;
      NS remission after tapering and withdrawal of steroid and immunosuppressive therapy in&#xD;
      patients with MCD or FSGS and steroid-dependent or multirelapsing NS. Secondarily, the study&#xD;
      will assess whether Rituximab allows reducing maintenance doses of steroids and other&#xD;
      immunosuppressants (in those who relapse), thus limiting treatment related side effects and&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. This prospective, sequential, open, study will include 20 patients with histology&#xD;
      evidence of MCD or FSGS and steroid-dependant or multirelapsing NS, who are on stable&#xD;
      complete or partial remission since at least 1 month and, based on their previous history,&#xD;
      are expected to invariably relapse after steroid/immunosuppression withdrawal. After baseline&#xD;
      evaluation of clinical, laboratory and kidney function parameters [including glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), albumin and sodium fractional clearance and&#xD;
      the glomerular albumin permeability assay (Palb)], patients will receive one Rituximab&#xD;
      infusion that will be repeated 1 week later if CD20 cells are not fully depleted from the&#xD;
      circulation. Then ongoing immunosuppression will be progressively tapered up to complete&#xD;
      withdrawal over 6 to 9 months. 24h proteinuria will be monitored monthly and spot urine will&#xD;
      be tested daily by albustix to early detect disease relapses. Baseline evaluations will be&#xD;
      repeated at study end (1 year). Relapses will be treated with high-dose steroids as per&#xD;
      center practice and the last immunosuppressive therapy effective in preventing disease&#xD;
      reactivation will be reintroduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. Rituximab is expected to prevent NS recurrence following tapering and&#xD;
      discontinuation of steroid and other immunosuppressants. Maintaining remission without&#xD;
      chronic immunosuppression is expected to minimize risks and costs of therapy and to&#xD;
      remarkably improve patient outcomes.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Nephrotic syndrome (NS)affects 2 every 100,000 children younger than 16 years.&#xD;
      Minimal change disease (MCD) accounts for around 90 percent of cases and most of the&#xD;
      remaining ones are associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Patients with&#xD;
      NS are at increased risk for life-threatening infections and thromboembolic episodes, and are&#xD;
      often affected by dyslipidemia and osteoporosis. Glucocorticoids are first-line treatment and&#xD;
      may achieve remission in about 90% of patients with MCD and in 20 to 60% of those with FSGS.&#xD;
      In about 20% to 60% of those achieving remission, however, steroid withdrawal is followed by&#xD;
      a recurrence of the disease. These patients require chronic steroid therapy&#xD;
      (steroid-dependent cases): this prevents relapses in most cases but is invariably associated&#xD;
      with severe adverse effects including growth retardation, infections, malignancies,&#xD;
      hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, weight gain and somatic changes. In a small&#xD;
      proportion of patients, recurrences occur even under chronic steroid therapy (multirelapsing&#xD;
      cases). In these cases, several approaches have been used to control disease activity&#xD;
      including plasmapheresis and add-on therapy with cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine,&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil and other immunosuppressants. Chronic immunosuppression, however,&#xD;
      seldom achieves persistent remission and is invariably burdened by serious adverse effects&#xD;
      including gonadotoxicity and sterility, opportunistic infections, malignancies, bone marrow&#xD;
      depression and renal toxicity. Thus, safer and more effective treatments are urgently needed&#xD;
      for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeted to the CD20 antigen of B cells able to&#xD;
      induce antibody-dependent and complement-mediated lysis of these cells, has been reported to&#xD;
      be effective in children with NS secondary to MCD or FSGS unresponsive to other&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatments. Rituximab achieved persistent NS remission in a patient with&#xD;
      MCD diagnosed at age of 30 yrs who had a history of frequent relapses refractory to treatment&#xD;
      with other immunosuppressants. Thus, chronic MCD persisting into adult-years may respond to&#xD;
      rituximab and sustained remissions are possible despite long-term disease and after other&#xD;
      treatments have failed. Along the same line, rituximab achieved prompt and persistent&#xD;
      remission in an adult with steroid and mycophenolate mofetil-resistant MCD and in two&#xD;
      patients with FSGS and steroid-resistant NS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above findings suggest that rituximab may have a role in the treatment of patients who&#xD;
      require chronic exposure to steroids and/or other immunosuppressants to prevent or limit&#xD;
      disease reactivation. Thus, main goal of the present study is to assess whether rituximab&#xD;
      administration may allow tapering and withdrawing ongoing treatment without exposing the&#xD;
      patients to the risk of disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether Rituximab therapy is able to prevent NS recurrence after complete&#xD;
           withdrawal of steroids and other immunosuppressive treatments in patients with&#xD;
           steroid-dependant or multirelapsing NS on sustained remission for at least 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether Rituximab therapy may reduce the need for steroids and other&#xD;
           immunosuppressive agents to prevent and treat further disease relapses;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether tapering or withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapy is associated&#xD;
           with regression of the related toxicities, such as growth retardation, hypertension,&#xD;
           impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether persistent NS remission is associated with an improvement of kidney&#xD;
           function and of renal hemodynamics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study whether proteinuria remission is associated with the disappearance of albumin&#xD;
           permeability factor(s) from patient's sera;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety profile of the rituximab treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the cost/effectiveness of the study treatment.&#xD;
