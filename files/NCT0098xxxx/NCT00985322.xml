    <textblock>
      Background: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a specific cardioprotective&#xD;
      effect and, compared to treatment not directly interfering with the renin-angiotensin-system&#xD;
      (RAS), significantly reduce cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity in subjects with&#xD;
      normal renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite CV events are the leading cause of death in these patients, no adequately powered&#xD;
      trial so far evaluated the specific cardioprotective effect of ACE inhibitors in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This prospective, randomized, open label, blinded end point (PROBE) trial is&#xD;
      primarily aimed at evaluating whether, at comparable blood pressure (BP) control, ACE&#xD;
      inhibitor as compared to non-RAS inhibitor therapy significantly reduces the incidence of a&#xD;
      composite end point of CV death (including sudden death) and non-fatal myocardial infarction&#xD;
      or stroke in 266 patients with arterial hypertension (pre-dialysis systolic/diastolic BP&#xD;
      &gt;140/90 mmHg or post-dialysis systolic/diastolic BP &gt;130/80 mmHg or antihypertensive therapy)&#xD;
      and/or echocardiography evidence of LVH (cardiac mass index &gt;130 g/m2 for men and 100 g/m2&#xD;
      for women) who are on dialysis therapy since at least six months. Secondarily, the study will&#xD;
      compare the incidence of single components of the primary outcome, new onset paroxysmal or&#xD;
      persistent atrial fibrillation, thrombosis of the artero-venous fistula, new onset,&#xD;
      progression or regression of LVH, changes in components of the metabolic syndrome, the safety&#xD;
      profile of the two treatment regimens and their cost/effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: After 1 month wash-out period from previous RAS inhibitor therapy and a baseline&#xD;
      evaluation of main clinical and laboratory parameters, patients will be randomized on a 1:1&#xD;
      basis to 2-year treatment with an ACE inhibitor or a BP lowering regiment not including RAS&#xD;
      inhibitors. A balanced distribution according to centre, number of dialysis sessions per week&#xD;
      (2 or 3), presence of diabetes (YES/NO), arterial hypertension (YES/NO), LVH (YES/NO) will be&#xD;
      achieved by the minimization method. Treatment will be adjusted to achieve and maintain a&#xD;
      target BP &lt;140/90 mmHg (pre-dialysis) and a target BP &lt;130/80 mmHg (post-dialysis) in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: ACE inhibitor compared to non-RAS inhibitor therapy is expected to reduce&#xD;
      more effectively fatal and non-fatal CV events, prevent or limit progression or induce&#xD;
      regression of LVH, improve some components of the metabolic syndrome, and reduce treatment&#xD;
      costs for cardiovascular complications. These findings might help achieving more effective&#xD;
      cardioprotection in people on chronic dialysis at lower costs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have the broader effect of any drug in&#xD;
      cardiovascular medicine, reducing the risk of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes,&#xD;
      and renal impairment.A recent meta-analysis of 33,500 patients included in six randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials and a pooled analysis of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE), the&#xD;
      European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery&#xD;
      Disease (EUROPA, and the Prevention of Events with Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme Inhibition&#xD;
      (PEACE) trials showed that ACE inhibitors reduce mortality and cardiovascular events also in&#xD;
      subjects with coronary artery disease but preserved left ventricular function. However, all&#xD;
      the above studies excluded patients with advanced renal insufficiency or end stage renal&#xD;
      disease (ESRD). Thus, whether ACE inhibitors may have a specific cardioprotective effect also&#xD;
      in this typology of patients is still matter of investigation. This is an issue of major&#xD;
      clinical relevance since CV disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in the&#xD;
      ESRD population and affects as many as 50-60% of ESRD patients.The burden of CV disease in&#xD;
      this population is predicted to dramatically increase over the next few years because of the&#xD;
      rapidly increasing number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy and the increasing&#xD;
      prevalence of ESRD patients at increased cardiovascular risk because of older age, diabetes&#xD;
      and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the excess CV risk, a consistent proportion of ESRD patients are not given ACE&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy because of concern of hyperkalemia. Others, on the contrary, are treated on&#xD;
      the basis of results of available trials. However, whether data in subjects without renal&#xD;
      insufficiency can be generalized also to those with ESRD is unknown. This is an itchy point&#xD;
      since dialysis patients might respond differently to therapies of proven benefits in non-ESRD&#xD;
      patients. For instance, data from the German Diabetes and Dialysis study showed that, unlike&#xD;
      in the general population, HmGCoA inhibitor therapy failed to decrease CV mortality in a&#xD;
      hemodialysis population. Thus, ad hoc studies in the ESRD population are urgently needed. A&#xD;
      recent trial, the Fosinopril in Dialysis (FOSIDIAL) study, tried to address this issue, but&#xD;
      was clearly underpowered and results were inconclusive. However, evidence of a non&#xD;
      significant trend to less cardiovascular events in the ACE inhibitor arm, suggests that ACE&#xD;
      inhibitors might have a specific cardioprotective effect also in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, whether ACE inhibitor therapy more effectively than non-RAS inhibitor therapy reduces&#xD;
      CV morbidity in high risk patients on chronic dialysis therapy is worth investigating in an&#xD;
      adequately powered trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad aim of the study is to evaluate whether ACE inhibitor therapy reduces CV mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity in high-risk ESRD patients with arterial hypertension and/or LVH who are on&#xD;
      chronic hemodialysis therapy since &gt;6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether, at comparable BP control, ACE inhibitor as compared to non-RAS&#xD;
           inhibitor therapy reduces the incidence of a combined end-point of CV death (including&#xD;
           sudden cardiac death and cardiac arrest resuscitation) and myocardial infarction or&#xD;
           non-fatal stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the incidence of the single components of the combined end-point, of&#xD;
           myocardial or peripheral revascularizations, new onset of atrial fibrillation in one of&#xD;
           its three forms (paroxysmal, persistent and permanent) or recurrence of the arrhythmia&#xD;
           in patients who experienced paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation previously,&#xD;
           hospitalizations for chronic heart failure and thrombosis of the artero-venous fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether ACE inhibitors prevent, limit progression or achieve regression of&#xD;
           LVH and ameliorate some of the components of the metabolic syndrome and whether these&#xD;
           effects correlates with CV outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the cost/effectiveness of the two treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious (including disturbances of cardiac rhythm and electrical conduction possibly&#xD;
           related to hyperkalemia) and non-serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any clinical or laboratory abnormality -such as symptomatic hypotension, cough,&#xD;
           hyperkalemia (serum potassium &gt;6 mEq/L), anemia requiring increasing doses of&#xD;
           erythropoietin- possibly related to ACE inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized, open label, blinded end point (PROBE) trial will include 266&#xD;
      hypertensive ESRD patients with echocardiography evidence of LVH who are on chronic&#xD;
      hemodialysis since &gt;6 months. After 1 month wash-out period from previous RAS inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy and stratification for diabetes YES/NO, they will have a baseline evaluation of main&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory parameters and will be randomized to 2-year treatment with an ACE&#xD;
      inhibitor or a BP lowering regimen not including RAS inhibitors. Treatment will be adjusted&#xD;
      to achieve and maintain a target BP &lt;140/90 mmHg (pre-dialysis) and a target BP &lt;130/80 mmHg&#xD;
      (post-dialysis) in both groups.&#xD;
