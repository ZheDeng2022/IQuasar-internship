  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the highest tolerable dose of irinotecan&#xD;
      that can be given directly into the liver, in combination with other drugs given by vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other drug combinations given by vein include bevacizumab alone, bevacizumab plus&#xD;
      oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab plus cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be tested in patients with advanced solid tumors that have spread to the liver. The&#xD;
      safety of these drug combinations will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irinotecan is designed to stop cancer cells from making new DNA (the genetic material of&#xD;
      cells). This may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the&#xD;
      growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients necessary for tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin is designed to block new cancer cells from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking proteins&#xD;
      inside cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arms and Dose Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, your doctor will assign you to a&#xD;
      study arm. Your study arm will depend on the type of cancer, your Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS)&#xD;
      test result (if applicable), and the drugs you have taken in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Arm A, you will receive irinotecan and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Arm B, you will receive irinotecan, bevacizumab, and oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Arm C, you will receive irinotecan, bevacizumab, and cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose that you receive will depend on when you are enrolled in this study and the safety&#xD;
      data that is available at that time. The first set of 3-6 participants to join each study arm&#xD;
      will receive the lowest dose of the drug combination. The next set of 3-6 participants will&#xD;
      receive a higher dose of the drug combination. Each new set of participants will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will&#xD;
      continue until the highest tolerable dose of the drug combinations is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose is found for each arm, 14 participants with the tumor type&#xD;
      that has responded well to a particular study drug combination will receive the study drugs&#xD;
      at that dose level. These participants will be in the &quot;expansion&quot; arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter Placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be hospitalized to receive the study drug combination. The morning after you enter&#xD;
      the hospital, you will have a catheter placed in your right groin area. A catheter is a&#xD;
      sterile flexible tube. It will be placed into a large artery (the blood vessel that carries&#xD;
      blood to your liver) while the area is numbed with local anesthetic. Your doctor will explain&#xD;
      this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be asked to sign a separate consent form&#xD;
      for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you return to your room, you will receive irinotecan as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study &quot;cycles&quot; will be repeated every 28 days. The catheter will be placed and removed during&#xD;
      each cycle. Each time, you will lie in bed for the entire time that the catheter is in place.&#xD;
      While the catheter is being removed, the study staff will apply pressure to your groin area&#xD;
      for 15 minutes to stop the bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irinotecan will be given through the catheter into your liver artery, continuously for&#xD;
      48hours (Days 1 through 2 of each cycle). Before every irinotecan dose, you will also receive&#xD;
      drugs by vein to lower the risk of nausea, if your doctor thinks this is needed for routine&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab will be given by vein once every 2 weeks. The first time you receive bevacizumab,&#xD;
      it will be given over 90 minutes. If you tolerate it well, all other bevacizumab doses will&#xD;
      be given over 30-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin, if you receive it, will be given by vein over 2 hours once every 2 weeks. Before&#xD;
      every oxaliplatin dose, you will also receive drugs by vein to lower the risk of nausea, if&#xD;
      your doctor thinks this is needed for routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab, if you receive it, will be given by vein once every 2 weeks. The first time you&#xD;
      receive cetuximab, it will be given over 2 hours. All other cetuximab doses will be given&#xD;
      over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you do not tolerate the study drug combination well, the doses that you receive may be&#xD;
      lowered. If you experience certain side effects, your study drug doses may be delayed and the&#xD;
      study cycle may be longer than 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given standard drugs (heparin and diphenhydramine) to help decrease the risk of&#xD;
      side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and&#xD;
      their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be in the hospital for about 5-7 days at the beginning of every cycle, until you&#xD;
      recover from side effects that may occur. You will be seen by a doctor or &quot;advanced practice&quot;&#xD;
      nurse every day while you are in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of each cycle and then once a week during each cycle, blood (about 1&#xD;
      tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. At the beginning of each cycle and then once&#xD;
      every 4 weeks (or earlier if needed), you will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have scans such as a chest x-ray, CT, MRI, and/or PET scan after every 2 cycles (8&#xD;
      weeks) or earlier if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, or the cancer gets&#xD;
      worse. These scans are to check the status of the disease. If the study doctor thinks it is&#xD;
      more appropriate for you, other types of scans may need to be performed. The study doctor&#xD;
      will discuss these scans with you, and you may be asked to sign a separate consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Tests/Procedures for Some Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you experience severe diarrhea and/or low white blood cell counts while on this study,&#xD;
      blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test your DNA to find out if you may be at a&#xD;
      higher risk of side effects from irinotecan. If the test shows that you may have a higher&#xD;
      risk, then you will receive irinotecan at a lower dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Arm C (which as discussed above, does not include colorectal cancer patients&#xD;
      with a KRAS mutation), a leftover sample of tumor tissue will be tested for the KRAS&#xD;
      mutation. If no leftover tumor tissue from an earlier procedure is available, and if your&#xD;
      KRAS status is unknown, you will have a needle biopsy of a tumor performed. The tissue will&#xD;
      be tested for the KRAS mutation. This procedure will be done on an appropriate tumor area&#xD;
      that is able to be biopsied, and it may or may not be the liver tumor. This will be the&#xD;
      doctor's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may stay on study for as long as the disease has not gotten worse, the cancer has not&#xD;
      gone away completely, and you have not experienced intolerable side effects. In any of those&#xD;
      cases, you would be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 28 days after your last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-study visit. At&#xD;
      this visit, the following tests and procedures may be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an x-ray, CT scan, PET scan, or -MRI&#xD;
           scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. It is investigational to give irinotecan into a liver&#xD;
      artery. The study drug combinations and dose levels are also investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drugs are commercially available and FDA approved to treat the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Irinotecan by vein -- colorectal cancer that is metastatic (has spread).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bevacizumab -- metastatic colorectal cancer, breast cancer, non small-cell lung cancer,&#xD;
           and a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cetuximab -- colorectal cancer, and head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxaliplatin -- colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 140 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
