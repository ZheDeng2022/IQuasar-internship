    <textblock>
      The Acute Pain Service (APS) at Sunnybrook has been using Gabapentin 200 mg three times a day&#xD;
      (TID) resulting in anecdotal benefits in terms of analgesia and opioid sparing effects.&#xD;
      Higher doses of Gabapentin were associated with an increased incidence of sedation. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to investigate if Gabapentin 200 mg given three times a day for 72&#xD;
      hours (9doses) results in a reduction in the total amount of opioid required after radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy surgery as compared to placebo, and if analgesia is improved. This study will&#xD;
      also examine the possible anxiety sparing effects and any health related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQL) changes, which may be a result of our perioperative use of gabapentin.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gabapentin Gabapentin is an anti-epileptic agent originally developed to treat spasticity&#xD;
      (1), and eventually was found to be effective against chronic neuropathic pain (1,2).&#xD;
      Gabapentin is available as an oral preparation and is primarily absorbed in the small&#xD;
      intestine (1). Gabapentin is not metabolized in humans and is eliminated unchanged via the&#xD;
      kidneys. It has no known drug-drug interactions, but it is reported that antacids can reduce&#xD;
      the bioavailability of Gabapentin by about 20%, and Cimetidine can decrease the clearance of&#xD;
      Gabapentin from the body by about 12% (1,2). Side effects of Gabapentin tend to be mild with&#xD;
      somnolence (20%), dizziness (18%), ataxia (13%), and fatigue (11%) being the most common (1).&#xD;
      The exact mechanism of Gabapentin in pain management is unknown, but it has demonstrated&#xD;
      inhibition of mechanical hyperalgesia, and mechanical/thermal allodynia in those with&#xD;
      neuropathic pain (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 5 years, there have been 20 studies examining the effect of Gabapentin on&#xD;
      postoperative pain (1 &amp; 3-22). All but one of these studies (16) has found that Gabapentin&#xD;
      demonstrated a significant reduction in the amount of postoperative opioid required (16-67%)&#xD;
      and a simultaneous reduction in pain scores. There was no difference in side effect profile&#xD;
      between the Gabapentin and the control groups in 11 studies(3-5,7,8,10,14-16,18,20), while&#xD;
      one(18) found a higher incidence of nausea and urinary retention in the control groups, and&#xD;
      two studies(11,13) found a higher incidence of nausea/vomiting in the Gabapentin group. The&#xD;
      most common side effect of increased sedation was found in only 4 studies when doses greater&#xD;
      than 900 mg per day were given (9,11-13). The daily dose of postoperative Gabapentin in the&#xD;
      current protocol is 200 mg TID (600 mg/day) which we currently use in our clinical population&#xD;
      with minimal side effect issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been 8 studies looking at the administration of Gabapentin in the postoperative&#xD;
      period (4,6-8,11,20,22,23). Fassoulaki and colleagues (6) examined pain scores and opioid&#xD;
      consumption in postoperative breast cancer patients. Seventy-five patients undergoing surgery&#xD;
      for breast cancer were randomized to receive Mexiletine 600 mg/day, Gabapentin 1200 mg/day or&#xD;
      placebo for 10 days. Opioid consumption was reduced by 50% in the Gabapentin and Mexiletine&#xD;
      groups vs. the placebo group on days 2-10. Only the Gabapentin group had decreased pain after&#xD;
      movement from the 2nd to the 5th postoperative day. There were no adverse effects reported in&#xD;
      the Gabapentin group. Dierking and his colleagues randomized 80 patients to receive either&#xD;
      1200 mg of Gabapentin or placebo 1 hr preoperatively, then either Gabapentin 600 mg or&#xD;
      placebo at hours 8, 16, and 24 postoperatively following abdominal hysterectomies(4). Opioid&#xD;
      consumption was reduced by 32% in this study and there was no significant difference between&#xD;
      side effects in either group. Another study looking at postoperative outcomes and Gabapentin&#xD;
      was published by Gilron and his colleagues who randomized 110 patients to 4 study groups: (A)&#xD;
      placebo (B) Gabapentin 600 mg TID (C) Rofecoxib 50 mg/day (D) Gabapentin 600 mg TID &amp;&#xD;
      Rofecoxib 50 mg/day starting 1hr preoperatively and continuing for 72 hours postoperatively&#xD;
      (9). This study was unique because it went further than simply looking at pain scores and&#xD;
      morphine consumption data. Gilron and his colleagues demonstrated that the Gabapentin and the&#xD;
      Gabapentin and Rofecoxib groups also significantly decreased movement associated pain evoked&#xD;
      by sitting and coughing post abdominal hysterectomy. Adverse events were similar in all&#xD;
      groups except sedation, which was more frequent with Gabapentin. Consistent with previous&#xD;
      literature, the multimodal Gabapentin/Rofecoxib combination demonstrated opioid sparing,&#xD;
      lower pain scores, but most importantly, decreased movement associated pain, which may be a&#xD;
      significant factor in faster rehabilitation. In our study we have chosen to use Gabapentin&#xD;
      200 mg TID (bioequivalence of 600 mg/day) based on our extensive clinical experience with our&#xD;
      patient population. This appears to be the dose at which most patients do not exhibit the&#xD;
      Gabapentin related side effects described earlier. Only four studies have prescribed&#xD;
      Gabapentin beyond 72 hours postoperatively (6-8,11). This is an area in which further&#xD;
      research is needed to determine whether prolonged postoperative administration and its&#xD;
      benefits translate into earlier hospital discharge, decreased chronic pain rates and&#xD;
      increased functional recovery even beyond the acute post surgical time period. By following&#xD;
      patients to 4 weeks post surgery, this study will aim to answer some of the questions&#xD;
      regarding the perioperative use of gabapentin and its possible role ameliorating functional&#xD;
      recovery beyond the acute hospitalization period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sunnybrook Health Sciences Acute Pain Service (APS) does not know if 200 mg of Gabapentin&#xD;
      is effective at reducing morphine consumption, and improving analgesia. Much higher doses&#xD;
      (i.e. greater than 1800 mg/day) published in the literature were initially used at&#xD;
      Sunnybrook, but many patients (anecdotally) became too sedated. We are currently using the&#xD;
      dose suggested in our protocol 200 mg TID without any major problems. Therefore our goal is&#xD;
      to assess if Gabapentin 200 mg does in fact have opioid reducing and analgesic benefits in&#xD;
      the radical prostate population. Our pilot data from 15 patients indicates these benefits&#xD;
      might exist. Furthermore, examining the role of gabapentin in regards to perioperative&#xD;
      anxiety and following patients beyond the acute post surgical time period and following any&#xD;
      changes related to their functional recovery and quality of life will help to close some of&#xD;
      the gaps in the literature regarding the perioperative usefulness of gabapentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gabapentin and Anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative effectiveness of Gabapentin in decreasing anxiety scores and improving early&#xD;
      functional recovery after anterior cruciate ligament knee surgery (n=40) has recently been&#xD;
      demonstrated(10). Premedication with Gabapentin 1200 mg improved preoperative anxiolysis,&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia, and early knee mobilization. By including a physical measure (active&#xD;
      and passive knee flexion), Menigaux and colleagues also demonstrated that adequate&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia enhances mobilization of the knee joint, thus potentially improving&#xD;
      functional recovery. This French study examined patient's preoperative anxiety levels by&#xD;
      administering an anxiety Visual Analogue Score prior to induction of anesthesia in the&#xD;
      operating room. Since this method of anxiety testing has not been validated, we will use four&#xD;
      reliable and well-validated anxiety tools in our present study. These measures are all one&#xD;
      page questionnaires that are of little burden to patients. The anxiety measures are: The&#xD;
      Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, The Pain Catastrophising Scale, The Pain Anxiety&#xD;
      Symptoms Scale and a 7 Item Modified Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) consists of two self-report scales, one measuring&#xD;
      state anxiety and the other measuring trait anxiety (24). Each scale consists of 20&#xD;
      statements about how the respondent may feel, and they are asked to rate how strongly they&#xD;
      agree (&quot;very much so&quot;) or disagree (&quot;not at all&quot;) with the item. The S-Anxiety scale&#xD;
      evaluates how respondents feel &quot;right now, at this moment&quot;, whereas the T-Anxiety scale&#xD;
      evaluates how they feel &quot;generally&quot;. This scale has been used extensively in research and&#xD;
      clinical practice, and has been shown to be valid and reliable (24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catastrophising or catastrophic thinking refers to &quot;an exaggerated negative 'mental set'&#xD;
      brought to bear during actual or anticipated pain experience&quot; (25). The PCS is a 13 item&#xD;
      self-report inventory that measures catastrophic thinking in relation to pain (26).&#xD;
      Respondents are asked to reflect on past painful experiences and to indicate the degree to&#xD;
      which they experience each of 13 thoughts or feelings when experiencing pain. Each item is&#xD;
      rated on a 5-point rating scale with the end points 0 = not at all and 4 = all the time. The&#xD;
      PCS yields a total score and three subscale scores assessing rumination (i.e., excessive&#xD;
      focus on pain sensations), magnification (i.e., exaggerating the threat value of pain&#xD;
      sensations) and helplessness (i.e., perceiving oneself as unable to cope with pain symptoms).&#xD;
      The PCS has been shown to have high internal consistency {coefficient alphas: total PCS =&#xD;
      .87, rumination = .87, magnification = .66, and helplessness = .78 (26). The PCS has been&#xD;
      shown to predict pain intensity in patients with acute postoperative pain (27) and pain&#xD;
      related disability in chronic neuropathic pain patients even after controlling for pain&#xD;
      severity (28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS) is a 40-item assessment tool that measures fear and&#xD;
      anxiety responses to pain, and the short form of the PASS is a condensed version of the full&#xD;
      PASS with only 20 items (29). The PASS-20 is a reliable and valid scale with adequate&#xD;
      psychometric properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 30) is a widely used scale for&#xD;
      measuring the symptoms of anxiety and depression among medical inpatients, outpatients and in&#xD;
      the general population (31). The HADS is a 14-item questionnaire that measures symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items). For each item, the patient is asked to select&#xD;
      from among 4 possible choices (scored from 0 to 3) the one that best describes how they have&#xD;
      been feeling over the past week. The HADS yields an anxiety (HADS-A) and a depression&#xD;
      (HADS-D) subscale score. We have chosen to administer only the (HADS-D) component because we&#xD;
      feel that the other anxiety measure provide enough information in regards to anxiety. In&#xD;
      general, the psychometric properties of the HADS are excellent. It has been administered in&#xD;
      more than 700 studies to more than 35,000 individuals. Internal consistency for the anxiety&#xD;
      and depression subscales show Chronbach alphas of between 0.80-0.93 for the anxiety subscale&#xD;
      and between 0.81 and 0.90 for the depression subscale (31,32). Concurrent validity of the&#xD;
      HADS is very good as measured by correlation coefficients of between 0.62 and 0.73 for the&#xD;
      HADS-D with various well-validated depression scales (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory, SCL-90&#xD;
      Depression subscale (31,32). The HADS has been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes due to&#xD;
      disease progression and in response to therapeutic interventions (32). The 7 item modified&#xD;
      HADS will take less than 2 minutes to fill out (33).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden to patients will be minimal because all of the above measures can be completed in&#xD;
      15-20 minutes. Patients will be asked to complete these items at baseline (prior to surgery),&#xD;
      on the day of hospital discharge (likely POD 3) and at the 3 month follow up post surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Related Quality of Life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes pertaining to health related quality of life (HRQOL) are gaining importance when&#xD;
      assessing the impact that interventions have on various disease states (34). Many tools are&#xD;
      available, however it has been recommended that both a general and disease specific HRQOL&#xD;
      tool be used to help ensure any changes in HRQOL status are captured (34,35). Regardless of&#xD;
      the instrument(s) chosen they should be valid &amp; reliable, as well as sensitive and responsive&#xD;
      to change (35, 36). Other key considerations include utilizing a tool that captures the key&#xD;
      dimensions of HRQOL, specifically physical, psychological, &amp; social/role functioning (35,&#xD;
      37). A critical component to assessing HRQOL is that, given the subjective nature of quality&#xD;
      of life, the data should be assessed by the patient, not the health care provider (37).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to meet all of these criteria, this study will utilize the SF-36 Health Outcomes&#xD;
      questionnaire (SF-36), the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index, (UCLA-PCI) and the Brief Pain&#xD;
      Inventory (BPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SF-36 is a widely used general HRQOL tool, with extensive validity and reliability and&#xD;
      responsiveness across many populations (38, 39). The SF-36 is a 36 question survey used to&#xD;
      describe overall health status. It has 8 subscales (physical functioning, role limitations,&#xD;
      bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social function, role limitation as a&#xD;
      result of emotional problems, and general mental health). It takes 5-10 minutes to complete&#xD;
      and can be used with persons 14 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UCLA Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) is also a valid and reliable tool, measuring health&#xD;
      related outcomes specific to the prostate cancer population (40). It takes about 10 minutes&#xD;
      to complete. In a recent review of HRQL in prostate cancer studies, the SF-36 and UCLA-PCA&#xD;
      were the most frequently used general and disease specific tools used (41)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to make the measurement of pain more robust, a valid and reliable tool should be&#xD;
      used. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) &amp; Brief Pain Inventory will be used. The Brief Pain&#xD;
      Inventory (BPI) is a widely used tool that has been validated in a wide variety of clinical&#xD;
      and research populations, including the cancer population (42) and post operative population&#xD;
      (43). It takes about 5 minutes to complete. The BPI measures pain intensity and pain&#xD;
      interference on work, activity, mood, enjoyment sleep, walking, and relationships. It is&#xD;
      important to assess baseline pain when undertaking a trial to assess pain or analgesia&#xD;
      related outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently published articles have examined the effect of post operative pain on HRQOL after&#xD;
      discharge, and have found that pain contributes to lower scores on HRQOL indices (44-46), at&#xD;
      one week and one month post discharge.&#xD;

    <description>Patients are stratified based on their initial pain score in the recovery room. patients with a pain numeric rating scale of greater than or equal to 7/10 are stratified to the &quot;high&quot; group. then randomized to receive gabapentin 200 mg tid x 9 doses, or placebo x 9 doses. Patients with a pain score equal to or less than 6/10 are stratified to the &quot;low&quot; group, then randomized to receive gabapentin 200mg tid x 9 doses or placebo x 9 doses.&#xD;
All patients receive Acetaminophen 1gm every 6 hours for 3 days, Celecoxib 400mg as a loading dose then 200mg twice a day for 3 days. Patients also receive patient controlled analgesia (PCA) of hydromorphone for 24 hrs, then are transitioned to oxycodone 5-15 mg every 2 hours as needed.</description>
