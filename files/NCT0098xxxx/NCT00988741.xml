  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded Phase 2 study designed to&#xD;
      compare treatment of ARQ 197 versus placebo in patients with unresectable HCC who had&#xD;
      radiographic disease progression after systemic first line therapy or were unable to tolerate&#xD;
      the therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive ARQ 197 or placebo. The&#xD;
      treatment assignment will be stratified based on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)&#xD;
      performance status (PS), and vascular invasion status. The treatment with ARQ 197 or placebo&#xD;
      will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another&#xD;
      discontinuation criterion listed in this protocol is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After radiographic disease progression is documented, treatment assignment will be unblinded.&#xD;
      Patients who were assigned to placebo arm and had documented radiographic disease progression&#xD;
      will have the option to receive ARQ 197 and will be evaluated for objective response rate and&#xD;
      disease control rate continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will continue until 78 total time to progression events are reached. At the end of&#xD;
      study, all remaining patients still on treatment will have the option to be rolled over to&#xD;
      another study to continue their treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The investigational drug ARQ 197 is supplied as capsules. A dose of 360 mg (3 capsules of 120 mg each) of ARQ 197 will be administered by mouth BID, once in the morning and once in the evening with meals, for a total daily dose of 720 mg. Under Amendment 2, a dose of 240 mg (2 capsules of 120 mg each) of ARQ 197/placebo will be administered by mouth BID, once in the morning and once in the evening with meals, for a total daily dose of 480 mg. A treatment cycle is defined as 4 weeks for both treatment arms. Cycles will be repeated every 4 weeks (28 days) based on toxicity and response.</description>
