    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate the effect of bezafibrate on metabolism during exercise&#xD;
      in 22 adult patients affected with carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPTII) or very-long&#xD;
      chain acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiencies. This study will be an 9-month, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. The trial will be conducted in two centers:&#xD;
      Institut de Myologie, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in France, and Rigshospitalet, University of&#xD;
      Copenhagen, in Denmark. The main criteria for assessing the potential effect of this drug&#xD;
      will be the fat oxidation rate studied during a moderate workload on cycle ergometer, after&#xD;
      infusion of stable isotopes (palmitate and glucose tracers).&#xD;

      Background and research aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPTII) and very-long chain acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (VLCAD)&#xD;
      deficiencies are the two most common inherited disorders of mitochondrial fatty acid&#xD;
      oxidation (FAO) in adults, both inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Mitochondrial FAO&#xD;
      plays a pivotal role for maintaining energy homeostasis in situations such as fasting, fever&#xD;
      or prolonged exercise that require both glucose sparing and major energy supply. In these&#xD;
      situations, a number of tissues such as skeletal muscle, heart, and liver, favour fatty acids&#xD;
      as the main source of energy. Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), that represent the major part of&#xD;
      endogenous free fatty acids cannot enter the mitochondrial matrix compartment by simple&#xD;
      diffusion, and the transfer of LCFA across the mitochondrial membranes is governed by a&#xD;
      multienzymatic system named carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) consisting of two enzymes:&#xD;
      CPT I and II. CPT I, a key regulatory step of LCFA oxidation, is located within the outer&#xD;
      mitochondrial membrane, while CPT II is appended to the inner face of the inner mitochondrial&#xD;
      membrane. CPTs I and II catalyze a single reaction (carnitine + acyl-CoA ⇔ acylcarnitine +&#xD;
      CoA~SH) in the forward and reverse directions, respectively. VLCAD is bound to the inner&#xD;
      mitochondrial membrane, and catalyses the first step of the long-chain fatty acid β-oxidation&#xD;
      spiral (Izai et al., 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various phenotypes of CPT II and VLACD deficiencies have been described. Severe neonatal or&#xD;
      infantile clinical life-threatening symptoms may occur with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, liver&#xD;
      failure, and cardiomyopathy during the first months or years of life (Demaugre et al, 1991;&#xD;
      Bonnefont et al, 1996; Vianey-Saban et al. 1998; Andresen et al., 1999). Conversely, the&#xD;
      &quot;adult&quot; forms of these diseases are more prevalent and have a clinical expression restricted&#xD;
      to skeletal muscle. In the latter form, onset most often occurs in teenagers or young adults,&#xD;
      and is mainly characterized by recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis triggered by prolonged&#xD;
      exercise, fasting, cold or fever (DiMauro et al., 1973; Vianey-Saban et al. 1998). The major&#xD;
      potential complication is acute renal failure following attacks of rhabdomyolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of fuel utilization in subjects with CPT II and VLCAD deficiencies, with stable&#xD;
      isotopes during exercise, have shown that in vivo oxidation of LCFA was severely impaired&#xD;
      during prolonged, low-intensity exercise. These findings indicated that residual CPT II and&#xD;
      VLCAD activities are sufficient to maintain normal oxidation of fat at rest, but that fat&#xD;
      oxidation rate cannot increase above basal level during exercise (Ørngreen et al., 2004;&#xD;
      2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current recommended treatments for long-chain FAO disorders essentially relies on dietary&#xD;
      approaches, with restriction of long-chain fat intake along with medium-chain triglyceride&#xD;
      supply (MCT oil). A carbohydrate-rich diet also improved exercise tolerance in CPT&#xD;
      II-deficient patients, as indicated by lowering of perceived exertion and an increased&#xD;
      duration of exercise after such a diet (Ørngreen et al., 2003). More recently, a remarkable&#xD;
      improvement of cardiac and muscular symptoms occurred in three children with VLCAD&#xD;
      deficiency, after dietary supplementation with a seven-carbon medium chain fatty acid&#xD;
      (triheptanoïn). The mechanism underlying this effect is believed to involve the production of&#xD;
      C5 ketone bodies and propionyl-CoA, which allows for replenishment of the pool of catalytic&#xD;
      intermediates for the citric acid cycle (Roe et al., 2002). This promising approach is still&#xD;
      under evaluation and marked digestive side effects could restrict its indication towards the&#xD;
      more severe form of FAO defects. Pharmacological approaches are mainly carnitine&#xD;
      supplementation in order to provide carnitine to convert potentially toxic long-chain&#xD;
      acyl-CoAs to acylcarnitines. However, the role of carnitine supplements in FAO defects&#xD;
      remains controversial and of unproven value due to the absence of controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPARα receptors were identified as potential targets for pharmacological therapy of CPTII and&#xD;
      VLCAD deficiencies. PPARα is a transcription factor, belonging to the superfamily of&#xD;
      steroid-thyroid hormone receptors, which is able to modify CPT2 and VLCAD gene expression&#xD;
      (Lemberger et al, 1996). Djouadi et al. established that administration to control mice of a&#xD;
      CPT I inhibitor (etomoxir) causes a feedback induction of PPARα target genes involved in&#xD;
      fatty acid oxidation such as medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and acyl-CoA oxidase genes&#xD;
      (Djouadi et al, 1998). PPARα was also shown to regulate the constitutive expression of the&#xD;
      CPT2 gene and protein in the adult mouse heart and liver and to mediate up-regulation of CPT2&#xD;
      gene in response to fibrates in mouse liver (Aoyama et al, 1998, Watanabe et al, 2000). In&#xD;
      humans, the &quot;fibrate&quot; class of hypolipidaemic drugs (clofibrate, bezafibrate, gemfibrozil,&#xD;
      etc…) are specific ligands of PPARα and the interaction with PPARα forms the molecular basis&#xD;
      of therapeutic effects of these drugs (Vamecq et al, 1999). The research group of Bastin J&#xD;
      and Djouadi F hypothesized that the hypolipidemic drug bezafibrate, acting as an activator of&#xD;
      PPARα, might stimulate FAO in CPT II and VLCAD-deficient cell lines. Bezafibrate treatment of&#xD;
      fibroblasts from four CPT II-deficient patients with the &quot;adult&quot; form of the disease was&#xD;
      shown 1) to increase the amount of CPT2 mRNA (+ 47 % to + 66 %) and the residual CPT II&#xD;
      enzyme activity (+ 54 % to + 135 %) in a time- and dose-dependant manner, and 2) to normalize&#xD;
      3H-palmitate and 3H-myristate oxidation rates. Conversely, bezafibrate did not correct FAO in&#xD;
      two patients with the &quot;infantile&quot; form of CPTII deficiency (Djouadi et al, 2003). Since the&#xD;
      clinical expression of the &quot;adult&quot; form of CPT2 deficiency is restricted to skeletal muscle,&#xD;
      the effect of fibrates was tested on FAO in muscle samples from such patients. After being&#xD;
      provided with muscle samples from patients with the &quot;adult&quot; form of CPTII deficiency followed&#xD;
      at the Institute of Myology (P. Laforêt, B. Eymard), it has been shown that myoblasts from&#xD;
      these biopsies exhibited a 40 % decrease in FAO compared to control cells (Djouadi et al,&#xD;
      2003). Moreover, pretreatment of CPTII-deficient myoblasts with bezafibrate restored FAO to&#xD;
      normal levels (Bastin et al, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, Djouadi et al. (2005) demonstrated that addition of bezafibrate in the culture&#xD;
      medium induced a dose-dependent (up to 3-fold) increase in palmitate oxidation capacities in&#xD;
      fibroblasts from patients with the myopathic form of VLCAD deficiency, but not from severely&#xD;
      affected patients. This biological improvement was related to drug-induced increases in VLCAD&#xD;
      mRNA (+ 44 to + 150%), protein (1.5-2-fold) and residual enzyme activity (up to 7.7-fold) in&#xD;
      cells from the patients. Bezafibrate also diminished the production of long-chain&#xD;
      acyl-carnitines by 90% in cells harboring moderate VLCAD deficiency. The same group also&#xD;
      investigated the response to bezafibrate as a function of genotype in 33 VLCAD-deficient&#xD;
      fibroblasts representing 45 different mutations. Treatment with bezafibrate resulted in a&#xD;
      marked increase in FAO capacities, often leading to restoration of normal values, for 21&#xD;
      genotypes that mainly correspond to patients with the myopathic phenotype (Gobin-Limballe et&#xD;
      al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Situation of the research area and results by the investigator in this area The above data&#xD;
      provided the first evidence for a possible pharmacological effect of PPAR agonists on FAO&#xD;
      defects in humans. In the last two years, a pilot clinical trial assessing the potential&#xD;
      beneficial effects of bezafibrate on the muscular form of CPT II deficiency has been&#xD;
      performed in collaboration between Pitié-Salpêtrière and Necker hospitals (appel d'offre AFM&#xD;
      2004). Six adult patients with CPT II-deficiency received a daily 400 mg dose of bezafibrate&#xD;
      during 6 months. Clinical tolerance of the treatment was excellent, and muscular symptoms&#xD;
      improved in 5/6 patients with a decrease in myalgia intensity and duration. In vitro analyses&#xD;
      were carried out on lymphocytes and skeletal muscle, sampled prior to- and at the end of the&#xD;
      study. LCFAO in isolated muscle mitochondria was strongly induced in 6/6 patients, and this&#xD;
      effect was shown to result from drug-induced up-regulation of CPT2 mRNA and protein levels&#xD;
      (Djouadi et al., 2007). However the major endpoints of this study were mainly biochemical&#xD;
      analysis, and we were not able to clearly demonstrate a decrease in the frequency of&#xD;
      rhabdomyolysis attacks, neither an improvement of in vivo muscle metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to evaluate the effect of bezafibrate on metabolism during exercise in adult&#xD;
      patients affected with CPT II or VLCAD deficiencies. This study will be an 11-month,&#xD;
      randomized double blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. The trial will be conducted in&#xD;
      two centers: Institut de Myologie, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in France and Neuromuscular&#xD;
      Research Unit, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, in Denmark. Since exercise test on&#xD;
      cycle ergometer after stable isotopes infusion is probably the most reliable way to assess in&#xD;
      vivo fat oxidation, this technique will be utilized as the one of two major outcomes for this&#xD;
      study, and the main criteria for assessing the potential effect of this drug will be the fat&#xD;
      oxidation rate during a moderate workload on cycle ergometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two primary outcomes to asses the potential effect of Bezafibrate are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Fat oxidation and heart rate generated during physical activity on cycle ergometer at a&#xD;
      constant workload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect the fat oxidation in the patients to increase by a factor 1.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enzyme activity in leucocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acylcarnitine profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accelerometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Borg score (perceived exertion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of episodes of myoglobinuria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily muscle pain score (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily diary of energy utilization (Bouchards questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects This study will be an 9-month, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      crossover trial. Based on the calculation of strength in the section of statistics 22&#xD;
      patients, respectively 11 patients with CPT II and 11 patients with VLCAD deficiency will be&#xD;
      included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adult forms of CPTII and VLCAD deficiencies are very rare diseases. Twenty-five patients&#xD;
      with CPTII deficiency and 15 patients with the myopathic form of VLCAD deficiency are&#xD;
      currently followed in our two groups. In case that we can't include enough patients from&#xD;
      Denmark and France, we will include patients from our collaborators in the Netherlands and&#xD;
      Sweden. All studies will be conducted at Rigshospitalet and Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. Only&#xD;
      the regularly blood samples will be outsourced to other hospitals, but the results will be&#xD;
      faxed or mailed directly to the sponsor or investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted on the two centers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neuromuskulær Forskningsenhed, Rigshospitalet, Danmark&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Institut de Myologie, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Frankrig In collaboration with&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Copenhagen Region Pharmacy, Alice Rosendahl, Marielundvej 25, Herlev, Denmark&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Copenhagen Muscle Research Center, Rigshospitalet, Blegdamsvej 9, København Ø, Denmark&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. GCP-unit, Bispebjerg hospital, Bispebjerg Bakke 23, København NV, Denmark&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into four periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First period: 1 month observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second period: 3 months treatment with either Bezafibrate or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Third period: 2 months wash out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fourth period: 3 months treatment with either Bezafibrate or placebo (the opposite drug&#xD;
           as in the second period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are to fill out daily scores of muscle pain (VAS score) and energy utilization&#xD;
      (Bouchards questionnaire) during all four periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to the randomizing all patients have a 1 month observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Creatin kinase will be measured regularly in this period to define the level of muscle&#xD;
           damage before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine a workload of 50% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) for the experiment, all&#xD;
           subjects will complete a maximal incremental cycle exercise test on a cycle ergometer in&#xD;
           the end of this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second and fourth period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will be instructed to follow a standardized carbohydrate rich diet three days&#xD;
           prior to the experiment containing 65% carbohydrate, 15% protein and 20% fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fat oxidation study: After the 3 months observation period subjects will meet in the lab&#xD;
           at 9.00 a.m. Two catheters will be inserted in arm veins, one in the cubital vein for&#xD;
           stable isotope infusion and one in the distal cephalic vein for blood sampling. The&#xD;
           subjects will receive a primed, constant rate infusion of [U-13C]-palmitate (0.0026 mg&#xD;
           kg-1 min-1, primed by a 0.085 mg kg-1 NaH13CO3 bolus, NB! non-radioactive and&#xD;
           non-dangerous tracers). Two hours after the start of the isotope infusion, subjects will&#xD;
           cycle to exhaustion or for maximum 60 min. at a workload of 50-60% of VO2max as&#xD;
           previously determined. Heart rate and the level of perceived exertion (Borg Scale) will&#xD;
           be monitored every other minute during exercise. Blood and expired gases for isotope&#xD;
           measurements will be collected at 10 min intervals at rest and during exercise. Expired&#xD;
           air will be collected in a 15 L Douglas bag, and 10 ml air samples from the bags will be&#xD;
           injected into vacutainer tubes for analyses of 13CO2 enrichment. Blood samples for acyl&#xD;
           carnitines will be collected after 30 and 60 min. of exercise or at exhaustion, and&#xD;
           three hours after exercise. Enzyme activity of CPT II and VLCAD will be measured on&#xD;
           leucocytes. The above-described test will be executed both before and after each&#xD;
           treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients will be randomized into two groups, to receive either 3 x 200mg bezafibrate or&#xD;
           placebo in the second period and vice versa in the fourth period. Patients and all&#xD;
           health care personal are blinded for the treatment. The randomization is carried out by&#xD;
           the GMP-certified regional pharmacy of Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. On the first trial day of these two periods patients will have blood samples taken to&#xD;
           analyse creatin kinase, cholestrol, triglycerides, lipoproteins, total long-chain fatty&#xD;
           acids, total carnitine, acylcarnitines, bilirubin, creatinin, aspartate amino&#xD;
           transferase (ASAT), alanine amino transferase (ALAT), γ glutamyl transferase and alcalic&#xD;
           phosfatase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To indicate their activity level, the patients will carry an accelerometer the last&#xD;
           fourteen days of each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two months wash-out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurements of creatin kinase levels every second week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blinded, randomised and crossover:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (z1-α/2 + Z1-β )2 * SD2 n ≥ _________________________ d2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Z1-α/2 = 1.96; Risk for type 1 error (α=0.05) Z1-β = 0.84; Risk for type 2 error: (1-β) = 80%&#xD;
      SD2 = 1.25; delta palmitate oxidation in four patients with CPT II deficiency = 1.26±1.12&#xD;
      (Ørngreen et al, 2005) d2 = 0.87; (MIREDIF) increase in palmitate oxidation during exercise&#xD;
      from the level of the patients with double CPT2 gene mutations to the level of the single&#xD;
      CPT2 gene mutation subjects. (Ørngreen et al, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1.96 + 0.84 )2 * 1.25 n ≥ _________________________ = 11 0.87&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strength calculation is based on a former study of fat oxidation in patients with CPT II&#xD;
      deficiency. Ørngreen et al 2005 In this study we described fat oxidation of patients and&#xD;
      carriers with respectively two and one CPT2 gene mutations compared with the fat oxidation in&#xD;
      healthy controls. The expected effect of bezafibrate on the fat oxidation in the CPT II&#xD;
      patients is expected to be the difference between the mean value of fat oxidation in patients&#xD;
      with CPT II deficiency and the mean value of the fat oxidation in heterozygous carriers of&#xD;
      one CPT2 gene mutations. The strength calculation indicates that a number of 11 subjects need&#xD;
      to be included. The aim is to include 11 patients from respectively the groups of patients&#xD;
      with CPT II deficiency and the groups of patients with VLCAD deficiency. If somehow it turns&#xD;
      out that we cannot include that many patients. The two groups will be pooled into one group.&#xD;
      This can be done because of the similarity of the two groups both in symptoms and in fat&#xD;
      oxidation, which is one of the primary outcomes, during exercise.Ørngreen et al 2005,&#xD;
      Ørngreen et al 2004 Missing data: As long as a patient has completed at least one treatment&#xD;
      period, results will be included in the data. Differences between treatments in the&#xD;
      individual will be assessed by a paired Student's t-test. A p value &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed&#xD;
      testing) will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
