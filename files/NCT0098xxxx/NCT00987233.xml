    <description>It is to be self-administered; the dosing regimen will be 2 sprays (actuations) into each nostril, once daily. This is the dosing regimen during placebo lead-in and randomized treatment phases. Each actuation of active treatment is equivalent to 55 ug of triamcinolone acetonide, for a total daily dose of 220ug triamcinolone acetonide per day.</description>
