  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate early wound healing of one application of four&#xD;
      different doses of intradermal Zesteem (17β-Estradiol) in male subjects and female subjects&#xD;
      two years post-menopausal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject received a total of six, 3mm punch biopsy wounds; three wounds to the upper&#xD;
      inner aspect of each arm. Each punch biopsy site was randomly allocated to receive one of six&#xD;
      treatments: Zesteem (0.02μg, 0.1μg, 0.2μg and 0.4μg/100μl), Placebo (vehicle), and Standard&#xD;
      Care (moist wound healing dressings) only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zesteem and Placebo were administered to marked, anaesthetised sites, by intradermal&#xD;
      injection 10 to 30 minutes before wounding. Sites randomised to receive Standard Care only&#xD;
      received no additional treatment before wounding. After wounding, all sites received moist&#xD;
      wound healing dressings (Standard Care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three days after wounding, all biopsy sites were anaesthetised and the wounds excised using a&#xD;
      5mm punch biopsy, for histological analysis. The Investigator closed all excision sites using&#xD;
      sutures and Steri-strips to achieve a cosmetically acceptable result. Subjects attended a&#xD;
      post-trial follow-up visit (13-18 days after dosing) where their sutures were removed and&#xD;
      final safety assessments were performed.&#xD;
