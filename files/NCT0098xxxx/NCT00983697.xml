      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT scan, may help doctors&#xD;
      find head and neck cancer and find out how far the disease has spread. It may also help&#xD;
      doctors plan the best treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT imaging to see how well&#xD;
      it works in assessing the tumor and planning neck surgery in patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      head and neck cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the negative predictive value of PET/CT imaging based upon pathologic sampling&#xD;
           of the neck lymph nodes in patients with head and neck cancer planning to undergo N0&#xD;
           neck surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the potential of PET/CT imaging to change treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the sensitivity and diagnostic yield of PET/CT imaging for detecting occult&#xD;
           metastasis in the clinical N0 neck (both by neck and lymph node regions) or other local&#xD;
           sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of other factors (e.g., tumor size, location, secondary primary&#xD;
           tumors, or intensity of FDG uptake) that can lead to identification of subsets of&#xD;
           patients that could potentially forego neck dissection or that can provide preliminary&#xD;
           data for subsequent studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the cost-effectiveness of using PET/CT imaging for staging head and neck cancer&#xD;
           vs current good clinical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the incidence of occult distant body metastasis discovered by whole-body PET/CT&#xD;
           imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate PET/CT imaging findings with CT/MRI findings and biomarker results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the quality of life of these patients, particularly of those patients whose&#xD;
           management could have been altered by imaging results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate PET/CT imaging and biomarker data for complementary contributions to metastatic&#xD;
           disease prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare baseline PET/CT imaging and biomarker data with 2-year follow up as an adjunct&#xD;
           assessment of their prediction of recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall&#xD;
           survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the proportion of neck dissections that are extended (i.e., additional levels&#xD;
           that clinicians intend to dissect beyond the initial surgery plan) based on local-reader&#xD;
           PET/CT imaging findings shared with the surgeon before dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the optimum cutoff value of standardized uptake values for diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
           of PET/CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of PET/CT imaging on the N0 neck across different tumor subsites&#xD;
           (defined by anatomic location).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT imaging. Approximately 14 days later, patients&#xD;
      undergo unilateral or bilateral neck dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and at 1, 12, and 24 months&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection periodically for biomarker analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 years after surgery.&#xD;
