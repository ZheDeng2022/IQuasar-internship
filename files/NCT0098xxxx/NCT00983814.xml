  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurobiological disorder characterized&#xD;
      by lifelong issues of inattention, distraction, organizational difficulties, forgetfulness,&#xD;
      restlessness, talking out of turn, difficulty waiting and interrupting others. ADHD is the&#xD;
      second most common neuropsychiatric disorder affecting 4.4% of the US adult population, or&#xD;
      between 8-9 million individuals (Kessler et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Droxidopa (L-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS)) is a synthetic catecholamine which is converted&#xD;
      to norepinephrine (NE) via decarboxylation, resulting in increased levels of NE centrally in&#xD;
      the CNS and peripherally. Co-treatment with carboxylase inhibitors, such as carbidopa, given&#xD;
      with droxidopa, can increase the CNS levels of NE with greater crossing of the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier. Droxidopa has received orphan drug approval by the FDA for the treatment of&#xD;
      symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in individuals with primary autonomic failure.&#xD;
      The half-life of droxidopa is approximately 2-3 hours, resulting in administration thee times&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As adult ADHD is characterized as a disorder of decreased NE activity in the pre-frontal&#xD;
      cortex, it is hypothesized that treating patients with droxidopa (in co-administration of&#xD;
      carbidopa) will have a positive effect on adult ADHD.&#xD;

      This will be a 12-week study of twenty enrolled subjects with DSM IV adult ADHD (age 18-55),&#xD;
      with a goal of completing twenty subjects in the trial. The primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to determine the effect of droxidopa therapy on adult ADHD symptoms over the course of a&#xD;
      six-week open-label titration period followed by a two-week double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      period. The primary outcome measure will be changes from baseline in total score on the Adult&#xD;
      ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS). Secondary measures will be changes in&#xD;
      self-report ADHD symptoms on the ASRS v1.1 Symptom Checklist, global impairment on the&#xD;
      Clinician Global Impression Scale (CGI).&#xD;
