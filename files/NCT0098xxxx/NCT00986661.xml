    <textblock>
      This open-label study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effect on&#xD;
      tumor growth following a single intralesional injection of PV-10 in subjects with either (a)&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that is not amenable to resection, transplant or other&#xD;
      potentially curative therapy or (b) cancer metastatic to the liver.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subject will be enrolled in one of four planned cohorts (Main Study Group, Expansion Cohort&#xD;
      1, Expansion Cohort 2 or Expansion Cohort 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study Group. Three initial subjects with either HCC or cancer metastatic to the liver&#xD;
      will receive 0.25 mL PV-10 per cc lesion volume (Lv) to a single lesion (up to a maximum dose&#xD;
      of 7.5 mL PV-10). If none of the initial three subjects experiences a new and persistent&#xD;
      CTCAE Grade 3 or greater non-hematological or any Grade 4 hematological toxicity over a&#xD;
      28-day follow-up interval, an additional three subjects will be enrolled and similarly&#xD;
      treated with PV-10 administered at 0.50 mL per cc Lv (up to a maximum dose of 15 mL PV-10)&#xD;
      provided no new and persistent Grade 3 or greater non-hematological or any Grade 4&#xD;
      hematological toxicity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Cohort 1 (EC1: PV-10 plus/minus Checkpoint Inhibition). Following demonstration of&#xD;
      safety and tolerability in the Main Study Group, up to 48 additional subjects with cancers&#xD;
      metastatic to the liver or with HCC will be enrolled into Expansion Cohort 1 (EC1). Subjects&#xD;
      will be treated with PV-10 administered at 0.50 mL per cc Lv (up to a maximum dose of 15 mL&#xD;
      PV-10). Subjects may receive injection of up to two lesions in any PV-10 treatment cycle.&#xD;
      Enrollment will continue provided no new and persistent Grade 3 or greater non-hematological&#xD;
      (excluding fatigue) or any Grade 4 hematological toxicity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Cohort 2 (EC2: PV-10 plus Checkpoint Inhibition). Following demonstration of safety&#xD;
      and tolerability in the Main Study Group, up to 12 additional subjects with HCC on a&#xD;
      background of standard care checkpoint inhibition therapy (i.e., anti-PD-1 therapy) will be&#xD;
      enrolled into Expansion Cohort 2 (EC2). Subjects will be treated with PV-10 administered at&#xD;
      0.50 mL per cc Lv (up to a maximum dose of 15 mL PV-10). Subjects may receive injection of up&#xD;
      to two lesions in any PV-10 treatment cycle. Enrollment will continue provided no new and&#xD;
      persistent Grade 3 or greater non-hematological (excluding fatigue) or any Grade 4&#xD;
      hematological toxicity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Cohort 3 (EC3: PV-10 plus Checkpoint Inhibition). Following demonstration of safety&#xD;
      and tolerability in the Main Study Group, up to 12 additional subjects with hepatic&#xD;
      metastases of uveal melanoma (mUM) on a background of standard care checkpoint inhibition&#xD;
      therapy (i.e., anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 or combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapy) will&#xD;
      be enrolled into Expansion Cohort 3 (EC3). Subjects will be treated with PV-10 administered&#xD;
      at 0.50 mL per cc Lv (up to a maximum dose of 15 mL PV-10). Subjects may receive injection of&#xD;
      up to two lesions in any PV-10 treatment cycle. Enrollment will continue provided no new and&#xD;
      persistent Grade 3 or greater non-hematological (excluding fatigue) or any Grade 4&#xD;
      hematological toxicity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant therapy with immune checkpoint inhibition is allowed in Expansion Cohort 1 and&#xD;
      required in Expansion Cohort 2 and Expansion Cohort 3. This concomitant therapy must commence&#xD;
      at least 7 days prior to initial PV-10 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in each Expansion Cohort one or more additional injectable tumor ≥ 1 cm in diameter&#xD;
      will be eligible for treatment of one or more additional injectable tumor 28 days to 6 months&#xD;
      after prior PV-10 administration provided that any prior treatments with PV-10 were well&#xD;
      tolerated. This may be repeated until all injectable tumors ≥ 1 cm in diameter have received&#xD;
      PV-10.&#xD;
