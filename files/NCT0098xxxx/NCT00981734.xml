  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an experimental research study. The subjects were randomized into two groups:&#xD;
      Experimental group (EG; n=58, age: 67 ± 6 old) and Control group (CG; n=40; age: 70 ± 6 old).&#xD;
      All were physically active without strictly obeying in regularity of the program of physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional autonomy was evaluated by the amount of tests of Group Development of Latin&#xD;
      American Maturity (GDLAM). It consists of hiking ten meters (C10m); standing up from the&#xD;
      sitting position (SSP); to stand up from the ventral decubitus position (SSPVD); to stand up&#xD;
      from a chair and be able to walk around your home (SCWH); and to be able to wear and remove a&#xD;
      t-shirt (DTS). These tests have showed similar results in indice of GDLAM (IG). The&#xD;
      intervention took place three times a week, with intensity that has varied between fifty five&#xD;
      to seventy five per cent of the frequency maximum from heart.&#xD;

      In the physical evaluation, the participants were asked that they bathe with clothes&#xD;
      (swimsuit, trunks) to measure the body composition, stature and IMC. All of the results were&#xD;
      recorded in elaborated cards by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were physically evaluated through systemic observation during 16 weeks. The&#xD;
      first collection of data occurred in the first week of April and the second collection&#xD;
      occurred in the first week of August, 2009 during the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A weighing machine with the unit of Filizola registered to INMETRO (precision of 100 grams)&#xD;
      was used to evaluate body composition. Stature was measured through the use of a Estadiometer&#xD;
      registered to INMETRO (precision of 1 mm). In order to evaluate the functional autonomy,&#xD;
      GDLAM (Group Development of Latin American Maturity) created by Dantas and Vale, was used. It&#xD;
      consists of hiking ten meters (C10m); standing up from the sitting position (SSP); to stand&#xD;
      up from the ventral decubitus position (SSPVD); to stand up from a chair and be able to walk&#xD;
      around your home (SCWH); and to be able to wear and remove a t-shirt (DTS). Everybody was&#xD;
      measured in seconds and consists of a score called the General Indice of the GDLAM (IG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of reference for classification of the functional autonomy level were the same&#xD;
      for IG and its components and GDLAM. The intervention took place three times per week&#xD;
      (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) from 5 PM to 5:45 PM. Intensity varied between 50% and 75% of the&#xD;
      frequency maximum from heart (FMH) obtained by the equation: FMH = 220 - age. The FMH was&#xD;
      controlled by the standardization of the heart frequency (HF) from the carotid at six seconds&#xD;
      and then multiplied by ten. This HF WAS measured by the participants themselves. They&#xD;
      received training and orientations to learn the right method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants had their HF measured by monitors, at least one time per session.&#xD;
      Therefore after the self-standardization, with the aim to confirm the identified results by&#xD;
      the older women. The moment of standardization of the HF varied due to the voice of the&#xD;
      responsible teacher or asked by the monitor close to the old woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sessions were spread out in the subsequent ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Warm up: Duration five to ten minutes of articular exercises of upper body, neck, trunk&#xD;
           and lower body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development: twenty to thirty minutes of hiking in a natural method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To came back to calmness: three to five minutes of sitting elongated and/or laying down:&#xD;
           neck, upper and lower body and trunk; using the changed method by segment. The activity&#xD;
           of intervention was oriented at a controlled environment as the surface (plain and does&#xD;
           not glide) and markation of the walked distances (field jogging does not count - 260&#xD;
           meters) where the training was controlled by the time of hiking, according to Norms of&#xD;
           the American College Sport of Medicine and of the fifth Brazilian Norm of arterial&#xD;
           Hypertension, that has the requirement of a minimum frequency of three times per week&#xD;
           with the duration of twenty and thirty minutes; adequate to have a good mean to&#xD;
           physiological adaptations in etary group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Statistics were used with average, error-standard, median, standard deviation,&#xD;
      minimum and maximum and absolute delt. The normality of the sample was evaluated by the test&#xD;
      by Shapiro-Wilk (GC) and by Kolmogorov Smirnov (GE). To analyze the answer variables,&#xD;
      comparisons were made between groups, t-student test couplet or by Wilcoxon, when appropriate&#xD;
      (homogeneous or heterogenous distributions of the data, respectively). To make evaluations&#xD;
      between groups the parametric test by ANOVA was used in two ways, followed by Post Hoc de&#xD;
      Scheffe. The study used the level of p &lt; 0.05 to test the statistical significance. The&#xD;
      results were evaluated by Excel and the Statistical Package for the Social Science® (SPSS),&#xD;
      version 14.0.&#xD;
