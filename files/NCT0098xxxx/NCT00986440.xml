    <measure>Percentage Rate of Progression-free Survival at 18 Weeks Following Use of CS-7017 in Colorectal Cancer Participants Who Have Achieved Disease Control Following First-Line Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from enrollment to the date of the first objective documentation of disease progression or death resulting from any cause, whichever comes first. Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from enrollment to the date of the first objective documentation of disease progression or death resulting from any cause, whichever comes first.

    <measure>Percentage Rate of Overall Survival Following Use of CS-7017 in Colorectal Cancer Participants Who Have Achieved Disease Control Following First-Line Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of death and assessed by Kaplan Meier analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall Response and Objective Response Rate Following Use of CS-7017 in Colorectal Cancer Participants Who Have Achieved Disease Control Following First-Line Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 3 years 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The best overall response was defined as the best response (in the order of confirmed complete response [CR], confirmed partial response [PR], unconfirmed CR, unconfirmed PR, stable disease [SD], and progressive disease [PD]) among all overall responses recorded from the start of treatment until the participant withdrew from the study. If there was no tumor assessment after the first dose of study drug, the best overall response was classified as Inevaluable. Based on RECIST v1.0, CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response for Responding Participants Following Use of CS-7017 in Colorectal Cancer Participants Who Have Achieved Disease Control Following First-Line Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first objective response (confirmed and unconfirmed CR or PR) to date of progressive disease, up to 3 years 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was defined for participants with confirmed CR or PR and confirmed and unconfirmed CR or PR as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease. Duration of SD was defined for participants whose best response was SD as the time from the randomization date to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease. Duration of response was estimated using Kaplan Meier methods.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to Study Drug With an Incidence of ≥5% Following Use of CS-7017 Or Placebo in Colorectal Cancer Participants Who Have Achieved Disease Control Following First-Line Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 30 days after last study dose, up to 3 years 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as any untoward, unfavorable, unintended medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of study medication is not included as a TEAE unless it is considered related to treatment. If relationship is missing, the AE is also considered to be related to the drug.</description>

        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from enrollment to the date of the first objective documentation of disease progression or death resulting from any cause, whichever comes first. Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>

        <title>Best Overall Response and Objective Response Rate Following Use of CS-7017 in Colorectal Cancer Participants Who Have Achieved Disease Control Following First-Line Chemotherapy</title>
        <description>The best overall response was defined as the best response (in the order of confirmed complete response [CR], confirmed partial response [PR], unconfirmed CR, unconfirmed PR, stable disease [SD], and progressive disease [PD]) among all overall responses recorded from the start of treatment until the participant withdrew from the study. If there was no tumor assessment after the first dose of study drug, the best overall response was classified as Inevaluable. Based on RECIST v1.0, CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to Study Drug With an Incidence of ≥5% Following Use of CS-7017 Or Placebo in Colorectal Cancer Participants Who Have Achieved Disease Control Following First-Line Chemotherapy</title>
        <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as any untoward, unfavorable, unintended medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of study medication is not included as a TEAE unless it is considered related to treatment.

      <desc>A TEAE was defined as any untoward, unfavorable, unintended medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of study medication is not included as a TEAE unless it is considered related to treatment. If relationship is missing, the AE is also considered to be related to the drug.</desc>
