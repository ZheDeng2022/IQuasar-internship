  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects at least 750,000 Canadians and is&#xD;
      currently the 4th leading cause of death in Canada. Almost everyone with COPD suffers from&#xD;
      shortness of breath (dyspnea) that worsens over time despite standard treatment (inhalers,&#xD;
      exercise programs and oxygen). Patients and families have identified relief from dyspnea as a&#xD;
      top priority for improved care. New approaches are needed for treating advanced COPD to&#xD;
      lessen the burden that it places on the lives of patients and families alike. Opioid drugs,&#xD;
      such as morphine, can help in COPD in many ways, including reducing dyspnea, fear and&#xD;
      anxiety. Opioids are used widely in cancer for similar symptoms. However, there are&#xD;
      historical biases against their use in advanced COPD (mostly due to fear of side effects when&#xD;
      much higher doses than the investigators intend have been used in the past). No studies have&#xD;
      assessed the value to patients of using low dose opioids in advanced COPD in addition to&#xD;
      conventional treatment. The investigators are planning a study that involves recording&#xD;
      interviews with about 30 patients and their partner or key family member before and after&#xD;
      starting treatment with low dose morphine, to understand their experiences with using&#xD;
      morphine. The investigators will also ask them to complete questionnaires about quality of&#xD;
      life, dyspnea, anxiety, depression and fear. Descriptions of experiences of using morphine&#xD;
      have the potential to inform patients, families, clinicians and professional societies about&#xD;
      the benefits and harms of opioid use for dyspnea in the advanced stages of a common serious&#xD;
      lung disease when traditional treatments often fail. The investigators will conduct the study&#xD;
      in both urban (Halifax and Saskatoon) and in a rural setting (New Brunswick). The&#xD;
      investigators' study of an inexpensive and widely available treatment has the potential to&#xD;
      improve care and outcomes in advanced COPD for the many Canadians living and dying with this&#xD;
      serious lung disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We define advanced COPD as including those with severe COPD by CTS criteria (i.e.,&#xD;
             severe shortness of breath resulting in the patient being too breathless to leave the&#xD;
             house, or breathlessness after dressing/undressing (i.e., Medical Research Council&#xD;
             (MRC) score of 5), or the presence of chronic respiratory failure (PaCO2&gt;45) or&#xD;
             clinical signs of right heart failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will also include patients who are short of breath and stop walking after about 100&#xD;
             meters or a few minutes on the level (MRC score 4) with at least one the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  BMI &lt; 21;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  post-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 30% predicted;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  one or more hospital admissions for acute exacerbation of COPD in the previous&#xD;
                  year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRC 4 patients will be recruited only if their baseline Chronic Respiratory&#xD;
             Questionnaire - dyspnea domain (CRQ-D) score is &lt; 5, an entry criterion used in a&#xD;
             Canadian RCT involving patients with advanced lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and/or caregivers with cognitive or other difficulties that would preclude&#xD;
             questionnaire completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to speak or understand English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients considered to be dying or with an expected survival of less than 2 months.&#xD;
