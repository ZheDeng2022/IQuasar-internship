      This study is being done to determine whether a substance called hematoporphyrin can be used&#xD;
      to treat tumors in various locations in the body when used in association with a laser.&#xD;
      Hematoporphyrin is a substance that is taken up by cancerous cells. When these cells are&#xD;
      exposed to the energy emitted by a laser source, chemical reactions occur in the cell and&#xD;
      cause the cells to die. It is hoped that this treatment method may be able to selectively&#xD;
      destroy malignant cells without damaging surrounding healthy tissue.&#xD;

      Lung cancer is currently the leading cause of death in both women and men in the United&#xD;
      States and continues to be a major problem in several other countries in the world.&#xD;
      Detection, localization, and surgical treatment at an early stage, provides the best&#xD;
      opportunity for long-term survival for patients with non-sma11 cell lung cancer at this time.&#xD;
      Studies examining the utility of screening patients at high risk for lung cancer with sputum&#xD;
      cytology and chest roentgenograms showed that, despite a higher frequency of detecting and&#xD;
      resecting early cancers in the screened group, there was no difference between the screened&#xD;
      group and the control group in overall cancer mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an alternative to&#xD;
      surgical resection in patients with early stage) roentgenographically occult squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the lung who are candidates for surgery. If PDT is successful, it would remove&#xD;
      the indication for surgery and eliminate the need for an operation. The specific goals are to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of PDT on these patients by determining the percentage of patients who&#xD;
      are spared surgery as wel1 as the following: morbidity, overall mortality, lung cancer&#xD;
      mortality, the rate of subsequent lung cancer, the relative cost of PDT and surgery, the&#xD;
      change in pulmonary function over time, the effect on quality of life, and the patient&#xD;
      preferences for PDT and surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Photodynamic Procedure:&#xD;
Photofrin II will be injected at a dosage of 2 mm/Kg intravenously. Laser treatment will take place 40-50 hours later. An argon-dye or an excimer-dye laser tuned to 620-630 nm will be used.&#xD;
It is anticipated that a microlens fiber will be used in almost all cases, but a cylinder-diffusing fiber can be used to treat lesions in segmental bronchi if needed.&#xD;
Argon-dye laser: Power settings 200 milliwatt (mW) microlens and 400 mW for cylinder Excimer laser: 4 milliJoules (mJoules)/pulse at 30 hertz for the microlens&#xD;
Energy density:&#xD;
Argon-dye laser: 200-300 Joules/cm^2 Excimer-dye laser: 100-200 Joules/cm^2</description>
