      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The influenza A virus can cause infections that lead to fever, cough, muscle aches,&#xD;
           diarrhea, and headaches, and can even be fatal in some people. Seasonal influenza kills&#xD;
           an estimated 36,000 people in the United States each year. In addition, more than&#xD;
           200,000 people are hospitalized for flu-related complications. Influenza A has a&#xD;
           substantial health effect on every age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, treatments are available for influenza A, but there is concern that the rate&#xD;
           of complications or even death from this infection is still high despite treatment, and&#xD;
           that over time this virus may become resistant to these treatments. Researchers are&#xD;
           interested in developing a possible new treatment that uses antibodies against influenza&#xD;
           A virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect plasma (the liquid component of blood containing antibodies) from people who&#xD;
      have high levels of antibodies against the influenza A virus because they either have been&#xD;
      previously infected with the virus or have been vaccinated against the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy male volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age who are eligible to donate blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals must have previously either recovered from influenza infection or have been&#xD;
           vaccinated against the infection, and may be subject to other restrictions on&#xD;
           participating in National Institutes of Health research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers will undergo apheresis, an outpatient procedure in which researchers will&#xD;
           collect plasma containing antibodies against the influenza virus by drawing blood into a&#xD;
           special machine that separates blood cells from the liquid portion under sterile&#xD;
           conditions and then returns the blood cells to the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers will be screened with blood tests to ensure that they are eligible to&#xD;
           participate and donate blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers are asked to undergo at least 3 sessions of apheresis; if willing, they can&#xD;
           volunteer to participate in up to 20 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After plasma is collected, it will be tested to ensure that it can be used to safely&#xD;
           develop treatments for patients who have influenza A infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two types of influenza A widely circulate in humans and cause seasonal outbreaks and&#xD;
      epidemics - H1N1 (swine flu) and H3N2 (a subtype abundant in seasonal influenza). During the&#xD;
      2009-2010 influenza season, the most commonly reported virus was influenza A (H1N1). However,&#xD;
      during the 2010-2011 influenza season, the most commonly reported virus was influenza A&#xD;
      (H3N2), but influenza A (H1N1) viruses and influenza B viruses circulated as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A certain age group may be hit harder by one type of influenza virus than another (for&#xD;
      example, the 2009 H1N1 virus disproportionately affected people younger than 65 years of age&#xD;
      rather than those older than 65, whereas H3N2 virus often affects those older than 65 years).&#xD;
      However, influenza A has a substantial health effect on every age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the limited therapeutic options for influenza and significant morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      despite treatment, additional therapeutics are warranted. One potential therapeutic that is&#xD;
      fairly rapidly available is the use of anti-influenza A immune plasma as immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is collection of anti-influenza A immune plasma from male&#xD;
      volunteers that meet criteria for use in human plasma therapy studies. The use of plasma from&#xD;
      male donors will minimize the risk of transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), which&#xD;
      has been associated with antibodies (likely generated during pregnancy) found in female&#xD;
      plasma. For this reason, only male donors will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol does not administer any investigational product, but rather collects plasma&#xD;
      from subjects with a high anti-influenza A antibody titer (convalescent survivors of&#xD;
      influenza infection or recipients of a licensed influenza vaccine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following screening of potential subjects to identify those who are not eligible to&#xD;
      participate in plasma donations and to determine the likelihood of having antibodies to&#xD;
      influenza A (H1N1 or H3N2) from a recent infection or immunization, enrolled subjects will&#xD;
      receive a baseline physical and laboratory examination. Eligible subjects with high influenza&#xD;
      A hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers will then be scheduled for at least 3 (and up to&#xD;
      20) plasma collection sessions. Following testing of the collected plasma for potential&#xD;
      pathogens, it may be used as therapeutic plasma, and/or it may be used for the manufacturing&#xD;
      of high titer anti-influenza A intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). Both options would support&#xD;
      clinical trials aimed at developing additional therapeutics for influenza infection.&#xD;
