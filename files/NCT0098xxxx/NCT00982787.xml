  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase II clinical trial will be to see if a botanical extract from the&#xD;
      plant Passiflora incarnata can improve seizure control and reduce anxiety in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with partial epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will randomize approximately 25 participants with partial epilepsy for this&#xD;
      placebo controlled, double blind, and crossover study. All patients will be scheduled for 10&#xD;
      clinic visits and four telephone visits during the 32-week period of the trial. After&#xD;
      enrollment into the study, all participants will begin a 9-week observation phase, which&#xD;
      serves as an individual baseline control. After 9 weeks participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either study drug or placebo for an 11 week study period. After completion of the 11&#xD;
      week study period, patients will crossover to the other study drug/placebo arm for another 11&#xD;
      weeks. Epilepsy participants will continue taking their anti-epileptic medication as&#xD;
      currently prescribed. The investigators will find participants through the OHSU clinics, by&#xD;
      notifying local neurologists, anthroposophical and naturopathic practices, and by advertising&#xD;
      the study via the local chapter of the American Epilepsy Society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine blood tests, physical examinations and tests to monitor heart, brain and muscle&#xD;
      activities will screen for any adverse effects. The primary outcome measure will be seizure&#xD;
      frequency through seizure diaries. Attention and performance tests, neurological and quality&#xD;
      of life questionnaires will be completed to assess the secondary outcome measures of anxiety,&#xD;
      cognitive function and quality of life.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-70 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reliable history of seizure semiology, EEG or EEG video telemetry confirming the&#xD;
             diagnosis of partial epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seizure frequency of at least 6 complex partial seizures over the 9 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment, with no 3 week period with less than one seizure, in spite of adequate&#xD;
             treatment with a stable anticonvulsant dosage with one or two anticonvulsants for at&#xD;
             least one month. Every seizure in a cluster will count as a separate seizure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to maintain current anticonvulsant dosage for 32 weeks. Tapering off a third&#xD;
             anticonvulsant up to one month prior to enrollment to allow study participation is&#xD;
             permitted. Consent will be obtained prior to tapering of a third anticonvulsant.&#xD;
             Habitual use of an additional rescue medication such as lorazepam for excess seizure&#xD;
             activity is permitted but not more frequently than once every three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential need to have a negative urine pregnancy test and&#xD;
             practice two simultaneous methods of birth control, which may not include oral&#xD;
             contraceptives. Due to drug interactions, oral contraceptives are not considered a&#xD;
             safe method of birth control in patients using anticonvulsant medications. Women who&#xD;
             are at least two years post-menopausal will be exempt from the pregnancy test or birth&#xD;
             control requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unreliable history of seizure semiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seizure frequency less than six complex partial seizures over 9 weeks or no seizure in&#xD;
             any 3-week period in the 9 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in whom it is anticipated that current standard of care would mandate a&#xD;
             change in their conventional epilepsy treatment during the time period of the study&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a widely fluctuating seizure frequency (good months and bad months) or a&#xD;
             history of status epilepsy will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are currently pregnant or lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other serious medical problems, such as brain tumors, cancer, stroke,&#xD;
             significant heart disease or psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or major&#xD;
             depression will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with progressive epilepsy syndromes, neurodegenerative disorders or dementia&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function as detected by abnormal BUN or&#xD;
             AST/ALT/alk phos on initial screening will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients at increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias (history of heart failure,&#xD;
             prolonged QTc &gt; 450 ms, family history of prolonged QT syndrome, hypokalemia, or those&#xD;
             using any diuretics or drugs which prolong the QT, see http://www.azcert.org) will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a high likelihood of psychogenic or non-epileptic seizures will be&#xD;
             excluded by the following method previously developed at the Oregon Health and Science&#xD;
             University (OHSU) epilepsy program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who use alcohol, drugs or have participated in another clinical trial in the&#xD;
             past 6 months, and patients who are found to be less than 80% compliant with their&#xD;
             documentation of seizure and medication diary will be excluded as will patients&#xD;
             unwilling to stop using oral contraceptives at the time of study enrollment. Patients&#xD;
             who agree to participate and are currently taking botanicals will be asked to&#xD;
             discontinue them at enrollment, as these may confound study results or cause safety&#xD;
             issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are found to have generalized spike and wave discharges, diagnostic of&#xD;
             primary generalized epilepsy, on their EEG will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
