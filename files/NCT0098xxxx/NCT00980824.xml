  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scotland has higher rates of suicide than other parts of the UK, an average rate of 15.1 per&#xD;
      100,000 in Scotland compared to 11.4 for England and Wales. The Scottish Government is&#xD;
      committed to reducing suicide by 2013. Choose Life has led to staff in services such as&#xD;
      Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) receiving recent training in suicide prevention through ASIST&#xD;
      and STORM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence for interventions specific to A&amp;E setting is limited despite the fact that this is&#xD;
      the most likely point of first contact with health services for people at risk of this&#xD;
      behaviour. Brief interventions that reduce repetition of self harm have not been particularly&#xD;
      effective partly because of poor attendance and lack of focus on comorbidity. We propose to&#xD;
      pilot an evaluation of a brief focused intervention, ENGAGE (based on MAnualised Cognitive&#xD;
      Therapy,MACT, developed by the investigator (Kate Davidson) and Prof Ulrike Schmidt of the&#xD;
      Institute of Psychiatry, London) for those who present at A&amp;E with a suicide attempt and who&#xD;
      have a complex presentation - a combination of substance abuse and or personality disorder,&#xD;
      all of which are recognized as high risk factors for suicide. ENGAGE will specifically&#xD;
      encourage patients to seek appropriate services to meet their mental health needs. This pilot&#xD;
      will allow us to assess the feasibility of a full scale study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory single centre, randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention&#xD;
      based on cognitive behavioural therapy principles for patients with a recent episode of&#xD;
      suicide and who have personality disorder/s and or substance abuse (complex comorbidity).&#xD;
      Patients who join the study will be randomly allocated to receive either ENGAGE CBT or&#xD;
      Treatment as Usual (TAU). We will compare the effectiveness of ENGAGE with TAU. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be engagement with services - the number of contacts with mental health services&#xD;
      (e.g. drug, alcohol and CMHT) in the 3 months following the participant's randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 30 patients seen in the hospital by the Liaison Team with a suicide attempt&#xD;
      who score above the threshold for personality disorder and drug or alcohol abuse using&#xD;
      SAPAS,AUDIT and DAST assessments. If the patient is interested in the study a research&#xD;
      assistant will obtain consent and conduct a baseline interview at which full personality&#xD;
      disorder diagnostic status will be confirmed and further psychological measures will be&#xD;
      taken. The patient will be randomised to ENGAGE (CBT) or TAU and interviewed again by the&#xD;
      research assistant at 3 months post randomisation. The research assistant will be blind to&#xD;
      treatment group. Those patients randomised to ENGAGE CBT will receive 6 sessions of the&#xD;
      intervention from a CBT therapist. ENGAGE will help patients to identify problems, use&#xD;
      problem solving to help prioritise and resolve problems and motivate patients to attend the&#xD;
      treatment recommended by the liaison team. The ENGAGE therapist will encourage and, if&#xD;
      necessary, facilitate patients with substance abuse and personality disorder to engage in the&#xD;
      appropriate NHS services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAU - usual treatment is the services that patients may already be involved in or services&#xD;
      that the patient has been referred to following the suicide episode.&#xD;
