      The main objective of this study is to test prospectively the performance of an algorithm&#xD;
      stratified by an index based on neutrophil counts in association with galactomannan assay and&#xD;
      image tests to start an antifungal early therapy (empirical/preemptive) in neutropenic&#xD;
      patients. Ths specific objectives are to determine the overall incidence of invasive fungal&#xD;
      infections, use of antifungal agents, duration of hospitalization and mortality in this&#xD;
      cohort, and to evaluate if this strategy is associated with a reduction in the expected use&#xD;
      of antifungal agents if a classical empiric antifungal strategy was used, without an increase&#xD;
      in the incidence of invasive fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, non randomized, non comparative study. Patients aged ≥ 18 years are&#xD;
      eligible if they have acute leukemia, myelodysplasia or other baseline disease submitted to&#xD;
      chemotherapy or to allogeneic stem cell transplantation with an expected duration of&#xD;
      neutropenia (neutrophil count &lt;500cells/mm³) of at least 10 days. Exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      patients with and a past history of or invasive mold infection and those who do not want to&#xD;
      participate. The study has no comparator arm. However, the investigators intend to determine&#xD;
      if the algorithm based on the D-index would result in a 50% reduction in the use of&#xD;
      antifungal agents, if all patients with persistent fever and neutropenia received empiric&#xD;
      antifungal therapy. Based on our database of ~2,000 episodes of febrile neutropenia, 36% of&#xD;
      patients had persistent fever between days 4 and 7 of antibiotics and would receive empiric&#xD;
      antifungal therapy. A total of 105 patients will be needed to demonstrate a 50% reduction in&#xD;
      antifungal use if the investigators compared this cohort with a matched control historical&#xD;
      cohort (alpha = 5%, beta = 20%).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neutropenia is a major risk factor for invasive fungal infections, particularly those caused&#xD;
      by moulds, such as Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp. and the Zygomycetes. Among neutropenic&#xD;
      patients, these invasive mould infections (IMI) occur almost exclusively in patients with&#xD;
      profound neutropenia (&lt;100 neutrophils/mm3) lasting more than 10-15 days [1-3]. Empiric&#xD;
      antifungal therapy is considered standard of care in patients with persistent or recurrent&#xD;
      fever and neutropenia. However using fever as the sole criterion for starting empiric&#xD;
      therapy, a significant number of patients will receive antifungal therapy unnecessarily,&#xD;
      particularly among recipients of fluconazole prophylaxis, because persistent fever in these&#xD;
      patients is commonly due to various factors, such as uncontrolled occult bacterial infection,&#xD;
      viral infection, drug fever and others [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative to empiric antifungal therapy is the preemptive treatment. In this strategy,&#xD;
      other markers (such as serology, radiology and clinical data) are added to persistent fever&#xD;
      [5,6]. One problem of such strategy is that the biomarkers currently in use (galactomannan&#xD;
      [GM], 1,3-beta-D-glucan and PCR) have high sensitivity. If one of these markers is used to&#xD;
      trigger the start of antifungal therapy, still a considerable number of patients will use&#xD;
      antifungal agents unnecessarily. However, a positive biomarker early in the course of&#xD;
      neutropenia most likely represents a false-positive result. By contrast, a positive biomarker&#xD;
      test late in the course of neutropenia is more likely to be a true positive. A problem is&#xD;
      that no cutoff value of duration of neutropenia is validated to help clinicians to identify&#xD;
      these 2 possibilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical parameter that evaluated the dynamics of neutropenia, combining intensity and&#xD;
      duration, could be a good tool to identify patients at high risk for IMI. This tool could be&#xD;
      used to stratify patients, helping clinicians to select appropriate candidates for early&#xD;
      antifungal therapy (empiric or preemptive) in persistently febrile neutropenic patients. We&#xD;
      developed an index (called D-index) that uses data from white blood cell counts (WBC), and&#xD;
      combines intensity and duration of neutropenia. This index was tested in patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia, and showed a good discriminatory performance in identifying patients with&#xD;
      IMI and without IMI. A cutoff was derived, and showed good sensitivity, specificity and a&#xD;
      very high negative predictive value (97 to 99%) [7]. The high negative predictive value of&#xD;
      this index is very similar to that obtained with GM and 1,3-beta-D-glucan in febrile&#xD;
      neutropenic patients [8,9]. With this regard, the D-index could be of help to assess the&#xD;
      pre-test probability of IMI and help to interpret the results of positive serum GM and / or&#xD;
      1,3-beta-D-glucan: patients with low values of D-index would be best interpreted as having&#xD;
      false-positive results of these tests. Similarly, positive biomarkers in the presence of a&#xD;
      high D-index would be more likely to be true positives, since the combination of different&#xD;
      tests may increase their positive predictive value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cohort study. The study will be submitted to the IRB and written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged ≥ 18 years are eligible if they have acute leukemia, myelodysplasia or other&#xD;
      underlying hematologic malignancy receiving chemotherapy with an expected duration of&#xD;
      neutropenia (&lt;500/mm3) &gt;10 days. This includes allogeneic (but not autologous) hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation. Patients with past history of IMI will be excluded, since for&#xD;
      these patients secondary prophylaxis is advised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled at initiation of chemotherapy and no later than 48h from the first&#xD;
      day of neutropenia. The same patient will be able to be enrolled more than once, but if he&#xD;
      develops IMI, he will be no longer eligible for a subsequent inclusion. All patients will&#xD;
      receive antimicrobial prophylaxis with fluconazole (400mg daily). Chest imaging (X-ray or CT&#xD;
      scan) will be performed at the enrollment. During the period of neutropenia induced by&#xD;
      chemotherapy/ conditioning regimen, patients will be surveyed for the development of fever&#xD;
      and will have the D-index calculated day by day. At the time of febrile neutropenia, at least&#xD;
      2 blood cultures will be collected. Other microbiologic exams will be obtained if clinically&#xD;
      indicated. The patients will then receive a broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic (cefepime).&#xD;
      Vancomycin will be added for patients who have clinically suspicion of catheter-related&#xD;
      infection or a blood culture yielding Gram-positive bacteria not yet identified. Serum will&#xD;
      be obtained 3 times a week for Aspergillus GM assay (Platelia Aspergillus; Bio-Rad) and&#xD;
      Aspergillus sp. PCR (in-house real time qualitative and quantitative PCR). A positive GM will&#xD;
      be defined as an index ≥ 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of persistent fever or a new fever, blood cultures will be collected and CT scans of&#xD;
      the chest and the sinuses will be performed. Results of GM will be checked and the patients&#xD;
      will be stratified according to the D-index as high, moderate or low risk for IMI. Based on&#xD;
      this analysis, antifungal therapy (caspofungin 70 mg day 1 and 50 mg/d thereafter) will be&#xD;
      started. In high risk patients (D index ≥ 5,800), the trigger for anti mold treatment will be&#xD;
      the presence of any image on CT scan or any positive GM. In the moderate risk (D-index&#xD;
      between 3,000 and 5,800), the trigger will be the presence of persistence of a positive GM in&#xD;
      consecutive tests. In this stratum, chest CT scan will be defined as indicative of antifungal&#xD;
      initiation only in the presence of one of the following: nodules &gt; 1 cm, with or without halo&#xD;
      sign, wedge-shaped images, or cavitation. For low-risk patients (D-index &lt;3,000), antifungal&#xD;
      treatment will be started only in the persistence of positive GM result in consecutive tests.&#xD;
      In situations in which antifungal treatment is not started, reassessment of these parameters&#xD;
      will be made at least twice a week with the evaluation of the D-index and biomarkers, and&#xD;
      once a week with CT scans. In patients with lung infiltrates, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)&#xD;
      will be taken, provided the patient is not hypoxemic or severely thrombocytopenic and&#xD;
      refractory to platelet transfusions. In the presence of findings in sinuses CT scans&#xD;
      suggestive of sinusitis, nasal endoscopy will be performed. BAL and sinus aspiration samples&#xD;
      will be processed for direct examination, culture, GM and Aspergillus PCR. Other diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures will be performed when clinically indicated. Autopsy will be performed in all&#xD;
      fatal cases after family authorization. Invasive fungal infection will be classified&#xD;
      according to the Revised Definitions from the European Organization for Research and&#xD;
      Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute&#xD;
      of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) Consensus Group [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the performance of risk stratification based on the D-index, the overall use of&#xD;
      antifungal treatment (al well as stratified by D-index) will be recorded, and reported by&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. The outcome of each risk stratus (low, moderate and high) will be&#xD;
      compared regarding: incidence of suspected and documented mold infection, use of anti mold&#xD;
      therapy, duration of hospitalization and death rate. In addition, the proportion of patients&#xD;
      receiving early antifungal treatment will be compared with empiric antifungal use in a&#xD;
      historical matched-control cohort. Patients from the 2 cohorts will be compared using&#xD;
      propensity score procedure. Propensity score analysis attempts to identify patients who are&#xD;
      similar except for their treatment. The analysis will be performed as follows: first, the&#xD;
      probability of any patient in the database to receive empiric antifungal therapy will be&#xD;
      estimated using a multivariate logistic regression model that incorporates baseline&#xD;
      characteristics, underlying diseases and co-morbidities. Next, we will match from the 2&#xD;
      cohorts patients with the nearest propensity score (the score generated by the multivariate&#xD;
      equation)[10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our database of ~2,000 episodes of febrile neutropenia, 36% of patients had&#xD;
      persistent fever between days 4 and 7 of antibiotics and would receive empiric antifungal&#xD;
      therapy. A total of 105 patients would be needed to demonstrate a 50% reduction in antifungal&#xD;
      use if we compared this cohort with a matched control historical cohort (alpha = 5%, beta =&#xD;
      20%).&#xD;
