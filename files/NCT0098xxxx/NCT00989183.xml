      The goals of this research proposal are to further our understanding of the reproductive&#xD;
      aging process in women and to improve our ability to clinically assess and model reproductive&#xD;
      aging. Reproductive aging is a continuous process that begins many years prior to menopause.&#xD;
      Women in their late 30s and early 40s usually maintain normal menstrual function and&#xD;
      ovulatory status, yet fertility in these women is considerably compromised compared to&#xD;
      younger women. The primary mechanism of reproductive aging is through the process of ovarian&#xD;
      primordial follicle (egg) depletion, a process that exhibits considerable variation between&#xD;
      women. As a result, the age at which an individual begins to experience infertility and&#xD;
      menstrual cycle changes secondary to follicle depletion also varies significantly and is&#xD;
      difficult to predict. Multiple studies have investigated the impact of lifestyle choices&#xD;
      (tobacco use, oral contraceptives, BMI, alcohol use, and parity) on reproductive lifespan by&#xD;
      correlating the impact of these exposures with the age of spontaneous menopause. Although&#xD;
      occasionally in agreement, many of these studies report contradictory findings. Alcohol use&#xD;
      either delays or has no effect upon the age of spontaneous menopause. Similarly, oral&#xD;
      contraceptive pill use has been suggested to both accelerate and delay the onset of&#xD;
      menopause. The most consistent findings regarding the impact of these factors is an&#xD;
      acceleration in the age of menopause by 1-2 years in smokers. Given the lack of consistent&#xD;
      findings in these investigations, the exact impact of lifestyle factors on reproductive age&#xD;
      is currently unknown. Nevertheless, the magnitude of such exposures in the U.S. population is&#xD;
      considerable, with 19% of adult women using oral contraceptives and 19.2% current smokers&#xD;
      according to recent statistics. This proposal seeks to develop better models of normal female&#xD;
      reproductive aging through anatomical studies investigating the impact of lifestyle choices&#xD;
      on ovarian primordial follicle number. A secondary aim is to determine the relationship&#xD;
      between newly described markers developed to assess biological aging in other organ systems&#xD;
      (white blood cell telomere length and the measurement of advanced glycation end products&#xD;
      (AGEs) through skin autofluorescence) and reproductive age.&#xD;

      In order to test the hypotheses, we will obtain whole ovaries (single or pairs) from 65&#xD;
      healthy females between the ages of 21 and 55 undergoing surgical oophorectomy at OU Medical&#xD;
      Center for benign indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  informed consent&#xD;

           ethanol, tobacco use and socioeconomic status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of FSH, estradiol, inhibin B, AMH, white-blood cells for telomere length,&#xD;
