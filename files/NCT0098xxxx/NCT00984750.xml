    <textblock>
      Decreased insulin sensitivity (or insulin resistance) is a major risk factor for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and renal and cardiovascular disease. It is the key component and,&#xD;
      possibly, a pathogenetic factor of the metabolic syndrome - a clustering of arterial&#xD;
      hypertension, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, coagulation abnormalities,&#xD;
      albuminuria and increased cardiovascular risk - that may precede or accompany type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin function and the abnormalities associated with insulin resistance, may have a major&#xD;
      role in preventing type 2 diabetes and, in the long-term, diabetes micro- and macrovascular&#xD;
      complications. Carnitine is involved in lipids and carbohydrates metabolism and&#xD;
      acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), an intramitochondrial carrier of acylic group, may modulate cell&#xD;
      fuel substrate utilization. Studies found that carnitine may improve insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      glucose disposal in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. A recent study&#xD;
      found that a primed constant infusion of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) may increase glucose&#xD;
      utilization in type 2 diabetic patients, possibly restoring the glycogen synthase activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous pilot study in healthy subjects with decreased insulin sensitivity, the&#xD;
      investigators found that 6-month treatment with Acetyl-L-Carnitine - an ester of l-carnitine&#xD;
      - improved the glucose disposal rate, taken as a marker of insulin sensitivity. Amelioration&#xD;
      of insulin sensitivity was associated with a significant and clinically relevant reduction in&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure without appreciable changes in diastolic blood pressure. Whether&#xD;
      blood pressure reduction reflected the amelioration of insulin sensitivity or, rather, a&#xD;
      direct, specific effect of Acetyl-L-Carnitine is still unknown.The antihypertensive effect&#xD;
      ensued progressively and slowly waned after treatment withdrawal as documented by a slow and&#xD;
      progressive increase in blood pressure levels toward baseline levels over the recovery&#xD;
      period. This finding provided convincing evidence that blood pressure reduction throughout&#xD;
      the observation period was not explained by a &quot;trial effect&quot;, but reflected a true treatment&#xD;
      effect. Blood pressure was a secondary efficacy variable of the study and mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the antihypertensive effect of Acetyl-L-Carnitine (such as reduced peripheral&#xD;
      resistances, decreased cardiac output, increased artery compliance and/or enhanced sodium&#xD;
      excretion), in this population were not assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetyl-L-Carnitine was well tolerated in all of the patients and may provide a novel&#xD;
      therapeutic tool for the treatment of arterial hypertension, and of dyslipidemia and could be&#xD;
      safely used in people with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial to investigate whether Acetyl-L-Carnitine added-on stable and standardized blood&#xD;
      pressure and lipid lowering therapy may help further improving control of hypertension and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia and, therefore, decreasing the overall cardiovascular risk in hypertensive&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND Arterial hypertension, in particular systolic hypertension, is a common component&#xD;
      of the metabolic syndrome, a syndrome of hypertension, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      impaired glucose tolerance and increased urinary albumin excretion sustained by decreased&#xD;
      tissue sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance). It affects 80 to 90% of people with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes and is the strongest risk factor for macrovascular and microvascular complications&#xD;
      of diabetes, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery disease, nephropathy&#xD;
      and retinopathy. Despite multi-drug therapy, reduction of systolic blood pressure to normal&#xD;
      range is seldom achievable in people with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, due to increased&#xD;
      vascular stiffness, reducing systolic blood pressure may decrease diastolic blood pressure to&#xD;
      the extent that diastolic myocardial perfusion is impaired and the risk of ischemic event&#xD;
      increased. Thus, availability of drugs that may help controlling systolic hypertension&#xD;
      without appreciably affecting diastolic blood pressure would have major clinical&#xD;
      implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia is also a component of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome that is almost invariably observed in people with type 2 diabetes and remarkably&#xD;
      contributes to the excess cardiovascular risk in this population. HMGCoA inhibition by statin&#xD;
      therapy, significantly ameliorates hypercholesterolemia, but only marginally affects the&#xD;
      concomitant hypertriglyceridemia (probably the most typical feature of increased insulin&#xD;
      resistance) and fails to significantly reduce the circulating levels of serum lipoprotein(a),&#xD;
      one of the strongest predictors of coronary and cerebrovascular events in type 2 diabetics.&#xD;
      Thus, availability of drugs that may help achieving a more effective amelioration of&#xD;
      dyslipidemia in this population might also have important clinical implications .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an ongoing study in healthy subjects with decreased insulin sensitivity, we found that&#xD;
      6-month treatment with acetylcarnitine - an ester of l-carnitine - improved the glucose&#xD;
      disposal rate, taken as a marker of insulin sensitivity. Amelioration of insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      was associated with a significant and clinically relevant reduction in systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure without appreciable changes in diastolic blood pressure. Whether blood pressure&#xD;
      reduction reflected the amelioration of insulin sensitivity or, rather, a direct, specific&#xD;
      effect of acetylcarnitine is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies also found that L-carnitine added on background simvastatin therapy,&#xD;
      marginally affected serum cholesterol, but remarkably reduced serum triglyceride and&#xD;
      lipoprotein (a) levels. Whether amelioration of insulin resistance may explain at least in&#xD;
      part this effect is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, all available clinical studies consistently showed that acetyl carnitine is a well&#xD;
      tolerated drug that can be safely used in humans. Experimental evidence is also available&#xD;
      that l-carnitine may improve statin-associated myotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS Primary To asses the effect of 6-month therapy with acetylcarnitine compared to placebo&#xD;
      on systolic blood pressure in 228 patients with type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia on stable background antihypertensive, hypoglycemic, and lipid lowering therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.To asses the effect of treatment on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diastolic and pulse pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serum triglycerides and apolipoprotein(a)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HOMA index (calculated during data analyses), serum insulin, leptin, adiponectin&#xD;
           (pending on the findings on the other efficacy variables)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood glucose, serum cholesterol (total, HDL and LDL), non-esterified fatty acids&#xD;
           (NEFA), lipoproteins A and and uric acid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-hours post oral load blood glucose profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  high density C-reactive protein (hsCRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urinary albumin excretion and estimated creatinine clearance (calculated during data&#xD;
           analyses)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiac output, peripheral resistances or large artery compliance (as assessed by&#xD;
           echocardiography in a representative subgroup)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 hour sodium excretion and sodium fractional clearance, in a representative subgroup&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  need for concomitant therapy with antihypertensive, hypoglycemic, and lipid lowering&#xD;
           agents&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.To assess whether the observed changes in systolic, diastolic or pulse pressures and in&#xD;
      lipid or metabolic profile correlate with the concomitant changes in markers of insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.To monitor systolic/diastolic blood pressure and other clinical/laboratory parameters&#xD;
      evaluated during the study two months after Acetyl-L-Carnitine therapy or Placebo withdrawal&#xD;
      in patients completing the study and maintained on the same background medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN The study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      multicenter trial.&#xD;
