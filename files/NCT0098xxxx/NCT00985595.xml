  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to test the effectiveness, implementation quality, and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of family-based treatment services for adolescent substance abuse delivered in&#xD;
      an agency setting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the success of family-based ecological interventions (FBEI) in controlled trials,&#xD;
      this highly promising services approach has not been tested under pure field conditions with&#xD;
      ASA populations. Controlled effectiveness research invariably enhances training, supervision,&#xD;
      and service delivery conditions in partnering sites in an effort to ensure treatment&#xD;
      adherence and consistency. An alternative strategy for advancing dissemination science is&#xD;
      rigorous naturalistic research on community clinics that already implement evidence-based&#xD;
      practices in the course of routine care. The proposed study will follow this &quot;bottom up&quot;&#xD;
      strategy by investigating the quality and impact of ASA services delivered by front-line&#xD;
      therapists in a community-based mental health center that already features FBEI as the&#xD;
      routine standard of care. The study will use a randomized design to compare naturalistic FBEI&#xD;
      services to services as usual (SAU) for ASA. Participants (N = 260) will be recruited from&#xD;
      local high schools, enrichment programs, and juvenile justice programs. Eligible adolescents&#xD;
      will meet ASAM criteria for outpatient treatment. The SAU condition will contain the three&#xD;
      most common service venues for ASA in urban communities: hospital-based ambulatory mental&#xD;
      health clinics, drug counseling/addictions specialty clinics, and community mental health&#xD;
      centers. The primary aims of the study are to examine the effectiveness of FBEI versus SAU&#xD;
      and to compare the strength of FBEI adherence and outcomes to performance benchmarks set&#xD;
      during a previous FBEI Stage II efficacy trial. The secondary aims are to compare cost&#xD;
      effectiveness, services utilization, and consumer satisfaction in FBEI versus SAU. A&#xD;
      multitrait, multimethod assessment design will include adolescent and parent interviews at&#xD;
      baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. Cost and service utilization data will be&#xD;
      collected from self report and from provider agencies in both conditions. The study will&#xD;
      yield the first evidence on whether a widely endorsed treatment approach for ASA is potent&#xD;
      and feasible in real-world conditions and superior to SAU in outcomes and cost-benefit. An&#xD;
      important secondary yield will be increasing the scarce knowledge base on commonly practiced&#xD;
      community approaches in the SAU condition.&#xD;

        Adolescents screened for symptoms of substance abuse/dependence, and their families, will&#xD;
        participate in the study. Participants will include 260 male and female adolescents who&#xD;
        complete the enrollment process, meet eligibility criteria, and consent to be randomized&#xD;
        into one of two study conditions. Youth will be referred primarily from two sources:&#xD;
        juvenile justice agencies and local schools/community programs. Based on the demographics&#xD;
        of adolescents currently participating in partner sites, youth are likely to be&#xD;
        predominantly male (69%), Hispanic (68%), and African American (32%). Families are&#xD;
        generally low income from disadvantaged neighborhoods, with high rates of family mental&#xD;
        health and substance use problems.&#xD;
