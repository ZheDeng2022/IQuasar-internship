  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' aim is to implement an intervention to increase aspirin prophylaxis use&#xD;
      among patients that is patient initiated, optimizes use of physician and staff time,&#xD;
      appropriately compensates staff, provides clinicians with tools necessary for managing&#xD;
      aspiring prophylaxis, and ensures continuous management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This intervention addresses a fundamental question of how clinicians need to be directly&#xD;
      involved in motivating behavior change (i.e., aspirin prophylaxis). While complex behavior&#xD;
      change likely demands high levels of involvement, a single simple action (aspirin&#xD;
      prophylaxis) may not require such complex interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to compare the effectiveness of three models of care in a rigorous randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial that will consist of a 3-arm, within-clinic design in which patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the physician-initiated, the patient-initiated model, or to a control&#xD;
      group in which usual care is delivered. In a patient-initiated model, patients are active&#xD;
      participants in their own care and receive a pre-visit summary that contains an&#xD;
      individualized risk assessment and patient education. In the physician-initiated model,&#xD;
      patients receive the pre-visit summary and the physician uses a clinical decision support&#xD;
      tool through the electronic health record that details the patient risk of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the proposed work are to compare the reliability and overall&#xD;
      effectiveness of two different methods for motivating patients to take aspirin to prevent&#xD;
      stroke and heart attacks as well as to develop a plan for translating the intervention into a&#xD;
      process that is suitable for a paper-based clinic.&#xD;

The clinical decision sharing tool informs the physician of the patient's heart attack or stroke risk and determines if the patient would benefit from aspirin use.</description>
