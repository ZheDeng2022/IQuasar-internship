  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess, whether the administration of a proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitor, Rabeprazole, has a negative effect on the activity of a concomitantly administered&#xD;
      blood thinner drug. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI's) are prescribed for patients with gastric&#xD;
      problems to reduce the gastric acid secretion. The blood thinner drug, Clopidogrel,&#xD;
      administered in this trial is approved for the treatment of mild heart attacks; it works by&#xD;
      preventing blood platelets from sticking together to form clots that would restrict blood&#xD;
      flow. Previous trials have shown that the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole interacts with the&#xD;
      blood thinning drug clopidogrel to reduce the active form of clopidogrel, thereby preventing&#xD;
      the drug's blood thinning effect. In this trial, the effect of two different proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitors, namely rabeprazole and omeprazole on the activity of the blood thinner drug&#xD;
      clopidogrel will be assessed and compared to the effect of placebo on the activity of the&#xD;
      blood thinner drug clopidogrel. This will be done in three sequential periods and each of the&#xD;
      patients enrolled into this trial will be asked to participate in three different periods,&#xD;
      during which clopidogrel with either rabeprazol, or omeprazol, or placebo will be&#xD;
      administered daily.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label trial (investigators and patients know, what medication is administered),&#xD;
      participants will in the course of three different periods, receive three different&#xD;
      combinations of study drugs, namely either clopidogrel combined with rabeprazole, or&#xD;
      clopidogrel combined with omeprazole or clopidogrel combined with placebo. Each of these&#xD;
      treatment periods will last 7 days and will be interrupted by 2 to 3 weeks without any&#xD;
      medication. The goal is to recruit a total of 36 healthy volunteers for all three periods.&#xD;
      Clopidogrel is a blood thinner drug that acts on the platelet cell membrane. By this&#xD;
      mechanism, clopidogrel inhibits the platelets aggregation. Clopidogrel is a prodrug, meaning&#xD;
      that it is orally administrated as an inactive drug and must be activated through several&#xD;
      biochemical steps to acquire its antiplatelet properties. This process takes place in the&#xD;
      liver and implies a complex enzymatic system. A part of this enzymatic system, called&#xD;
      cytochrome 2C19 (CYP2C19) has an important role in the metabolism of the clopidogrel and of&#xD;
      other drugs. One of the drugs, which is also metabolized through this system is the proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitor (PPI) omeprazole. If omeprazole is given concomitantly with clopidogrel, the&#xD;
      metabolism of clopidogrel is inhibited and as a consequence, the therapeutic activity of&#xD;
      clopidogrel is reduced. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitor rabeprazole, whose metabolism is much less dependent on CYP2C19, interferes less&#xD;
      with clopidogrel bioactivation and could thus be proposed as an alternative to other PPIs to&#xD;
      patients taking clopidogrel. To confirm that rabeprazole has no clinically relevant effect on&#xD;
      the metabolism of clopidogrel, one session is performed with placebo tablets in combination&#xD;
      with clopidogrel. Each patient will receive 2 types of study drug during 3 separate periods;&#xD;
      either one tablet clopidogrel (75 mg) combined with rabeprazole, or clopidogrel (75 mg)&#xD;
      combined with omeprazole or clopidogrel (75 mg) combined with placebo. Each of these&#xD;
      treatment periods will last 7 days and will be interrupted by 2 to 3 weeks without any&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
