    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety of therapy with nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      and CsA and if the addition of Cyclosporine A (CsA) to nab-paclitaxel helps stop cancer cells&#xD;
      as well as or better than nab-paclitaxel alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for metastatic breast cancer commonly involves the use of the chemotherapy drug&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel. Nab-paclitaxel is a special preparation of paclitaxel inside a protein layer&#xD;
      of albumin. Other studies have shown Cyclosporine A (CsA) may block the progression of&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer. The combination of nab-paclitaxel and CsA is considered&#xD;
      investigational which means it has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration,&#xD;
      FDA. Participants on this study will receive nab-paclitaxel through a vein in the arm weekly&#xD;
      3 weeks out of 4, in the outpatient clinic. On the same day as the first infusion of&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel, participants will begin taking CsA tablets twice a day by mouth. Participants&#xD;
      will continue to receive study treatment as long as their tumor responds. If the tumor does&#xD;
      not respond or the participant experience severe side effects from study treatment, she will&#xD;
      be removed from the study and offered other therapies, if that is appropriate.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female or male patients with adenocarcinoma of the breast with metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have evaluable or measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and&#xD;
             for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she&#xD;
             is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had any major surgery, hormonal therapy (other than replacement),&#xD;
             chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)&#xD;
             prior to entering the study or patients who have not recovered from adverse events due&#xD;
             to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Prior nab-paclitaxel is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or receiving concurrent&#xD;
             anticancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease or active&#xD;
             neurologic impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Cyclosporine A or nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating (Cyclosporine A is excreted into breast milk) females&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with GI tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication,&#xD;
             malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures&#xD;
             affecting absorption, uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's, ulcerative&#xD;
             colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are excluded since Cyclosporine A may result in further&#xD;
             immunosuppression&#xD;
