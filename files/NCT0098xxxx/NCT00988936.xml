      A Pilot Phase II Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the usefulness of [F-18]RGD-K5 PET/CT to predict efficacy or early response&#xD;
           to Avastin® (the anti-angiogenesis drug) plus chemotherapy treatment before the full&#xD;
           course of treatment is completed&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives for this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To continue safety evaluation by collection of safety data from all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gain experience with [F-18]RGD-K5 PET/CT in order to improve the study design and&#xD;
           conduct of future studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: An open label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, single group assignment, pilot efficacy&#xD;
      study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Screening visit (3-4 hrs), pre-treatment imaging visit of [F-18]RGD-K5 PET/CT (~&#xD;
      3-4 hrs) and the standard [F-18]FDG PET/CT (~ 3-4 hrs) or diagnostic CT, followed by two&#xD;
      [F-18]RGD-K5 PET/CT scans, one after the second but before the third Avastin® treatment, and&#xD;
      one after the fourth but before the fifth Avastin® treatment, and a follow up standard&#xD;
      [F-18]FDG PET (~ 3-4 hrs) or diagnostic CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Informed consent, collection of demographic information, medical history, blood&#xD;
      labs, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, three sets of [F-18]RGD-K5 dosing and imaging&#xD;
      scans including pretreatment, early mid-treatment, and later mid-treatment, concomitant&#xD;
      medication collection, adverse event monitoring, and assessment of tumor response to&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Approximately forty (40) patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer,&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer, metastatic colon or rectum cancer who will receive chemotherapy&#xD;
      plus Avastin®. This allows for approximately 30 evaluable patients to complete this study at&#xD;
      approximately four to eight sites internationally&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to examine the utility of a new molecular imaging tracer,&#xD;
      [F-18]RGD-K5 to monitor treatment responses in patients scheduled to undergo treatment with&#xD;
      Avastin® (Bevacizumab) plus standard chemotherapy. The changes of [F-18]RGD-K5 PET/CT image&#xD;
      scans between before treatment and after both mid-treatment cycles of Avastin® (Bevacizumab)&#xD;
      will be evaluated. The hypothesis for this study is that changes in the uptake of&#xD;
      [F-18]RGD-K5 PET in tumors may reflect changes in the level of integrin expression and/or&#xD;
      angiogenesis. This pilot study will help to define if changes in uptake of [F-18]RGD-K5 are&#xD;
      an early indicator of treatment efficacy to Avastin®.&#xD;
