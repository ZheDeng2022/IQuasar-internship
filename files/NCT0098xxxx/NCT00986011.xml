      RATIONALE: Overweight and obesity have been associated with multiple types of disease,&#xD;
      including cancer. Living in a smart growth community may encourage behaviors that would&#xD;
      reduce the risk of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at the effect of a smart growth community on&#xD;
      prevention of obesity in middle-, moderately low- and low-income families.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of the whole set as well as individual smart growth principles&#xD;
           on prevention of obesity risk in middle, moderately low, and low-income families who&#xD;
           reside in a smart growth community, the Preserve, compared to two types of control&#xD;
           groups of families who reside in other communities that may naturally vary in exposure&#xD;
           to these principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the longitudinal-mediational relationship between increased activity and&#xD;
           pro-health attitudes achieved in the smart growth community to lower obesity risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify trajectories of physical activity over time and evaluate their relationship&#xD;
           to obesity risk, including high-stable, early-onset stable, early-onset short-term, and&#xD;
           low-stable trajectories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary (exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate demographic x type of community (smart growth vs other) interactions (with&#xD;
           the major ethnic groups representing Hispanic vs white), gender, parent vs child on&#xD;
           outcomes, as well as on obesogenic trajectories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate a possible &quot;chaining&quot; or translational effect, i.e., whether effects of&#xD;
           living in a smart growth community generalize to changes in eating behavior as part of a&#xD;
           general change in health attitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether neighborhoods where physical activity actually takes place (defined as&#xD;
           0.5 square-mile area and 10-15 walking distance from residence, school [for children],&#xD;
           work or equivalent [for index adult], and leisure), contribute significantly to physical&#xD;
           activity and eating behavior beyond the effect of smart growth community residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether some individual smart growth principles may have a relatively&#xD;
           greater impact on obesity risk than others, in both intervention and control&#xD;
           communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether physical activity trajectories other than those hypothesized can be&#xD;
           identified for their predictive relationship to obesity prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants receive an accelerometer monitor and are instructed to wear it for 7&#xD;
      continuous days (except when sleeping, bathing, or swimming) on the right hip attached to an&#xD;
      adjusted belt to assess physical activity. Participants also undergo anthropometric measures&#xD;
      (height and weight) using a calibrated digital scale and professional stadiometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete surveys and questionnaires on Self-reported Physical Activity,&#xD;
      Self-reported Dietary Intake, and Social Network Survey. Participants also complete other&#xD;
      self-reported items assessing demographic characteristics, family finances, health status,&#xD;
      health history, length of current residence, home-relocation patterns, time use and&#xD;
      transportation patterns, substance use, depression, sleeping habits, fast-food consumption,&#xD;
      and school and work addresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 390 families living in The Preserve, 195 families who were not&#xD;
      chosen to live in The Preserve, and 195 control families who live in the surrounding area&#xD;
      will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
