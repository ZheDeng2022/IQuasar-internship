  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. With ageing of the&#xD;
      population, glaucoma morbidity will rise, causing increased health care costs and economic&#xD;
      burden for a condition in which visual loss, once established, cannot be reversed. In&#xD;
      contrast to western countries, primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is a major form of&#xD;
      glaucoma in Asia. In a recent population based survey in Singapore, the prevalence of&#xD;
      glaucoma was 3.2% in the Chinese population over 40. Glaucoma was the leading cause of&#xD;
      blindness, with PACG the most visually destructive form of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser iridotomy is the current first line treatment for PACG. It acts by relieving pupil&#xD;
      block, which in turn may reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) and prevent progression of&#xD;
      glaucoma. However recent data indicate that iridotomy is not successful in controlling IOP in&#xD;
      the long term, and the majority of cases develop a clinically significant rise in IOP&#xD;
      requiring medical therapy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty (ALPI) offers a new therapeutic option for PACG. The&#xD;
      procedure consists of placing contraction burns in the iris periphery which results in&#xD;
      contraction of the iris stroma and opening of the angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a 2-centre randomized controlled trial to determine whether ALPI is an&#xD;
      effective and safe treatment in the management of PACG. 210 patients with PACG and high IOP&#xD;
      (&gt;21 mmHg) following laser iridotomy will be randomized to receive ALPI or medical treatment&#xD;
      to achieve IOP control. Subjects will be followed up for 12 months and the outcome criteria&#xD;
      will be the rate of medical treatment and surgery in each group, and the angle width and&#xD;
      configuration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first RCT worldwide to address the role of ALPI in PACG. The study findings&#xD;
      will have great relevance for the prevention of glaucoma blindness in the elderly.&#xD;

      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to determine whether argon laser peripheral iridoplasty&#xD;
      (ALPI) is an effective treatment in terms of intraocular pressure (IOP) control for cases of&#xD;
      primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) in which the drainage angle remains narrow following&#xD;
      laser iridotomy. Primary outcome measures will be the proportion of patients requiring&#xD;
      medical or surgical treatment to maintain IOP control, number of medications required to&#xD;
      control IOP at 12 months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is determine whether ALPI significantly alters the configuration of the&#xD;
      drainage angle when compared with conventional treatment (medication) following laser&#xD;
      iridotomy. Secondary outcomes will be the change in appearance of the drainage angle based on&#xD;
      gonioscopy, ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior segment OCT at 1, 6 and 12 months follow&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of ALPI and the detrimental effects of iridoplasty on the corneal endothelium and&#xD;
      the lens will also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design for this project is a prospective randomized controlled trial. It will not&#xD;
      be possible to blind either the subject or observer to the intervention due to the use of&#xD;
      laser in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be patients with primary angle closure glaucoma attending the&#xD;
      Singapore National Eye Centre and National University Hospital, who fulfil the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and are willing to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wash out regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients who are already on one or two-glaucoma medications are required to complete&#xD;
      a washout period before being randomized. Washout periods will vary according to the previous&#xD;
      medication used and are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostaglandin analogues 4 weeks Beta blockers 3 weeks Adrenergic agonist 2 weeks Cholinergic&#xD;
      agonist 5 days Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-study washout period check&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are on prostaglandin analogues or beta blockers prior to the study will be&#xD;
      required to undergo a washout period of 3 and 4 weeks respectively prior to the study. For&#xD;
      this group of patients, there will be a safety check during the second week. Patients whose&#xD;
      IOP&gt;30 mm Hg during this washout check will be stopped from further washout and be withdrawn&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLANNED INTERVENTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iridoplasty group&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those randomised to laser iridoplasty, the procedure will be performed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drop of brimonidine will be instilled in to the eye to be treated 15 minutes prior to the&#xD;
      procedure. Topical anaesthesia will be administered and an Abrahams lens used for the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser burns will be placed over 360 degrees of the peripheral iris (approximately 25 burns in&#xD;
      total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The argon laser setting used are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial treatment (SEAGIG Guidelines) 28 We request to modify our laser settings for initial&#xD;
      treatment in the laser arm to Spot size: 200-500 microns (changed from 500 microns) Power:&#xD;
      150-400 milliwatts (mw) increasing until desired end point is achieved (changed from&#xD;
      100-300mw) Duration: 0.2 -0.5 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat treatment (one month - three months) Laser settings 29 Spot size: 200 microns Power:&#xD;
      100-300 milliwatts increasing until desired end point is achieved Duration: 0.5 -0.7 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given a 2 week course of topical steroids four times a day for the&#xD;
      treated eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraocular pressure will be checked one hour after the procedure. IOP spikes &gt; 25mmHg will&#xD;
      be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RE-TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at follow up the angle remains as narrow as before on gonioscopy and UBM/ ASOCT then one&#xD;
      further treatment of ALPI will be given to the patient to try and achieve the endpoint of&#xD;
      widening the angle. This treatment will be administered between one and three months&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL GROUP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients randomized to the control group will not undergo further procedures at this&#xD;
      visit. The patients will be commenced on topical treatment to lower the IOP. The first line&#xD;
      agent for lowering IOP will be a prostaglandin analogue, and a stepwise addition of Timoptol&#xD;
      0.5% or dorzolamide will be implemented until IOP is controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If both eyes of an individual patient fulfil the inclusion criteria they will both undergo&#xD;
      intervention as allocated by randomization of the patient. (see randomization and data&#xD;
      analysis)&#xD;
