  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether inhaled iloprost is safe and effective in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension who are sick in the intensive care unit.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is used in the management of all causes of pediatric pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension. Despite widespread use of nitric oxide to treat critically ill&#xD;
      mechanically-ventilated pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension, response to therapy&#xD;
      is not universal. Nitric oxide fails to improve oxygenation in approximately 30% of these&#xD;
      patients. Nonresponders to nitric oxide have few treatment options. Iloprost is the only&#xD;
      other medication approved for inhalational delivery in the treatment of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension. Inhalation therapy for pulmonary vasodilatation in critically ill children is&#xD;
      inherently more attractive than oral or intravenous therapies due to the ability to deliver&#xD;
      medication directly to the lung and to decrease systemic effects. The use of inhaled iloprost&#xD;
      has been reported to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance in many pediatric pathologic&#xD;
      settings, including combination therapy with nitric oxide.&#xD;
