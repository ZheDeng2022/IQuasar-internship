    <textblock>
      To date, the majority of microbicide research has focused on the assessment of the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of vaginal microbicides used for the prevention of HIV transmission via the&#xD;
      vaginal compartment. Receptive anal intercourse (RAI) is common among men who have sex with&#xD;
      men (MSM), and there is increasing evidence that heterosexual women in the developed and&#xD;
      developing world also practice anal sex. It can, therefore, be anticipated that once vaginal&#xD;
      microbicides are licensed, they will be used in both the vaginal and rectal compartments. As&#xD;
      a consequence, there is a need to evaluate both the rectal and vaginal safety profile of&#xD;
      candidate microbicides. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      systemic safety of 1% vaginally formulated tenofovir gel applied rectally. In addition, this&#xD;
      study will evaluate the immunotoxicity of the gel and evaluate its acceptability; it will&#xD;
      also use the oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (TDF), rectally-applied tenofovir&#xD;
      gel,and a placebo gel to compare their systemic and compartmental pharmacokinetic (pK)&#xD;
      profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to address the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaginally-formulated tenofovir 1% topical gel when applied rectally will be safe using a&#xD;
           combination of clinical and laboratory markers including assays specifically designed to&#xD;
           measure mucosal toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tenofovir will be detectable at different concentrations in the various anatomic&#xD;
           compartments sampled for pharmacokinetics following single and 7-day topical exposures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exposure to tenofovir 1% gel will demonstrate prevention of ex vivo HIV-1 challenge&#xD;
           using in vivo drug-exposed tissue as compared to baseline tissue samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orally delivered, single dose, 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets will have&#xD;
           similar safety profiles using routine blood safety indices as have been established in&#xD;
           other trials and will show no mucosal safety concerns&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The oral dose will have different multi-compartment concentration kinetics than the&#xD;
           topical tenofovir and will also demonstrate preliminary (ex vivo) prevention using the&#xD;
           explant infectivity assay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaginally formulated tenofovir 1% topical gel applied rectally will be acceptable to&#xD;
           participants, as indicated by a score in the upper one third of the 10-point Likert&#xD;
           scale on intentionality to use in the product in the future&#xD;
