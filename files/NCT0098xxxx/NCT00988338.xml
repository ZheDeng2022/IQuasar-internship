  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to utilize Trinity Evolution as a graft source in foot/ankle&#xD;
      fusions and to follow the subjects to measure the clinical outcomes and fusion rate. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of the study is that Trinity Evolution will result in fusion rates and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes similar to those obtained from autograft and other routinely used allograft&#xD;
      materials; these include: fusion, improvement in pain, improvement in function, and absence&#xD;
      of adverse events related to the use of the graft source.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic arthritic conditions of the foot and ankle including osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      post-traumatic arthritis, inflammatory arthropathies and others can be painful and disabling&#xD;
      conditions that lead to a reduced quality of life. Major symptoms include pain, stiffness,&#xD;
      swelling, and difficulty walking. Many patients may be initially treatable with non-invasive&#xD;
      measures such as analgesics, ankle-foot orthosis, physical therapy and medications such as&#xD;
      steroids; however, over time, surgery becomes necessary to improve quality of life and&#xD;
      maintain function. Arthrodesis is a well-known procedure that can reduce pain and result in a&#xD;
      foot/ankle that can withstand an active lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone graft is used to stimulate new bone formation at the operative site by providing&#xD;
      osteogenic cells with osteoinductive factors with an osteoconductive matrix. Although&#xD;
      autologous bone is often used as the structural graft material for fusion procedures, donor&#xD;
      site morbidity (e.g., pain, infection, and fracture), limited supply, and inconsistent&#xD;
      osteogenic activity continue to be associated problems. The quality of an autograft is&#xD;
      dependent upon the age and medical condition of the patient, as well as the number of viable&#xD;
      mesenchymal and osteoprogenitor stem cells that are present in the specimen. This tissue is&#xD;
      harvested during the surgical procedure; the process can prolong morbidity at the harvest&#xD;
      site. The ideal bone graft would offer osteogenic cells, osteoinductive factors, and an&#xD;
      osteoconductive matrix with a consistent supply of viable mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and&#xD;
      osteoprogenitor cells (OPCs)-but without the morbidity of autograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the limitations associated with autograft, researchers are pursuing the use of&#xD;
      bone-graft substitutes to promote arthrodesis. Bone-graft substitutes now being used by&#xD;
      surgeons include ceramic synthetics, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), demineralized bone&#xD;
      matrices (DBMs) and other allografts; these may be used alone or in combination. Allografts&#xD;
      available as substitutes for autograft offer some of the benefits of autograft without its&#xD;
      limitations-but do not contain viable MSCs and OPCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trinity Evolution is an allogeneic cancellous bone matrix containing demineralized cortical&#xD;
      bone (DCB) as well as viable osteoprogenitor and mesenchymal stem cells. Adult mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells, such as those in Trinity Evolution, are the precursor&#xD;
      cells that differentiate into osteoblasts-the cells responsible for bone growth and repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trinity Evolution provides the required osteoconduction, osteogenesis, and osteoinductivity&#xD;
      necessary for successful bone grafting. It offers viable osteoprogenitor and mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells and demineralized cortical bone-all in a single product. Data from preclinical studies&#xD;
      with Trinity Evolution have demonstrated in-vitro and in-vivo safety and effectiveness.&#xD;
      Trinity Evolution is a &quot;minimally manipulated&quot; tissue that is considered an allograft, and as&#xD;
      such, is labeled for bone repair for all orthopedic and podiatric indications where autograft&#xD;
      is used. In this study, Trinity Evolution will be used as a substitute for autograft and/or&#xD;
      standard allograft in the following arthrodesis procedures: tibiotalar, subtalar,&#xD;
      calcaneocuboid, talonavicular, double fusions (i.e. calcaneocuboid and talonavicular), and&#xD;
      triple fusions (i.e. subtalar, calcaneocuboid, and talonavicular).&#xD;
