    <textblock>
      The investigators will study the effect of imatinib mesylate (Glivec) in treatment of&#xD;
      moderate to severe nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far there is no evidence of adequately effective treatment options of NSF. Various&#xD;
      treatments have been tried to stop the progressing disease. Corticosteroids, which suppress&#xD;
      the early inflammatory stage of the disease, fail to halt disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other immunosuppressive agents, photopheresis, and kidney transplantations are reported to be&#xD;
      partly beneficial to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has not been possible to confirm these findings in further studies because in&#xD;
      photopheresis, and kidney transplantation, such effects are generally unreproducible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NSF is a relatively newly defined fibrosing disease not described before 1997 where the&#xD;
      Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) were introduced in patients with kidney disease. The&#xD;
      association between NSF and GBCA has in many studies shown to be very strong. Until recently,&#xD;
      radiologists believed that commercially available GBCAs were safe to use whether the renal&#xD;
      function was normal or not. Since the 1980s, &gt;200 million patients have been given these&#xD;
      agents. Lately, the occurrence of NSF, a relatively new chronic disorder, has given serious&#xD;
      speculations about the safety of these drugs and has questioned their future use. First&#xD;
      identified in 1997, but not described until 2000, NSF has been reported only in patients with&#xD;
      acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (with a glomerular filtration rate &lt;30&#xD;
      ml/min/1.73 m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrosis in the subcutis means that the skin hardens and loses flexibility. Hard dermal&#xD;
      plaque changes often appear on legs, arms and abdomen together with dyspigmentation. As the&#xD;
      lesions involve the deep part of the subcutis the muscles are often affected. Involvement of&#xD;
      the joints leads to contractures and narrowing of movement. Patients with massive affection&#xD;
      of the joints often end up with a zimmer frame or in a wheelchair. The connecting tissue in&#xD;
      the inner vital organs may also be affected and NSF can accelerate the death of the patient.&#xD;
      The retained gadolinium in lesions of NSF can be found years after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, a case report suggests beneficial effects of imatinib mesylate in two&#xD;
      patients. Two other independent case reports also show promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imatinib mesylate inhibits several tyrosine kinases involved in the fibrotic reaction, which&#xD;
      is one of the main pathogenetic components of NSF.&#xD;
