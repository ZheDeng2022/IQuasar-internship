      The study will randomized patients to either open or laparoscopic pancreatic surgery. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of the study is to determine whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is&#xD;
      associated with improved outcomes compared to open distal pancreatectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open distal pancreatectomy with or without splenectomy has been commonly employed for the&#xD;
      treatment of a variety of pancreatic diseases. Although many general surgical procedures have&#xD;
      been increasingly performed laparoscopically or with laparoscopic assistance, until the&#xD;
      current decade, laparoscopic pancreatic surgery had not been performed. Surgeons at Indiana&#xD;
      University Hospital have safely applied laparoscopic surgery to very select patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic disease since 2003. Recently, the outcomes of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy&#xD;
      at Indiana University in combination with multiple other institutions were reviewed and&#xD;
      presented at the American Surgical Association Meeting 2008. These data suggest that&#xD;
      laparoscopic when compared with open distal pancreatectomy may be associated with lower blood&#xD;
      loss (357 vs. 588 cc, p&lt;0.01), fewer complications (40 vs. 57%, p&lt;0.01), and shorter hospital&#xD;
      stays (5.9 vs. 9.0 days, p&lt;0.01). Furthermore, the laparoscopic approach was an independent&#xD;
      predictor of shorter hospital stays. The main criticism of this retrospective study and&#xD;
      similarly designed studies is that there is likely to be a selection bias in patients who&#xD;
      undergo laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy which may account for the apparent positive&#xD;
      results in favor of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. In other words, patient factors, not&#xD;
      the operative approach may be more predictive of the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data, however, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy appears to be at least as&#xD;
      safe as open distal pancreatectomy. Currently, either technique is considered the &quot;standard&#xD;
      of care&quot; at Indiana University Hospital as well as several other institutions in the US with&#xD;
      expertise in laparoscopic pancreas surgery. To determine whether laparoscopic distal&#xD;
      pancreatectomy is truly superior to open distal pancreatectomy in terms of outcomes, we have&#xD;
      proposed to randomize patients to laparoscopic vs open distal pancreatectomy. In addition to&#xD;
      the randomization, patients will be preoperatively stratified according to whether there is a&#xD;
      diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, so outcomes in this specific group of patients may be&#xD;
      examined. Patients with adenocarcinoma will be randomized separately to insure equal groups&#xD;
      in laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy groups for this specific diagnosis. Patients&#xD;
      with neuroendocrine/islet cell tumors will also be randomized separately to insure equal&#xD;
      groups in laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy groups for this specific diagnosis.&#xD;
      Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine/islet cell tumors is&#xD;
      uncommon (e.g., only 9 adenocarcinomas in last 5 years were performed laparoscopically at&#xD;
      IU), thus it is clear from the outset that conclusions will be limited about patients with&#xD;
      these diagnoses. Although this is being submitted as a single institution study, it will be&#xD;
      strongly considered for multi-institutional study design in the near future. Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled on an intention-to-treat manner. Thus, patients who are randomized to laparoscopic&#xD;
      distal pancreatectomy who require conversion to open pancreatectomy will still be included in&#xD;
      the laparoscopic group in the overall comparative analyses. Subgroup analyses, however, will&#xD;
      also be performed excluding this cross-over group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: The primary objective is to determine whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is&#xD;
      associated with improved outcomes compared to open distal pancreatectomy. Retrospective data&#xD;
      suggests that blood loss, overall complication rate and hospital length of stay are&#xD;
      positively influenced by the laparoscopic approach. Thus, these specific outcomes will be&#xD;
      examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. estimated blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. overall complication rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. hospital length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is safe in patients with&#xD;
           pancreatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to establish a distal pancreatectomy registry&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients who are eligible for open distal pancreatectomy are also eligible for&#xD;
             laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. There are no absolute contraindications. The only&#xD;
             situations where a patient is ineligible is if he/she prefers one approach over the&#xD;
             other or the individual surgeon prefers one approach over the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Patients in whom there is a suspicion of a high likelihood of metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
        cancer (minority of patients on trial) will undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy. If the tumor&#xD;
        is metastatic (not confined to the pancreas) then the patient is no longer a candidate for&#xD;
        any distal pancreatectomy (or the trial). The procedure of diagnostic laparoscopy in this&#xD;
        setting is a potential confounder of a trial that randomizes patients to laparoscopic&#xD;
        versus open distal pancreatectomy. Due to the importance of cancer patients to this trial,&#xD;
        instead of excluding patients from randomization simply because they are undergoing&#xD;
        laparoscopy, we have set some limits on the diagnostic laparoscopy. The limits include the&#xD;
        use of 2 laparoscopic ports (total) and the diagnostic laparoscopy must be performed at the&#xD;
        same setting as the distal pancreatectomy. Thus, after randomization to open distal&#xD;
        pancreatectomy, if a patient goes to the operating room, the patient may undergo diagnostic&#xD;
        laparoscopy with these limits (2 ports, same setting surgery) prior to undergoing open&#xD;
        distal pancreatectomy. This is not an issue with a patient who is randomized for&#xD;
        laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, since when the patient goes to the operating room for&#xD;
        diagnostic laparoscopy, they may be transitioned into laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy&#xD;
        which allows 5 ports total.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be eligible for enrollment in the study if they have a pancreas disease&#xD;
             or condition for which they are to undergo distal pancreatectomy. Indications for&#xD;
             distal pancreatectomy will be determined by the surgeon caring for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must undergo informed consent for the study prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be eligible to undergo both open or laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy&#xD;
             at all times up until randomization occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of child-bearing age must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients randomized to laparoscopic technique who require conversion to open technique&#xD;
             will remain on trial due to the intention-to-treat design of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who despite pancreas disease or condition are not fit surgical candidates and&#xD;
             thus will not undergo distal pancreatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who fail to be eligible to undergo both open or laparoscopic distal&#xD;
             pancreatectomy at anytime up until randomization occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing total pancreatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy who have had previous right-sided pancreatic&#xD;
             resection (i.e., pancreaticoduodenectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pediatric patients (&lt;18 years of age) are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with extensive pancreatitis or peri-pancreatic inflammation have a relative&#xD;
             contraindication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with portal or sinistral hypertension have a relative contraindication.&#xD;
