  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus when given&#xD;
      together with sorafenib tosylate and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors and metastatic pancreatic cancer that does not respond to gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride. Sorafenib tosylate and everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Sorafenib tosylate may also stop the&#xD;
      growth of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sorafenib tosylate&#xD;
      together with everolimus may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the 6-month overall survival of patients with previously treated gemcitabine&#xD;
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride)-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with the&#xD;
      combination of sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) and everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the recommended Phase II dose of everolimus when administered in combination&#xD;
      with sorafenib in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the response rate, median survival, time to progression, CA 19.9 decline and&#xD;
      toxicity spectrum of the combination in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of sorafenib and everolimus when given&#xD;
      in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the biomarkers that correlate with response to the study combination in&#xD;
      patients previously treated with gemcitabine-refractory metastatic pancreas cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of everolimus, followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive everolimus (PO) once daily and sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily on days&#xD;
      1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.&#xD;
