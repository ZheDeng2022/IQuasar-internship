      Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) describes a new field of&#xD;
      investigational surgery which uses the endoscope as the primary operative tool. The insertion&#xD;
      sites for the endoscope include natural orifices such as the mouth, anus, vagina, or urethra.&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary teams of surgeons and gastroenterologists collaborate to develop safe and&#xD;
      effective surgical techniques via the natural orifice route in order to avoid surgical&#xD;
      incisions. Early studies have focused on transvaginal surgery as the access route to the&#xD;
      abdomen as it sidesteps troubling questions about infection and closure of the organ. This&#xD;
      study is a pilot study to test the feasibility to NOTES transvaginal cholecystectomy using&#xD;
      conventional surgical and endoscopic tools.&#xD;

      Introduction: Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) describes a new field&#xD;
      of investigational surgery which uses the endoscope as the primary operative tool. The&#xD;
      insertion sites for the endoscope include natural orifices such as the mouth, anus, vagina,&#xD;
      or urethra. Multiple animal studies utilizing similar techniques are ongoing at several&#xD;
      institutions, including Baystate Medical Center. These multidisciplinary teams consist of&#xD;
      surgeons and gastroenterologists who are collaborating to develop safe and effective surgical&#xD;
      techniques via the natural orifice route in order to avoid surgical incisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NOTES team at Baystate began animal studies in May, 2006. Multiple procedures, including&#xD;
      but not limited to uterine horn resection (simulating appendectomy), cholecystectomy,&#xD;
      nephrectomy, splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, small bowel resection, mediastinal&#xD;
      exploration, and sleeve gastrectomy have been completed successfully by the team. This work&#xD;
      has led to a separate, IRB-approved protocol to perform NOTES pancreatic&#xD;
      pseudocystgastrostomy in human patients. To date, 2 patients have successfully undergone&#xD;
      entirely transluminal, endoscopic cystgastrostomy with a third case upcoming. The focus of&#xD;
      much of our research (as well as that of many other investigators), is to develop a secure&#xD;
      closure method for the stomach. Unfortunately, key scientific questions remain regarding this&#xD;
      technique and thus have limited human trials to date. Given this, we have begun to explore&#xD;
      other access techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gynecologists have long considered transvaginal access to the peritoneum as a safe route of&#xD;
      entry into the abdomen. Transvaginal hysterectomy and transvaginal tubal ligation have indeed&#xD;
      become a regular part of the gynecologic armamentarium. NOTES surgeons have learned from this&#xD;
      access approach and have begun to employ it as a safe route into the abdomen. In fact,&#xD;
      investigators in New York1,2; San Diego3; Strasbourg, France4; Mallorca, Spain5; Hamburg,&#xD;
      Germany6, Milan, Italy7; and Rio de Janeiro8,9 and SÃ£o Paulo10, Brazil have all announced&#xD;
      transvaginal NOTES procedures involving the gallbladder. All of these approaches, to date,&#xD;
      have utilized one or more laparoscopic trocars for safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The primary objective of this pilot study is to demonstrate that the&#xD;
      Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) transvaginal cholecystectomy&#xD;
      technique is as safe and effective as standard laparoscopic surgical technique for the&#xD;
      resection of gallbladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients who undergo Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery for&#xD;
      treatment of their gallbladder disease will experience effective treatment with less&#xD;
      discomfort and with quicker recovery than standard surgical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: The NOTES team (surgeon and gastroenterologist) at Baystate has extensive&#xD;
      experience with animal work in developing novel techniques with commercially available&#xD;
      products. Despite performing cholecystectomies in porcine models both through a transgastric&#xD;
      and transvaginal approach, we have yet to perform a human case. The surgeons on the team have&#xD;
      performed well over a thousand laparoscopic cholecystectomies; the gastroenterologist is a&#xD;
      recognized advanced therapeutic endoscopist; and the gynecologist is an expert in&#xD;
      transvaginal surgery. We believe that our combination of human experience and animal research&#xD;
      will lead to safe attempts to perform the procedure described herein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: There will be a total of 3 patients undergoing this experimental surgical procedure&#xD;
      once meeting all entry criteria and subsequent to obtaining informed consent These patients&#xD;
      will be recruited from the Baystate ambulatory surgery clinics.. Preoperative laboratory&#xD;
      testing, such as blood work (liver function tests, amylase and lipase, a white blood cell&#xD;
      count, and a pregnancy test), as well as ultrasound of the liver to document gallbladder&#xD;
      disease will be performed as is the standard for patients undergoing surgical removal of the&#xD;
      gallbladder. In this procedure, after the induction of general anesthesia and creation of a&#xD;
      culdotomy, a sterile endoscope would be inserted into the vagina and then into the abdomen.&#xD;
      Following the insertion of the endoscope, a retraction stitch will be passed through the&#xD;
      abdominal wall and into the gallbladder to retract the fundus of the gallbladder in a&#xD;
      cephalad direction. A 5-mm trocar will be placed in the umbilicus and will serve two&#xD;
      functions: one, to allow for a laparoscope in case the view becomes compromised or&#xD;
      substandard; and two, to allow a clip applier to be placed in the abdomen for clipping the&#xD;
      cystic artery and cystic duct. Dissection of the gallbladder can commence using endoscopic&#xD;
      tools and removal of the specimen will be directly through the culdotomy and out through the&#xD;
      vagina. Utilizing this technique, as many as three surgical incisions can be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, the patient will be kept in the hospital overnight. After discharge,&#xD;
      follow-up examination will be conducted at 3-5 days (by telephone), 1 week, and 6 weeks&#xD;
      following the procedure to determine the success of the procedure. Longer term follow-up will&#xD;
      be determined by the patient's overall condition. For at least the first 3 procedures, a&#xD;
      laparoscopic camera will be available on the sterile field and at least one laparoscopic&#xD;
      trocar will be employed. As with any operation, we would revert to the next least invasive&#xD;
      modality should patient safety and/or degree of difficulty dictate that it be so. In this&#xD;
      case, should we encounter difficulties during transvaginal cholecystectomy, we would have a&#xD;
      low threshold to revert to laparoscopic cholecystectomy or even to open cholecystectomy as&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring: Due to the novelty of the procedure, safety information will be monitored&#xD;
      on a continuous basis. Complications that deviate from expected outcomes from standard&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy would result in, the study being terminated prematurely or&#xD;
      temporarily suspended while we assess the events. A member of the general surgery department&#xD;
      will be appointed as a safety monitor and will review all the cases and report to the IRB&#xD;
      after the first and third case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits: The anticipated risks associated with this type of surgery include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding, infection, need for open surgery, bile leak, bile duct injury, and bowel injury.&#xD;
      Risks specific to the transvaginal NOTES approach include infection of the vagina,&#xD;
      dyspareunia. A vaginal incision has no known adverse effects on either fertility or&#xD;
      subsequent childbirth, even within a few weeks of the procedure. The anticipated benefits&#xD;
      include a decrease in the amount of pain experienced with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, as&#xD;
      well as a more cosmetically acceptable result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: As this is a purely descriptive study of feasibility of a new technique, there&#xD;
      are no specific statistics to be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage: The identifiable data collected will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in the&#xD;
      primary investigator's office. Only the PI will have access to this file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that there will be more similar &quot;natural orifice-type&quot; surgeries in the&#xD;
      future for a variety of procedures and a multitude of reasons (no incision, less pain, and&#xD;
      less time in the hospital). These surgeries will be some of the first transvaginal&#xD;
      cholecystectomies performed in the world.&#xD;
