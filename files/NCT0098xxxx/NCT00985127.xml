      The study will be conducted in two parts. The first is a parallel-group design, evaluating&#xD;
      doses of 40 mg, 80 mg or 120 mg BCX-4208. The second part is planned as a dose-escalation&#xD;
      study, evaluating higher doses including 160 mg, 240 mg and 320 mg BCX-4208. The study's&#xD;
      primary endpoint is the change in uric acid in the blood compared to baseline measurement&#xD;
      prior to treatment, assessed on Day 22.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of BCX4208 in approximately 120 subjects with gout. The study will be conducted in 2 parts.&#xD;
      Part 1 is a parallel-group design, evaluating doses of BCX4208 previously found to be safe&#xD;
      and well-tolerated in healthy subjects and subjects with psoriasis. Part 2 is a&#xD;
      dose-escalation study, evaluating higher doses of BCX4208 supported by the nonclinical safety&#xD;
      dossier. Part 2 will initiate after review of efficacy and safety data from Part 1, and&#xD;
      determination that higher doses of BCX4208 may be necessary to achieve meaningful clinical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, approximately 60 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 fashion to one of the&#xD;
      following 4 treatment groups: 1) Placebo; 2) 40 mg BCX4208; 3) 80 mg BCX4208; or 4) 120 mg&#xD;
      BCX4208.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, the study will consist of 3 periods: the Screening Period, the Treatment Period,&#xD;
      and the Follow-Up Period. The Screening period will begin on Day -30 for subjects receiving&#xD;
      urate-lowering therapy; these subjects will discontinue the urate-lowering therapy on Day -30&#xD;
      to allow an appropriate washout period before entering the Treatment Period. For subjects not&#xD;
      receiving urate-lowering therapy, the Screening Period may begin on any day from Day -30 to&#xD;
      Day -1 (Day -1 being the day immediately prior to dosing), as long as all inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are satisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some Screening procedures such as a recording of medical history and some clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests (those that are performed at Screening only) may be performed at any time during the&#xD;
      Screening Period (Day -30 to Day -1). Other Screening procedures must be performed within the&#xD;
      6 days prior to the first dose of study drug (i.e., from Day -6 to Day -1); these include:&#xD;
      physical examination, height, weight, clinical chemistry (including baseline and qualifying&#xD;
      sUA), hematology, and urinalysis evaluations, CD4+, CD8+, CD20+, and CD56+ lymphocyte counts,&#xD;
      a serum pregnancy test, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and vital signs assessments. These&#xD;
      assessments will constitute the Baseline assessments for the purpose of comparisons with&#xD;
      these same assessments post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recording of concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs) will take place from the time&#xD;
      of the signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment Period begins on Day 1. Subjects are to arrive at the study clinic on Day 1&#xD;
      after an overnight fast. After a final review of eligibility criteria, pre-dose vital signs&#xD;
      assessments, and pre-dose BCX4208 pharmacokinetic (PK) blood draw have been performed,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized and administered the first dose of study drug. Subjects will&#xD;
      remain in the study clinic for Hour 2, Hour 4, and Hour 8 assessments and will return to the&#xD;
      study clinic for efficacy and safety evaluations on Days 2, 8, 15, and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will take study drug daily from Day 1 to Day 21, so that the Day 22 evaluation will&#xD;
      occur approximately 24 hours after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Day 22 evaluation, subjects will enter the Follow-Up Period and will return to the&#xD;
      study clinic on Days 29, 36, 43, and 50 for safety evaluations. Subjects who on Day 50 have&#xD;
      unresolved treatment-emergent AEs will be followed beyond Day 50 until either resolution of&#xD;
      the AE or until Day 80, whichever occurs sooner. Subjects who on Day 50 have absolute CD4+,&#xD;
      CD8+, CD20+, and/or CD56+ lymphocyte counts that are both below the lower limit of normal and&#xD;
      &lt; 50% of Baseline will be followed monthly until the sooner of: 1) return of the absolute&#xD;
      CD4+, CD8+, CD20+, and/or CD56+ lymphocyte counts to the lower limit of normal range, or 2) 6&#xD;
      months after the Day 50 or Early Termination Visit. All other subjects will conclude their&#xD;
      study participation at the Day 50 or Early Termination Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed during the study by means of sUA concentrations. Safety will be&#xD;
      assessed during the study by means of physical examination, weight, clinical chemistry,&#xD;
      hematology, and urinalysis parameters, absolute CD4+, CD8+, CD20+, and CD56+ lymphocyte&#xD;
      counts, 12-lead ECG, vital signs assessments, and AE assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy, safety, and tolerability data from Part 1 of the study will be reviewed prior to&#xD;
      initiation of Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will consist of up to 3 cohorts: 1) 160 mg BCX4208 or placebo; 2) 240 mg BCX4208 or&#xD;
      placebo; and 3) 320 mg BCX4208 or placebo. Unlike Part 1, Part 2 is a dose-escalation design&#xD;
      whereby each of the cohorts will be enrolled sequentially, following review of the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability data of the previous cohort. Enrollment into each cohort during Part&#xD;
      2 will be in a 3:1 ratio of BCX4208 to placebo such that 15 subjects will be randomized into&#xD;
      each of the BCX4208 groups (total of 45 subjects) and 15 subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study procedures for Part 2 of the study, from the Screening through the Follow-Up&#xD;
      Period, will be conducted as described for Part 1.&#xD;
