  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the resolution of an inflammatory&#xD;
      reaction is an active process. This process requiring signals that turn off early&#xD;
      inflammatory stages, as neutrophil infiltration and promote resolution phase, as clearance of&#xD;
      apoptotic cells. In this array,the relationship between neutrophils, monocytes, and&#xD;
      macrophages is crucial for the concert process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macrophages possess a plasticity of phenotype that explains their protective as well as&#xD;
      potentially detrimental role in chronic inflammation and tissue injury. Such heterogeneity&#xD;
      arises as macrophages differentiate from monocytes and are exposed to specific tissue- and&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell-derived stimuli. It is important to be able to identify the different&#xD;
      types of macrophages in this setting. Today's literature can distinguish between 3 main&#xD;
      phenotypic groups of macrophages. The classically activated M1 macrophages, the alternatively&#xD;
      activated-M2 macrophages and the &quot;resolution phase&quot; - rMs macrophages. The third phenotypic&#xD;
      macrophage might play a crucial rule in the resolution phase, and is called the &quot;resolving&#xD;
      macrophage&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of those pro-resolving lipid mediators promote the return to tissue homeostasis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that in periodontal patients the inflammatory process&#xD;
      continues because the process does not reach the resolution phase, and in that milieu, the&#xD;
      macrophage might be a key component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the overall concept of periodontal disease as a model for an inflammatory disease with&#xD;
      an stoppable inflammatory reaction, the primary aim of the study is to check the macrophage&#xD;
      characteristics in periodontal patients and to compare it to healthy people.&#xD;
