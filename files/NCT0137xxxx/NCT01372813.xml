      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One way tumors are able to grow is by forming new blood vessels that supply it with&#xD;
           nutrients and oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vandetanib (ZD6474) is an experimental drug that blocks certain proteins on the surface&#xD;
           of tumor and blood vessel cells that are involved with the formation of new blood&#xD;
           vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blocking these proteins may prevent the tumor cells or blood vessels from continuing to&#xD;
           grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether vandetanib can cause tumors to shrink or stabilize in patients with&#xD;
           advanced kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine how vandetanib may work in people with kidney cancer and to develop tests&#xD;
           that may be helpful in studying kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients 18 years of age or older with advanced clear cell kidney cancer whose disease has&#xD;
      worsened after treatment with one or more of the following drugs: sunitinib, sorafenib,&#xD;
      interleukin-2 and temsirolimus; or patients who have had to stop treatment with these drugs&#xD;
      due to unacceptable side effects; or patients who are unable to receive standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients take a vandetanib pill once a day in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are followed in the clinic every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment&#xD;
           and then every 4 weeks for a physical examination, blood and urine tests,&#xD;
           electrocardiogram and a review of any drug side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have imaging scans (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
           (MRI)) about every 8 weeks to monitor tumor growth. MRI scans are also done to look at&#xD;
           tumor blood flow when treatment begins, 24 hours after the first dose of treatment, and&#xD;
           again about 4 and 8 weeks after starting treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional tumor biopsies (surgical removal of a sample of tumor tissue) may be done&#xD;
           before starting vandetanib treatment and after 4 weeks of treatment to look for drug&#xD;
           effects on the tumor.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) inactivation by mutation or promoter hypermethylation is seen in&#xD;
           a high proportion of sporadic clear cell renal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inactivation of VHL leads to accumulation of proteins targeted for degradation through&#xD;
           the ubiquitin pathway, which includes a group of transcriptionally active proteins&#xD;
           called the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF), whose alpha subunits undergo degradation in&#xD;
           a VHL-dependent fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accumulation of HIFs results in overexpression of several genes including vascular&#xD;
           endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), transforming growth&#xD;
           factor (TGF-a), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and erythropoietin, which are&#xD;
           believed to play a role in tumorigenesis, tumor progression and metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kinase insert domain-containing receptor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2&#xD;
           (kinase insert domain receptor (KDR)/vascular endothelial growth factor 2 (VEGFR2)) is&#xD;
           an endothelial cell receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and plays a&#xD;
           crucial role in mediating tumor angiogenesis, while EGFR (a receptor for TGF-a and&#xD;
           epidermal growth factor (EGF) is believed to mediate tumor growth and proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ZD6474 is an orally administered receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity&#xD;
           against the KDR/VEGFR2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the efficacy (overall response rate) of single agent ZD6474 in advanced clear&#xD;
      cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate progression free survival in patients treated with ZD6474.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the safety and tolerability of ZD6474.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the correlation between VHL mutational status and response to ZD6474.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of ZD6474 on circulating endothelial cells and endothelial&#xD;
           progenitor cells and to explore the utility of these markers as surrogates of&#xD;
           angiogenesis inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of ZD6474 on potential biomarkers of angiogenesis in plasma&#xD;
           such as VEGF and soluble VEGFR2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effect of ZD6474 treatment on tumor vascular flow and permeability using&#xD;
           dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of ZD6474 on EGFR and VEGFR mediated signaling using tumor&#xD;
           biopsy tissue (when available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults with measurable advanced clear cell renal carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have received no more than three prior systemic therapies (no more than&#xD;
           two agents known to inhibit VEGF or VEGFR) and must have either progressed on or be&#xD;
           unable to receive 1) Sunitinib or sorafenib, and 2) High dose interleukin-2 (IL-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single agent ZD6474 administered daily at a dose of 300mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated for response every 8 weeks using Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
           in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study is based on an open label Simon two-stage optimal phase II design and will&#xD;
           accrue a maximum of 37 patients.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression. Clinical response is assessed by the Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. A partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum LD. A complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions.</description>

             Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ZD6474 is an anti-angiogenic agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with ZD6474, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
