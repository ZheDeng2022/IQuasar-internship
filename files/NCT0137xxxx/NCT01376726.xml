    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response to an HIV vaccine in&#xD;
      healthy, HIV-uninfected adults who have participated in a previous HIV vaccine clinical trial&#xD;
      and in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults who have not participated in a previous HIV vaccine&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous clinical trials have shown that people who receive a second vaccine for certain&#xD;
      conditions after having received a prior vaccine may have a better antibody response to the&#xD;
      second vaccine than people who receive the vaccine for the first time. This is known as&#xD;
      &quot;priming&quot; and it may occur in people receiving a second vaccine even if the first vaccine was&#xD;
      received several years previously. This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adults who&#xD;
      have participated in a previous HIV vaccine clinical trial and received HIV-1 subtype B&#xD;
      envelope subunit vaccines with MF59 adjuvant, and healthy, HIV-uninfected adults who have not&#xD;
      participated in a previous HIV vaccine clinical trial and therefore have not previously&#xD;
      received any HIV vaccines. Participants in this study will receive a total of two injections,&#xD;
      each 6 months apart, of the HIV-1 Sub Cgp140 vaccine with MF59 adjuvant. Researchers will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immune response to the study vaccine and determine if people who&#xD;
      participated in a previous HIV vaccine clinical trial demonstrate an improved antibody&#xD;
      response to the study vaccine versus people who have never received an HIV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll two groups of participants. Group 1 will include healthy,&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected adults who have participated in a previous HIV vaccine clinical trial. Group 2&#xD;
      will include healthy, HIV-uninfected adults who have not participated in an HIV vaccine&#xD;
      clinical trial. All participants will receive the study vaccine injected into their upper arm&#xD;
      at baseline and Month 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline study visit, all participants will undergo a physical examination, a medical&#xD;
      and medication history review, and blood collection. Female participants will also take a&#xD;
      pregnancy test. Participants will complete questionnaires and receive counseling on HIV risk&#xD;
      reduction and pregnancy prevention. Saliva samples will be obtained from all participants and&#xD;
      rectal fluids, semen samples, and cervical secretions will be obtained from some&#xD;
      participants. After receiving the vaccine, participants will remain in the clinic for at&#xD;
      least 30 minutes for observation and monitoring of side effects. For 3 days after the&#xD;
      vaccination, participants will record any side effects in a symptom log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 1 will attend study visits 1 and 2 weeks after the first vaccination&#xD;
      study visit, at Month 6 for the second vaccination, 1 and 2 weeks after the Month 6 study&#xD;
      visit, and at Months 9 and 12. Participants in Group 2 will attend study visits 1 and 3 days&#xD;
      and 1 and 2 weeks after the first vaccination study visit, at Month 6 for the second&#xD;
      vaccination, 1 and 3 days and 1 and 2 weeks after the Month 6 study visit, and at Months 9&#xD;
      and 12. Follow-up study visits will include select study procedures. Blood collected during&#xD;
      study visits may be saved for future testing. Study researchers will contact participants at&#xD;
      Month 18 for follow-up health monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In July 2013, an extension to the study was announced. Current study participants will be&#xD;
      screened to see if they are eligible to participate in the study extension. Participants who&#xD;
      are eligible will receive one additional injection of the study vaccine, at a visit&#xD;
      approximately 14 to 20 months after their second (Month 6) vaccination. Additional study&#xD;
      visits will occur 2 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after receiving the third vaccination. Select&#xD;
      visits will include a physical examination, blood collection, saliva collection, pregnancy&#xD;
      test for female participants, HIV testing and risk reduction counseling, and interviews and&#xD;
      questionnaires. Study researchers will contact participants 1 year after the third&#xD;
      vaccination for follow-up health monitoring.&#xD;
