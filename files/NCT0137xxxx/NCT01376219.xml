      The economic cost of asthma is considerable both in terms of direct medical costs (such as&#xD;
      the cost of pharmaceuticals and hospital admissions) and indirect medical costs (such as time&#xD;
      lost from work and premature death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The costs of asthma depend on the severity of disease and the extent to which exacerbations&#xD;
      are avoided. Moreover, poor control of asthma symptoms is a major issue that can result in&#xD;
      adverse clinical and economic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to GINA guidelines, the goal of asthma treatment is to achieve and maintain asthma&#xD;
      control. Such an objective can be reached in a majority of patients with a pharmacologic&#xD;
      intervention strategy developed in partnership between the patient/family and the doctor.&#xD;
      Validated measures for assessing asthma control score goals as continuous variables and&#xD;
      provide numerical values to distinguish different levels of control. Among them, the Asthma&#xD;
      Control Test (TM - QualityMetric Incorporated) is widely recognized. Few data exist on the&#xD;
      relationship between asthma control and health care consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some models for predicting asthma costs have been proposed. However, these models only&#xD;
      attempt to assess costs associated with medications and/or asthma exacerbations. Furthermore,&#xD;
      in such studies, asthma control was not defined accordingly to current international&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the increasing interest of health authorities in reducing asthma associated costs&#xD;
      and improving quality of care, it appears necessary to study the relationship between the&#xD;
      cost and the level of control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A European observational retrospective bottom-up cost of illness study will be designed based&#xD;
      upon a sample of patients with asthma. Investigators will be general practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will have to enrol a sample of patients with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of asthma control will be evaluated with 2 methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Firstly by using the auto-test Asthma Control Test (TM - QualityMetric Incorporated)&#xD;
           which allows to assess the level of control on a 4-week period by distinguishing&#xD;
           controlled and uncontrolled patients ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondly by using the GINA's asthma control criteria to measure the level of control in&#xD;
           the last 3 months. The GINA classification will allow ranging patients in 3 groups&#xD;
           (controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled patients) and comprises a measure of&#xD;
           lung function using a peak expiratory flow measurement (PEF) or a spirometric&#xD;
           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will necessitate only one visit per patient with a retrospective data&#xD;
      collection over a three-month period. This period is the maximum possible retrospective&#xD;
      duration to avoid memory biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire will be filled-up by the general practitioner. Data collected during the&#xD;
      visit will be demographic data, medical history of patients, physician and paramedic's&#xD;
      visits, treatment, diagnosis and lab tests, hospitalizations, rehabilitation, and absence&#xD;
      from work during the last three months. A PEF or a spirometric result will be also requested.&#xD;
      Patients will have to complete the Asthma Control test (TM - QualityMetric Incorporated)&#xD;
      questionnaire. To assess the quality of life, patients will also have to complete the EQ-5D&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the time horizon of the asthma control concept is one month or shorter, the cost analysis&#xD;
      will be first done taking into account this duration (the cost will be compared with the&#xD;
      Asthma Control Test (TM - QualityMetric Incorporated) score), and secondly, on the three&#xD;
      months period (the cost will be compared to the GINA's criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To take into account seasonality, the overall population of patients will be enrolled in four&#xD;
      quarterly waves. The data collection will therefore require one full year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data collected will be centralized, captured and analyzed. Costing will be done using&#xD;
      both societal and payer perspectives without any discounting. Results will be provided by&#xD;
      period and by asthma control level and according to the patient profile (age, sex, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients needed to be enrolled was calculated taking into account the precision&#xD;
      of the average cost estimate in the lower size group (i.e patients with optimal control) for&#xD;
      each period in each country. In each country, at least 380 patients will be enrolled per wave&#xD;
      to obtain a total population of 152 patients with optimal control. Overall, 3,040 will be&#xD;
      enrolled all over the study year.&#xD;
