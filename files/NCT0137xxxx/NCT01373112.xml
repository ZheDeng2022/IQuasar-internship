    <textblock>
      Infection remains a difficult-to-treat complication of total knee arthroplasty. The gold&#xD;
      standard treatment is two-stage removal of the prosthesis with later replacement of permanent&#xD;
      implants. The first stage consists of removal of the infected arthroplasty components and the&#xD;
      surrounding devitalized tissue, copious pulsed irrigation, and placement of a temporary&#xD;
      antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer. This spacer typically is left in place six weeks,&#xD;
      during which time the patient receives intravenous antibiotics. After the surgeon feels that&#xD;
      the infection has been eradicated, or if the patient requires repeat debridement, a second&#xD;
      operative procedure is performed. While the use of an antibiotic-loaded spacer is well&#xD;
      accepted, whether the spacer should immobilize the knee (a so-called &quot;static&quot; spacer) or&#xD;
      allow for range of motion (a so-called &quot;articulating&quot; spacer) is controversial. Proponents of&#xD;
      articulating spacers argue that they prevent scarring of the musculature surrounding the knee&#xD;
      resulting in easier reimplantation, improved long-term knee function, and improved range of&#xD;
      motion. Proponents of static spacers argue that immobilization of the periarticular soft&#xD;
      tissues aids in clearance of the infection and is simpler to fashion intraoperatively. While&#xD;
      good results have been described with both methods, comparative trials have been conflicting&#xD;
      as to whether spacer design alters knee function, operative time, and range of motion.&#xD;
      Equipoise exists within the literature, and no randomized clinical trial has been conducted&#xD;
      to evaluate this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare articulating and static antibiotic-impregnated&#xD;
      spacers for the treatment of chronic periprosthetic infection complicating total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty through a prospective, randomized clinical trial. The goals of this trial are to&#xD;
      determine the effect of spacer design upon eradication of infection, knee function, ease of&#xD;
      reimplantation, and range of motion. The investigators hypothesize that articulating spacers&#xD;
      will provide shorter operative times at reimplantation, while improving knee function and&#xD;
      range of motion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After diagnosis of infection and informed consent, patients will be taken to the operating&#xD;
      room. After anesthetization, patients will be randomized to either an articulating spacer or&#xD;
      a static spacer. Randomization will be performed by prepared opaque envelopes administered by&#xD;
      a nonparticipant in the study. After a complete debridement of devitalized tissue,&#xD;
      explantation of the infected components and any associated cement, either an articulating or&#xD;
      static spacer will be placed. All spacers will be formed of 3 g of Vancomycin and 1 g of&#xD;
      Tobramycin for each 40 g packet of cement. Articulating spacers will be formed of antibiotic&#xD;
      impregnated cement using the Stage One system (Biomet, Warsaw, IN). Static spacers will be&#xD;
      hand-made to fit the femoral and tibial exposed metaphyses as a solid block with associated&#xD;
      antibiotic cement coated tibial and femoral intramedullary rod, such that knee motion will be&#xD;
      minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, all patients will be made touch-down weight bearing protected with a walker&#xD;
      or crutches. If a static spacer is placed, patients will be immobilized using with a knee&#xD;
      immobilizer. If an articulating spacer is utilized, range of motion will be allowed to the&#xD;
      limits of stability as determined in the operating room and protected with a hinged knee&#xD;
      brace. At the time of reoperation, the joint will be aspirated and multiple cultures obtained&#xD;
      along with intraoperative histopathological analysis to evaluate for persistent infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected preoperatively will include age, gender, laterality, etiology of knee&#xD;
      degeneration, comorbidities, Knee Society score, and infecting organisms. The Knee Society&#xD;
      score has been used extensively in the study of revision knee arthroplasty and has been found&#xD;
      to be reliable and valid and will be determined pre-operatively and at all follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected at the time of implant removal and reimplantation will include operative time,&#xD;
      blood loss, and need for an extensile exposure. Radiographs performed immediately following&#xD;
      and just prior to reimplantation will be reviewed to determine if the spacer utilized has&#xD;
      caused bone loss; bone loss to the cut bony surfaces will be confirmed intraoperatively. At&#xD;
      each follow-up visit radiographic appearance, the Knee Society Score, knee range of motion,&#xD;
      recurrence of infection, and the need for revision or reoperation of any kind on the knee&#xD;
      will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All portions of this study will be part of conventional care except for randomization to&#xD;
      either a static or articulating spacer. Which type of spacer is used currently depends upon&#xD;
      the judgment of the attending surgeons and both are used routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable will be range of motion. A power analysis was conducted with the&#xD;
      assistance of Dr. Mario Moric at Rush using range of motion as our primary outcome variable,&#xD;
      with standard deviations culled from two of the largest series to date -Van Thiel and&#xD;
      colleagues (2010) and Fehring and colleagues (2000). For an 80% chance of detecting a&#xD;
      predetermined clinically significant difference of 10 degrees, 53 patients per group, 106&#xD;
      patients total, will be needed. To account for attrition, our target sample size will be 140&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
