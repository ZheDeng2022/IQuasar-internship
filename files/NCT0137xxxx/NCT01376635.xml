      Background/Aims: To evaluate the sympathovagal balance in patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) on conservative treatment. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, patients with&#xD;
      CKD stages 3, 4 and 5 not yet on dialysis (CKD group) and age-matched healthy subjects (CON&#xD;
      group) underwent continuous heart rate recording during two twenty-minute periods in the&#xD;
      supine position (pre-inclined), followed by passive postural inclination at 70° (inclined&#xD;
      period). Power spectral analysis of the heart rate variability was used to assess the&#xD;
      normalized low frequency (LFnu), indicative of sympathetic activity, and the normalized high&#xD;
      frequency (HFnu), indicative of parasympathetic activity. The LFnu/HFnu ratio represented&#xD;
      sympathovagal balance.&#xD;

      Patients We evaluated 32 individuals (18 men and 14 women) with CKD at stages 3, 4 or 5 who&#xD;
      were not yet on dialysis. The individuals were recruited at the Interdisciplinary Nucleus for&#xD;
      Studies, Research and Treatment in Nephrology, Federal University of Juiz de Fora. All&#xD;
      patients had been followed by a nephrologist for at least 6 months before inclusion in the&#xD;
      study. Patients with severe cardiac disease, cancer, diabetes, collagen and demyelinating&#xD;
      diseases, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or a history of stroke were excluded. The&#xD;
      control group consisted of 14 subjects with normal renal function who were non-diabetic,&#xD;
      normotensive and free of heart disease. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      University Hospital of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, document number 073/2007, and&#xD;
      all subjects signed an informed consent before being included in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This was a cross-sectional study in which we evaluated ANS function in patients&#xD;
      with CKD under conservative treatment and compared the results to a control group. Power&#xD;
      spectral analysis of the HRV at rest and during a passive orthostatic stress was performed in&#xD;
      both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Evaluation The medical evaluation was performed by a cardiologist and&#xD;
      consisted of an interview and clinical examination. Blood pressure was measured at each 2&#xD;
      minutes intervals using a conventional sphygmomanometer. A conventional 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed with an electrocardiograph (model Apex 1000, TEB,&#xD;
      Brazil). To detect LVH, we used the Cornell criterion [9]. Ventricular geometry and function&#xD;
      were analyzed using a two-dimensional Doppler echocardiogram generated using a Philips&#xD;
      EnVisor C Ultrasound System (Philips Medical Systems-Ultrasound, MA, USA). Measurements and&#xD;
      indices of left ventricular function at rest were obtained through the two-dimensional and M&#xD;
      modes, using a 3.5 MHz linear transducer placed over the third or fourth intercostal space.&#xD;
      The diagnosis of LVH was based on the left ventricular mass index (LVMI), values for which&#xD;
      were considered normal up to 115 g/m2 for men and up to 95 g/m2 for women [10]. The data were&#xD;
      interpreted according to criteria established by the American Society of Echocardiography&#xD;
      [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Evaluation The results of the following tests were obtained from the patients'&#xD;
      charts: glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; estimated from creatinine using the Modification of&#xD;
      Diet in Renal Disease equation) [12], urea, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, hemoglobin, uric&#xD;
      acid, parathyroid hormone (PTH), total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, glucose and urinalysis. The diagnosis of CKD was based on the Kidney Disease&#xD;
      Outcomes Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation (KDOQI/NKF) [13]: eGFR &lt;60&#xD;
      ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or at least one marker of renal parenchymal damage (e.g., proteinuria),&#xD;
      present for a period of ≥3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Heart Rate Variability The HRV was measured at rest in the supine position and&#xD;
      during orthostatic stress. All subjects were instructed to fast for six hours and not to&#xD;
      smoke or drink caffeine for 12 hours prior to the test. All medications that could&#xD;
      potentially interfere with the cardiovascular response such as non-dihydropyridine calcium&#xD;
      channel blockers, beta-blockers, central sympatholytic, tricyclic antidepressants as well as&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmic drugs were withdrawn for at least five drug half-lives before the study. The&#xD;
      evaluation was conducted in the morning in a calm environment with low light on a tilting&#xD;
      table with seat belts and a platform for a footrest. The subjects underwent continuous HR&#xD;
      recording using a Holter system (Cardio Light, Brazil) during two 20 minute periods in the&#xD;
      supine position (pre-inclined), followed by passive postural inclination at 70° (inclined&#xD;
      period) [14,15]. To evaluate the spectral analysis of HRV, a fast Fourier transform was used&#xD;
      [16], obtained by means of Holter-specific software (Cardio Smart 550, Brazil), that allows&#xD;
      periodic signals, an average of 500 sequential R-R intervals, to be divided into various&#xD;
      bands of frequency response: ultra-low frequency (ULF: &lt;0.0033 Hz), very low frequency (VLF:&#xD;
      0.0033 to 0.04 Hz), low frequency (LF: 0.04 to 0.15 Hz), and high frequency (HF: 0.15 to 0.4&#xD;
      Hz). The LF and HF components were used as markers of sympathetic and parasympathetic&#xD;
      activities, respectively, and the LF/HF ratio was used as a measure of the sympathovagal&#xD;
      balance. To minimize the effects of changes in ULF and VLF bands, the data were normalized&#xD;
      and the results expressed as normalized units (nu). The normalization was done by dividing&#xD;
      the power of a given component (LF or HF) by the total power spectrum; from this result, the&#xD;
      VLF component was subtracted, and this number was then multiplied by 100. Thus, the variables&#xD;
      used for the HRV analysis were LFnu, HFnu and the LFnu/HFnu ratio. The data were interpreted&#xD;
      following previously published guidelines [17]. The HRV was analyzed using the highest total&#xD;
      power expressed in msec², which was obtained after 10 minutes in the supine position and&#xD;
      during the first 5 minutes after tilting the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The variables are described as mean, standard deviation, percentage or&#xD;
      median. The descriptive statistics and normality of the data were tested by the Kolmogorov&#xD;
      Smirnov test. The laboratory data of the control and CKD groups at baseline were compared&#xD;
      using an independent sample T test, Chi-square test or Mann Whitney test depending on the&#xD;
      characteristics of the variable. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability was assessed&#xD;
      within groups in the pre-inclined and inclined periods by Kruskal Wallis or ANOVA (with post&#xD;
      Hoc test) for both the control group and for the CKD group divided into disease stages three,&#xD;
      four and five. The LFnu / HFnu ratio for the control and CKD groups was compared by the Mann&#xD;
      Whitney Test. To assess the correlation between CKD stages and biochemical variables with the&#xD;
      LFnu/HFnu ratio, Spearman's linear correlation coefficient was used. A p value less than or&#xD;
      equal to 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using&#xD;
      SPSS 13.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).&#xD;
