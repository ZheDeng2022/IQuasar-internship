  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to pilot a telehealth approach to evaluate components of risk communication by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Providing personalized tailored patient feedback to help initiate and maintain specific&#xD;
           diabetic kidney disease (DKD)-related behaviors (e.g., medication adherence, weight,&#xD;
           exercise, diet, smoking cessation) to reduce their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluating how this feedback can be incorporated into clinical care by examining 6 month&#xD;
           patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of providing both patients and their&#xD;
           provider feedback on individuals' DKD risk via the telehealth intervention and&#xD;
           incorporating it into regular clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If improvements in outcomes are found, to estimate the cost of the program in terms of&#xD;
           the patient, provider, and overall costs of implementing the program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose an innovative telehealth approach that has reduced antecedents of kidney disease,&#xD;
      including poor blood pressure and glucose control, but has never been used to treat DKD. To&#xD;
      mitigate the growing burden of DKD, these studies are designed to determine whether a&#xD;
      potentially scalable, telehealth intervention effectively slows progression of DKD in a&#xD;
      diverse US population and whether it is also cost-effective. The intervention simultaneously&#xD;
      addresses medication management and behavioral therapies and education that seek to optimize&#xD;
      adherence and self-efficacy. This proposed pilot trial will begin to evaluate if a&#xD;
      multifactorial telehealth intervention may be effective in reducing progression of DKD.&#xD;
