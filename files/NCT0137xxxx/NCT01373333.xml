  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compassionate use of orphan drug 3,4-Diaminopyridine(DAP) in Treatment of Lambert Eaton&#xD;
      Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS). 3,4-DAP is used to decrease the muscle weakness associated with&#xD;
      LEMS and hopefully will decrease the need for prednisone and all other therapies that were&#xD;
      previously required to control symptoms. How long a patient will take 3,4 DAP depends upon if&#xD;
      he/she is seeing benefits from the medication or experiencing side effects that will prevent&#xD;
      them from continuation in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) decreases symptoms of weakness in patients with LEMS, and&#xD;
      therefore can be used to decrease the amount of immune modulation therapy needed to provide&#xD;
      an equivalent degree of disease control.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical diagnosis of LEMS with or without any of the following: evidence of&#xD;
             underlying malignancy, presence of P/Q or N-type calcium channel antibodies,&#xD;
             electrodiagnostic evidence of a presynaptic defect of neuromuscular junction&#xD;
             transmission.None of these laboratory findings are required for inclusion in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. P/Q and N type calcium channel antibodies are measured in the blood as a routine&#xD;
             laboratory test during the course of initial diagnosis, but 10-20% of patients with&#xD;
             LEMS do not have elevated levels of these antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of past or current seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of prolonged QT syndrome. There is no absolute upper limit of normal for the&#xD;
             QTc interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Family history of prolonged QTc syndrome, history of unexplained syncope, seizures or&#xD;
             cardiac arrest.&#xD;
