  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visual perception impairment and upper limb disability will affect the handwriting&#xD;
      performance. Children with cerebral palsy (CP) who have good function on upper extremity may&#xD;
      associated with visual perception impairment, which will impact the handwriting performance.&#xD;
      However, there were few studies to investigate the handwriting problems in children with CP&#xD;
      who have good upper limb functions. To date, there are no studies to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of computerized handwriting training programs on handwriting performance in&#xD;
      children with CP. The aims of this study were to establish the relationships of visual&#xD;
      perception, visual motor integration, and motor coordination of handwriting performance in&#xD;
      children with typical development (TD) in Taiwan, to establish the norms of handwriting&#xD;
      performance in children with TD in Taiwan, to compare handwriting performance in children&#xD;
      with CP and children with TD, to clarify the relationship of visual perception function and&#xD;
      handwriting performance in children with CP, and to examine the effectiveness of interactive&#xD;
      computerized handwriting training program (ICHTP) on handwriting performance in children with&#xD;
      CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect 90 children with TD and 48 children with CP in the 1st phase.&#xD;
      All children will receive clinical and Chinese handwriting assessment tool (CHAT)&#xD;
      assessments. The CHAT and ICHTP will be modified as Taiwan-version handwriting assessment&#xD;
      tool and training programs for children in Taiwan, respectively. Clinical assessments include&#xD;
      the visual perception, visual motor integration, fine motor skill, and handwriting&#xD;
      performance. The CHAT assessed the handwriting legibility, accuracy, pen pressure and writing&#xD;
      speed. In the 2nd phase, the investigators will collect 48 children with CP, who were&#xD;
      randomly classified into ICHTP group and Traditional Handwriting Training Program (THTP). All&#xD;
      children with CP will receive clinical and CHAT assessments before and after interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected results of this study are the visual perception function is related to&#xD;
      handwriting performance in children with CP, and the improvements in the handwriting&#xD;
      legibility, accuracy, pen pressure and writing speed of ICHTP training group are greater than&#xD;
      THTP training group.&#xD;

      This study were to establish the relationships of visual perception, visual motor&#xD;
      integration, and motor coordination of handwriting performance in children with TD in Taiwan,&#xD;
      to establish the norms of handwriting performance in children with TD in Taiwan, to compare&#xD;
      handwriting performance in children with CP and children with TD, to clarify the relationship&#xD;
      of visual perception function and handwriting performance in children with CP in the first&#xD;
      phase, and to examine the effectiveness of interactive computerized handwriting training&#xD;
      program (ICHTP) via a randomized controlled study in children with CP in the second phase.The&#xD;
      subjects are ninety children with typical development aged between 6-12 years from elementary&#xD;
      school and forty-eight children with CP aged between 6-12 years from Chang Gung Memorial&#xD;
      Hospital (Taipei branch, Linkou branch, Taoyuan branch, Kaohsiung branch), Far Eastern&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital, Taipei Veterans General Hospital and Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital&#xD;
      (Taipei branch)etc.Experimental design In first phase, we establish the relationships of&#xD;
      visual perception, visual motor integration, and motor coordination of handwriting&#xD;
      performance in children with TD in Taiwan, to establish the norms of handwriting performance&#xD;
      in children with TD among different age groups in Taiwan, a comparison designed study to&#xD;
      compare the handwriting performance among 2 CP groups and TD groups. All children were&#xD;
      assigned into diplegia group, hemiplegia group, and typical development (TD) group. Then we&#xD;
      will assessment the fine motor skill, visual perception and handwriting performance by&#xD;
      occupational therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children were assessed with clinical assessments and the Chinese handwriting assessment&#xD;
      tool (CHAT). Clinical assessments included Manual Ability Classification System (MACS),&#xD;
      Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-second edition (BOT-II), the Test of&#xD;
      Visual-Perceptual Skills Revised (TVPS-R), Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor&#xD;
      Integration (Berry VMI) and comprehensive test of basic reading and writing. Evaluations were&#xD;
      performed in about 1.5-2 hours in a silent and restful room, eliminating factors such as&#xD;
      fatigue and distraction of attention and concentration, which could have an impact on the&#xD;
      results. All the tests used in the study were individually administered to all children. The&#xD;
      performance of all children was videotaped for later scoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In second phase, all CP children were randomized assigned into ICHTP group or THTP group. All&#xD;
      participations will received clinical and CHAT assessments before and after intervention.&#xD;
      Clinical assessments included Manual Ability Classification System (MACS),&#xD;
      Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-second edition (BOT-II), the Test of&#xD;

      and distraction of attention and concentration, which could have an impact on the results.&#xD;
      All the tests used in the study were individually administered to all children. The&#xD;
      performance of all children was videotaped for later scoring. The intervention consisted of&#xD;
      ICHTP and THTP training programs, which is 45 min/once, three times/one week, and sustain&#xD;
      four weeks.&#xD;
