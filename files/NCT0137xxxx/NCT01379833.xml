    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a demyelinating chronic&#xD;
      progressive or relapsing neuropathy believed to be secondary to an autoimmune response&#xD;
      against peripheral nerve antigens.5 We have observed two patients with CIDP with decreased&#xD;
      corneal sensation who also suffered neurotrophic corneal ulcers and severe visual loss in the&#xD;
      affected eyes. We want to explore the relationship of CIDP and corneal sensitivity. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that people with CIDP have decreased corneal sensation compared to those&#xD;
      without. We plan to perform a prospective study measuring corneal sensation in patients&#xD;
      (proposed n=10) with CIDP and without to determine (1) if a difference exists in patients&#xD;
      with CIDP compared to controls and (2) the magnitude of the difference. If a difference is&#xD;
      detected in corneal sensitivity in patients with CIDP, this awareness amongst physicians and&#xD;
      patients may help prevent blinding complications.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION The prevalence of CIDP ranges from 0.8 to 8.4 per 100 000.5 This broad range may&#xD;
      reflect the use of different diagnostic criteria, as recently confirmed by an epidemiologic&#xD;
      study on UK population. Over 50% of the patients may have temporary severe disability during&#xD;
      the course of their disease and approximately 10% eventually become persistently disabled or&#xD;
      die because of the illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CIDP may affect any nerve plexus in the body. However, diagnostic criteria leans towards&#xD;
      nerve conduction studies in the limbs and denervation in other organ systems might be&#xD;
      overlooked. Sensory innervation of the cornea is provided by the ophthalmic branch of the&#xD;
      trigeminal nerve via the anterior ciliary nerves. A relatively small number (50-450) of&#xD;
      primary sensory neurons from the ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion send their peripheral axons&#xD;
      to the cornea and branch extensively within the corneal tissue. To maintain corneal&#xD;
      transparency, all peripheral axons of corneal neurons lose the myelin sheath when they enter&#xD;
      the corneal stroma. Fibers spread in a radial fashion parallel to the corneal surface.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposed study will explore the relationship of decreased corneal sensation, a&#xD;
      potentially devastating eye condition secondary to CIDP. Decreased corneal sensation may lead&#xD;
      to neurotrophic keratitis; which describes corneal diseases due to impairment or loss of&#xD;
      corneal sensation leading to epithelial defects and corneal ulcers. This may be caused by&#xD;
      many ocular and systemic diseases such as Diabetes or Stroke. Corneal innervation is&#xD;
      important for the maintenance of corneal structure and function, and provides protective&#xD;
      mechanisms against factors that might be potentially damaging to the cornea. Innervation also&#xD;
      plays an important trophic function in corneal repair in relation to disease, trauma or&#xD;
      surgery. Denervation and decreased corneal sensitivity are associated with impairment of&#xD;
      epithelial and endothelial cell function, increased epithelial and endothelial permeability,&#xD;
      decreased cell migration and cell mitosis. In addition, denervated corneas are predisposed to&#xD;
      epithelial or stromal abnormalities, recurrent erosion, impaired wound healing and&#xD;
      infection.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although corneal nerves lose their myelin sheath as they enter the stroma, the association of&#xD;
      a demyelinating disease affecting these nerves cannot be excluded. This may be because&#xD;
      trigeminal nerves can be affected at different levels (the nucleus in the pons, the Gasserian&#xD;
      ganglion, the trigeminal ophthalmic branch, the nasociliary nerve, or the long ciliary&#xD;
      nerve). Also, nerves without central myelin throughout their length can be affected in CIDP.&#xD;
      For example, CNVIII has peculiar myelin as it has central myelin for the majority of its&#xD;
      length, except for a short distal segment which has peripheral myelin.6 There is one case&#xD;
      report correlating findings of hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction for over a 6-year&#xD;
      period in patients with CIDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUR STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan a prospective clinical trial to compare prevalence of decreased corneal sensation and&#xD;
      possible decrease in corneal nerves in patients with CIDP previously diagnosed by clinical&#xD;
      features and electrophysiologic data as outlined by the American Academy of Neurology10 as&#xD;
      compared to patients without CIDP. Patients will be categorized according to the severity of&#xD;
      the disease and duration as per their medical records. Exclusion criteria is aimed at those&#xD;
      conditions which may reduce corneal sensation such as previous eye trauma, surgery, contact&#xD;
      lens use, eye drop use, or previous viral infections of the eye. A routine complete eye exam&#xD;
      will be performed along with additional testing for corneal sensation using a standard&#xD;
      method. If significant findings are obtained during initial eye exam, subjects will obtain&#xD;
      in-vivo confocal imaging at a second site to image corneal nerve fibers. Published standards&#xD;
      for corneal sensitivity as well as corneal nerve fiber density via confocal imaging will be&#xD;
      used in statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental evidence indicates that impairment of corneal sensory nerves induces&#xD;
      pathological changes in the anatomic integrity and function of the cornea, particularly in&#xD;
      the epithelium. Loss of corneal sensory innervations leads to a decrease in thickness of the&#xD;
      corneal epithelium, intracellular swelling, loss of microvilli and abnormal production of the&#xD;
      basal lamina. This may lead to impairment in vitality, metabolism, and mitosis of epithelial&#xD;
      cells and, consequently, epithelial breakdown. Persistent epithelial defects may lead to&#xD;
      chronic ulceration and eventually to compromise of all ocular surface components with severe&#xD;
      visual impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an association is found between CIDP and decreased corneal sensation, this study will be&#xD;
      the first one to demonstrate such an association. An increased awareness among physicians&#xD;
      about this association may lead to a more careful eye exam in patients with CIDP and&#xD;
      detection of early changes of ocular disease which may be treated earlier so that serious&#xD;
      blinding complications can be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FUTURE STUDIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a positive association is found between CIDP and decreased corneal sensation, the latter&#xD;
      may be added as a supportive criteria in grading the severity of CIDP. CIDP has many&#xD;
      treatment modalities available according to its severity and clinical course. Finding&#xD;
      decreased corneal sensation in CIDP patients prospectively may lead to a diagnosis of&#xD;
      increased disease severity and patients may benefit from more aggressive treatments.&#xD;
