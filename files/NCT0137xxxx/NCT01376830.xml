      Respiratory virus infections are a common cause of COPD exacerbations and antiviral therapies&#xD;
      have potential as treatments for exacerbations. However it is likely that treating patients&#xD;
      when they present with an exacerbation with antiviral drugs will be too late to be effective&#xD;
      and earlier treatment at the time of the initial upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)&#xD;
      will be required. The incidence of exacerbations following URTIs in COPD patients, and&#xD;
      whether there are host factors and biomarkers that can identify the risk of this, is unknown.&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to establish the proportion of viral URTIs that progress to an&#xD;
      acute exacerbation in COPD patients and identify clinical, viral and biological markers that&#xD;
      predict risk of an exacerbation following an URTI. In addition we will determine the&#xD;
      frequency of, and risk factors for, bacterial infection following viral URTIs in COPD&#xD;
      patients. This data will permit development of a model combining baseline patient&#xD;
      characteristics, clinical measurements and biomarkers to predict exacerbation risk following&#xD;
      viral URTI in COPD patients. The results will open the way for trials of antiviral therapy in&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations and targeting of treatment to high risk patients.&#xD;

      Research Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers and clinical characteristics that identify the risk of an exacerbation following&#xD;
      viral upper respiratory tract infections in COPD patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chief Investigator: Dr Patrick Mallia Co-investigators: Professor Sebastian Johnston Dr Sarah&#xD;
      Elkin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site The study will take place at St Mary's Hospital, London - part of the Imperial&#xD;
      College Healthcare NHS Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background COPD exacerbations are a major cause of health care costs, morbidity and&#xD;
           mortality. Current therapies are only partially effective and have considerable side&#xD;
           effects so new treatments are urgently needed. 40 - 50% of COPD exacerbations are&#xD;
           associated with virus infections and the commonest viruses detected are rhinoviruses and&#xD;
           influenza1,2. Sensitive and rapid diagnostic techniques for viral infections have&#xD;
           recently become available3 and drugs effective against rhinovirus and influenza have&#xD;
           been developed4, making antiviral therapy a realistic potential treatment option for&#xD;
           COPD exacerbations. However our understanding of the relationship between viral&#xD;
           infections and COPD exacerbations remains limited and a more information is required&#xD;
           before trials of antiviral therapies are carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experimental model of COPD exacerbation We have developed a model of COPD exacerbation&#xD;
      using experimental rhinovirus infection in COPD patients that allows us to study a number of&#xD;
      outcomes in a carefully controlled manner not possible with naturally occurring&#xD;
      infections5,6. This model has provided novel data regarding the relationships between virus&#xD;
      infection and exacerbations. Following rhinovirus infection subjects developed symptoms of&#xD;
      upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) that commenced on day 2 post-inoculation and peaked&#xD;
      on day 4, followed by the typical lower respiratory tract symptoms of an acute exacerbation&#xD;
      that commenced on day 5 and peaked on day 9. Airflow obstruction and lower airways&#xD;
      inflammation also peaked on day 9. Maximum virus load occurred on day 4 in nasal lavage and&#xD;
      day 5 in sputum. In naturally occurring exacerbations patients present 3-4 days after the&#xD;
      onset of exacerbation symptoms7 and our data shows that the peak of virus replication is&#xD;
      likely to have already occurred by this time. Therefore intervention with antiviral drugs at&#xD;
      the time of exacerbation may be too late. 63% of COPD subjects in our study developed&#xD;
      bacterial infections following experimental rhinovirus infection. While virus load peaked on&#xD;
      day 5 most bacterial infections occurred later on days 12 and 15 post-inoculation, suggesting&#xD;
      that rhinovirus infection increases susceptibility to bacterial infection. Therefore&#xD;
      treatment of viral infections may have the additional benefit of reducing secondary bacterial&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicting risk of exacerbation: preliminary data from the experimental model Data obtained&#xD;
      from our experimental model allowed us to evaluate relationships between markers at the time&#xD;
      of initial URTI and measures of subsequent exacerbation severity. Peak upper respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms correlated with peak lower respiratory scores (p=0.0037, r=0.58), sputum&#xD;
      inflammatory cells counts (p=0.018, r=0.5) and sputum virus load (p=0.014, r=0.51). The fall&#xD;
      in peak expiratory flow on day 5 correlated with peak lower respiratory scores (p=0.023,&#xD;
      r=-0.47), breathlessness scores (p=0.0079, r=-0.54) and sputum virus load (p=0.03, r=-0.45).&#xD;
      Blood neutrophils on day 5 correlated with peak fall in FEV1 (p=0.0072, r=-0.55), total&#xD;
      leukocyte count on day 5 with peak fall in FEV1/FVC (p=0.04, r=-0.43) and nasal lavage virus&#xD;
      load on day 5 correlated with peak fall in FEV1 (p=0.0186, r=-0.49). These data suggest that&#xD;
      parameters such as symptoms, airflow obstruction, peripheral leukocyte counts and virus load&#xD;
      measured during an URTI in COPD patients correlate with subsequent lower respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms, airflow obstruction and airways inflammation and could predict the risk of&#xD;
      exacerbation. However this study was in a small number of patients with mild-moderate COPD&#xD;
      and these findings need to be explored in a larger cohort of patients with a wider range of&#xD;
      COPD severity with naturally-occurring infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers Exacerbations are defined by increases in symptoms and the diagnosis depends on a&#xD;
      subjective assessment of symptoms by patients and health care providers. No markers - either&#xD;
      biological or physiological - exist that can be used to define an exacerbation. Exacerbations&#xD;
      are associated with airways inflammation but direct measurement of inflammatory markers is&#xD;
      difficult as bronchoalveolar lavage and endobronchial biopsy are too invasive, and sputum and&#xD;
      exhaled breath condensate too complex and time-consuming to be practical in routine clinical&#xD;
      practice. Blood is easily obtainable for measurement of biomarkers but it is not established&#xD;
      that systemic markers reflect airways inflammation or correlate with clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations. Nasal samples are also easy to obtain and there is data showing nasal&#xD;
      inflammatory markers correlate with lower airway inflammation8 and we have reported that IL-8&#xD;
      and IL-6 are elevated in nasal lavage following experimental rhinovirus infection5. A number&#xD;
      of biomarkers have been investigated both as markers of COPD exacerbations and indicators of&#xD;
      specific aetiologies. Copeptin9 and serum amyloid A (SAA)10 correlate with clinical outcomes&#xD;
      in COPD exacerbations, interferon-induced protein-10 (IP-10)11 and neopterin have been&#xD;
      identified as potential markers of viral respiratory infections12,13 and procalcitonin as a&#xD;
      marker of bacterial infection14. However none of these markers have been investigated&#xD;
      specifically as predictors of outcomes following URTI in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship between viral URTI and COPD exacerbations Data from our study suggests that&#xD;
      treatment at the time of the initial URTI may be required to prevent virus-induced&#xD;
      exacerbations. However this strategy risks treating URTIs that do not progress to an&#xD;
      exacerbation resulting in over-treatment. Only one study has examined exacerbations following&#xD;
      URTIs in COPD patients and found 43% of URTIs were followed by exacerbations15. However in&#xD;
      this study URTIs were identified retrospectively from symptom diary cards and therefore it&#xD;
      was not proven that the symptoms were caused by viral infection. Up to 75% of COPD patients&#xD;
      complain of upper respiratory symptoms when clinically stable16 so upper respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      caused by factors other than viral infections would have weakened the association between&#xD;
      URTI and COPD exacerbations in this study. The true association is likely to be higher and&#xD;
      can only be determined by virological confirmation of infection. Also the risk of&#xD;
      exacerbation following a viral URTI may not be the same for all COPD patients but may be&#xD;
      influenced by host factors such as FEV1, previous exacerbation history and smoking status.&#xD;
      Currently no data is available regarding how these factors may influence risk of exacerbation&#xD;
      following a viral URTI. All studies to date of COPD exacerbations have recruited patients&#xD;
      when they present with symptoms of an exacerbation. Therefore the opportunity to investigate&#xD;
      the relationship between a preceding URTI and the exacerbation has been missed. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to recruit a cohort of COPD patients and investigate them when they develop an&#xD;
      URTI so that the relationship with a subsequent exacerbation can be examined in a prospective&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish the proportion of URTIs with a confirmed viral aetiology in COPD patients&#xD;
           that progress to an acute exacerbation and determine the specific viral aetiologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify clinical, viral and biological markers that predict progression of an URTI&#xD;
           to an exacerbation and correlate with exacerbation severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine baseline clinical characteristics that identify patients at high risk of&#xD;
           developing exacerbations following a viral URTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the frequency of, and risk factors for, bacterial infection following viral&#xD;
           URTI in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To develop a model combining baseline patient characteristics, clinical measurements and&#xD;
           biomarkers that will predict exacerbation risk following viral URTI in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Methods Study subjects A cohort of 100 COPD subjects will be recruited from the Chest and&#xD;
      Allergy clinic at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington part of Imperial College Healthcare NHS&#xD;
      Trust and community clinics within the local areas of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria The principal inclusion criterion is patients who are 40-85 years old with&#xD;
      a diagnosis of COPD confirmed with spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have difficulty understanding English so would not be able to answer&#xD;
           symptom questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have another medical condition such as advanced cancer that means they&#xD;
           have a life expectancy less than 2 years and so would not be able to complete follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who would find it difficult to attend for frequent visits to hospital will&#xD;
           also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit Following informed consent participants will have a baseline visit at which&#xD;
      they will have detailed clinical characterisation including documentation of smoking status,&#xD;
      co-morbidities, exacerbation frequency and medications and measurement of lung function&#xD;
      (FEV1, FVC, FEV1,/FVC, PEF, transfer coefficient). Sputum, nasal fluid and blood will be&#xD;
      collected for baseline assessment of bacterial and viral colonisation and measurement of&#xD;
      airways inflammation and biomarkers. During the course of the study the participants will&#xD;
      have repeat visits with the same assessment and sampling carried out every 3 months. The&#xD;
      purpose of this is to document any changes in clinical status (e.g. change in smoking status)&#xD;
      and to ensure that if a cold/exacerbation occurs there will be a stable visit with which to&#xD;
      compare parameters within the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the baseline visit the participants will commence a record of lower respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms using the Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT), a new&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome diary that has been validated in COPD cohort studies17. They will&#xD;
      continue their usual medications and medical care but will be advised to contact the&#xD;
      investigators if they develop symptoms of a cold or an exacerbation. They will be contacted&#xD;
      by telephone weekly in an attempt to identify all episodes of increased respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cold visit Subjects will be advised to report to the investigators if they develop symptoms&#xD;
      of an URTI. When this occurs they will be seen within 24 hours for a 'cold visit' - the&#xD;
      details of this visit are shown below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      URTI symptoms will be quantified using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey&#xD;
      (WURSS-21)18 questionnaire. The WURSS-21 is a quality of life assessment that measures the&#xD;
      health-related effects of the common cold and has been used to predict exacerbations&#xD;
      following URTI in asthmatics19. To obtain WURSS-21 scores in COPD subjects without a cold a&#xD;
      subgroup of stable subjects will be administered the WURSS-21 for 14 consecutive days. FEV1,&#xD;
      FVC, FEV1,/FVC and PEF will be measured and samples of nasal fluid, induced sputum and blood&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be seen 7 days after the cold visit with repeat sampling unless they&#xD;
      develop an exacerbation prior to this. As exacerbations are defined by symptoms and symptom&#xD;
      perception is subjective the purpose of this visit will be to measure objective markers such&#xD;
      as lung function and inflammatory markers in the clinical samples collected. Comparing these&#xD;
      between participants who do and do not report exacerbations will provide more objective&#xD;
      evidence that an exacerbation has occurred in addition to symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exacerbation visit When subjects develop an URTI they will monitored for symptoms of a&#xD;
      subsequent exacerbation and if this occurs they will have a further visit termed the&#xD;
      'exacerbation visit'. If participants develop an exacerbation without a preceding URTI they&#xD;
      will also be seen. Clinical assessment including physical examination, symptom scores and&#xD;
      spirometry will be carried out to evaluate exacerbation severity and the same clinical&#xD;
      samples as the cold visit collected. Subjects will have further visits 2 and 6 weeks after&#xD;
      exacerbation onset with repeat assessment and clinical sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milestones COPD patients have an average of 1-2 colds per year so recruiting a cohort of 100&#xD;
      subjects and following them for 24 months to include 4 seasons of peak rhinovirus activity&#xD;
      should provide at least 200 episodes of URTI to evaluate. We will then require 6 months to&#xD;
      complete the laboratory analyses and analyse the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Study Procedures Throat swab A sterile dry cotton-headed swab is used to obtain samples&#xD;
      from the pharynx for virus detection. This is performed with the subject sitting. Ensure&#xD;
      adequate lighting and use a tongue depressor if required. Remove the swab from the container&#xD;
      carefully to ensure the tip is not contaminated, and swab the dorsal aspect of the pharynx&#xD;
      and soft palate, avoiding the tongue. Place swab into a dry container and freeze at -80°C&#xD;
      prior to analysis and another into bacteriology culture medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasosorption&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal lining fluid will be collected using the Synthetic Absorptive Matrix (SAM) method.&#xD;
      Fluid volumes of 50-100μL are obtained and 50μL is enough to measure up to 20 analytes using&#xD;
      the MSD platform (http://www.meso-scale.com), which we have already used to assay soluble&#xD;
      mediators in human studies and custom made plates to measure selected mediators can be&#xD;
      obtained. Strips of SAM will be used for 2 minutes in the nostril to obtain repeated samples&#xD;
      of neat nasal ELF. This is a painless minimally invasive procedure that will not require any&#xD;
      local anaesthetic. Following sampling, SAM will be placed in a 1mL microfuge spin filter tube&#xD;
      containing 100μL of elution buffer (PBS/1% bovine serum albumin/1% Triton®). In order to&#xD;
      determine the volume of fluid obtained by nasosorption and hence the final concentration of&#xD;
      soluble mediators in ELF, the weight of the SAM before and after sampling must be known. The&#xD;
      following procedure must be followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the dry weight of the SAM (DS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the dry empty weight of the microfuge tube (DT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the combined weight of the microfuge tube containing SAM in elution buffer (CW)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculate and record weight of ELF (mg):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight of ELF = CW - (DT + DS + 100) (100mg is the weight of 100μL of elution buffer) The SAM&#xD;
      will be transported on dry ice to the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal Lavage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal lavage is performed using the following technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure to occur in negative-pressure room on ICRRU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5mL of 0.9% saline is introduced into one nostril using a syringe with the subject&#xD;
           sitting with the head tilted back.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The saline is held in the nose for 5 seconds then blown into a sterile pot. The&#xD;
           procedure is then repeated for the other nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fluid is then aliquotted into sterile microfuge tubes and centrifuged for analysis&#xD;
           of cells and supernatants are frozen at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal lavage fluid will be analysed with PCR for respiratory viruses. Any samples that are&#xD;
      positive for rhinovirus will be further analysed with a quantitative PCR to determine the&#xD;
      virus load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling Blood will be taken at the baseline visit for separation of serum for&#xD;
      measurement of inflammatory markers and measurement of C-reactive protein and a full blood&#xD;
      count. These will be processed in the Respiratory Medicine laboratories in the Medical School&#xD;
      Building, St Mary's Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total amount of blood taken at each visit would amount to 20mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induced Sputum Sputum will be induced and processed using standard protocols20. Briefly&#xD;
      participants will be pre-medicated with 200mg salbutamol via metered dose inhaler and large&#xD;
      volume spacer and baseline FEV1 measured. 3% saline will be administered with a DeVilbiss&#xD;
      UltraNeb99 ultrasonic nebuliser in 2 minute periods and FEV1 measured again. If FEV1 falls by&#xD;
      20% the procedure will be discontinued and further salbutamol administered. Otherwise the&#xD;
      procedure will be continued and FEV1 measured every 2 minutes until an adequate sputum sample&#xD;
      is obtained. Sputum will be processed within 2 hours of induction. Sputum plugs will be&#xD;
      selected from saliva by macroscopic inspection of the sample and an aliquot selected and&#xD;
      stored unprocessed at -80oC for qRT-PCR for virus detection. An aliquot of sputum will also&#xD;
      be kept for bacterial detection. The remaining sample will be weighed, 0.1% Dithiothreitol&#xD;
      (DTT) added in the ratio 4ml DTT to 1g sputum and the mixture agitated and filtered. The same&#xD;
      volume PBS added, the filtrate centrifuged and the supernatant aliquotted and stored at&#xD;
      -80°C. The cell pellet will be washed and resuspended and the cells counted to obtain total&#xD;
      cell counts. Cytospins will be prepared and stained using Shandon Diffquick kit (Thermo&#xD;
      Shandon Ltd, Cheshire, UK), coded and counted blind to study status to obtain differential&#xD;
      cell counts. Cell counts will be expressed as a percentage of at least 400 inflammatory&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) Regulatory issues Ethics approval Approval has been obtained from the East London Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee for this study. The study will be submitted for Site Specific Assessment&#xD;

      Consent Consent to enter the study will be sought from each participant only after a full&#xD;
      explanation has been given, an information leaflet offered, time allowed for consideration,&#xD;
      and any questions participants may have answered. Signed participant consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. The right of the participant to refuse to participate without giving reasons must&#xD;
      be respected. After the participant has entered the study the clinician remains free to give&#xD;
      alternative treatment to that specified in the protocol at any stage if he/she feels it is in&#xD;
      the participant's best interest, but the reasons for doing so should be recorded. In these&#xD;
      cases the participants remain within the study for the purposes of follow-up and data&#xD;
      analysis. All participants are free to withdraw at any time from the protocol treatment&#xD;
      without giving reasons and without prejudicing further treatment.&#xD;

      Serious AEs An SAE form should be completed and faxed to the Chief Investigator and the&#xD;
      Sponsor within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SAEs should be reported to the East London Research Ethics Committee where in the opinion&#xD;
      of the Chief Investigator, the event was:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  'related', i.e. resulted from the administration of any of the research procedures; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  'unexpected', i.e. an event that is not listed in the protocol as an expected occurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports of related and unexpected SAEs should be submitted to ethics, the sponsor and the R&amp;D&#xD;
      office within 15 days of the Chief Investigator becoming aware of the event, using the NRES&#xD;
      SAE form for non-IMP studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact details for reporting SAEs Fax: 020 7262 8913 for the attention of Dr Patrick Mallia&#xD;
      Tel: 020 7594 3751 (Mon to Fri 09.00 - 17.00)&#xD;

      7) Track Records Our group has an established record of high quality research in the field of&#xD;
      viral infections in asthma and COPD. We have established protocols for PCR detection of&#xD;
      respiratory viruses, quantitative PCR for rhinovirus and have collaborated with Imperial&#xD;
      College Healthcare NHS Trust Microbiology Laboratory for semi-quantitative bacterial&#xD;
      cultures. We have established protocols and experience in measuring inflammatory mediators in&#xD;
      nasal fluid and sputum supernatants and are developing expertise in use of the MSD platform.&#xD;
      Dr Elkin has experience in recruiting cohorts of COPD patients for longitudinal clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8) Expected impact This study will be the first to determine the relationship between viral&#xD;
      URTI and exacerbations in COPD patients. It will establish clinical factors and biomarkers&#xD;
      that predict the risk of an exacerbation following an URTI. The data obtained will be of&#xD;
      enormous interest to the pharmaceutical industry and clinical researchers as it will open the&#xD;
      way for trials of antiviral therapies for virus-induced COPD exacerbations.&#xD;
