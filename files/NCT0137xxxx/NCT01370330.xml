  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a compassionate use protocol to allow patients with advanced neuroblastoma palliative&#xD;
      access to 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma remains a fatal disease for a large percentage of patients, especially those&#xD;
      with high-risk disease features who become resistant to conventional therapy.&#xD;
      131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) is a norepinephrine analog that concentrates in&#xD;
      adrenergic tissue and therefore holds promise for cell-specific treatment of neuroblastoma.&#xD;
      131I-MIBG is active against relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma and associated hematopoietic&#xD;
      toxicity can be abrogated with autologous stem cell rescue. 131I-MIBG given in doses of 10-18&#xD;
      millicurie (mCi)/kg with stem cell rescue, if necessary, is safe and effective palliative&#xD;
      therapy for refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma patients.&#xD;

    <description>131I-MIBG Therapeutic Administration. Therapeutic 131I-MIBG will be synthesized at Jubilant DraxImage (Quebec, Canada) with specific activities of 9-18 Ci/mmole, or at Progenics with specific activity of 2,500 mCi/mg. The therapeutic dose (8-18 mCi/kg at investigator's discretion; any dose greater than 12 requires stored stem cells) will be diluted in 25-50 ml of normal saline for either preparation, and will be infused intravenously through a patient's central line, if already present, or a peripheral IV if a central line is not present.If Azedra is used, the dose will be infused over 30-60 minutes; the low specific activity preparation from Draximage will be infused over 90-120 minutes. For patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, the recommended maximum dose is 500 mCI or 12 mCi/kg.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis: Refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma with original diagnosis based on tumor&#xD;
             histopathology or elevated urine catecholamines with typical tumor cells in the bone&#xD;
             marrow. Refractory, progressive or metastatic pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma or&#xD;
             related tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MIBG uptake: Tumors must be shown to be MIBG avid within 6 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 1 year and able to cooperate with radiation safety restrictions during therapy&#xD;
             period. Patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and related tumors must be&#xD;
             between 1 and 12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life Expectancy: greater than 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lanksy and Karnofsky Performance Status: 60% or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease status: Failure to respond to standard therapy (usually combination&#xD;
             chemotherapy with or without radiation and surgery) or development of progressive&#xD;
             disease at any time (any new lesion or an increase in size of &gt;25% of a pre-existing&#xD;
             lesion). Disease evaluable by MIBG scan must be present within 6 weeks of study entry&#xD;
             and subsequent to any intervening therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stem cells: Patients must have an autologous hematopoietic stem cell product available&#xD;
             for re-infusion after MIBG treatment at doses of &gt;12 mCi/kg if needed. The minimum&#xD;
             quantity for purged or unpurged peripheral blood stem cells is 1.0 x 10^6 cluster of&#xD;
             differentiation 34 (CD34)+ cells/kg (optimum &gt; 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg). The minimum&#xD;
             dose for bone marrow is 1.0 x 10^8 mononuclear cells/kg (optimum &gt; 2.0 x 10^8&#xD;
             mononuclear cells/kg). If no stem cells are available, then the dose of 131I-MIBG&#xD;
             should be &lt;12 mCi/kg .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior Therapy: Patients may enter this study with or without re-induction therapy for&#xD;
             recurrent tumor. Patients must have fully recovered from the toxic effects of any&#xD;
             prior therapy. At least 2 weeks should have elapsed since any anti-tumor therapy and&#xD;
             the patient must meet hematologic criteria below. Three months should have elapsed in&#xD;
             the case of completing radiation to any of the following fields: craniospinal, total&#xD;
             abdominal, whole lung, total body irradiation). Cytokine therapy [eg&#xD;
             granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage&#xD;
             colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), erythropoietin] must be&#xD;
             discontinued a minimum or 24 hours prior to MIBG therapy. Prior 131I-MIBG therapy is&#xD;
             allowed if &gt; 6 months previous and if the patient has adequate hematopoietic stem&#xD;
             cells available and if cumulative 131I-MIBG dose will not exceed 60 mCi/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Organ Function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver function: bilirubin &lt;2x normal and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/Alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 10x normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Kidney function: Creatinine less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematopoietic Criteria Patients must have adequate hematopoietic function (without&#xD;
             transfusion): absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;.750 x 10E9/L; Platelets &gt;50 x 10E9/L&#xD;
             if stem cells are not available; if stem cells are available, the patient should be&#xD;
             independent of platelet transfusions with a platelet count of at least 20 x 10E9/L.&#xD;
             Hemoglobin &gt;10g/dl at time of treatment (transfusion allowed). Patients with&#xD;
             granulocytopenia and/or thrombocytopenia due to tumor metastatic to the bone marrow&#xD;
             may be eligible after discussion with study chair or designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal lung function as manifested by no dyspnea at rest or exercise intolerance, no&#xD;
             oxygen requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No clinically significant cardiac dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent: The patient and/or the patient's legally authorized guardian&#xD;
             must acknowledge in writing that consent to become a study subject has been obtained,&#xD;
             in accordance with institutional policies approved by the U.S. Department of Health&#xD;
             and Human Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with disease of any major organ system that would compromise their ability to&#xD;
             withstand therapy. Any significant organ impairment should be discussed with the Study&#xD;
             Chair or Vice Chair prior to patient entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because of the teratogenic potential of the study medications, no patients who are&#xD;
             pregnant or lactating will be allowed. Patients of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             practice an effective method of birth control while participating on this study, to&#xD;
             avoid possible pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are on hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active infections that meet grade 3-4 toxicity criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma who have any proteinuria on urinalysis&#xD;
             must have a 24-hr urine collection for protein. If there is proteinuria above the&#xD;
             reference range on a 24-hour urine collection, they are excluded due to increased risk&#xD;
             of respiratory complications.&#xD;
