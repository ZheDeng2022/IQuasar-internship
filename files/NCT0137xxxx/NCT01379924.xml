      1. Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effects of life skills/parenting groups that are embedded within a&#xD;
           comprehensive multidisciplinary clinic for adolescent parents (the Young Parents&#xD;
           Program), using a randomized control design. Specifically, the effect of group&#xD;
           participation on the following adolescent parent outcomes will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Parenting attitudes and skills including empathy, non-violent discipline, role&#xD;
                appropriateness and developmentally appropriate expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Skills of daily living, social relationships, and work/study at follow-up, as&#xD;
                measured by the Ansell-Casey Life Skills Assessment Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Depression and perceived social support using the CESD-C and Duke Social Support&#xD;
                scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Repeat pregnancy rates at 12 and 24 months after first delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the overall Young Parents Program service delivery as required by the Office&#xD;
           of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs (project funder) using a cross cutting evaluation of&#xD;
           health services utilization, social needs and work/educational outcomes.&#xD;

      The Young Parents Program (YPP), a specialty clinic within Children's Hospital Primary Care&#xD;
      Center, provides comprehensive medical care, mental health services, and advocacy to high&#xD;
      risk, urban teen parents and their young children through a teen-tot model. YPP serves 152&#xD;
      teenage mothers and their babies annually with a multi-disciplinary team knowledgeable in the&#xD;
      medical, social, and developmental issues of adolescence and early childhood. Project Connect&#xD;
      is an evaluation of both the medical and social services provided by YPP and a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of an intensive educational arm of YPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YPP serves the population that economically, ethnically, and geographically represents the&#xD;
      highest rates of subsequent pregnancies and the greatest risk for poor birth outcomes. The&#xD;
      staff of physicians, nurse practitioners, social workers, and nurse consists of experienced&#xD;
      professionals work with parents, adolescents, and children. YPP has cooperative relationships&#xD;
      with Boston area education and job training sites, Early Intervention Programs, the&#xD;
      Massachusetts Department of Revenue, community agencies, mental health services, and teen&#xD;
      living programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By providing an integrated family based comprehensive medical home and a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of intensive parenting/life skills training, Project Connect enhances teen&#xD;
      parents' connections to child, family, peers, partners, medical care, and mental health.&#xD;
      Medical care, home visiting, child/adolescent health services, mental health, and fathers'&#xD;
      programming are all linked into a continuous program. Goals of the intensive intervention are&#xD;
      to enhance parenting and life skills, help participants optimize family interactions, and&#xD;
      build self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Connect brings together YPP at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH), Healthy Baby/Healthy&#xD;
      Child (HB/HC) nurse home visiting program and Families First, a parenting education agency,&#xD;
      to provide a state-of-the art model of care for parenting teens in Boston. The model builds&#xD;
      on lessons learned and strengths of each program, adding critical new elements of randomized&#xD;
      control trial of parenting/life skills modules, and home visiting. Prenatal services will&#xD;
      encourage breast-feeding, and support infant care and parenting. YPP provides a medical home&#xD;
      with coordinated, continuous health care services, psychosocial support, parenting/life&#xD;
      skills modules and individual services for teen mothers and fathers. Integrated fathers'&#xD;
      services emphasize male parenting roles, communication, life skills training, violence&#xD;
      prevention and positive youth development.&#xD;

          <description>These modules were developed using the Ansell-Casey Life Skills Assessment Curriculum and The Women's Negotiation Project Curriculum for Teen Mothers. The Nurturing Curriculum has been shown in our past program to be associated with increased parenting skills, maternal self-esteem and decreased life hassles. The nationally recognized Nurturing Curriculum is integrated with the Ansell-Casey life skills Curriculum and The Women's Negotiation Project Curriculum to help teen mothers develop the skills and communication needs of daily living. The series of five, one-hour long, structured, one-on-one interactive modules aims to help teens build positive, empathetic relationships with their children, while enhancing self-efficacy and increasing the sense of self- worth for parents and children.

          <description>Patient takes part in modules that were developed using the Ansell-Casey Life Skills Assessment Curriculum and The Women's Negotiation Project Curriculum for Teen Mothers. The Nurturing Curriculum has been shown in our past program to be associated with increased parenting skills, maternal self-esteem and decreased life hassles. This curriculum is integrated with the Ansell-Casey life skills Curriculum and The Women's Negotiation Project Curriculum to help teen mothers develop the skills and communication needs of daily living. The series of five, one-hour long, structured, one-on-one interactive modules aims to help teens build positive, empathetic relationships with their children, while enhancing self-efficacy and increasing the sense of self- worth for parents and children. Domains addressed include child development/discipline, safety, house/money management, social relationships, career planning, substance abuse and community and interpersonal violence.</description>

The measure is comprised of 26 items with response items &quot;completely false&quot;, &quot;mainly false&quot;, &quot;uncertain or neither true or false&quot;, &quot;mainly true&quot;, and &quot;completely true.&quot; The item response scale ranged from 1-5, with higher scores indicating higher maternal self-esteem. The total score is a sum of all items, thus the minimum/maximum possible scores are 26-130. Higher scores indicate higher maternal self-esteem.</description>

            <description>Modules: These modules were developed using the Ansell-Casey Life Skills Assessment Curriculum and The Women's Negotiation Project Curriculum for Teen Mothers. The Nurturing Curriculum has been shown in our past program to be associated with increased parenting skills, maternal self-esteem and decreased life hassles. The nationally recognized Nurturing Curriculum is integrated with the Ansell-Casey life skills Curriculum and The Women's Negotiation Project Curriculum to help teen mothers develop the skills and communication needs of daily living. The series of five, one-hour long, structured, one-on-one interactive modules aims to help teens build positive, empathetic relationships with their children, while enhancing self-efficacy and increasing the sense of self- worth for parents and children. Domains addressed include child development/discipline, safety, house/money management, social relationships, career planning, substance abuse and community and interpersonal violence.</description>

The Nurturing Curriculum has been shown in our past program to be associated with increased parenting skills, maternal self-esteem and decreased life hassles. The nationally recognized Nurturing Curriculum is integrated with the Ansell-Casey life skills Curriculum and The Women's Negotiation Project Curriculum to help teen mothers develop the skills and communication needs of daily living. The series of five, one-hour long, structured, one-on-one interactive modules aims to help teens build positive, empathetic relationships with their children, while enhancing self-efficacy and increasing the sense of self- worth for parents and children. Domains addressed include child development/discipline, safety, house/money management, social relationships, career planning, substance abuse and community and interpersonal violence.</description>

            <description>Modules: These modules were developed using the Ansell-Casey Life Skills Assessment Curriculum and The Women's Negotiation Project Curriculum for Teen Mothers. The Nurturing Curriculum has been shown in our past program to be associated with increased parenting skills, maternal self-esteem and decreased life hassles. The nationally recognized Nurturing Curriculum is integrated with the Ansell-Casey life skills Curriculum and The Women's Negotiation Project Curriculum to help teen mothers develop the skills and communication needs of daily living. The series of five, one-hour long, structured, one-on-one interactive modules aims to help teens build positive, empathetic relationships with their children, while enhancing self-efficacy and increasing the sense of self- worth for parents and children. Domains addressed include child development/discipline, safety, house/money management, social relationships, career planning, substance abuse and community and interpersonal violence.</description>
