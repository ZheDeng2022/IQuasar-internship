      The purpose of the study is to compare the change from baseline in blood pressures (DBP/SBP)&#xD;
      to 16-week regimen between Amtrel® and Co-Diovan®. The secondary objectives were listed as&#xD;
      the following.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the response rate (defined as SBP &lt; 130 mmHg and DBP &lt; 80 mmHg) at the end of&#xD;
           study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the change from baseline in albumin-to-creatinine ratio with&#xD;
           antihypertensive medications in whole group (combined treatment groups) and each&#xD;
           treatment group (Amtrel®, Co-Diovan®) at Week 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at Week 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change from baseline in fasting lipid profiles (triglyceride, total cholesterol,&#xD;
           high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) at Week 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change from baseline in arteriosclerosis marker (brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity&#xD;
           (ba-PWV) and ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI), using Colin-VP1000) at Week 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change from baseline on the body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) at each&#xD;
           specified study time point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ascertain the safety and tolerability of Amtrel® versus Co-Diovan® including AE/SAE,&#xD;
           and laboratory examinations&#xD;

      At the screening visit, patients who fulfilled the entrance criteria and had given written&#xD;
      informed consent entered a placebo running period where they discontinued antihypertensive&#xD;
      medication for two weeks. During that period, Adalat 5mg could be given for emergency. At the&#xD;
      end of placebo running period those patients became hypertensive (i.e., SBP between&#xD;
      130-180mmHg or DBP between 80-110mmHg) were randomized into either treatment group. For those&#xD;
      patients remaining normotensive continued to be on placebo run-in for another two weeks (10 -&#xD;
      14 days). After the two-week (10 - 14 days) placebo run-in period those patients became&#xD;
      hypertensive were randomized into either treatment group. However for those patients&#xD;
      remaining normotensive were excluded from the study. After randomization into either arm,&#xD;
      patients entered four months treatment period. The dosage adjustment were proceed in order to&#xD;
      reach the best effect. During the treatment period there was a monthly visit to assess the&#xD;
      response of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose of Amtrel® was 1 capsule (contains 1/2 tablet) (amlodipine / benazepril&#xD;
      hydrochloride 2.5 mg/ 5 mg) every morning and could be adjusted up to 2 capsules (contains 1&#xD;
      tablet per capsule) (amlodipine / benazepril hydrochloride 10 mg/ 20 mg) every morning if&#xD;
      patients did not achieve the criteria of SBP&lt;130 mmHg and DBP&lt; 80 mmHg during treatment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose of Co-Diovan® was 1 capsule (contains 1/2 tablet) (valsartan/&#xD;
      hydrochlorothiazide 40 mg/ 6.25 mg) every morning and could be adjusted up to 2 capsules&#xD;
      (contains 1 tablet per capsule) (valsartan/ hydrochlorothiazide 160 mg/ 25.0 mg) every&#xD;
      morning if patients did not achieve the criteria of SBP&lt;130 mmHg and DBP&lt; 80 mmHg during&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All randomized patients attended monthly clinic visits for the 16-week treatment period. At&#xD;
      week 4 (Visit 3), all patients were force-titrated to 1 capsule (1 tablet per capsule) for 4&#xD;
      weeks. Subsequently, those patients did not achieve the target blood pressure (SBP&lt;130 mmHg&#xD;
      and DBP&lt;80 mmHg) were titrated monthly to next dose level (2 capsule per day).&#xD;
