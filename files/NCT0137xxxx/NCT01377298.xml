  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of the advantageous activity against VEGF-C and FGF pathways and favorable toxicity&#xD;
      profile comparing with sunitinib, the investigators plan this phase II trial of pazopanib in&#xD;
      cisplatin-refractory recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.&#xD;

      Pazopanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targets VEGFR1/2/3, PDGFR alpha &amp; beta, c-KIT, and&#xD;
      FGFR1/3 to inhibit angiogenesis. The phase II trial in advanced RCC (previous cytokine&#xD;
      therapy in 25 % of patients) yielded good clinical benefits (response rate 34.6%; disease&#xD;
      control 79.8%) with durable activity (progression-free to near 1 year) and acceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. The randomized phase III trial in advanced RCC are ongoing and interim analysis&#xD;
      revealed prolonged progression-free survival in pazopanib group compared with placebo group.&#xD;
      Pazopanib is an active multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor needed to broaden it new&#xD;
      indications to treat cancers. VEGF-C and FGF pathways are also important in the angiogenesis,&#xD;
      metastasis, invasion, and cancer stem cell renewal in HNSCC. Pazopanib can also inhibit these&#xD;
      two pathways and might offer much more suppression on tumor angiogenesis and growth in HNSCC&#xD;
      compared with sunitinib. Common side effects of pazopanib are grade I to II diarrhea,&#xD;
      hypertension, hair color change, and nausea, which are all manageable. Because of the&#xD;
      advantageous activity against VEGF-C and FGF pathways and favorable toxicity profile&#xD;
      comparing with sunitinib, we plan this phase II trial of pazopanib in cisplatin-refractory&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum inflammation markers, like IL-6 (esp. in inflammation- mediated cancers, like virus-&#xD;
      related hepatocellular carcinoma and HNSCC), and host/tumor VEGF/VEGFR2 polymorphism&#xD;
      attracted much attention in tumor angiogenesis dependence and response prediction of&#xD;
      anti-angiogenesis treatments, in addition to previously described sVEGFR2 and circulating&#xD;
      endothelial progenitors(CEP) in the phase II trial of RCC. We will study serum&#xD;
      IL-6/VEGF/sVEGFR2/CEP and host/tumor VEGF/VEGFR2 polymorphism for prognosis and response&#xD;
      correlation.&#xD;
