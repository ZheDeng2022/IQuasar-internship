      The purpose of this study is to determine whether children on long-term parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      (&gt;6 weeks) have serum aluminum concentrations that are higher than children (aged and gender&#xD;
      matched) that have never received parenteral nutrition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aluminum contamination of parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions has been a concern for decades&#xD;
      because of its link to metabolic bone disease (MBD) due to it's high aluminum content.&#xD;
      Currently in the United States, FDA regulations are in place to protect American patients on&#xD;
      PN from the effects of aluminum (AL) toxicity. Despite these regulations, pediatric patients&#xD;
      on PN are still receiving higher than recommended AL intakes from PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike the United States, there are no regulations governing AL content of or intakes from PN&#xD;
      solutions in Canada. Consequently, the investigators are unaware of the AL content of the&#xD;
      various PN solutions given to our patients. The investigators (the authors) have observed&#xD;
      that a significant number of our patients on long-term PN (Home PN), have MBD. Some of our&#xD;
      patients have also had bone fractures. The investigators have also observed alteration in&#xD;
      calcium and phosphate concentrations as well as suppressed PTH. In an effort to understand&#xD;
      the etiology of the MBD the investigators have measured serum AL concentrations in our&#xD;
      patients and have found them to be high; between 900 - 2000 nmol/L compared to 0 to 220&#xD;
      nmol/L reported in healthy adults. This has led us to believe that there is a significant&#xD;
      problem of AL contamination in PN solutions in Canada. Because the investigators are unable&#xD;
      to obtain information on the AL content of the various PN solutions from the PN suppliers,&#xD;
      the investigators have decided to report on the serum AL concentrations of our patients as&#xD;
      well as the AL concentration of a random sample of PN solutions provided to patients. Plasma&#xD;
      aluminum concentrations have already been analyzed in each of the cases. Blood was drawn for&#xD;
      routine clinical monitoring on each subject after they had been on PN for six weeks or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first step towards raising awareness of the potential problem. It is our hope&#xD;
      that this will provide initial evidence to help guide Health Canada's decision regarding&#xD;
      regulations on AL content in PN solutions in Canada.&#xD;

    <description>A 4 ml blood sample will be obtained from each control subject when they are giving blood for routine clinbical purposes. These subjects will be recruited from in-patient wards or ambulatory clinics. The aluminum content of samples (plasma aluminum concentration) will be determined by high resolution sector field inductively coupled mass spectrometry (HR-SF-ICP-MS). The accuracy and precision of the instrument used to determine aluminum concentration is measured using external and internal standards. Accuracy and precision was last measured at ± 0.5 to 2.5% and 5 to 10% respectively</description>
