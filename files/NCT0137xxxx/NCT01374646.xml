      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive community based program on&#xD;
      reducing excess weight. Overweight and obese study participants will be grouped with peers of&#xD;
      similar ages and their parent/guardians. The participants will be divided into 2 groups,&#xD;
      child (6-12 yrs. old) and teens (13-17 yrs. old) and will be accompanied by their&#xD;
      parent/guardian. 150 participants will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 6-month program (12 in-person group workshop sessions and 12 at-home sessions) takes the&#xD;
      best components of current evidence for individual treatment and places them in a&#xD;
      comprehensive community based program. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parental involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in consumption of sugar sweetened beverages&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of screen time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stimulus control&#xD;
