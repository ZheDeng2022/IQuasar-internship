      Hypothesis: Directly applying antibiotic powder onto the site of surgery along with&#xD;
      perioperative intravenous antibiotics, before closing the wound, is more effective than&#xD;
      intravenously applied perioperative antibiotics alone in controlling post-operative wound&#xD;
      infection. The investigators also think powders that control both gram positive and gram&#xD;
      negative bacteria are more beneficial.&#xD;

      1. Subjects will be divided into three groups based on the procedure used for the&#xD;
           application of antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. No local antibiotics (control group): In this group, individuals will be subjected&#xD;
                to peri-operative intravenous* antibiotics only&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Gram positive antibiotic: In this group, gram positive (powdered vancomycin)+ will&#xD;
                be applied to the site of surgery, before closure of the wound, along with&#xD;
                peri-operative intravenous antibiotics*&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Gram positive and gram negative: In this group, gram positive (powdered vancomycin)&#xD;
                will be instilled on the site of surgery, before closing the wound, and gram&#xD;
                negative antibiotic (gentamycin mixed with bone cement)+ will be used, along with&#xD;
                peri-operative intravenous antibiotics* (only in cases of implant fixation).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Intravenous antibiotic dosage: 1 pre-operative dose of Cefuroxime 1.5 gm and 2&#xD;
                     post-operative doses of Cefuroxime 750 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Vancomycin and Gentamycin dosage: 500 mg of vancomycin powder will be&#xD;
                          used and in group 'c' gentamycin mixed with bone cement will be used&#xD;
                          along with vancomycin powder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sample size: Based on, finding at least 4% difference between the proportions of&#xD;
           infections found in control (generally 5%, 4% in case of joint replacement) and case&#xD;
           groups (1%) (proportions were assumed from literature and our institute records), a&#xD;
           sample size of minimum 285 in each group (424 for joint replacement cases) will be&#xD;
           considered for the observation to be significant at an alpha level of 0.05. This will&#xD;
           give the study a minimum power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Spine cases: Control = 143, Gram-P = 143; Trauma cases: Control = 143, Gram-P = 143;&#xD;
           Joint replacement cases: Control = 424, Gram-P = 424, Gram-P+Gram-N = 424; Total = 1844;&#xD;
           Where Control - Cases with intravenous antibiotic dose; Gram-P - Cases with intravenous&#xD;
           antibiotic + local antibiotic (Vancomycin, acts against gram positive bacteria); Gram-N&#xD;
           - Cases with intravenous antibiotic + local antibiotic (Vancomycin, acts against gram&#xD;
           positive bacteria) + local Gentamycin cement (acts against gram negative bacteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedure: Sampling will be based on stratified procedure. The total sample will be&#xD;
           divided into categories based on the type of surgery, which are spine, trauma and joint&#xD;
           replacement. Subjects within each category will be randomly selected for the three&#xD;
           antibiotic treatments. For this study, we will use computer software to generate&#xD;
           restricted randomization to achieve balance between groups in size. Within this&#xD;
           restricted randomization, single block random size will be used to ensure randomization&#xD;
           within each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While joint surgery category will have all the three groups of cases (a, b and c), spine&#xD;
           and trauma surgery category will have only two groups (a and b). Surgeries will be&#xD;
           performed accordingly i.e. control group individuals will undergo mandated hospital&#xD;
           policy requirements + perioperative intravenous antibiotic treatment and cases will&#xD;
           undergo mandated hospital policy requirements + powdered vancomycin, or both vancomycin,&#xD;
           just before the closure of the wound, and gentamycin as a mix with bone cement. Patients&#xD;
           who exhibit both superficial and deep wood infection will be considered as infected and&#xD;
           accounted for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Analysis: Our main parameter of comparison is infection percentage among control and&#xD;
           cases. Various factors like duration of surgery, tourniquet time, prior infections,&#xD;
           blood transfusion, haemoglobin count, comorbidities, etc, will be considered while&#xD;
           analysing for infection percentage. Infection proportions will be compared between&#xD;
           different groups at a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
