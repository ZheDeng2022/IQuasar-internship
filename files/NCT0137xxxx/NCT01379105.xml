      The objective of this experimental study was to compare the electromyographic responses of&#xD;
      sedentary youth with and without the administration of static stretching and neural&#xD;
      mobilization. The sample was composed of sedentary students, divided, randomly, into neural&#xD;
      mobilization practitioners (NMG; n=15; age=22±3 years), static stretching practitioners (SSG;&#xD;
      n=15; age=23±4 years) and a control group (CG; n=15; age: 24±4 years). For this evaluation,&#xD;
      an electromyograph (EMG; a four channel system) was used to monitor electrical activity in&#xD;
      the femoral bicep muscles). In neural mobilization, hip flexion was conducted passively with&#xD;
      the knee extended, and 30 plantar-to-dorsal flexion oscillations were completed per minute.&#xD;
      For the static stretching, hip flexion with was completed passively with the knee extended&#xD;
      and held for 6 seconds. The perception of effort was evaluated using the Perceived Force in&#xD;
      Flexibility Scale. The statistical significance level was p&lt;0.05. Descriptive statistics such&#xD;
      as the average, standard deviation, median, standard error and absolute change within groups&#xD;
      (post-test - pretest) were calculated. The sample normality was evaluated using the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test. For the response variable analysis, the paired Student's t-test (paired)&#xD;
      or Wilcoxon test (nonparametric) was used for intragroup analysis. For the intergroup&#xD;
      analysis, the multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used, followed by the Tukey&#xD;
      Post-Hoc test. A p&lt;0.05 significance level was adopted for the statistical evaluations.&#xD;
      Microsoft Excel and the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 14.0 were used&#xD;
      for evaluation of the results.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was approved by the Committee for Ethics in Research with Humans of the Faculty of&#xD;
      Medical Sciences (FACIME) (protocol number 145/09).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group included students with the absence of neural, muscular and skeletal-associated&#xD;
      problems and who were non-obese, according to established body mass index (BMI) criteria.&#xD;
      Participants were excluded if they had metabolic disease or neuro-musculo-skeletal problems,&#xD;
      practiced certain physical activities, presented pain during maintenance of the position for&#xD;
      electromyographic response collection or otherwise did not fulfill the terms of the agreement&#xD;
      with the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, the researcher conducted an anamnesis of the individuals to obtain&#xD;
      information about their dietary habits (Vasconcelos, 1995), medicines being used,&#xD;
      pathological history and physical activity, according to the Baecke Questionnaire (Florindo,&#xD;
      Latorre, 2003). In the second stage, the subjects' heights and body mass were measured for&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) evaluation using a Filizola 0-150 kg clinical scale (with a precision&#xD;
      of 0.1 kg) and a mechanical 0-190 cm stadiometer (with a precision of 0.5 cm), following the&#xD;
      recommendations of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry&#xD;
      (Marfell-Jonnes et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the electromyography measurements, the subject was positioned in dorsal decubitus on a&#xD;
      São Paulo Institute (ISP) model 4040 couch, and the researcher performed hip flexion and knee&#xD;
      extension until tissue resistance, at which point the volunteer reported the sensation of&#xD;
      &quot;discomfort combined with pain'' by pressing a trigger button, and the signal was recorded&#xD;
      for 2 seconds after this point. The speed with which the movements were made was slow and&#xD;
      gradual, because, according to reports from Tanaka and Farah (2007), for the same degree of&#xD;
      the range of motion, a greater stretching speed generates a higher impulse frequency in the&#xD;
      afferent fibers near the terminal, such that a more intense reflex response is promoted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electrical activity of the femoral bicep muscle of the right thigh was recorded by a four&#xD;
      channel EMG system with using superficial bipolar active electrodes (pre-amplified) with&#xD;
      acquisition software and signal processing. The sampling frequency was 2,000 Hz, and the&#xD;
      amplifier had a high-pass filter at 20 Hz and a low-pass filter at 500 Hz; a 12-bit&#xD;
      analogical converter and computer completed the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both interventions (SSG and NMG), the perception of strength was evaluated using the&#xD;
      Perceived Strength and Flexibility Scale (PERFLEX)which presents five levels of intensity,&#xD;
      varying from 0 to 110, with five corresponding verbal descriptors, so that the evaluated&#xD;
      individual can point to the description of their perception corresponding to the amplitude of&#xD;
      movement performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SSG group, the subject was positioned in dorsal decubitus, and the researcher&#xD;
      performed hip flexion with the knee extended passively and held for 30 seconds; this type of&#xD;
      stretching corresponds to the maintenance of increased amplitude posture, without surpassing&#xD;
      the maximum movement limit, three times with an interval of 10 seconds between the&#xD;
      repetitions (Nelson and Bandy, 2005). In the NMG group, the subject was positioned in dorsal&#xD;
      decubitus, and the researcher performed hip flexion with the knee extended passively and&#xD;
      performed 30 oscillations of plantar-to-dorsal flexion for one minute. In the SSG group, the&#xD;
      subject was positioned in dorsal decubitus, and the researcher performed hip flexion with the&#xD;
      knee extended passively and held for 30 seconds; this type of stretching corresponds to the&#xD;
      maintenance of increased amplitude posture, without surpassing the maximum movement limit,&#xD;
      three times with an interval of 10 seconds between the repetitions (Nelson and Bandy, 2005).&#xD;
      In the NMG group, the subject was positioned in dorsal decubitus, and the researcher&#xD;
      performed hip flexion with the knee extended passively and performed 30 oscillations of&#xD;
      plantar-to-dorsal flexion for one minute.&#xD;
