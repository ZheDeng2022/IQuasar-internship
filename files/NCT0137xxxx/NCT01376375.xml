      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical treatment. Thin needles are used to stimulate&#xD;
      specific points in the body. Previous studies have found that acupuncture can be useful in&#xD;
      treating low back pain. This study will explore how acupuncture affects low back pain.&#xD;
      Researchers will look at blood samples for changes in different chemicals related to&#xD;
      inflammation and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the effect of acupuncture on blood chemicals associated with chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People at least 18 years of age who have chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who have had back surgery or had acupuncture for any medical condition may not&#xD;
           participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires eight visits over 2 to 3 weeks. Each visit will take 1.5 to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first study visit, participants will give a medical history and complete two&#xD;
           questionnaires about their low back pain. They will also spend 30 minutes lying down on&#xD;
           a bed, relaxing quietly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The next visits will occur every 2 to 3 days for the next 2 weeks. Participants will&#xD;
           receive 30 minutes of either sham or standard acupuncture. Sham acupuncture will mimic&#xD;
           the standard procedure, but no needles will be used. The standard procedure will be&#xD;
           performed in the same location. A licensed, experienced acupuncturist will insert small&#xD;
           disposable needles into acupuncture sites on the back, arms, and legs. Those in the&#xD;
           study will not know whether they are receiving the sham or the standard acupuncture&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At some visits, participants will provide blood samples for testing. At every visit,&#xD;
           participants will complete the questionnaires about low back pain.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation and primary mechanical derangements are thought to be the two major causes&#xD;
      leading to low back pain (LBP) syndromes. Increasing evidence suggests that cytokines and&#xD;
      hormones, including IFN-gamma, IL-17, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, MMP10, NGF, PGE2, NO and&#xD;
      IL-8, play critical roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory LBP. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the effect of acupuncture on LBP by measuring serum cytokine and hormone levels&#xD;
      before and after treatment in participants. To define the molecular mechanism by which&#xD;
      acupuncture affects LBP, histone modification, including H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, as well as&#xD;
      methylation patterns of CpG islands on the promoters of selected genes in the peripheral&#xD;
      CD4(plus) T cells will be also tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five participants with chronic LBP will receive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this non-randomized, single group pilot study, participants will be given sham acupuncture&#xD;
      and subsequently treated with acupuncture for a total of eight visits over the span of 17&#xD;
      days. Blood will be drawn and analyzed at scheduled intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to investigate the potential effect of acupuncture treatment, as&#xD;
      compared to sham acupuncture and quiet relaxation, on the regulation of IFN-gamma and IL-17&#xD;
      in participants with LBP, including the serum level of these two cytokines, frequency of&#xD;
      CD4(plus)IFN-gamma(plus) and CD4(plus)IL-17(plus) cells in the peripheral blood, and the&#xD;
      patterns of H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and DNA methylation on their promoters in CD4(plus) T cells in&#xD;
      response to acupuncture treatment. Secondary outcomes investigate the effects of acupuncture,&#xD;
      as compared to sham acupuncture and quiet relaxation, on the following outcome measures:&#xD;
      level of serum cytokines and hormones, including IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, MMP10, NGF, PGE2, NO,&#xD;
      IL-8, IL-6, TGF-beta, IL-10, IL-22, IL-23 and IL-17F before and after acupuncture treatment;&#xD;
      genome-wide gene expression profile of CD4(plus) T cells before and after acupuncture&#xD;
      treatment; genome-wide patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modification in CD4(plus) T cells&#xD;
      before and after acupuncture treatment; genome-wide patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3&#xD;
      modification in CD4(plus)T cells before and after acupuncture treatment; DNA methylation&#xD;
      status change of selected CpG islands before and after acupuncture treatment; and the&#xD;
      severity of LBP before and after two weeks of acupuncture treatment according to the Brief&#xD;
      Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) for pain severity, as well as the Randall Morris&#xD;
      Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) for LBP-related interference scores.&#xD;
