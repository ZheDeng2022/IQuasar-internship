    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with metastatic solid tumors. Vaccines made from antibodies and peptides combined&#xD;
      with tumor cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform early phase clinical trial assessing safety and clinical toxicity of&#xD;
      immunization, and as well as to establish an optimal biological dose (OBD) of combination&#xD;
      vaccines with n-muramyldipeptide derivative (nor-MDP) as adjuvant emulsified in Montanide&#xD;
      (ISA 720).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To establish whether an OBD of two combination vaccines is achieved. III. To measure both&#xD;
      humoral and cellular immune responses including the specificity, class and kinetics of&#xD;
      anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate whether the combination of HER-2 epitopes show therapeutic benefit, provide&#xD;
      synergistic and/or additive effects and to enumerate mechanisms of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To collect and analyze post-immune sera and peripheral blood cells for additional six&#xD;
      months post the last injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To document any clinical responses that may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive a HER2/neu peptide vaccine comprising measles virus epitope MVF-HER-2&#xD;
      (266-296) and MVF-HER-2 (597-626) emulsified with nor-MDP in ISA 720 intramuscularly (IM) on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: EXTENSION TRIAL AT OBD&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose-escalation (4 cohorts) has successfully completed with the accrual of 24 patients&#xD;
      and the Optimum biological dose (OBD) has been determined as the dose at cohort level 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next phase of the study progresses directly into an extension trial at the OBD. 12&#xD;
      patients will be accrued at that level. The extension cohort will be open to only HER-2&#xD;
      and/or EGFR overexpressing cancers. Patients (all gastrointestinal,ovarian and breast must&#xD;
      have received no more than three prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in the last two years&#xD;
      after standard therapy. Patients (breast, ovarian and gastrointestinal cancers) must have&#xD;
      received no more than three prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in the last two years after&#xD;
      standard therapy.&#xD;
