  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over a period of years there have been numerous reports from many developing countries&#xD;
      including Pakistan showing a rising treatment failure rate with first line drugs (amoxicillin&#xD;
      and cotrimoxazole) in non-severe pneumonia in children. The reasons for this rise in&#xD;
      treatment failure rates are not entirely clear but one of the reasons is thought to be&#xD;
      increasing antimicrobial resistance of H. influenzae and Strep. pneumoniae to first line&#xD;
      drugs. There is microbiological data which suggests that this resistance can be overcome by&#xD;
      increasing the dose of amoxicillin. The investigators propose to treat non-severe pneumonia&#xD;
      with double dose amoxicillin in an attempt to demonstrate a decrease in treatment failure&#xD;
      rates. This will be a multicentre, double blind randomized controlled trial in children 2-59&#xD;
      months of age with non-severe pneumonia comparing the clinical outcome between the standard&#xD;
      and double dose groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been felt that the WHO criteria for treatment failure in children with pneumonia are&#xD;
      too stringent and have never been systematically evaluated in the community. The&#xD;
      investigators also propose to modify WHO criteria and field test them in this trial in an&#xD;
      attempt to demonstrate that less stringent treatment failure criteria would have an impact on&#xD;
      the overall treatment failure rates in pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy outcome with double dose of oral amoxicillin is not different than the standard dose&#xD;
      of amoxicillin, when used for three days for the treatment of non-severe pneumonia in 2-59&#xD;
      months old children.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      World Health Organization's (WHO) standard case management strategy for reducing ARI related&#xD;
      mortality recommends oral cotrimoxazole and oral amoxicillin as first line drugs for the&#xD;
      treatment of pneumonia. In 1989, the Pakistan Ministry of Health (MOH) adopted this strategy&#xD;
      to control ARI mortality and recommended cotrimoxazole for treatment of outpatients pneumonia&#xD;
      due to lower costs. A number of studies subsequently performed have shown significant in vivo&#xD;
      and in vitro resistance of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, the commonest bacteria causing&#xD;
      childhood pneumonia, to cotrimoxazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This increase in clinical failure with oral cotrimoxazole has put a lot of pressure both at&#xD;
      national and international forums on the National ARI Control Programme of Pakistan to change&#xD;
      its recommendations from cotrimoxazole to amoxicillin as the first line of therapy. Besides&#xD;
      being efficacious for non-severe pneumonia amoxicillin has shown good efficacy in children&#xD;
      with severe pneumonia and bacteremic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      although on a case by case basis for pneumonia, in vitro resistance does not correlate very&#xD;
      well with in vivo failures. One can hypothesize that if bacterial pneumonia is a certain&#xD;
      proportion of all pneumonia cases, the rise in clinical failures may be related to increasing&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae to amoxicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is felt that WHO criteria for treatment failure are too stringent. Improvement is defined&#xD;
      as the return of respiratory rate to below the cut off for that particular age at 48 hours.&#xD;
      Some of the children with viral pneumonia will continue to have respiratory rate above the&#xD;
      cut off on the first follow-up. These children are otherwise well and show no signs of&#xD;
      deterioration of the disease but according to WHO criteria they would be classified as&#xD;
      treatment failure. The treatment failure rates hence are influenced by the definitions used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing data shows that if we increase the dose of amoxicillin to achieve higher MICs&#xD;
      then the eradication of causative organism tend to be much more complete. As yet, no clinical&#xD;
      trial has been conducted to address this important question in the treatment of childhood&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a multicentre, randomized, controlled double blind trial in which we will compare&#xD;
      standard versus double dose oral amoxicillin for three days for the treatment of non-severe&#xD;
      pneumonia in children less than five years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To compare the proportion of children 2 - 59 months of age presenting with non-severe&#xD;
      pneumonia, who achieve clinical resolution on day 5 with standard (15 mg/kg/8hrly) versus&#xD;
      double dose (30 mg/kg/8hrly) of oral amoxicillin therapy given for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To follow the clinical course of non-severe pneumonia with the alternative criteria of&#xD;
      treatment failure (signs of deterioration i.e. lower chest indrawing and appearance of danger&#xD;
      signs) on or before day 3 and compare them with other children who have persistent fast&#xD;
      breathing (respiratory rate above the cut off for age) on day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy outcome with double dose of oral amoxicillin is not different than the standard dose&#xD;
      of amoxicillin, when used for three days for the treatment of non-severe pneumonia in 2-59&#xD;
      months old children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION AND SITE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be recruited from those coming to outpatient departments (OPD) in large tertiary&#xD;
      care hospitals in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study will be explained to parents and oral informed consent to&#xD;
      participate obtained. A proposed consent form is attached (Annex. 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, double blind, multi-centre trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARI is defined according to the WHO ARI Programme guidelines 2 for children who have either a&#xD;
      cough or difficult breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical resolution is defined as return of respiratory rate to normal (no pneumonia)&#xD;
      according to WHO ARI standard case management classification 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Failure is defined as development of chest indrawing; or any other danger sign; or&#xD;
      persistence of fast breathing at day 5 follow-up or thereafter leading to therapy change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improved will be defined as slower respiratory rate (either back to normal range for age, or&#xD;
      lower by more than 5 compared to previous evaluation), feeding better according to mother and&#xD;
      lower body temperature than previous assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Same will be defined as still breathing fast (respiratory rate Â± 5 breaths/minute compared to&#xD;
      previous evaluation or higher than that), with no chest indrawing and or danger sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worse will be defined as development of lower chest indrawing or any danger sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A relapse is defined as development of recurrence signs of pneumonia till day 14 after fast&#xD;
      breathing has disappeared initially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children will be followed-up on day 3, 5 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping in mind the overall treatment failure rate of 20.9% with amoxicillin from the MASCOT&#xD;
      study (1999 - 2001), it is expected that the proportion of patients who will fail to respond&#xD;
      with standard dose amoxicillin will be around 21.0%.7 In order for double dose to be more&#xD;
      efficacious there should be a difference of more than 5% in the treatment success rate as&#xD;
      compared to the standard dose. We assume that the failure rate will not be more than 13% with&#xD;
      double dose amoxicillin. By using the power of 80% and the confidence interval of 95%, the&#xD;
      estimated sample size comes to 369 for each group. Assuming the loss to follow up to be 15%&#xD;
      (as it is an out patient study and having day 14 follow-up) the estimated sample size will be&#xD;
      425 patients in each group, a total of 850 patients. Thus 900 patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      one and a half ARI season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ENTRY AND ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data forms will all be filled on auto copy forms and will be reviewed by the site&#xD;
      co-ordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered using Epi Info 6 and will be entered twice by two separate operators and&#xD;
      both data bases will be validated using Epi Info 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical resolution is defined as return of respiratory rate to normal (no pneumonia) on&#xD;
      day 5, according to WHO ARI standard case management classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical/treatment Failure is defined as development of chest indrawing; or any other danger&#xD;
      sign; or persistence of fast breathing at day 5 follow-up or thereafter leading to therapy&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be carried out on intention to treat basis. For primary outcome proportion of&#xD;
      therapy failures and their 95% CI will be calculated for both the two regimens. Then we will&#xD;
      compare proportion of therapy failure using alternative criteria and WHO defined conventional&#xD;
      therapy failure criteria.&#xD;
