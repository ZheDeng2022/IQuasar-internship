    <textblock>
      The ability to perform two or more tasks together is impaired in Parkinson's Disease (PD).&#xD;
      Based on pilot work we hypothesize that dual tasking is amenable to training in PD and will&#xD;
      not compromise safety. In the proposed study we will therefore collect high level evidence on&#xD;
      whether 6 weeks of integrated dual task gait training is more effective than consecutive task&#xD;
      practice. The investigators will use a randomized, single blind study design and conduct the&#xD;
      same protocols in two academic centers (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and Radboud&#xD;
      Universiteit Nijmegen). The investigators intend to test an experimental condition which&#xD;
      consists of focused dual task training in the home using a novel program of personalized&#xD;
      cognitive tasks. The aim of dual task training is to teach motor-cognitive task integration&#xD;
      and achieve optimal levels of automaticity and functionality. The control arm will receive&#xD;
      gait practice and separate cognitive training of the same intensity, but offered&#xD;
      consecutively. We will test the hypothesis that dual task training (integration) will have&#xD;
      more pronounced effects on complex gait than consecutive task training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-analysis will be conducted on patients with and without freezing of gait. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that integrated dual task training may be less effective in patients&#xD;
      with freezing, due to the increased fall risk and impaired cognitive profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, this project will provide evidence to support future directions for motor learning&#xD;
      and innovative rehabilitation targets.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to perform two or more tasks together - for instance walking and talking - is&#xD;
      impaired in Parkinson's Disease (PD). As a result, dual tasking might evoke gait&#xD;
      deterioration with an increased risk of falling in PD. In the European guideline for&#xD;
      physiotherapy, it is therefore recommended to advise PD patients to avoid dual tasking.&#xD;
      However, based on clinical experience and pilot work we argue that rather than avoiding, dual&#xD;
      tasking should be trained and this may enhance safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there is little clinical evidence about the effectiveness of attention-related&#xD;
      exercise in PD. The RESCUE-trial showed sustained reductions of dual task interference after&#xD;
      a short period of combined single and dual task cued gait training without increasing fall&#xD;
      risk. These effects were cue-related and not contrasted with an active control group. Dual&#xD;
      task training with a variable locus of attention showed very effective in comparison to&#xD;
      single task training in achieving retention and transfer effects in balance-impaired older&#xD;
      people. This randomized study also showed that dual tasking led to greater improvements of&#xD;
      cognitive function compared to single task intervention. In addition, recent study showed&#xD;
      dual task training to be surprisingly effective in mild to moderately affected patients with&#xD;
      dementia, who were randomly assigned to dual tasking or unspecific exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the positive effects of these clinical studies, the effectiveness of dual task training&#xD;
      needs to be urgently addressed in PD patients, in whom both motor and cognitive problems are&#xD;
      apparent. The fact that patients with freezing of gait (FOG) are associated with a surplus&#xD;
      decline of attention and have a higher fall risk, begs the question whether dual task&#xD;
      training is equally effective in this important clinical subgroup. Therefore, we propose to&#xD;
      obtain high level evidence on whether dual task gait training is as effective and safe in&#xD;
      PD-patients with FOG. The overall purpose of this project is to guide future directions for&#xD;
      innovative rehabilitation targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether intensive and integrated dual task gait training leads to sustained&#xD;
           improvements in complex gait performance and is more effective than consecutive task&#xD;
           training. The study will focus on influencing the ability to resist dual task&#xD;
           interference, the ability to transfer learning effects to an untrained but related task&#xD;
           and the ability to retain the learning increments after a period without training (12&#xD;
           weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test whether integrated training of dual task walking is a safe intervention in PD&#xD;
           and does not increase fall risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether disease stage or disease profile (with and without FOG) and&#xD;
           cognitive factors predict the effect of dual task training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design will consist of a multicentered single blind randomized controlled trial in which&#xD;
      PD patients are either allocated to a control group (Consecutive Task Training, &quot;CTT&quot;) or to&#xD;
      an experimental group (Integrated Dual Task Training, &quot;IDT&quot;). Patients in both arms of the&#xD;
      study will continue their usual care (including standard physiotherapy) as normal. In case&#xD;
      patients receive physiotherapy, we will inform the therapists involved and make sure that we&#xD;
      ascertain the contents of normal care and avoid overlap. The trial will be conducted in two&#xD;
      countries Belgium and the Netherlands, which are similar in terms of language and healthcare&#xD;
      facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall timeline of the study is 3 years. Subjects will undergo a control period of six&#xD;
      weeks without intervention. This allows us to investigate the effects of repeated measures.&#xD;
      Subsequently, patients will be randomized to one of the two groups within each center: 1) IDT&#xD;
      or 2) CTT. All subjects will participate in an intensive, progressive training protocol&#xD;
      consisting of 18 sessions (3 per week for 6 weeks) and up to one hour per session. Assessors&#xD;
      will be unaware of group allocation. Randomization will be stratified with respect to&#xD;
      subgroups (i.e. with or without FOG and Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage II and III) to ensure adequate&#xD;
      representation and diversity. A computerized block randomization will be performed per&#xD;
      centre. Freezers will be defined by a score &gt;1 on the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the literature and our previous experience, we anticipate that DTT will improve with&#xD;
      an average of 20% and STT with 5% of baseline dual task gait speed (during a novel task).&#xD;
      Assuming an alpha of 0.05, we calculated our sample size with dual task gait speed as the&#xD;
      main outcome. On the basis of the RESCUE data, (including patients with &gt;5% DT interference)&#xD;
      we found a mean dual task gait speed of 0.766 m/s and SD=0.21. Based on these figures we&#xD;
      estimated that the total sample size would be N=108 (54 per centre). Incorporating a loss to&#xD;
      follow-up of about 5% brings the final figure up to 60 patients per centre to be recruited&#xD;
      over a period of two years (N=120).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrated dual task training will be conducted at home by a physiotherapist, especially&#xD;
      trained in the intervention. It will consist of gait training (straight-line gait, turning&#xD;
      and manoeuvring round the house) while using a standardised cognitive exercise protocol with&#xD;
      an MP3 player. To address the correct level of learning, the levels of task complexity will&#xD;
      be matched to the patient's baseline characteristics, considering the following components:&#xD;
      baseline DT interference, previous fall risk and presence of FOG. Given the cognitive&#xD;
      deterioration in PD, implying a reduced learning capacity, a fixed priority training&#xD;
      (attention priority on both tasks) will be implemented, aimed to improve better and safe&#xD;
      walking when distracted by other attention demands. Every session will also include training&#xD;
      of a functional dual task, relevant for each patient. Progression of treatment will be&#xD;
      standardized. Treatment will consist of 18 sessions over a period of 6 weeks. Homework will&#xD;
      be conducted with the partner for safety reasons. Intervention will be additional to regular&#xD;
      care (including physiotherapy). A follow-up period of 12 weeks without training will be used&#xD;
      to test retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive task training will be conducted at home by a physiotherapist. It will consist of&#xD;
      traditional gait training(straight-line gait, turning and maneuvering). Patients will get&#xD;
      separate training of cognitive tasks while sitting, using the same program via an MP3 player&#xD;
      as described above. Every session will also include training of a functional task, relevant&#xD;
      for each patient, but dual tasking will be positively discouraged. Functional training will&#xD;
      thus consist of carrying out task components separately. Progression and intensity of&#xD;
      treatment will be the same as IDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 6 weeks of IDT or CTT, all other interventions (medication, allied health care&#xD;
      etc) will be kept as stable as possible. Any changes in treatment will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited by a movement disorders specialist at each medical center&#xD;
      involved. The following clinical descriptive outcomes will be collected: Disease duration,&#xD;
      Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage, Unified Parkinson's Disease rating scale, New Freezing of Gait&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Cognitive scores, Beck's Depression Index, and general gait performance (2&#xD;
      minute walk test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing will be conducted by an independent therapist at each centre. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up over a period of 24 weeks in total. Four testing moments will be foreseen: 1) one&#xD;
      baseline test at study entry and the second baseline tests after a 6 week control period&#xD;
      without intervention; 2) one test after 6 weeks of training and 3) one test after 12 weeks&#xD;
      follow-up without training. All spatiotemporal gait outcomes with and without DT will be&#xD;
      measured during normal speed conditions and therefore will require transport of the patients&#xD;
      to the gait laboratory. Clinical testing will also be conducted in this environment. Both&#xD;
      centers use the same GAITRite Walkway System in their gait laboratory, which is considered to&#xD;
      be the 'gold standard' instrumented system for measuring spatiotemporal gait parameters. The&#xD;
      untrained secondary task will be an Auditory Stroop task delivered by a wireless headphone. A&#xD;
      microphone will record the verbal responses of the patients, allowing detailed measurement of&#xD;
      the reaction times of patients' responses. This system is currently used in one of the&#xD;
      centers (Katholieke universiteit Leuven). Secondary task performance will be measured during&#xD;
      sitting as well as walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DT gait performance will be evaluated by measuring gait speed while performing the&#xD;
           untrained cognitive task, i.e. the Auditory Stroop.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety will be assessed by determining fall rate ascertained by a weekly telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. We will also test cognitive performance during a trained dual task (Digit Span Backward)&#xD;
           and during a functional task (using a mobile phone). At baseline, the appropriate level&#xD;
           of cognitive challenge for each patient will be determined. We will measure gait and&#xD;
           secondary task performance separately and calculate dual task interference outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcomes will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single task gait performance: speed, stride length and cadence;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single task cognitive performance (during sitting);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (measure of function);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of executive function and attention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Freezing of Gait Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ADL scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PDQ39 Quality of LIfe scale&#xD;
