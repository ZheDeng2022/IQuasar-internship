  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, cross over study in which up to&#xD;
      20 otherwise healthy male nicotine abstinent smokers will be tested following 3 acute&#xD;
      treatment conditions (placebo, 4 and 8mg of GSK1034702). Each subject will undergo screening&#xD;
      assessments within 30 days prior to administration of the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
      There will be 3 treatment sessions and dosing will be separated by a minimum 1 week washout&#xD;
      period. There will be two testing days (day 1 and day 2) per treatment session. On each&#xD;
      treatment session subjects will be admitted on day 1. On day 1, subjects will be administered&#xD;
      placebo and approximately 3 hours later, there will be a Baseline EEG/ERP recording,&#xD;
      neuropsychological (Cogstate battery) testing and mood/craving/dependence questionnaire&#xD;
      assessments . Subjects will be allowed to smoke until approximately midnight on day 1. On day&#xD;
      2, subjects will undergo a pre-drug neuropsychological (Cogstate battery) testing and&#xD;
      questionnaire assessments of mood/craving. This will be conducted approximately 1 hour prior&#xD;
      to dosing. Subjects will be randomized to one of six treatment sequences. Post dose EEG/ERP&#xD;
      recording, neuropsychological (Cogstate battery) testing and mood/craving measurements will&#xD;
      be conducted between 3 and 6 hours post treatment to coincide with peak pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      effects. This testing will be performed approximately at 12pm following at least 12hrs of&#xD;
      nicotine abstinence. Blood samples will be collected at baseline (pre-drug) and following&#xD;
      drug administration to quantify exposure levels.&#xD;
