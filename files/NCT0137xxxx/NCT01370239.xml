    <textblock>
      The humanized monoclonal antibody against Lewis Y antigen (Hu3S193) has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      be safe in previous studies and has also been indicated as potential intervention in breast&#xD;
      cancer. The study of this new agent in advanced breast cancer may contribute to the&#xD;
      development of new strategies for patients that progressed after hormonal treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a national study, open label, single arm, phase II study which will be conducted in&#xD;
      seven centers in Brazil. The study will be coordinated by the INSTITUTO DO CÂNCER DO ESTADO&#xD;
      DE SÃO PAULO in collaboration with RECEPTA Biopharma. The study is funded by the CONSELHO&#xD;
      NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICO (CNPq). Before any procedure relating to&#xD;
      the study, patients must read and sign the informed consent (IC). The inclusion of patients&#xD;
      begin immediately after regulatory approval and is expected to end after reaching the number&#xD;
      of patients. The follow-up term will last at least 24 months for each patient included,&#xD;
      unless limited by death, loss to follow up or withdrawal of informed consent. A total of 60&#xD;
      patients will be recruited in this study. The eligible patients must be 18 or older,&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer with locally advanced or metastatic progression after&#xD;
      one or two lines of previous hormone treatment, confirmation of Lewis antigen expression -as&#xD;
      assessed by central laboratory, measurable or evaluable disease and adequate organ function.&#xD;
      Patients will receive weekly intravenous doses of the antibody Hu3S193 until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or the investigator's decision,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first. The study's primary endpoint is the clinical benefit rate.&#xD;
