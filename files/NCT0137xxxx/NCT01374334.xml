      Aging is associated with loss of muscle strength and a serious import of physical disability.&#xD;
      Treatment of age-related physical disability should focus on the prevention of the condition&#xD;
      rather than the consequences. Need to modify daily tasks is an early sign of future mobility&#xD;
      disability. Many older adults who utilize daily task modifications report no mobility&#xD;
      difficulty. Neglect to self-report task modification may delay intervention. Identifying&#xD;
      objective marker of task modification will help to identify task modifiers.&#xD;

      Background: There is a significant rise in the number of people who are living well into old&#xD;
      age. Aging is associated with loss of muscle strength and a serious import of physical&#xD;
      disability. Age-related physical disability is associated with physical dependence, poor&#xD;
      quality of life, and mortality. Treatment of age-related physical disability should focus on&#xD;
      the prevention of the condition rather than the consequences. Need to modify daily tasks is&#xD;
      an early sign of future mobility disability. Many older adults who utilize daily task&#xD;
      modifications report no mobility difficulty. Neglect to self-report task modification may&#xD;
      delay intervention. Identifying objective marker of task modification will help to identify&#xD;
      task modifiers. Loss of muscle strength is associated with mobility decline. Older adults who&#xD;
      engage in habitual physical activity (PA) are more likely to maintain physical independence&#xD;
      until shortly before the natural end of their lives. Yet, many older adults are not&#xD;
      physically active. Health-care professional in general and physical therapists in particular,&#xD;
      are in a unique position to promote PA among older adults. Healthcare providers who&#xD;
      habitually engage in PA are more likely to consult their patients on PA guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes: The purposes of the following studies were to: 1) examine lower extremity muscle&#xD;
      strength across subjects who do, and do not utilize task modifications, 2) to determine the&#xD;
      strength of the association between lower extremity muscle strength and daily task&#xD;
      modifications in older adults living independently, 3) identify functionally relevant&#xD;
      isometric and isokinetic cutpoints of lower extremity muscle strength below which daily task&#xD;
      modifications are more prevalent, 4) to compare the relative diagnostic accuracy of isometric&#xD;
      versus isokinetic strength cutpoints as they relate to daily task modifications, 5) estimate&#xD;
      the rate of participation in moderate and vigorous physical activity (PA) among student&#xD;
      physical therapists (SPTs), 6) compare these estimates to rates of PA among US adults, and 7)&#xD;
      assess barriers to PA among SPTs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: To address the first two purposes, fifty-three community dwelling male (21) and&#xD;
      female (32) older adults (76.4±5.2 years) were observed performing a chair rise, negotiating&#xD;
      stairs, kneeling from a standing position, and rising from supine to stand. Levels of daily&#xD;
      task modifications were assessed using a previously described, valid, and reliable tool&#xD;
      [MOD]. The MOD assesses task modifications using six hierarchically ranked categories from&#xD;
      zero (no modification) to five (refusal). Rankings were summed across tasks. A score of ≥5&#xD;
      points on the summed MOD score was the cutpoint between a classification of daily&#xD;
      Task-Modifiers (TM) and None-Task-Modifiers (NTM). Normalized to body weight Isometric&#xD;
      measures of peak muscle torque were obtained from the hip extensors, knee extensors, and&#xD;
      ankle plantar flexors using a Biodex testing device. A net anti-gravity composite measure of&#xD;
      isometric lower extremity muscle force production in the sagittal plane (NETforce) was&#xD;
      calculated by summing the normalized torques from the three muscle groups. An independent&#xD;
      t-test was used to compare groups (TM vs. NTM) across the dependent measures of muscular&#xD;
      torque. A logistic regression model was used to determine the association between torque&#xD;
      measures and group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the third and the forth purposes same fifty-three community dwelling male (21) and&#xD;
      female (32) older adults (76.4±5.2 years) were observed performing same activities as above.&#xD;
      Normalized to body weight isometric and isokinetic (60⁰ per second) measures of peak muscle&#xD;
      strength were obtained from the hip extensors, knee extensors, and ankle plantar flexors&#xD;
      using a Biodex Isokinetic testing device. A composite torque outputs were calculated by&#xD;
      summing the normalized torques from the three muscle groups. An independent t-test was used&#xD;
      to compare groups (TM vs. NTM) across the dependent measures of muscular torque. Discriminant&#xD;
      analysis{{1397 Hasegawa,R. 2008}} was repeated for each predictor variable separately to&#xD;
      determine the minimal strength cutpoints of normalized composite lower extremity isometric&#xD;
      and isokinetic strength outputs that would optimally differentiate between the TM and NTM&#xD;
      groups. An ROC curve analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity. A&#xD;
      repeated, separated logistic regression with the group classification as the dependent&#xD;
      variable and the lower extremity strength measures as the independent variables was&#xD;
      conducted. For all statistical tests, a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant. All data analyses were performed using SPSS (version 18; SPSS&#xD;
      Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A p value of .05 was used the reject the null hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the last three purposes, we applied a cross-sectional survey design [N = 126 SPTs&#xD;
      enrolled in a professional (entry level) physical therapist education program]. Frequencies,&#xD;
      percentages, and cross-tabulations followed by chi-square tests were used to address purposes&#xD;
      number 5 and 6. Qualitative (coding) followed by non-parametric statistical procedures were&#xD;
      used to assess purpose number 7.&#xD;
