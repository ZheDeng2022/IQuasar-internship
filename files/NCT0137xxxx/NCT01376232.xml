      Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863A Coadministered with a High Fat Meal or an&#xD;
      Inhibitor of CYP2C8 (gemfibrozil),]&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical drug-drug interaction potential of&#xD;
      GSK1278863A with medications that are inhibitors of CYP2C8 enzyme in order to support&#xD;
      co-administration of similar agents in later phase development. Specifically. this study will&#xD;
      assess the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of GSK1278863A administered alone or&#xD;
      co-administered with gemfibrozil, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8, following steady-state oral&#xD;
      administration of gemfibrozil. Finally, to support the co-administration of GSK1278863A with&#xD;
      food, this study will assess the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of GSK1278863A under&#xD;
      fasting conditions and following a standard high-calorie, high fat meal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is&#xD;
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:Non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or&#xD;
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a&#xD;
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and&#xD;
             estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement&#xD;
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of&#xD;
             the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the&#xD;
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks should&#xD;
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on&#xD;
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,&#xD;
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section&#xD;
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study&#xD;
