    <textblock>
      This phase II study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining two active&#xD;
      agents;Revlimid® (lenalidomide) and low dose Vidaza® (azacitidine) for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with low to intermediate-1 MDS excluding patients with 5 q deletion. The rationale&#xD;
      for adding Vidaza® (azacitidine) after 3 months of revlimid monotherapy is that combination&#xD;
      therapy will result in higher response rates, and potentially longer response duration than&#xD;
      that achieved with either agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of Revlimid® (lenalidomide) and&#xD;
      low dose Vidaza® (azacitidine) in patients with low - intermediate-1 risk MDS non 5 q&#xD;
      deletion who have not responded after 3 months of Revlimid® (lenalidomide) monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the response rate in patients with low - intermediate-1 risk MDS non 5 q&#xD;
      deletion receiving Revlimid® (lenalidomide) in combination with low dose Vidaza®&#xD;
      (azacitidine), as defined by the IWG 2006 Revised Response Criteria&#xD;

      Eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diagnosis of low- or intermediate-1-risk IPSS (see Appendix III) MDS without an&#xD;
           abnormality of chromosome 5 involving a deletion between bands q31 and q33.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pathologic diagnosis via pathology performed at Rush University Medical Center or made&#xD;
           available to Rush from outside institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Prior treatment with &lt; 3 cycles (84 days) of Revlimid® (lenalidomide) are eligible for&#xD;
           enrollment regardless of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. ECOG performance status of 2 at study entry (see Appendix II).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Disease free of prior malignancies for &gt; 5 years with exception of currently treated&#xD;
           basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma &quot;insitu&quot; of the cervix or&#xD;
           breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Serum bilirubin levels &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range for the&#xD;
           laboratory (ULN). Higher levels are acceptable if these can be attributed to active&#xD;
           hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) or&#xD;
           serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) levels &lt; 2 x&#xD;
           ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Serum creatinine levels &lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm³&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Platelet count &gt; 30,000/mm³&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist® program, and be&#xD;
           willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®.&#xD;

Lenalidomide and azacitidine combination: lenalidomide 10 mg will be administered orally on Days 1-28 of each 28-day cycle. Patients who fail to achieve an erythroid response per 2006 IWG criteria after 3 cycles of monotherapy will receive lenalidomide at the same dose administered in cycle 3 and low-dose azacitidine25 mg/m2 subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) for 5 days (on Days 1-5) of every 28-day cycle.&#xD;
Patients who fail to respond (2006 IWG criteria) after receiving two cycles of combination therapy will receive lenalidomide at the same dose administered in Cycle 3 and azacitidine 50 mg/m2 SC or IV given daily on Days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle, if no grade 4 toxicity developed or no delay greater than 2 weeks in starting a new cycle was experienced during the first 2 cycles of combination therapy.</description>
