  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to establish chimerism and avoid graft-versus-host-disease&#xD;
      (GVHD) in patients with inherited metabolic disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective for the study is to establish chimerism following reduced intensity&#xD;
      conditioning with no grade III/IV GVHD. The primary endpoint we will follow is production of&#xD;
      the missing enzyme at ≥ 10% of the normal level at day 180 post-transplant in &gt; 90% of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorder / inborn&#xD;
             error of metabolism. Diagnosis should be confirmed by appropriate test(s) (enzyme&#xD;
             and/or mutation analysis) before study entry. Patients must not be eligible for&#xD;
             myeloablative chemotherapy as a preparative regimen for transplant due to age,&#xD;
             co-morbidities or organ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Inborn errors of metabolism / Inherited Metabolic Disorders (IMD) eligible for this&#xD;
             study include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hurler Syndrome (MPS I)&#xD;

                  cc/min/1.73m2. Newborns must have a creatinine clearance ≥ 25 cc/min. For babies&#xD;
                  less than or equal to 3 months of age, the raw value on glomerular filtration&#xD;

          5. Subjects with a positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test result&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who are pregnant, as indicated by a positive serum human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (HCG) test&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects whose only donor is pregnant at the time of intended transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects of childbearing potential who are not practicing adequate contraception as&#xD;
             defined by the investigator at the site&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Jehovah's witnesses being unwilling to be transfused&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients that have any comorbid condition which, in the view of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigators, renders the patient at too high a risk from treatment complications and&#xD;
             regimen related morbidity/mortality.&#xD;
