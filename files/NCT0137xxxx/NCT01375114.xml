      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if panax ginseng (commonly called&#xD;
      ginseng) can help to control fatigue and other symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and mood&#xD;
      changes in patients with cancer. The safety of ginseng will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Supplement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ginseng is an herbal supplement that may affect people's energy level, especially during&#xD;
      times of fatigue or stress. Many people have used ginseng, but its level of effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety has not been clearly studied. In this study, researchers will use questionnaires and&#xD;
      other tests to study how ginseng may affect cancer-related fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups and Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose of&#xD;
      the study drug(s), depending on when you join the study. The first 30 participants will take&#xD;
      part in Part 1 of the study. Participants in Part 1 will take ginseng by mouth, in capsule&#xD;
      form, every day for 29 days. You will take it 2 times a day (morning and afternoon), and will&#xD;
      swallow a total of 2 capsules each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you enroll on this study after the first 30 participants, you will take part in Part 2 of&#xD;
      the study. Participants in Part 2 will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1&#xD;
      of 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will take a placebo for 29 days. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the&#xD;
           study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be&#xD;
           compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect. If you are&#xD;
           assigned to this group, you may be able to take ginseng later, in the second part of the&#xD;
           study (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will take ginseng for 29 days, as the Part 1 group did.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have an equal chance of being assigned to either group. Neither you nor the study&#xD;
      staff will know which group you are in. However, if needed for your safety, the study staff&#xD;
      will be able to find out what you are receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups in Part 2 will take ginseng or placebo by mouth, every day for 29 days. You will&#xD;
      take it 2 times a day (morning and afternoon), 2 capsules each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your Day 29 ginseng or placebo dose, if you tolerated the doses well, the study doctor&#xD;
      may decide you can take ginseng from Days 29-57, following the same dosing schedule you had&#xD;
      before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 (± 3 days), Day 29 (± 3 days), Day 36 (+/- 3 days) and Day 57 (± 3 days), you will&#xD;
      fill out questionnaires about the symptoms you may be having, such as fatigue, mood,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, nausea, appetite problems, sleep problems, and your overall sense of&#xD;
      well-being. This should take about 30 minutes. You will also be asked about any side effects&#xD;
      you may be having. You will also perform a medication review. If you cannot come to the&#xD;
      clinic on these days, the research nurse will call and ask you the questions over the phone.&#xD;
      The strength and stamina of your arm muscle will be measured only if you come to the clinic.&#xD;
      It will not be measured if you are contacted over the phone. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will&#xD;
      be drawn for routine tests on Day 15 (± 3 days), Day 29 (± 3 days) and Day 57 (± 3 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6-minute walk test will be performed on baseline, Day 15 (± 3 days), Day 29 (± 3 days),&#xD;
      and Day 57 (± 3 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8 (± 3 days), Day 21 ( +/- 3 days), Day 36 (± 3 days), and Day 43 (± 3 days), the&#xD;
      research nurse will call and ask about the symptoms and side effects you may be having. You&#xD;
      will also perform a medication review. This should take about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are unable to return to MD Anderson for your routine blood draw, your local doctor can&#xD;
      draw the blood and your results will be sent to MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You blood will be drawn weekly if you are taking coumadin to check to see how fast your blood&#xD;
      clots. Liver function tests will also be performed every 2 weeks if you have metastasis to&#xD;
      your liver or are on medication such as acetaminophen statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are the among the first thirty patients you will be assigned to receive/take ginseng&#xD;
      at the beginning of the study for a total 29 days followed by up to 28 days of ginseng, if&#xD;
      the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. If you are not among the first thirty&#xD;
      patients you may receive up to 29 days of ginseng/placebo followed by up to 28 days of&#xD;
      ginseng, if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. Ginseng/placebo will be&#xD;
      stopped early if intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your main doctor for cancer approves, you may take ginseng after Day 57 (outside of the&#xD;
      study) if you tolerated it well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Ginseng is commercially available. Giving ginseng to&#xD;
      patients with cancer and fatigue is being done for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 158 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
