      The primary purpose of the trial is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (behaviour of the&#xD;
      compound in the body) of safinamide in subjects with different degrees of renal impairment in&#xD;
      comparison to matched subjects with normal renal function.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Renally impaired subjects - Subject with different degrees of renal impairment:&#xD;
             moderate and severe renal impairment as assessed by Estimated Glomerular Filtration&#xD;
             Rate (eGFR) according to Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation at&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Healthy subjects - Subject is in good age-appropriate physical and mental health as&#xD;
             established by medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and&#xD;
             vital signs recordings, and results of biochemistry, haematology, coagulation and&#xD;
             urinalysis testing within 3 weeks prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All subjects have given written informed consent before any study-related activities&#xD;
             are carried out&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any other clinically relevant disease, condition, or therapy, which in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion would exclude the subject from the trial, may pose a risk to&#xD;
             the subject or interfere with the trial objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Existence of surgical or medical condition, which, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator, might interfere with the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of the&#xD;
             drug and/or gastrointestinal motility&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Renally impaired subjects - Acute renal failure of any etiology (including viral,&#xD;
             toxic, or drug induced), renal transplantation within the previous 12 months,&#xD;
             uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as judged by the Investigator, use of any drug&#xD;
             affecting gastric acid secretion, such as proton pump inhibitors and antacids received&#xD;
             within 48 hours prior to drug administration and for 24 hours after administration,&#xD;
             Chronic heart failure (CHF) New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV despite&#xD;
             treatment at screening, change in used medication (prescribed by a physician or&#xD;
             over-the-counter [OTC] medication) within 14 days prior to safinamide administration.&#xD;
             Concomitant medication used for the treatment of renal impairment and accompanying&#xD;
             diseases may be continued during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Healthy subjects - Use of any medication, including multi-vitamin preparations,&#xD;
             received within 21 days prior to drug administration (or within six times the&#xD;
             elimination half-life, whichever is longest), except combined oral contraceptives and&#xD;
             occasional use of paracetamol or ibuprofen within 14 days before trial drug&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
