        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be &gt;30 and &lt;65 years of age, in order to limit the confounding affect of&#xD;
             age on our endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have an ejection fraction &gt;45% (based on their echocardiogram)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with T2DM and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or steatohepatitis may be&#xD;
             included since they have extensive evidence of steatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had a myocardial infarction or resting ischemia (by history or as&#xD;
             evidenced by hypo/akinesis on the pre-intervention echocardiogram) will be excluded&#xD;
             because hypo/akinesis would affect our endpoints of LV mass and diastolic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unstable, not able to lie flat for the imaging studies, unable to&#xD;
             give informed consent, pregnant, lactating, with atrial fibrillation (which would&#xD;
             compromise measurement of E'), or current smokers will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with other major systemic diseases per their clinical charts, history,&#xD;
             physical exam, or significant renal insufficiency will also be excluded, as these&#xD;
             other system diseases may affect our study endpoints and subject follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will exclude patients with significant LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction&#xD;
             &lt;45%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will not exclude patients with sleep apnea because it does not detrimentally affect&#xD;
             LV diastolic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be excluded a priori if they have any history or evidence of liver&#xD;
             disease other than NAFLD, consumed &gt;20 g alcohol per day.&#xD;
