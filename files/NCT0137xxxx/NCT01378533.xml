      The purpose of this trial is to compare the 3 years DFS of dose-dense epirubicin and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with paclitaxel plus carboplatin as adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      for triple-negative breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer are heterogeneous group of tumors with diverse behavior, outcome, and&#xD;
      sensitivity to therapy.In recent years, the term triple negative (TN) breast cancer has&#xD;
      emerged to describe those cancers which do not express oestrogen (ER) , progesterone (PR)&#xD;
      receptors, or Her2. Many studies had estimated that TN cases represents between 12%-20% of&#xD;
      all breast cancers. Those TN case constitute one of the most challenging breast cancer&#xD;
      groups, with only systemic chemotherapy is currently available for their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRCA1 protein normally functions as a negative regulator of the cell cycle, also,&#xD;
      BRCA1-positive tumors encompass a heterogeneous group of tumors that show distinctive&#xD;
      pathological and clinical features. BRCA1-associated cancers are typically high-grade&#xD;
      invasive duct carcinoma and are mostly triple negative.The phenotypic and molecular&#xD;
      similarity of the TNBCs to BRCA1-associated BCs might be of use in designing their treatment&#xD;
      protocol. There is increasing evidence that the DNA repair defects that are characteristic of&#xD;
      BRCA-1 related cancers may provide sensitivity to certain systemic agents to treat TNBC&#xD;
      patients such as the bifunctional alkylating agents and platinum drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose density refers to the administration of drugs with a shortened intertreatment interval.&#xD;
      It is based on the observation that in experimental models, a given dose always kills a&#xD;
      certain fraction, rather than a certain number, of exponentially growing cancer cells.&#xD;
      Because human cancers in general, and breast cancers in particular, usually grow by&#xD;
      nonexponential Gompertzian kinetics, this model has been extended to those situations.&#xD;
      Regrowth of cancer cells between cycles of cytoreduction is more rapid in volume-reduced&#xD;
      Gompertzian cancer models than in exponential models. Hence it has been hypothesized that the&#xD;
      more frequent administration of cytotoxic therapy would be a more effective way of minimizing&#xD;
      residual tumor burden than dose escalation. In the INT C9741 trial, the dose-dense schedule&#xD;
      is accomplished by using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim) to permit&#xD;
      every-2-week recycling of the drugs A, T and C at their optimal dose levels rather than at&#xD;
      the conventional 3-week intervals.Sequential therapy refers to the application of treatments&#xD;
      one at a time rather than concurrently. It does not challenge the concept that multiple drugs&#xD;
      are needed to maximally perturb cancers that are composed of cells heterogeneous in drug&#xD;
      sensitivity. Rather, it hypothesizes that for slow-growing cancers like most breast cancers,&#xD;
      it is more important to preserve dose density than to force a combination, especially if that&#xD;
      combination would be more toxic and requires dose-reductions or delays in drug&#xD;
      administration. If dose density is the same in a sequential combination chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
      and a concurrent combination regimen, theoretical considerations indicate that the&#xD;
      therapeutic result should be the same, even if the sequential pattern happens to be less&#xD;
      toxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our trial, we want to compare the 3 years DFS of dose-dense epirubicin and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with paclitaxel plus carboplatin as adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      for triple-negative breast cancer.The other purpose of this trial is to observe the patient's&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
