  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the present study the investigators intend to identify the morphologic and&#xD;
      electrophysiologic substrate markers of increased arrhythmic risk in patients with dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy undergoing implantation of a defibrillator for the primary prevention of&#xD;
      sudden cardiac death. Moreover, the investigators also aim to identify if there is any&#xD;
      electrophysiological substrate modification at the time of the first arrhythmic event in&#xD;
      these patients. To this aim, the investigators will prospectively correlate electroanatomic&#xD;
      mapping and cardiac magnetic resonance findings with arrhythmic events, in order to identify&#xD;
      substrate markers of increased arrhythmic risk in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, who&#xD;
      are therefore more likely to benefit from a defibrillator implantation. Furthermore,&#xD;
      electroanatomic mapping will be repeated at the time of the first arrhythmic event and&#xD;
      compared with that at baseline, in order to evaluate any electrophysiological substrate&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A correct identification of patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death is crucial for a&#xD;
      rational clinical management, since the demonstrated effectiveness of implantable&#xD;
      cardioverter-defibrillators on the reduction of sudden cardiac death. Basing on the results&#xD;
      of multiple clinical trials, left ventricular systolic function, measured as ejection&#xD;
      fraction, is currently the only recommended tool to identify patients at higher risk of&#xD;
      sudden death that would benefit from a prophylactic defibrillator. However, the systematic&#xD;
      implementation of current recommendations results in a substantial number of inappropriate&#xD;
      defibrillator implantations, while failing to prevent the majority of sudden deaths occurring&#xD;
      in the general population. Unfortunately, at present time we have no other way to identify&#xD;
      patients at higher risk of sudden cardiac death, since other proposed risk markers have not&#xD;
      been consistently demonstrated of incremental value. Recent data suggest that several&#xD;
      substrate markers, either assessed morphologically with magnetic resonance imaging, or&#xD;
      electrophysiologically with invasive mapping procedures, may be helpful to identify subgroup&#xD;
      of patients at higher arrhythmic risk. However, previous studies have been largely conducted&#xD;
      on few patients, most were retrospective or with short follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will submit patients with dilated cardiomyopathy undergoing implant of an implantable&#xD;
      cardioverter defibrillator to a morphologic and electrophysiologic substrate evaluation&#xD;
      including cardiac magnetic resonance with gadolinium contrast-enhancement study, and&#xD;
      electroanatomic mapping with bipolar electrogram voltage and morphological analysis. The&#xD;
      electroanatomic mapping and cardiac magnetic resonance will be repeated at the time of the&#xD;
      first arrhythmic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to define the role of anatomical and electrophysiological substrate abnormalities&#xD;
      in determining malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
      thus allowing a better risk stratification and prevention of sudden death.&#xD;
