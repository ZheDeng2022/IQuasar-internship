      This multi-center study was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PillCam&#xD;
      Platform with the PillCam COLON 2 capsule as demonstrated by the identification of subjects&#xD;
      with polyps, compared to optical colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      884 subjects participated in this study. All subjects that were enrolled in this study were&#xD;
      indicated and scheduled to undergo colonoscopy based on their age and demographics for&#xD;
      screening for polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject was required to follow a bowel preparation regimen and to undergo capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy (CE) followed by optical colonoscopy (OC). The optical colonoscopy procedure was&#xD;
      scheduled 4-6 weeks after CE procedure to allow for the central readers reading of the&#xD;
      PillCam RAPID video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonoscopist was kept blinded to the CE results&#xD;

    <description>Sensitivity and specificity of PillCam Platform with the PillCam COLON 2 capsule in detecting subjects with polyps equal to or larger than 6 mm. For a given polyp, a match between the PillCam Colon 2 Capsule and optical colonoscopy was considered if the polyp size was assessed within plus or minus 50% of the size of the estimate of the OC measurement and the polyp as appearing within the same colon segment or in adjacent segments. The polyp size measurement by optical colonoscopy was used as the reference standard.&#xD;
Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives which are correctly identified as such.&#xD;
Specificity measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified as such.&#xD;
positive event defined as patients with polyps ≥6 mm detected by OC procedure.</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo standard Colonoscopy procedure 4-6 weeks after PillCam® COLON 2 procedure.&#xD;
Standard colonoscopy involves placement of a standard endoscope (a thin, flexible plastic tube) into the anus and into the colon, a tiny camera in the endoscope allows the study doctor to see the surface of the colon.</description>

        <title>Sensitivity and Specificity of PillCam Platform With the PillCam COLON 2 Capsule in Detecting Patients With Polyps ≥6 mm Where OC Considered as the Gold Standard Reference</title>
        <description>Sensitivity and specificity of PillCam Platform with the PillCam COLON 2 capsule in detecting subjects with polyps equal to or larger than 6 mm. For a given polyp, a match between the PillCam Colon 2 Capsule and optical colonoscopy was considered if the polyp size was assessed within plus or minus 50% of the size of the estimate of the OC measurement and the polyp as appearing within the same colon segment or in adjacent segments. The polyp size measurement by optical colonoscopy was used as the reference standard.&#xD;
Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives which are correctly identified as such.&#xD;
Specificity measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified as such.&#xD;
