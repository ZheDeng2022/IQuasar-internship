  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common scenario in intensive care unit.&#xD;
      Discussions about it is exponentially growing up due its high mortality rates all over the&#xD;
      world and low quality of life among survivors. Mechanical ventilation is recognized to play&#xD;
      an important role in treatment of patients with ARDS. However, mechanical ventilation itself&#xD;
      has the potential to produce or worsen alveolar injury if inadequate strategies are chosen.&#xD;
      Several studies compared different mechanical ventilation strategies in ARDS but the results&#xD;
      remain uncertain regarding their influence on survival in patients with ARDS. Thus, this is a&#xD;
      multicentric randomized controlled trial, with allocation concealment and intention to treat&#xD;
      analysis to investigate if maximum alveolar recruitment maneuver in association to Positive&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titrated by static compliance of respiratory system (ART&#xD;
      strategy) is able to increase 28 days survival in patients with moderate to severe ARDS&#xD;
      compared to conventional strategy proposed by the ARDS Clinical Network (ARDSNet strategy).&#xD;
      Patients considered to this trial are those in mechanical ventilation with diagnosis of&#xD;
      moderate to severe ARDS less than 72hours. Patients included will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      ART strategy or ARDSNet strategy and will be followed until hospital discharge, 28 days and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
