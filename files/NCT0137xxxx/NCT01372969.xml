    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to asses the safety and efficacy of adipose-derived adult stem&#xD;
      cells from healthy donnors for treatment of complex perianal fistulas in Crohn's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn´s disease (CD) is a severe disorder with significant morbidity and major impact on&#xD;
      life. CD can affect any part of the digestive system and symptoms of this chronic illness&#xD;
      include abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. CD also causes bowel wall&#xD;
      ulcers, strictures (narrowing of a hollow structure due to scar tissue and swelling), and&#xD;
      fistulas (abnormal passages from the intestines to another organ or the skin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an unmet need for effective medical therapy in CD patients with perianal fistulas,&#xD;
      not responding to the conventional strategies, including biological therapies. The current&#xD;
      study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of adipose tissue derived mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells from healthy donors for the treatment of perianal fistulas in patients presenting&#xD;
      CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To assess the safety (incidence of treatment emergent adverse-events) of&#xD;
      eASCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multicenter, pilot study, assessing safety and with evaluation of the efficacy&#xD;
      by two Gastroenterologists/Surgeons and an independent external radiologist. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive a cell suspension of allogenic adipose-derived stem cells, eASCs (20 million cells)&#xD;
      in the fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of incomplete fistula closure of the treated fistula at week 12, subjects will&#xD;
      receive a second dose of eASCs (40 million cells). Subjects will be followed until week 24,&#xD;
      following the initial administration of cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be treated with standard care during the entire study period, according to the&#xD;
      investigators discretion, excluding infliximab or any other anti-TNF, tacrolimus or&#xD;
      cyclosporine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Study population: In total 24 patients, men and women of at least 18 years of age, with&#xD;
      perianal CD will be recruited. Patients with a minimum of one and a maximum of three fistula&#xD;
      tracts.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Subjects will receive:&#xD;
