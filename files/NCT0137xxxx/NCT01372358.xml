             at least 1 year, or surgically sterile)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Each subject shall be given, a general physical examination within 28 days of&#xD;
             initiation of the study and will include, but is not limited to, blood pressure,&#xD;
             general observations, and history.&#xD;
