  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intra-ocular malignancy in adults with an incidence&#xD;
      of 0.6 - 0.7 per 100,000 per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognosis of metastatic uveal melanoma is poor. In retrospective analyses a median survival&#xD;
      time after detection of metastases of 5 months (Flaherty et al, 1998) and 7 months (Kath et&#xD;
      al, 1993) was reported. For patients receiving no treatment reported median survival was 2.0&#xD;
      months compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (Gragoudas et&#xD;
      al, 1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now there is no established treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma. Some therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches with locoregional treatment or systemic chemotherapy have been undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of metastatic disease which is confined to the liver in about 85% of patients with&#xD;
      uveal melanoma surgical resection led to a median survival of 14 months (Mariani et al, 2009)&#xD;
      or 19 months and a 5-year survival rate of 22% in a selected patient population (Adam et al,&#xD;
      2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As locoregional treatment option treatment with fotemustine via direct intra-arterial hepatic&#xD;
      infusion was investigated and led to a median survival of 15 months (Peters et al, 2006).&#xD;
      This was not a randomized trial, but a report on 101 consecutive treated patients. Additional&#xD;
      debulking surgery was performed whenever feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized phase III trial comparing intra-arterial hepatic fotemustine administration with&#xD;
      intravenous systemic fotemustine and overall survival as primary endpoint is still ongoing&#xD;
      (EORTC 18021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, no systemic chemotherapy is approved for metastatic uveal melanoma. Although no&#xD;
      specific genes have been linked to the pathogenesis of uveal melanoma, preclinical studies&#xD;
      suggest potential benefit of inhibitors of Bcl-2, ubiquitin-proteasome, histone deactylase,&#xD;
      mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-AKT pathways, and receptor&#xD;
      tyrosine kinases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, sorafenib as inhibitor of b-Raf and Raf-1 (c-Raf or c-Raf-1), pro-angiogenic vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor&#xD;
      (PDGFR) may potentially lead to a benefit for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in&#xD;
      terms of disease control and prolongation of survival.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale for treatment of uveal melanoma with sorafenib Improved understanding of the&#xD;
      molecular pathogenesis of cancers has led to a new generation of therapeutic agents that&#xD;
      interfere with a specific pathway critical in tumor development or progression. Although no&#xD;
      specific genes have been linked to the pathogenesis of uveal melanoma, which significantly&#xD;
      differs from that of cutaneous melanoma, progress has been made in identifying potential&#xD;
      targets involved in uveal melanoma apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Accordingly, improvement of systemic therapy of metastatic uveal melanoma could&#xD;
      be achieved by using molecularly targeted agents that are currently in clinical use as well&#xD;
      as agents being tested in clinical trials. Preclinical studies suggest potential benefit of&#xD;
      inhibitors of Bcl-2, ubiquitin-proteasome, histone deactylase, mitogen-activated protein&#xD;
      kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-AKT pathways, and receptor tyrosine kinases.&#xD;
      Modifiers of adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinase, and angiogenic factors also have&#xD;
      demonstrated potential benefit. (Triozzi et al, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, sorafenib as oral multi-kinase inhibitor that targets the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway&#xD;
      (CRAF, BRAF, V600E BRAF) in the cell and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as VEGFR-2,&#xD;
      VEGFR-3, and PDGFR-ß involved in tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis may potentially&#xD;
      lead to a benefit for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in terms of disease control and&#xD;
      prolongation of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a GCP-adapted register trial approved by the ethics committee in Essen 62 patients with&#xD;
      metastatic uveal melanoma received treatment with sorafenib on a compassionate use basis.&#xD;
      Median overall survival was 10.8 months in patients receiving 200 mg bid sorafenib and 7.1&#xD;
      months in patients receiving 400 mg bid (Scheulen et al, 2011). These treatment results are&#xD;
      encouraging for further investigation of treatment with sorafenib in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      uveal melanoma in a randomized trial, a potential benefit of this systemic treatment is&#xD;
      anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for selection of a randomized discontinuation trial design The randomized&#xD;
      discontinuation trial (RDT) design , first proposed in 1975 (Amery et al, 1975) aims to&#xD;
      assess the clinical activity of a drug while minimizing the use of placebo. All patients&#xD;
      receive study drug for an initial run-in period, followed by random assignment of potential&#xD;
      responders to either the study drug or the placebo (Amery et al,1975; Kopec et al,1993). RDT&#xD;
      design provides more homogeneous study treatment groups by selecting patients with a&#xD;
      predefined response, and allows the evaluation of a drug's clinical activity with fewer&#xD;
      patients and increased statistical power. Thus this study design is especially useful to&#xD;
      distinguish anticancer activity of the drug and natural history of the underlying disease&#xD;
      (Kopec et al,1993; Jain L et al, 2006; Rosner et al, 2002). As pointed out by Rosner the RDT&#xD;
      design is a feasible phase II study design for evaluating possible activity of cytostatic&#xD;
      anticancer agents whereas historically anticancer drug efficacy was evaluated as being&#xD;
      cytotoxic (Rosner et al, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As laid down in section 3.2 sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that targets the&#xD;
      Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in the cell and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as&#xD;
      VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and PDGFR-ß involved in tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The&#xD;
      primary clinical benefit of sorafenib is expected to be disease stabilization rather than&#xD;
      tumor shrinkage. As disease stabilization is substantially influenced by the natural disease&#xD;
      of a disease, the RDT design was chosen in several phase II trials evaluating possible&#xD;
      activity of sorafenib (such as Ratain et al, 2006; Eisen et al, 2006; Pacey et al, 2009)&#xD;
      Taking into account that uveal melanoma is a rare disease with presumably unidentified&#xD;
      prognostic factors the RDT design seems to be useful for objective evaluation of time to&#xD;
      progression and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RDT design will ensure that all patients receive treatment with sorafenib for a run-in&#xD;
      phase of 8 weeks and will receive further treatment with sorafenib if they experience&#xD;
      response (complete response or partial response). Patients who experience tumor progression&#xD;
      during this run-in phase will not remain in the study but may be offered alternative&#xD;
      treatment. Patients who experience tumor stabilization (stable disease) will be randomized&#xD;
      double-blinded to either sorafenib or placebo. Tumor response assessments will be performed&#xD;
      every 8 weeks, in case of progression the patient will be unblinded and offered retreatment&#xD;
      with sorafenib if he had been randomized to placebo. Thus, if the patient experiences&#xD;
      progression, the effective maximum duration of a possible placebo application is confined to&#xD;
      eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk-benefit assessment of the treatment of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma with&#xD;
      sorafenib Based on the rationale for treatment of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma&#xD;
      with sorafenib and own clinical experience in a limited number of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      uveal melanoma treated with sorafenib on a compassionate use basis (section 3.3), a potential&#xD;
      benefit of this systemic treatment is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major potential side effects of the continuous oral treatment with sorafenib are&#xD;
      hand-foot-syndrome, diarrhoea and increase in blood pressure which can effectively be reduced&#xD;
      either by dose reduction or cessation of treatment with sorafenib in case of&#xD;
      hand-foot-syndrome or diarrhoea or antihypertonic agents in case of increase of blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further on, the administration of sorafenib (oral intake) means fewer hospitalizations and&#xD;
      thus constitutes an improvement of quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, treatment with sorafenib is a potentially effective treatment of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic uveal melanoma without serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of short-term evaluation of inappropriate antitumor efficacy patients have the option&#xD;
      for alternative treatment strategies either by intra-arterial liver perfusion with&#xD;
      fotemustine or melphalan in case of metastatic disease confined to the liver or salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy. However it should be noted that these treatments do not represent established&#xD;
      and authorized alternative treatment options. The only randomized phase III trial comparing&#xD;
      intra-arterial hepatic fotemustine administration with intravenous systemic fotemustine with&#xD;
      regard to overall survival as primary endpoint is still ongoing (EORTC 18021), all other&#xD;
      experience is based on small phase II trials or individual treatments decisions as described&#xD;
      in section 3.1. Any locoregional treatment such as surgery or intra-arterial hepatic infusion&#xD;
      with fotemustine or mephalan requires that the patient does not suffer from disseminated&#xD;
      metastasis of the liver or extrahepatic localisation of metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any placement of an intra-arterial catheter and to a lower extent, intravenous catheter is&#xD;
      associated with the risks of catheter thrombosis, dislocation, catheter stenosis/obstruction&#xD;
      or leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main serious side effects of melphalan and fotemustine are myelotoxicity with anemia,&#xD;
      leucopenia and thrombocytopenia and the risk of developing acute leucemia, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      toxicity with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, allergic reactions, alopecia, interstitial&#xD;
      pneumonia, liver function disorders and renal function disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the poor prognosis of metastatic uveal melanoma and taking into account the lack&#xD;
      of an established treatment to treat metastatic uveal melanoma, the risk-benefit relation of&#xD;
      the study is assessed as positive. The possible benefit of achieving disease control with&#xD;
      sorafenib outweighs the risk of possible side effects of sorafenib. Alternative treatment&#xD;
      options are likewise further subject to investigation, have probably more serious side&#xD;
      effects and certainly affect the quality of life far more as result of the&#xD;
      intraarterial/intravenous infusional application in contrast to oral intake of sorafenib.&#xD;
