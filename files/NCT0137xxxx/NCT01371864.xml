      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the peri-operative communication between families and the pediatric cardiac&#xD;
      surgery team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -In this study the investigators plan to utilize structured interview and survey of&#xD;
      parents/legal guardians and health care providers of children undergoing cardiac surgery in&#xD;
      the United States of America.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Every day clinicians face challenges when attempting to negotiate their way through dialogues&#xD;
      with families whose children require surgical intervention in the near future. The area of&#xD;
      clinician-patient communication with pediatric families is under-researched and highlights a&#xD;
      pressing clinical problem. There are several adult studies that describe the content and&#xD;
      nature of patient-physician communications at the time of cardiac surgery. However, there are&#xD;
      no studies that evaluate the communications between nursing, physicians, and pediatric&#xD;
      patient's families at the time of cardiac surgery. Further knowledge in this area is valuable&#xD;
      in that a disparity between the these groups can lead to medical error, damage the&#xD;
      clinician-patient relationship and provide grounds for dissatisfaction, complaints, or claim.&#xD;
      This research will provide insight into what patient's families value in their communications&#xD;
      with the medical team and assist the medical community in better meeting our children's&#xD;
      families needs.&#xD;

        The study population will be selected from a tertiary care academic children's hospital&#xD;
        including:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inpatient population within the pediatric critical care unit, neonatal critical care&#xD;
             unit, and the cardiac intermediate care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Outpatient population including the pediatric cardiothoracic surgery clinic patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary language is English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt; 18 years age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nurse, physician, physician assistant, or parent / legal guardian of a pediatric&#xD;
             patient who requires cardiothoracic surgery at the North Carolina Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary language is not English. The interviewers all speak English as their primary&#xD;
             language. People whose primary language is other than English will only be excluded if&#xD;
             they do not have the ability to converse in English with the interviewers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &lt;18 years of age. The parent / legal guardian must be of age to be the primary&#xD;
             caregiver able to make decisions for their child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  People with an intellectual or mental impairment that prohibits their capacity to make&#xD;
             medical decisions for their child. Our research aims to investigate the relationship&#xD;
             between the parent / legal guardians of pediatric cardiac surgery patients who&#xD;
             interact with the pediatric cardiac surgery multidisciplinary team. These individuals&#xD;
             must have sufficient mental capacity to be able to provide consent for their child to&#xD;
             undergo surgery. Individuals with intellectual or mental impairment that prohibits&#xD;
             their ability to give consent are therefore excluded.&#xD;
