      Objective: To analyze the additional benefits of exercise training application by the&#xD;
      non-invasive home mechanical ventilation in patients with stable COPD and hypercapnic&#xD;
      respiratory failure. SUBJECT: moderate-severe COPD (FEV1 &lt;60%) in chronic respiratory failure&#xD;
      (hypoxemia and hypercapnia PaCO2&gt; 45mmHg). GROUPS: 45 patients included prospectively and&#xD;
      randomly into 3 groups of 15: a) training + NIPPV group, b) Group training, c) Group NIPPV.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A training program to the effort associated with treatment with NIPPV&#xD;
      significantly increase the effects compared with each treatment. MAIN OBJETIVE: Effects on&#xD;
      exercise capacity as measured by the test of endurance cycling and test 6-minute walk&#xD;
      (distance). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: Impact on quality of life and dyspnea, as measured by&#xD;
      questionnaire and CRQ, systemic inflammatory response (CRP, IL-8, TNF-α), changes in&#xD;
      peripheral muscle strength (1RM test, isometric) and effects score BODE index.&#xD;

                     Spanish-speaking subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training program (trained group) was carried out for 12 weeks and sessions of 40 minutes&#xD;
      duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 20 minutes of bicycle ergometer with an initial charge of about 70% of initial maximal&#xD;
           oxygen consumption, increasing the load every two weeks as tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Weightlifting in 2 sets of 6 replicates of 5 simple exercises. These are held at a&#xD;
           station multigimnástica (CLASSIC Fitness Center, KETTLER) and are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Simple bending of the arms (pull cable to the chest &quot;Chest pulls&quot;): effects on the&#xD;
                latissimus dorsi, deltoids and biceps. Procedure: Sitting in the face of the tower&#xD;
                of strength, approaching the bar to the chest and arm span later after return to&#xD;
                the starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Simple extension of the arms (force to the neck &quot;Neck press / shoulder press):&#xD;
                Effects on the deltoids and triceps. Procedure: Sitting upright on the bench and&#xD;
                held the weight to shoulder height, arm span will be held over his head, slowly&#xD;
                returning after bending arms to starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Arm flexion and extension against resistance (Butterfly &quot;Butterfly&quot;): Effects on&#xD;
                the pectoral and deltoid muscles. Sitting upright on the bench with your forearms&#xD;
                and elbows on a lever, takes it to the midline, giving way slowly to the starting&#xD;
                position.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Leg extensions (&quot;Leg extension&quot;): Effects on quadriceps. Sitting on the bench leg&#xD;
                extension is performed against resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Leg Curl (&quot;Leg curls): Effects on femoral biceps and calves. Lying prone on the&#xD;
                bench legs are flexed against the weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Resistance is increased gradually from 50% of the maximum weight you can lift the&#xD;
                patient on one occasion, early in the week, up to 85%. Every two weeks the weight&#xD;
                limit is reassessed to adjust the training load in each patient (Test 1 RM).&#xD;
&#xD;
                The groups that come under the non-invasive ventilation program will do so for 12&#xD;
                weeks. Noninvasive ventilation was initiated with support pressure applied with a&#xD;
                bilevel positive pressure ventilator (BiPAP ® Respironics, Inc.) This is a&#xD;
                ventilatory support system that maintains pressure at two different levels, a level&#xD;
                of positive expiratory pressure, or EPAP ( equivalent to conventional mechanical&#xD;
                ventilation PEEP) and a positive inspiratory pressure (IPAP, equivalent to pressure&#xD;
                support), even in the presence of flow variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The device can be programmed in different modes. In the spontaneous (S), the system&#xD;
                cycles to EPAP to IPAP when the patient's inspiratory flow exceeds 40 ml / sec.&#xD;
                over 30 msec. IPAP level is maintained for more than 180 milliseconds and cycles to&#xD;
                EPAP when inspiratory flow falls below a certain level, when it detects an&#xD;
                expiratory effort or the IPAP is held for more than 3 seconds. Thus, the patient&#xD;
                retains control over the respiratory rate, inspiratory flow and time. T mode, the&#xD;
                system provides the patient ventilatory support to a programmable frequency without&#xD;
                detecting any inspiratory effort (similar to a controlled manner in the&#xD;
                conventional mechanical ventilation). ST mode would be intermediate between them&#xD;
                and equivalent to assist-control ventilation in a volume ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The NIV will be implemented initially through a nasal mask (Respironics) with a&#xD;
                size appropriate to the patient, fixed by elastic belts fastened with Velcro, and&#xD;
                with sufficient strength to prevent escape but while avoiding excessive pressure in&#xD;
                order to achieve maximum comfort the patient. If leaks are important in the mouth&#xD;
                that hindered the NIV, is replaced by an oronasal mask (Respironics).&#xD;
&#xD;
                The first set parameters are: IPAP 10 cm H2O, EPAP 4 cm H2O, and ST mode, setting a&#xD;
                respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The IPAP was progressively increased to&#xD;
                a maximum of 20 cm H2O, depending on patient tolerability, clinical response and&#xD;
                arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry continuously monitored, trying to&#xD;
                avoid possible leaks through the mask.It can also supply oxygen through a tube&#xD;
                connected to the mask at a rate of 2-4 liters per minute in order to maintain&#xD;
                oxygen saturation at around 85-90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Patients were ventilated continuously during the night hours (minimum between 6-8&#xD;
                hours per night).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Upon completion of 12 weeks of treatment applied according to each study group, all&#xD;
                tests were repeated at baseline and compared the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. EXIT CRITERIA STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Offset of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Loss of 3 or 5 consecutive sessions staple.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  On the initiative of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
                8. Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analyzing the effect size at the expense of an improvement in work reached about 15 W&#xD;
           higher than the stress test, assuming a standard deviation of this parameter of + / -&#xD;
           10W, An alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0, 1 (statistical power 90%) and calculating a loss&#xD;
           ratio of 15%, we estimate a sample size of 15 patients for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comparing before and after the training response in each group were performed using a&#xD;
           paired t test. Comparisons between groups were made using analysis of variance (ANOVA).&#xD;
           The Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis will allow to examine&#xD;
           relationships between physiological variables. Be considered significant at p &lt;0.05. The&#xD;
           dispersion of a mean value is expressed as mean + / - standard deviation.&#xD;
