    <textblock>
      The Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) has been commissioned by the Department of&#xD;
      Health and Ageing to undertake a project to assess new Radiation Oncology Technology and&#xD;
      Treatments. This project is being undertaken in response to a recognised need for the&#xD;
      Medicare Benefits Schedule to support appropriate new radiation oncology technologies and&#xD;
      treatments as they become available, to ensure optimal patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of the project required TROG to develop a Generic Research Framework (the&#xD;
      Framework) capable of collecting and generating information to substantiate the safety,&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of new technologies and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second (and current) phase of the project requires that the Framework be piloted to&#xD;
      assess the safety, clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of Intensity Modulated Radiation&#xD;
      Therapy (IMRT) and Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) in four tumour site specific&#xD;
      regions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Post Prostatectomy(IMRT) B. Anal Cancer (IMRT) C. Nasopharynx (IMRT) D. Intermediate Risk&#xD;
      Prostate Cancer (IGRT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the site specific components of the ANROTAT protocol are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol A. Develop an approach for applying the Framework to evaluate the safety, clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IMRT compared to 3DCRT in patients with prostate cancer&#xD;
      (PP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol B. Develop an approach for applying the Framework to evaluate the safety, clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IMRT compared to 3DCRT in AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol C. Develop an approach for applying the Framework to evaluate the safety, clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IMRT compared to 3DCRT in NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol D. Develop an approach for applying the Framework to evaluate the safety, clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IGRT compared to non-IGRT in patients with intermediate&#xD;
      risk prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ANROTAT study is divided into four tumour site specific studies. A decision analytic&#xD;
      model will be constructed for each disease area/technology to estimate the safety, clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and cost effectiveness of the new technology compared to conventional standard&#xD;
      treatment approach. This will incorporate information from previous studies and data from a&#xD;
      series of component studies including a dosimetric evaluation, a QoL evaluation, and an&#xD;
      evaluation of the cost of treatment planning and delivery. The development and refinement of&#xD;
      these models is an integral component of the planned research program. The overall protocol&#xD;
      details the data collection activities that have been identified as feasible and useful for&#xD;
      informing the development of a series of decision analytic models to evaluate IMRT and IGRT&#xD;
      for the four specified cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These activities involve the collection of dosimetry data, quality of life (QoL) and toxicity&#xD;
      data, and health care resource usage data in a series of component studies. These data will&#xD;
      be used in conjunction with evidence from the existing literature and expert opinion to&#xD;
      inform the construction of the decision analytic models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from at least 10 treatment centres for each of the site specific&#xD;
      studies. Data will be transcribed onto CRFs from source data forms. The CRFs will be sent to&#xD;
      TROG Cancer Research on a secure fax line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's treatment plans will be securely uploaded to the TROG Central Quality&#xD;
      Management System (CQMS) for plan review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data to be collected, number of participants and tasks for participants is outlined below&#xD;
      for each of the site specific studies. WBRC has been invited to participate in Studies A and&#xD;
      B only, however, ethics approval is sought for the entire ANROTAT protocol so our centre has&#xD;
      approval and the option to participate in all components of ANROTAT where required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol A IMRT versus 3DCRT in Post Prostatectomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post prostatectomy study methodology applies the ANROTAT framework and includes a series&#xD;
      of component studies including a dosimetric evaluation, a QoL/toxicity evaluation, and an&#xD;
      evaluation of the cost of treatment planning and delivery. This involves the collection of&#xD;
      data from approximately 30 patients. Data collection includes eligibility, adverse&#xD;
      events/toxicity, QoL, patient costs, and dosimetry parameters (contouring, planning, quality&#xD;
      assurance, treatment data). These data will be used in conjunction with evidence from the&#xD;
      existing literature and expert opinion to inform the construction of a decision analytic&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centres will be asked to provide two retrospective and one prospective patient but this will&#xD;
      have to be varied according to the availability of retrospective patients at each&#xD;
      participating centre. Each centre will be provided with details of case selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected directly from patients will include QoL and toxicity data as well as costs&#xD;
      incurred by the patient as a result of their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol B IMRT versus 3DCRT in Anal Cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anal canal study methodology applies the ANROTAT framework and includes a series of&#xD;
      component studies including a dosimetric evaluation, a QoL/toxicity evaluation, and&#xD;
      healthcare resource usage. This involves the collection of data from 30 patients. Data&#xD;
      collection includes eligibility, adverse events/toxicity, QoL, patient costs, and dosimetry&#xD;
      parameters (contouring, planning, quality assurance, treatment data). These data will be used&#xD;
      in conjunction with evidence from the existing literature and expert opinion to inform the&#xD;
      construction of a decision analytic model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating centres will be asked to provide data on the contouring and planning of a CT&#xD;
      data set that will be sent to each of the participating centres. Following this, each&#xD;
      participating centre will plan 3 retrospective patient cases each. In addition to this, data&#xD;
      will be collected from 10 prospective anal cancer patients who will be asked to complete QoL&#xD;
      and patient cost questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol C IMRT versus 3DCRT in NPC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nasopharynx study methodology applies the ANROTAT framework and includes a series of&#xD;
      component studies including a dosimetric evaluation, a QoL/toxicity evaluation, and&#xD;
      healthcare resource usage. This involves the collection of data from 30 patients for the&#xD;
      dosimetry component and 150 patients for the QoL component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection includes eligibility, adverse events/toxicity, QoL, patient costs, and&#xD;
      dosimetry parameters (contouring, planning, quality assurance, treatment data). These data&#xD;
      will be used in conjunction with evidence from the existing literature and expert opinion to&#xD;
      inform the construction of a decision analytic model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating centres will be asked to provide data on the contouring of a CT data set that&#xD;
      will be sent to each of the participating centres. Following this, the dosimetry component&#xD;
      will require centres to recruit as many prospective patients as possible to collect the above&#xD;
      mentioned data. Due to the short time frame, if 30 prospective patients cannot be recruited&#xD;
      in the time frame, this will be supplemented with retrospective cases. In addition to this,&#xD;
      data will be collected from 150 nasopharynx patients who will be asked to complete QoL and&#xD;
      patient cost questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol D IGRT versus non IGRT in Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IGRT study methodology applies the ANROTAT framework and includes a series of component&#xD;
      studies including a dosimetric evaluation, a QoL/toxicity evaluation, and healthcare resource&#xD;
      usage. This involves the collection of data from 30 prospective patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection includes eligibility, adverse events/toxicity, QoL, patient costs, and&#xD;
      dosimetry parameters. These data will be used in conjunction with evidence from the existing&#xD;
      literature and expert opinion to inform the construction of a decision analytic model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected directly from patients will include QoL and toxicity data as well as costs&#xD;
      incurred by the patient as a result of their treatment.&#xD;
