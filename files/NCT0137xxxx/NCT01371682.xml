      This is an open-label, randomised, two-period crossover, single dose study to demonstrate&#xD;
      bioequivalence between the extended release 2 mg ropinirole XL tablets manufactured at two&#xD;
      different sites in healthy subjects. Dosing will be under fasting conditions and there will&#xD;
      be a minimum one week washout between doses. Domperidone will be administered to control&#xD;
      dopaminergic side effects. Pharmacokinetic samples will be taken following each dose. Safety&#xD;
      assessments will include screening and follow-up vital signs, ECGs and safety laboratory&#xD;
      tests. Vital signs and adverse events will be monitored periodically throughout the study.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, randomised, two-period crossover, single dose study to demonstrate&#xD;
      bioequivalence between the extended release 2 mg ropinirole XL tablets manufactured at two&#xD;
      different sites in healthy subjects. Dosing will be under fasting conditions and there will&#xD;
      be a minimum one week washout between doses. Domperidone will be administered to control&#xD;
      dopaminergic side effects. Pharmacokinetic samples will be taken following each dose. Safety&#xD;
      assessments will include screening and follow-up vital signs, ECGs and safety laboratory&#xD;
      tests. Vital signs and adverse events will be monitored periodically throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The manufacturing of ropinirole XL tablets will be moved from the Crawley (UK) manufacturing&#xD;
      facility to the Aranda (Spain) manufacturing facility. The tablets manufactured at Aranda&#xD;
      will have the same characteristics as those manufactured at Crawley.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present pharmacokinetic study is designed to assess bioequivalence of ropinirole XL 2 mg&#xD;
      tablets manufactured at Aranda vs ropinirole XL 2 mg tablets manufactured at Crawley.&#xD;
      Bioequivalence between the two tablets will be tested in healthy subjects and administered in&#xD;
      the fasting state.&#xD;
