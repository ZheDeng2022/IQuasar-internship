  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The important character of acute lung injury (ALI) is alveolar capillary membrane damage&#xD;
      caused by different diseases, such as sepsis, trauma and shock. One of the important&#xD;
      pathological stages is the varying degrees of interstitial fibrosis and semi-permeable&#xD;
      alveolar membrane fibrosis. It has been proved that CXCL12/SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived&#xD;
      factor-1) induces fibrocyte migration, and promotes fibrosis progression. Study indicated&#xD;
      that inhibition of TLR4 receptor signaling pathway improves fibrosis progression induced by&#xD;
      ALI, however, the role of fibrocyte in ALI is still unclear. The fibrocytes was significantly&#xD;
      increased in asthmatic patients with pulmonary fibrosis, which companies with increased CTGF&#xD;
      expression. Therefore, this project assumes that fibrocyte will differentiation to&#xD;
      fibroblast/myofibroblast in patient with acute lung injury, which in turn leads to&#xD;
      progression of fibrosis. The central hypothesis of this project is that peripheral progenitor&#xD;
      cell fibrocytes play an important role in alveolitis caused by acute lung injury. The overall&#xD;
      objective of this project is to study the role of fibrocytes in acute lung injury.&#xD;
