      Prevention of Cisplatin-Induced Hearing Loss by Intratympanic Dexamethasone Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of various malignant&#xD;
      neoplasms, including testicular, ovarian, bladder, cervix uteri, head and neck and lung&#xD;
      cancers 1-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose limiting side effects of Cisplatin include nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity and&#xD;
      ototoxicity. While nephrotoxicity can be diminished or controlled with hydration therapy&#xD;
      there are no known cure or preventive treatments available for neurotoxicity and ototoxicity&#xD;
      2,4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin-associated ototoxicity is characterized by bilateral, symmetric progressive and&#xD;
      usually irreversible sensorineural hearing loss. The hearing impairment is dose related,&#xD;
      cumulative and takes place within hours to days from the administration of cisplatin 1-4. The&#xD;
      reported incidence of cisplatin-induced hearing loss is variable. Schweitzer calculated from&#xD;
      a large number of studies an average incidence of 62% with a range from 11 to 97% 5-6. Damage&#xD;
      from cisplatin initially affects the outermost row of outer hair cells located at the&#xD;
      cochlear basal turn, which codes hearing at the high frequency range. Further insult affects&#xD;
      the remaining rows of outer hair cells, inner hair cells, and supporting cells. The pattern&#xD;
      of destruction proceeds from the basal turn towards the more apical regions of the cochlea,&#xD;
      with increasing impact on hearing acuity in lower frequencies 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin induces cochlear toxicity by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on one&#xD;
      hand and depletion of antioxidant enzymes on the other hand. This leads to lipid, protein and&#xD;
      nucleic acids peroxidation with destruction of various cell organs and apoptosis 4,7,8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various chemoprotectants have been suggested to ameliorate cisplatin-induced ototoxcity.&#xD;
      These include sodium thiosulfate, amifostine, diethyldithiocarbamate, 4-methylthiobenzoic&#xD;
      acid, D- and L-methionine, N-acetylcysteine, and glutathione ester. The mechanisms of action&#xD;
      include direct antioxidant activity and maintenance of glutathione levels 2,4. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      systemic delivery of many of these agents have been found to inhibit the tumoricidal effects&#xD;
      of cisplatin and/or have toxicities or unknown effects in humans 2,9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abundant corticosteroids receptors were demonstrated within the mouse critical inner ear&#xD;
      structures suggesting active role of these compounds in inner ear homeostasis 10.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone has been reported to up-regulate cochlear anti ROS enzymes activity in various&#xD;
      small mammals animal models2,3,11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone treatment is currently practiced for various pathologies afflicting the inner&#xD;
      ear in which ROS are involved in immediate or delayed ischemia-reperfusion mechanism of&#xD;
      injury. These include sudden sensorineural hearing loss, noise-induced hearing loss,&#xD;
      salicylate and aminoglycoside ototoxicity 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above discussion suggests rationale for the prevention of cisplatin ototoxicity by&#xD;
      Dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intratympanic (IT) delivery of drugs is a contemporary method based on the diffusion of the&#xD;
      active remedy across the round window into the inner ear where it exerts its therapeutic&#xD;
      effects 12-14. This method allows for high inner ear concentration when compared to oral or&#xD;
      parenteral administration while avoiding the undesirable systemic side-effects 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IT administration of steroids is vastly used in the last decades for the treatment of sudden&#xD;
      sensorineural hearing loss and Meniere's disease. 2,3,12 Currently employed techniques for IT&#xD;
      drug delivery include trans-tympanic membrane injection into the middle ear cavity either&#xD;
      directly or through a tympanostomy; placing a wick attached to the round window niche which&#xD;
      is suggested to facilitate better administration of the drug to the target organ;&#xD;
      implantation of a round window microcatheter connected to a micro-pump for continuous drug&#xD;
      delivery. Experimental IT strategies include the application of various hydrogels and&#xD;
      nanoparticles as drug carriers, and direct delivery of medication to the inner ear via&#xD;
      osmotic pumps and reciprocating perfusion systems 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our review of the literature yielded three animal studies which examined the protective&#xD;
      effect of IT dexamethasone in the prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss. These studies&#xD;
      demonstrated promising results pointing to the potential for IT dexamethasone in the&#xD;
      prevention of cisplatin ototoxicity in humans. Daldal et al carried a controlled study in the&#xD;
      guinea pig model. The study groups were treated by IT dexamethasone either before or after&#xD;
      intra-peritoneal injections of cisplatin, one control group had cisplatin injections alone&#xD;
      and the second control group was given only IT dexamethasone. IT dexamethasone caused no&#xD;
      cochlear damage as evaluated by distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Cisplatin&#xD;
      caused significant decrease in DPOAEs amplitudes and SNR values, while both IT dexamethasone&#xD;
      treated groups demonstrated significant protection from cisplatin ototoxicity 11. Hill et al&#xD;
      evaluated ABR click and tone burst evoked thresholds in mice receiving intra-peritoneal&#xD;
      cisplatin. In each animal one ear was treated by IT dexamethasone while the second ear had IT&#xD;
      saline injection and served as a control. The results showed significant protection for the&#xD;
      click, 8 and 16 kHz threshold shifts in the IT dexamethasone treated ears 3. Paksoy et al&#xD;
      employed similar ABR evaluations to examine the potential otoprotective effect of IT&#xD;
      dexamethasone in cisplatin treated rats. While significant thresholds elevations were&#xD;
      demonstrated in the cisplatin treated rats, IT dexamethasone preserved ABR responses 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We could not find any previously published study that examined the role of IT dexamethasone&#xD;
      in the prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine possible protective effect of IT dexamethasone on&#xD;
      cisplatin-induced hearing loss, in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study hypothesis is that IT dexamethasone treatment would prevent cisplatin-induced&#xD;
      hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a prospective cohort controlled research. The participants would be 30&#xD;
      consecutive patients suffering from a neoplastic disease for which the treatment protocol&#xD;
      includes cisplatinum not previously delivered to them. The cumulative cisplatin dose would be&#xD;
      at least 300mg divided to treatment sessions and dosages as dictated by the oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving an explanation about the study goals and methods, candidates for&#xD;
      participation in the study would sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation would include detailed history with emphasis on previous or existing ear&#xD;
      disease, microscopic otoscopy, pure tone, speech and impedance audiometry, and Distortion&#xD;
      Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs) testing. This test specifically evaluates the&#xD;
      functioning of the cochlear outer hair cells which are the primary target organ for cisplatin&#xD;
      ototoxicity. It has been previously shown that decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the&#xD;
      otoacoustic emissions precedes the appearance of the audiological pure tone threshold shift&#xD;
      and identify sub-clinical hearing loss.15 Exclusion criteria would include the followings:&#xD;
      age &lt; 18 years; existing or previous pathology of the external or middle ear avoiding IT drug&#xD;
      delivery or the performance of DPOAEs testing; retrocochlear hearing loss; Meniere's disease;&#xD;
      Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease; fluctuating hearing loss; history of sudden sensory neural&#xD;
      hearing loss; previous radiation therapy to the head and neck region; baseline average pure&#xD;
      tone audiometry thresholds for 500-3000 Hz and 4000-8000 Hz greater than 40 dB; average SNR&#xD;
      below 6 dB for DPOAEs f2 frequencies 500-3000 Hz and 4000-8000 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under topical anesthesia of Emla cream (mixture of lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%), 0.7ml&#xD;
      of Dexamethasone Phosphate 10mg/ml would be injected unilaterally to the middle ear using 25&#xD;
      gauge spinal needle. The injected side would serve as the study ear while the contralateral&#xD;
      side would be the control ear. The ear receiving the treatment would be randomly chosen using&#xD;
      a computerized &quot;randomizer&quot;16. The trans-tympanic membrane injection would take place at the&#xD;
      posterior inferior quadrant of the ear drum facing the round window niche. The patient would&#xD;
      be instructed to lie down for 20 minutes after the injection with the treated side up and to&#xD;
      avoid swallowing or coughing. These measures are taken to allow maximal contact of the&#xD;
      Dexamethasone solution with the round window membrane while minimizing medication loss via&#xD;
      the Eustachian tube. Intratympanic Dexamethasone would be delivered immediately prior to each&#xD;
      cisplatin treatment as maximal level of the medication in the scala tympani is anticipated 1&#xD;
      hour post injection 10,17,18 while the maximal perilymph concentration of cisplatinum after&#xD;
      intravenous injection in the guinea pig model is reached after 20 minutes19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pure tone, speech and impedance audiometry and DPOAEs would be recorded prior to the first&#xD;
      cisplatinum administration and before each consecutive treatment. The final testing would&#xD;
      take place 7 days after the last treatment session in which the cumulative dose of 300mg was&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters would be compared between the study and control ears for the&#xD;
      baseline and consecutive examinations: Pure tone average thresholds for 500-3000 and&#xD;
      4000-8000 Hz; DPOAEs SNR averages for 500-3000 and 4000-8000 f2 frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal distribution of the results would be examined by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The&#xD;
      comparisons between the study and control ears for the baseline and consecutive evaluations&#xD;
      would be done using the Student's paired two-tailed t-test. Longitudinal changes in pure tone&#xD;
      audiometry thresholds and DPOAEs SNR would be evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was based on the following parameters: The event rate for&#xD;
      cisplatinum-induced sensorineural hearing loss is 60% 6; each patient serves as his own&#xD;
      control when one ear is treated and the hearing level is compared to that of the untreated&#xD;
      ear; A successful treatment is defined as preventing at least third of the anticipated&#xD;
      hearing loss in the study population; the desired statistical power is 80% with p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking the above parameters into consideration the calculated required sample size is 30&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
