      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health needs healthy volunteers for vaccine clinical trials. These trials will&#xD;
      allow researchers to study vaccines and injection devices. These studies will also allow&#xD;
      researchers to understand the immune system and how vaccines work. In this protocol,&#xD;
      researchers will screen healthy volunteers for these future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To screen healthy volunteers for clinical trials at the NIAID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy people between 18 years of age or older. They must be available to take part in&#xD;
      clinical trials and be able to provide blood for research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening for a clinical trial may begin several months before the vaccine clinical&#xD;
           trial begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They may also&#xD;
           answer questions about sexual activity and drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers will provide blood samples and possibly urine samples. They may have other&#xD;
           tests as needed for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers will not receive any treatment in this screening trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to screen potential study, mostly healthy volunteers, to&#xD;
      determine if they are eligible for clinical trials of investigational products conducted by&#xD;
      the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), NIAID, NIH at the NIH Clinical Center. Educational&#xD;
      materials on the investigational products and protocols will be reviewed with and provided to&#xD;
      subjects during participation in the screening protocol. Approximately 3,000 adults 18 years&#xD;
      of age or older will be enrolled; however, the age ranges may be more restrictive for some&#xD;
      clinical trials. Recruitment efforts at any given time will focus on the age ranges specified&#xD;
      for the VRC studies that are in development or open to accrual.&#xD;
