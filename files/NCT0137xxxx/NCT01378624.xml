      Ex vivo effect of fragments and modified forms of surfactant protein D on pulmonary immune&#xD;
      cells derived from bronchoalveolar lavage after segmental allergen challenge in patients with&#xD;
      asthma and pilot study to assess local inflammation induced by segmental allergen challenge&#xD;
      by magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of surfactant protein D under native and altered conditions will be investigated&#xD;
      in immune cells that are derived from bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with allergic asthma&#xD;
      following segmental allergen challenge. The goal of this study is to elucidate the pro-&#xD;
      versus anti-inflammatory function of SP-D molecules and to identify motifs of SP-D that have&#xD;
      treatment potential in allergic asthma and to assess local inflammation induced by segmental&#xD;
      allergen challenge by magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the patients with allergic asthma a subgroup of five healthy subjects will be&#xD;
      included into the study to elucidate the specificity of the SP-D (surfactant protein-D)&#xD;
      effect on the allergic inflammation in the invitro models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to isolate BAL cells for different invitro experiments&#xD;
      and to assess local inflammation after segmental allergen challenge by MRI in response to the&#xD;
      applied allergen dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, following a baseline BAL, allergen (2× individual dose, 1× one tenth of individual&#xD;
      dose) and saline (1×) will be instilled into four different lung segments during a first&#xD;
      bronchoscopy. After 24 hours during a second bronchoscopy BAL will be collected in these&#xD;
      challenged segments to harvest invaded cells for invitro experimentation. In addition,&#xD;
      bronchial biopsies and epithelial brushes will be taken to assess the degree of local&#xD;
      inflammation in bronchial mucosa and to study the activation of airway epithelium following&#xD;
      allergen challenge.&#xD;
