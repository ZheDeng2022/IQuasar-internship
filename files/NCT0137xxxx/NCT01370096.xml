      To diagnose pulmonary hypertension, children have a cardiac catheterization to check the&#xD;
      blood pressure in their lungs. Children with pulmonary hypertension have high blood pressure&#xD;
      in their lungs. The right ventricle of the heart has to do more work to pump against this&#xD;
      higher pressure. The investigators do not know the best medicine(s) to help children with&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension when their right ventricles fail. The purpose of the study is to look&#xD;
      at the effects of two different medicines on the blood pressure in the lungs of a child with&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension. The investigators hope to then be able to choose the best medicine&#xD;
      for children with pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first medicine is called vasopressin. It is a hormone that your body makes on its own.&#xD;
      The investigators will be giving it through an intravenous infusion. The investigators think&#xD;
      that vasopressin works differently in different parts of your body. The investigators are&#xD;
      looking to see the different effects that vasopressin has in the lungs compared to the rest&#xD;
      of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second medicine is called prostacyclin and is something that your body also makes by&#xD;
      itself. Prostacyclin, given via an intravenous infusion, is a treatment for pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension as it decreases pressure in the blood vessels. In the catheterization&#xD;
      laboratory, patients breathe in this medicine to measure specific changes in the blood&#xD;
      pressure in their lungs.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare, but devastating disease that affects both adult and&#xD;
      pediatric patients. Mortality is high with 84% survival at one year and 50% survival at five&#xD;
      years in adult populations despite treatment. The cause of death is typically either from&#xD;
      right ventricular failure or sudden cardiac death, likely secondary to a pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertensive crisis. The resuscitation of patients with PH after cardiac arrest is extremely&#xD;
      difficult. The use of epinephrine, a pulmonary vasoconstrictor, during resuscitation may&#xD;
      impair filling of the left ventricle. The ideal resuscitation drug(s) would dilate the&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular bed to help fill the left ventricle while constricting the systemic&#xD;
      vascular bed to maintain coronary perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of pulmonary vascular reactivity is critical to the clinical management of&#xD;
      patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH). The goals of this pilot study include&#xD;
      determination of the hemodynamic effects of low dose vasopressin infusion and the effects of&#xD;
      a combination of low dose vasopressin infusion and inhaled prostacyclin in a population of&#xD;
      pediatric patients with PH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective, pilot study to examine the acute hemodynamic effects&#xD;
      of low dose vasopressin infusion and the combination of low dose vasopressin infusion and&#xD;
      inhaled prostacyclin in pediatric pulmonary hypertension patients. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate recruiting 10 pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension over the course of&#xD;
      one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. All subjects will be&#xD;
      intubated and mechanically ventilated for the study as per laboratory protocol. Sedation and&#xD;
      anesthesia will be performed at the discretion of the pediatric anesthesiologist to provide a&#xD;
      consistent anesthetic during the period of hemodynamic study. Arterial and venous access will&#xD;
      be obtained via the femoral approach by standard techniques. Right and left catheterization&#xD;
      will be performed to record hemodynamic measurements at baseline and after pulmonary&#xD;
      vasoreactivity testing with oxygen and nitric oxide as per usual. Catheterization data to be&#xD;
      collected includes right atrial pressure, systolic, diastolic and mean pulmonary artery&#xD;
      pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic arterial pressure, cardiac index,&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) index, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) index and&#xD;
      PVR/SVR ratio. After a period of time to allow for nitric oxide washout, acute vasoreactivity&#xD;
      testing to assess the hemodynamic response to low dose vasopressin infusion followed by the&#xD;
      combination of low dose vasopressin infusion and inhaled PGI2 will be performed.&#xD;

    <description>An intravenous infusion of vasopressin will be started at an initial rate of 0.0002U/Kg/min via the side arm of the central venous sheath. The infusion will be titrated up by 0.0001U/kg/min every minute until there has been a 20% increase in invasive mean arterial blood pressure (maximum infusion 0.002U/kg/min) and then the infusion may be titrated to maintain this blood pressure.</description>

    <description>An intravenous infusion of vasopressin will be started at an initial rate of 0.0002U/Kg/min via the side arm of the central venous sheath. The infusion will be titrated up by 0.0001U/kg/min every minute until there has been a 20% increase in invasive mean arterial blood pressure (maximum infusion 0.002U/kg/min) and then the infusion may be titrated to maintain this blood pressure. If the target 20% increase in SBP is not achieved with vasopressin titration, the infusion will remain at 0.002U/kg/min. After a period of ten minutes of drug exposure to allow for patient equilibration, subjects will receive nebulized prostacyclin at a dose of 50ng/kg/min for 15 minutes via Aeroneb into the endotracheal tube.</description>
