    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of filanesib when given together&#xD;
      with carfilzomib in treating patients with multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia that has&#xD;
      returned or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as filanesib,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Carfilzomib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      filanesib together with carfilzomib may be a better treatment for multiple myeloma or plasma&#xD;
      cell leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of filanesib (ARRY-520) when&#xD;
      combined with carfilzomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the efficacy of ARRY-520 when combined with&#xD;
      carfilzomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore potential markers for patient selection and obtain a preliminary assessment of&#xD;
      the biological activity of ARRY-520 when combined with carfilzomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive filanesib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 15, and 16 and&#xD;
      carfilzomib IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Courses repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 8 courses of&#xD;
      therapy, patients may continue with dosing of carfilzomib on days 1, 2, 15, and 16 and&#xD;
      filanesib as tolerated. If patient progresses on carfilzomib maintenance with administration&#xD;
      on days 1, 2, 15, and 16 they may increase the intensity and add in days 8 and 9 dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then&#xD;
      periodically thereafter.&#xD;
