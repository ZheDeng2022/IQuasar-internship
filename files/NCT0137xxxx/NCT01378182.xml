  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetically inherited disorder of copper&#xD;
      metabolism, causing neurological, psychiatric and liver disease. The ATP7B gene on the 13th&#xD;
      chromosome is responsible for the disease. Liver has a critical role on copper metabolism. It&#xD;
      is the main site of copper accumulation and bile secretion is the only physiologic way of&#xD;
      copper elimination. Due to defective production of ceruloplasmin which carries copper, wide&#xD;
      amount of free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the liver, eyes&#xD;
      and brain. Patients are bound to lifelong chelating agents such as penicillamine, trientine&#xD;
      and tetramine dihydrochloride. Unfortunately, these medications may cause severe side-effects&#xD;
      such as hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression, auto-immune disease and&#xD;
      sideroblastic anemia. Medical treatment of liver cirrhosis, the last stage of the illness&#xD;
      that leads to morbidity and mortality in the Wilson Disease, is difficult. Liver&#xD;
      transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis&#xD;
      in Wilson Disease. However, serious problems are accompanied with liver transplantation. Lack&#xD;
      of liver donors, complications during and after the surgery, graft rejection and high costs&#xD;
      are the main problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a&#xD;
      diverse range of specialized cell types. These are called &quot;stem cells&quot;. Stem cells can be&#xD;
      differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. Recently, the&#xD;
      differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes is proved by&#xD;
      demonstrating hepatocytes containing Y chromosome in the female who has had bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation from male donors. In many laboratory studies, it is observed that human bone&#xD;
      marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, transplanted to animals with induced liver damage,&#xD;
      differentiate into the albumin producing hepatocytes without fusion. By these studies, it is&#xD;
      understood that mesenchymal stem cells are more potent than other bone marrow elements in&#xD;
      context of differentiation to hepatocytes. Even though the number of studies on human for the&#xD;
      same purpose is few, findings are supporting those of animal experiments. Mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells are non-immunogenic. Safety and feasibility of allogeneic transplantations between&#xD;
      individuals without need of immunosuppressive drug regimen are proven. Proofs of correcting&#xD;
      metabolic defects by this way are also presented in some publications. For the reasons&#xD;
      mentioned above, allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is a promising treatment&#xD;
      modality especially for the hereditary metabolic diseases. By this way, non-immunogeneic&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells which have healthy genetic structure, can manufacture the required&#xD;
      enzyme, will be repopulated in the damaged tissue and contribute to the clinical improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, mesenchymal stem cells will be derived from healthy volunteer donor's bone&#xD;
      marrow and be expanded in-vitro, and then 1 million cells per kg will be infused to patients&#xD;
      with liver cirrhosis related to Wilson disease, 50 million cells via hepatic artery and the&#xD;
      remaining cells via peripheral vein. It is aimed to enable liver regeneration, decrease&#xD;
      fibrosis rate, improve patient's health conditions, increase ceruloplasmin synthesis,&#xD;
      ameliorate disorder of copper metabolism, decrease the need for chelating agents, increase&#xD;
      living standards of patients, and prolong waiting time for liver transplantation. Finally it&#xD;
      is aimed to establish a new and regenerative treatment protocol alternative to liver&#xD;
      transplantation. For observation of clinical and laboratory improvement, patients are planned&#xD;
      to be monitored by histopathologic examination of liver biopsies before and at 6th month&#xD;
      after the treatment, monthly biochemical and hematologic blood tests and periodic radiologic&#xD;
      examinations. This is a hopeful, avant garde and sophisticated study which may constitute new&#xD;
      horizons in context of cellular therapies.&#xD;
