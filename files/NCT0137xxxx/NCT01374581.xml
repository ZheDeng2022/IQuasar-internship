      This is a bi-centric phase IIIb, randomized, open label, 3-arm clinical trial performed to&#xD;
      investigate the impact of retreatment with an Artemisinin-Based Combination (ACT), for&#xD;
      example Arthemeter-Lumefantrine (AL) in Uganda (Ug) and artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) in&#xD;
      RDCongo, on malaria incidence and its potential selection of resistant strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed-up for efficacy and safety during 42 days after treatment with the&#xD;
      first line therapy recommended by the national authorities(arthemeter-lumefantrine in Uganda&#xD;
      and artesunate-amodiaquine in RDCongo) and retreated the patients either with the same ACT or&#xD;
      an other ACT or oral Quinine + clyndamicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that (re)treatment with the first line ACT treatment beyond 14&#xD;
      days is as efficacious as any other rescue treatment, without the risk of selecting drug&#xD;
      resistant strains.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      RATIONALE Following the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, most African countries&#xD;
      have opted for ACT. Several clinical trials on ASAQ, an ACT, completed in Africa have shown&#xD;
      an efficacy &gt; 90% (3-5). Furthermore, after The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis,&#xD;
      over 75 % of ASAQ &amp; AL treatment failures have been classified as new infections, while&#xD;
      recrudescences have low parasite densities. ASAQ is safe and easy administered, with a good&#xD;
      treatment adherence. Therefore, effectiveness may be close to efficacy . ASAQ has now been&#xD;
      developed as fixed-dose combination and registered. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)&#xD;
      has also chosen ASAQ as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of the 6 dose regimen of AL has been demonstrated in semi-immune and non-immune&#xD;
      populations in Asia and Africa to be consistently greater than 95%, with rapid parasite and&#xD;
      symptom clearance and significant gametocidal effect. In Uganda, AL has already been chosen&#xD;
      as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In DRC and Uganda, quinine is the rescue treatment for malaria. It is cheap, widely available&#xD;
      and generally considered to be effective but is not popular due to the unwanted side effects.&#xD;
      Quinine has a very short half life, therefore repeated dosing is required. In an efficacy&#xD;
      study of quinine and artemisinin for uncomplicated malaria in Vietnam, recrudescence rates&#xD;
      were 16% after 7 days of quinine monotherapy. In studies conducted in Gabon, Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum in Vitro sensitivity to quinine was high and had not changed over the past decade.&#xD;
      Although quinine monotherapy shows high efficacy in the setting of clinical trials, it has&#xD;
      considerable disadvantages, mainly because of its poor tolerability and the prolonged&#xD;
      treatment course. Poor adherence carries a high risk of treatment failure, particularly&#xD;
      because quinine causes a syndrome of adverse effects known as cinchonism that includes&#xD;
      primarily tinnitus, nausea, and vertigo. Other reported side effects are high tone hearing&#xD;
      impairment, dizziness, hypotension as well as headache and visual disturbances. As result of&#xD;
      these side effects, some studies have reported poor compliance to treatment. A randomized&#xD;
      trial in Thailand reported 71% adherence Such poor adherence to the 7-days regimen is&#xD;
      associated with a high risk of treatment failure, which can contribute to the development and&#xD;
      spread of resistance. Furthermore, in field circumstances patients are often re-treated with&#xD;
      the recommended first line drug, i.e. ASAQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As quinine is effective against all species of malaria including chloroquine-resistant&#xD;
      strains of P. falciparum, it is widely used for the treatment of severe malaria. Therefore,&#xD;
      it should be protected from resistance by a rational use, as its effectiveness in&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria is lower than ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Considering the facts that: over 90% of treatment failure to ASAQ or AL are new&#xD;
      infections, parasitaemia is low in case of recrudescence occurring from day 14 and in&#xD;
      real-life situations patients are re-treated with the same first line drug, there is the need&#xD;
      to assess the role of the first line treatment as rescue treatments. This efficacy will be&#xD;
      compared to quinine + clindamycin and another ACT treatment in line with the WHO guideline,&#xD;
      and another ACT treatment to provide clear guidelines. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      re-treatment with the first line ACT treatment beyond 14 days is as efficacious as any other&#xD;
      rescue treatment, without the risk of selecting drug resistant strains. Furthermore, a&#xD;
      prolonged follow up will allow the assessment of the epidemiological, parasite related risk&#xD;
      factors for repeated malaria infection and to collect samples for immunological risk factors&#xD;
      for repeated malaria attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to show that, in children aged 12 to 59 months with recurrent uncomplicated P.&#xD;
           falciparum malaria within 42 days of treatment with an artemisinin-based combination&#xD;
           therapy (ASAQ in DRC or AL in Uganda), the PCR adjusted efficacy at 28 days after&#xD;
           re-treatment with the same artemisinin-based combination therapy is at least 90% and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to estimate the relative efficacy of re-treatment with the same artemisinin-based&#xD;
           combination compared to treatment with quinine and treatment with another&#xD;
           artemisinin-based combination therapy (ASAQ after first line AL treatment or AL after&#xD;
           first line ASAQ treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the PCR-unadjusted efficacy at 28 days of re-treatment with the same&#xD;
           artemisinin-based combination therapy and to compare it to treatment with quinine +&#xD;
           clindamycin and treatment with another artemisinin-based combination therapy (ASAQ after&#xD;
           first line AL treatment or AL after first line ASAQ treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate and compare the efficacy of AL, ASAQ and quinine + clindamycin as rescue&#xD;
           treatment for a recurrent P. falciparum malaria episode occurring 2 weeks after the&#xD;
           administration of the first line treatment, with and without PCR adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate and compare the 42 days clinical efficacy of AL (Uganda) and ASAQ (RDC) for&#xD;
           the first line treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, with and without PCR&#xD;
           adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate and compare the efficacy of the different rescue treatment regimens in terms&#xD;
           of fever clearance time, asexual parasite clearance time, gametocytaemia at day 7, 14,&#xD;
           21 and 28, and, Hemoglobin changes between day 0 and days 14 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the selection of Plasmodium falciparum pfmdr1 alleles following therapy with&#xD;
           quinine + clindamycin, AL and ASAQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess epidemiological, parasitological and host related predictors for recurrent&#xD;
           malaria infections, an adjacent study that will be developed in a separate nested study&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AL, ASAQ and quinine + clindamycin when&#xD;
      used as rescue treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DRUG TO BE TESTED Quinine Quinamax® (Sanofi) + Clindamycin Dalacin® (Pfizer): in this study&#xD;
      the investigators will use Dalacin syrup (75mg/5ml) and dry Quinamax® tablets (125mg) of whom&#xD;
      the dosage is not adapted to children below 9 kg. The latter explains why children below 12&#xD;
      months will be exclude from our study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) AL of Novartis, marketed under the trademarks Riamet® and&#xD;
      Coartem®, was registered in Switzerland in 1999, it is pre-qualified by the WHO and has since&#xD;
      received marketing authorisation in several endemic and non-endemic countries. A recent&#xD;
      review showed that the drug combination is highly efficacious against sensitive and multidrug&#xD;
      resistant falciparum malaria as it offers the advantage of rapid clearance of parasites by&#xD;
      artemether and the slower elimination of residual parasites by lumefantrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amodiaquine artesunate ASAQ is safe, easy to use and efficacious and the second most used ACT&#xD;
      worldwide. DRC, through the National Malaria Control Program has complied with the WHO&#xD;
      recommendation by recommending since 2005 ASAQ as first line treatment for uncomplicated&#xD;
      malaria. In a study conducted in 2004 in the eastern part of the country, the efficacy of&#xD;
      ASAQ was estimated at 93% after PCR adjustment. Twenty five trials (11,700 patients) carried&#xD;
      out in Sub-Saharan Africa show a PCR-adjusted efficacy at day 28 of 94%. ASAQ is currently&#xD;
      the second most used ACT globally (co formulated Co-arsucam® or ASAQ Winthrop®,&#xD;
      Sanofi-Aventis. A study has been conducted in Burkina Faso in children under 5 and has shown&#xD;
      that co-formulated ASAQ is well tolerated and its efficacy was 93% after PCR correction. The&#xD;
      investigators will use this co-formulated ASAQ Winthrop® of Sanofi-Aventis, age dosed and put&#xD;
      on the market since March 2007. This product has been pre-qualified by the WHO.&#xD;
