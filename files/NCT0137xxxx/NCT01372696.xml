  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to investigate whether polyps that look different at colonoscopy, have formed&#xD;
      via different mutations and have different risks of turning into cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laterally spreading tumours (LSTs), are polyps that have a lateral extension along the colon&#xD;
      wall with minimal vertical growth. It has become evident over the last few years that rather&#xD;
      than being a single entity requiring an accumulation of mutations, colon cancer is in fact a&#xD;
      heterogenous disease forming via multiple distinct genetic pathways. Additionally, with&#xD;
      improved endoscopic characterization, it has been noted from experience at Westmead hospital&#xD;
      that two macroscopically distinct types of LSTs, &quot;granular&quot; and &quot;non granular&quot;, have&#xD;
      different natural histories and risks of invasive cancer. It is therefore hypothesised that&#xD;
      different polyp types have different genetic abnormalities, and potentially form via distinct&#xD;
      genetic pathways, although this theory has not been widely examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This knowledge would be important in furthering our understanding of the development of&#xD;
      cancer. There is accumulating evidence that genetic abnormalities may be a better predictor&#xD;
      of cancer behaviour than histological grade. Additionally, guidelines for colonoscopy&#xD;
      surveillance are currently a one size fits all approach that do not reflect the genetic&#xD;
      heterogeneity of the disease and the knowledge that only 5% of polyps progress to cancer.&#xD;
      Genetic studies may assess future cancer risk to a person in polyps once removed and plan&#xD;
      surveillance colonoscopy frequency. This is an area with interest currently due to the&#xD;
      national bowel cancer screening programme, with obvious cost implications for decision&#xD;
      makers.&#xD;
