    <textblock>
      The study will complete up to 500 subjects across 9 clinical sites to evaluate the precision&#xD;
      and accuracy of SCOUT DS (Diabetes Screening) subjects at risk for type 2 diabetes. The study&#xD;
      will involve up to two unique Scout devices at each clinical site. Each site will initially&#xD;
      contain only a CS-1 (Commercial SCOUT 1) &quot;A&quot; for collection of data. As they become&#xD;
      available, CS-1 &quot;B&quot;s operating with latest version of SCOUT software will be shipped to each&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NSEEDS study will enroll patients at-risk for type 2 diabetes who meet the study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria (and do not meet one or more of the exclusion criteria) at approximately 9&#xD;
      clinical sites distributed across the United States. Eligible subjects must be at least 18&#xD;
      years old, not have an existing diagnosis of diabetes and, if less than 45 years old, must&#xD;
      have a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 and at least one other risk factor for type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected and a partial area under the receiver operator curve (pAUC) will&#xD;
      be computed via the method of moments between the 20% and 50% false positive rates based on&#xD;
      the first valid Scout &quot;A&quot; measurement for each patient. The impaired glucose tolerance status&#xD;
      will be determined by the average of the two hour, post challenge plasma glucose samples&#xD;
      measured at the central laboratory. This will be compared to 1000 bootstrap re-samplings of&#xD;
      the calibration data pulling a cohort that matches that collected during this study. A test&#xD;
      will be conducted to assure that the SCOUT performance lies within a 95% empirical confidence&#xD;
      interval based on the bootstrap re-sampling.&#xD;

      Serum will be stored to later analyze lipids and insulin. This will be useful in&#xD;
      understanding metabolic disorders experienced by the patients measured. These measurements&#xD;
      can be used directly, or combined in a manner similar to the McAuley index to understand the&#xD;
      risk of insulin insensitivity.&#xD;

        In the study, volunteers age 18 and above, of either sex and of any ethnic background, will&#xD;
        be recruited at up to 9 clinical sites. The number of sites may be decreased as the sponsor&#xD;
        has the right to close a site due to protocol compliance or enrollment issues during the&#xD;
        course of the study. All subjects will be at risk for diabetes based on the American&#xD;
        Diabetes Association Standard of Care Guidelines. Subjects in the 18-44 age range must have&#xD;
        a BMI &gt; 25 plus an additional risk factor for type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
