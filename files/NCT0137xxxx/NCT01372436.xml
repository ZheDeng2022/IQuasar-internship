      Main goal: Reducing social inequalities in dental health in the Alpes-Maritimes with the&#xD;
      identification of high-risk subjects in order to implement effective preventive actions&#xD;
      focused on people likely to benefit most from such actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carrying out a prospective representative cohort, in schools, over a period of 4 years has&#xD;
      the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the pattern of risk factors for tooth decay, as defined by the HAS, in the&#xD;
           representative studied sample, and particularly to assess the part played by the zone of&#xD;
           schooling (priority education area (low socio-economic) (PEA) or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate, in a representative French sample, the relevance of the caries risk (CR)&#xD;
           factors defined by the HAS based on an analysis of the foreign literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the interest of bacteriological tests using the technique of real-time PCR&#xD;
           (Cario-analysis ®, Pierre Fabre Oral Care) in the assessment of CR, once the other risk&#xD;
           factors are taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the interest of using a laser fluorescence device (Diagnodent ® Pen, Kavo)&#xD;
           compared to clinical examination alone, in the detection of caries which are difficult&#xD;
           to diagnose(approximal caries or small enamel lesions) and its impact on the caries risk&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type: prospective cohort study. Population study: This study is conducted in 360&#xD;
      primary schools and 89 high-schools in the Alpes Maritimes (randomized study). They are&#xD;
      divided into two strata (priority education area or not). Within each stratum and for each&#xD;
      level of education (primary schools and high schools), schools are chosen at random on the&#xD;
      corresponding list until the number of children needed in both the 1rst grade and the 5th&#xD;
      grade is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pupils are followed by the investigators. Subjects Number: 678 (339 in 1rst grade and 339 in&#xD;
      5th grade proportionally divided into non-PEA and PEA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of follow-up: 4 years Frequency of visits: annual visits Oral health screening -&#xD;
      clinical examination (probe and mirror) and with the new laser fluorescence device&#xD;
      (DIAGNOdent ® pen, Kavo). Salivary Tests: bacteriological in real-time PCR (Cario-analysis ®&#xD;
      Oral Care Pierre Fabre) and CRT Buffer ® Ivoclar Vivadent) Statistical analyses - Descriptive&#xD;
      analyses and logistic regression models (dependent variable is the high caries risk (when&#xD;
      CAODM36-CAODJ0 &gt; or = 4)&#xD;
