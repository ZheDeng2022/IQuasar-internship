  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On a yearly basis roughly 40.000 individuals aged 65+ contact the emergency departments in&#xD;
      Denmark as a result of an accidental fall, and in about 30% of these cases hospitalization is&#xD;
      required. The cost of these admissions vary according to the type of injury with hip&#xD;
      fractures being the most expensive accident {{113 Chrischilles,E. 1994; }}. The total average&#xD;
      cost of a severe hip fracture in the Danish healthcare system resulting in nursing home&#xD;
      placement has been estimated to approximately 365.000 Danish Kroner (Dkk) per year {{288&#xD;
      Christensen,P.M. 2005;}}. In addition, about 20 % of the elderly individuals who sustain a&#xD;
      hip fracture will die within 6 months {{200 Brot,C. 2006; }}. For the society the outcome of&#xD;
      falling in the elderly population is therefore not only associated with severe human but also&#xD;
      economical consequences. Hence, it is essential to refine, develop and think &quot;out of the box&quot;&#xD;
      when future intervention programs are designed and employed in the elderly community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such &quot;out of the box&quot; intervention could be balance training with a Nintendo Wii Fit&#xD;
      board (Nintendo Wii, Nintendo Co Ltd, Minami-ku Kyoto, Japan). The Nintendo Wii Fit board is&#xD;
      a new generation of computer game which uses 3D tracking of the participants' motion and&#xD;
      gestures. This means that the user interacts in and controls elements of the 3D gaming world&#xD;
      with their own body {{307 LaViola,J.J.,Jr 2008;}}. In the case of the Wii Fit board, it&#xD;
      detects the body sway and center of pressure (COP) of the participant and displays it onto a&#xD;
      TV screen in different balance sceneries. A virtual character on the TV then reacts according&#xD;
      to the user's movement and gesture (ex. skiing down a ski slope passing thru gates). This&#xD;
      enables the user to perform tasks that, they may not be able to execute safely or at all in&#xD;
      real-world situations. Interestingly in this context a study by Sihvonen et al from 2004&#xD;
      showed a compliance of 97,5% using the same technique as the Wii Fit only in 2D and with a&#xD;
      poor graphical display. Further, the Sihvonen-study showed that 2D &quot;biofeedback&quot; intervention&#xD;
      of only 4 weeks proved successful in terms of improved postural balance, physical activity&#xD;
      and life quality {{297 Sihvonen,S. 2004;}}. Finally, traditional methods when promoting&#xD;
      physical activity in the elderly population has been limited by lack of motivation or poor&#xD;
      compliance (REFS), which possibly has prevented the elderly from reaching a maximum&#xD;
      rehabilitation potential(REFS). Furthermore, in the follow-up period after these traditional&#xD;
      intervention studies, it has been documented how difficult it is for the elderly to sustain&#xD;
      the same training volume on themselves (REFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality systems like the Nintendo Wii Fit have been developed specifically for&#xD;
      rehabilitation of the upper- {{301 Kuttuva,M. 2006;300 Dvorkin,A.Y. 2006;}} and&#xD;
      lower-extremities and gait training {{298 Deutsch,J.E. 2007;}}. Further virtual reality&#xD;
      platforms have been use for rehabilitation and training of reaching movements {{302 Piron,L.&#xD;
      2001;}}, motor coordination {{303 Broeren,J. 2002;}}, hand strength and range of motion,&#xD;
      speed of hand movement{{304 Jack,D. 2001;305 Merians,A.S. 2002;}}. But so far most of these&#xD;
      systems have not become commercially available possible due to a very high cost {{294&#xD;
      Deutsch,J.E. 2008;}}. Moreover in some cases the virtual rehabilitation environment has to be&#xD;
      constructed from scratch making the hole process and implication very complicated {{306&#xD;
      Weiss,P.L. 2004;}}. Thus, designing an intervention program that utilizes the low-cost&#xD;
      ready-to-use Wii Fit platform could be a possible research direction to explore. At the&#xD;
      moment few studies have been conducted using the Nintendo Wii console. Among the few some&#xD;
      have investigated the energy expenditure in kids (11-17 years of age) playing Wii Sports&#xD;
      (bowling, tennis and boxing) compared to sedentary xbox games and actual bowling, tennis and&#xD;
      boxing {{ 295 Graves,L.E. 2008; 296 Graves,L. 2008; }} while others have explored the&#xD;
      Nintendo Wii console for rehabilitation of an adolescent with cerebral palsy {{294&#xD;
      Deutsch,J.E. 2008; }}.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the authors knowledge no studies have investigated the effect of 10 weeks of Nintendo Wii&#xD;
      Fit balance training in seniors (+65 years). The main purpose of the study is to investigate&#xD;
      the hypothesis: That 10 weeks of Nintendo Wii Fit balance training in a group of seniors (+65&#xD;
      years of age) have a significant effect on postural balance and muscle strength.&#xD;
