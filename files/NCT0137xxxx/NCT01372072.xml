    <textblock>
      Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a form of ventilation delivered by a mask and is an&#xD;
      important mode of treatment in patients with both acute and chronic respiratory (breathing)&#xD;
      failure. Humidification is widely accepted as an essential part of the ventilation strategy&#xD;
      in patients receiving invasive ventilation (i.e. via a tube inserted into the mouth), but its&#xD;
      role during NIV use is not proven. Consequently, there is a variation in practice with regard&#xD;
      to humidification during NIV. Humidification is important in maintaining upper and lower&#xD;
      airway mucosal function and patients requiring NIV often report symptoms, such as throat&#xD;
      dryness, due to a lack of airway humidity. Success of NIV in the acute setting is dependent&#xD;
      on many factors including, patient tolerance of NIV during the acute phase. In patients with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD), poor tolerance results in NIV failure, which&#xD;
      necessitates endotracheal intubation or treatment failure. Furthermore, invasive ventilation&#xD;
      increases the risk of a hospital acquired pneumonia, which is associated with a worse&#xD;
      outcome. In the long term setting of NIV use, again patients frequently report symptoms due&#xD;
      to drying of the airways and adherence to NIV can be highly variable. Adherence in these&#xD;
      patients is important in improving both quality and length of life. Humidification devices&#xD;
      may be technically effective, but clinicians have concerns regarding potential negative&#xD;
      effects of these devices. There is a requirement to evaluate the use of humidification in&#xD;
      both the acute and long term use of NIV, particular, in terms of patient ventilator&#xD;
      interaction, which will impact on comfort and adherence to NIV. This will effect the overall&#xD;
      effectiveness of ventilation. The investigators propose a randomised controlled trial to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of a humidification system during noninvasive ventilation.&#xD;
