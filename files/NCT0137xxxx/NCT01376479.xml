    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response of an inactivated&#xD;
      vaccine to prevent hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) caused by Enterovirus 71 (EV71).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) caused by Enterovirus 71 (EV71) can be severely&#xD;
      debilitating for some children with a risk of paralysis and death. The most susceptible age&#xD;
      group is the 1 to 5 year olds, and the disease is spread via the oral-fecal route. Currently,&#xD;
      there is no antiviral therapy nor there is a vaccine available to prevent HFMD. In this&#xD;
      study, an inactivated vaccine (INV21) based on the EV71 antigen will be evaluated in terms of&#xD;
      safety and immune response that is generated after two doses of the vaccine are given to&#xD;
      healthy adults. Safety assessments include the frequency and severity of systemic adverse&#xD;
      events as well as local reactions. Immune response will be assessed by measurement of EV71&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody levels at specified time points throughout the study.&#xD;
