      This work will use a new approach to measure how surgery effects human biochemistry and&#xD;
      metabolism. It will create a metabolic signature or 'phenotype' for surgical injury that will&#xD;
      help clinicians choose the right surgical treatments for an individual. This is because&#xD;
      metabolism is based on an individual's genes, disease burden and environmental influences&#xD;
      such as gut microbiota. This study will use a scientific method based on computational&#xD;
      analysis of spectra taken from techniques known as Mass Spectrometry (MS) and Nuclear&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This science is called 'metabonomics' and it has many&#xD;
      advantages. Firstly, it provides a measure of thousands of metabolites at a single moment in&#xD;
      time that are unique to the individual and it therefore gives a 'systems' overview of a&#xD;
      persons metabolism. Secondly it is able to process many hundreds of samples quickly. The&#xD;
      investigators are aiming to integrate the investigators metabolic data with genetic&#xD;
      information about patients or bacteria wherever possible. This will be the first time that a&#xD;
      'systems biology' approach has been used in surgery, with potentially significant gains to me&#xD;
      made in pre operative risk stratification and optimisation. By performing this analysis at&#xD;
      all stages of the surgical journey (preoperatively, during the operation and after the&#xD;
      surgery) it will ensure the right treatments are given to the right patient at the right&#xD;
      time. By creating longitudinal models of the biochemical responses to surgery, predict at a&#xD;
      much earlier stage those patients at risk of developing complications. This will improve&#xD;
      outcome after surgery. This work will use a metabonomic approach to create new tools for&#xD;
      surgeons to use during operations based on tissue biology. For example the investigators will&#xD;
      be able to measure the metabolic content of tumours in real time by measuring the biological&#xD;
      content of diathermy smoke. This has the potential to change intra-operative decision making&#xD;
      and further improve outcome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A systems perspective can improve surgical decision making both before and after surgery in&#xD;
      real time. Specifically, we hypothesize that it may provide diagnostic and prognostic&#xD;
      information of importance that is more accurate than current biochemical approaches. This is&#xD;
      because it accounts for important environmental influences on surgical outcome such as&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy and the gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypothesis is that this approach can provide real time molecular feedback to&#xD;
      the operator during surgery about tissue type and pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will therefore need to study patients having surgery under a range of different&#xD;
      conditions and states, and by varying types of surgical intervention. It is known that&#xD;
      patients with cancer for example have quite different metabolic requirements to those&#xD;
      without. This has significant implications for the development of personalized management&#xD;
      strategies for patients with cancer undergoing surgery. It is essential that this study&#xD;
      definitively proves that the technology is able to make a description between patients with&#xD;
      significantly different disease states and also that it can differentiate this from the type&#xD;
      and magnitude of the surgical procedure being performed and the timing of the surgery.&#xD;
      Therefore, this work will involve a heterogeneous patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be subject to research governance structures provided internally within the&#xD;
      department of Biosurgery and Surgical technology in conjunction with the section of&#xD;
      Biomolecular medicine for the safe use of samples and machinery. It will also possess a&#xD;
      clinical steering committee to assess the progress, clinical outcomes, safety and timely&#xD;
      completion of the work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two separate clinical groups will be recruited for this trial. The first will be those&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective procedures, the second will be those undergoing emergency&#xD;
      procedures. Each of these groups will contain subcategories of clinical conditions, upon&#xD;
      which the study will focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elective surgery (n=200):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Patients with cancer. This will include patients with malignancy of the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      and colorectal tract (including those excised by microsurgery) cancer of the breast or solid&#xD;
      tumors of the kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Patients with benign diseases of the bowel requiring surgery e.g. inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease C. Benign surgical conditions, usually operated on in a day surgery setting. These&#xD;
      will specifically be of the biliary tree (gall stones) and the anterior abdominal wall (e.g.&#xD;
      Hernia surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited if seen under the 'two week' wait rule with suspected cancer for&#xD;
      the general surgery, upper GI surgery, Breast and Urology surgery teams at St. Mary's&#xD;
      hospital in the outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending for elective inpatient surgery under the general, upper GI or breast&#xD;
      surgery teams at St. Mary's hospital, London will be recruited at the pre admission clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute surgery (n=200)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting to Accident and emergency under the care of the general surgery on call&#xD;
      team will be recruited into this study group. This study group will have the following&#xD;
      subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Acute abdominal pain, as per the previous ethical clearance B. Patients with acute sepsis&#xD;
      thought to be of surgical origin. C. Patients suffering major trauma with an Injury severity&#xD;
      score of &gt;15, multiple injuries, who require surgery or who have &gt;1 organ system that is&#xD;
      failed or who are admitted to the intensive care department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients under the age of 18 years All patients who are pregnant Patients receiving&#xD;
      Advanced Life Support by cardiopulmonary resuscitation on their arrival in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced cancer only suitable for palliative care at presentation to the&#xD;
      clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting for the first time with other known malignancies for which they are&#xD;
      receiving treatment e.g. Prostate cancer Patients already recruited into other clinical&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be broken down into two separate phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical work for biofluid analysis in elective and acute surgical admissions has already&#xD;
      been performed in both animal and human studies in Magic Angle Spinning (MAS)-1H NMR (also&#xD;
      known as solid state NMR as the tissue does not require preparation), MS, and Matrix Assisted&#xD;
      Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI)-MS. Samples from previous studies gained under ethical&#xD;
      clearance will be analyzed using these techniques for methodological optimization. This will&#xD;
      entail metabonomic and metagenomic profiling of colorectal cancer samples (Ethics Ref:&#xD;
      07/H0712/112 and 06/Q0403/16) and from samples taken from patients with acute pancreatitis&#xD;
      and the acute abdomen (Ethics Ref: 05/Q0403/201).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non essential (i.e. Benign or pathologically normal tissue) excised and due for incineration&#xD;
      taken from consenting patients during routine surgery will be collected for analysis by: Mass&#xD;
      spectrometry of smoke plumes collected from a range of electrocautery devices. This will&#xD;
      allow optimization of MS protocols and it will define the chemical parameters for normal&#xD;
      tissue and for various tissue types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Malignant tissue excised from breast, colon and upper GI cancers will be tested for its&#xD;
      capacity to detect normal and malignant disease by the use of the intelligent knife ex vivo.&#xD;
      This will be performed under the guidance of histopathologists, and it will not interfere&#xD;
      with pathological staging or treatment of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of translational software for analytical interpretation of complex biochemical&#xD;
      metadata by non scientific staff will be developed using these data. This work will use&#xD;
      current intensive care clinical databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is for the technology to be readily applicable to patients having surgery within the&#xD;
      NHS. Therefore, patients will be recruited from two surgical pathways:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Care: Patient recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited whilst in Accident and Emergency. Only patients admitted via this&#xD;
      route will be eligible for study inclusion. Patients will be provided with an information&#xD;
      sheet and the patient will be left for 30 minutes to consider the study. Consent will be&#xD;
      taken in private, by an adequately qualified and trained individual. When consented, patients&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a questionnaire to provide medical and surgical history, and&#xD;
      metabolic information that could influence results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will not be possible to gain consent in some cases as patients may be unconscious or&#xD;
      unable to consent due to injury. In these cases samples will be taken, and when the patient&#xD;
      gains consciousness and capacity formal consent will be taken. If at this stage, the patient&#xD;
      states they do not want to be included in the study their samples will be withdrawn. In the&#xD;
      event of a patient's death, the samples will be included in the study. This is because the&#xD;
      capacity of these tests to predict mortality is a primary end point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elective Care: Patient recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in the outpatient setting where ever possible to ensure that they&#xD;
      have adequate time to take on board the clinical information and to consent. We will sample&#xD;
      patients on their admission to hospital for treatment after the decision for surgery has been&#xD;
      made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected at set time points during the patient journey in both cases.&#xD;
      Samples will be obtained at the same time as standard clinical investigations to minimize&#xD;
      discomfort for the patient, and they will not be taken in excess of standard sample times&#xD;
      prevent unnecessary investigation for the patient. Sample collection will be coordinated with&#xD;
      the clinical biochemistry team at St. Mary's hospital where ever possible to prevent&#xD;
      unnecessary and time consuming sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre operation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma and urine collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. At their arrival in Accident and Emergency. Every 24 hours for the duration of their&#xD;
      admission or until surgery, discharge or treatment defined as surgical, radiological or&#xD;
      invasive therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient remains in hospital for prolonged rehabilitation or non surgical therapy,&#xD;
      samples will be taken weekly until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      First bowel motion after arrival in A+E. Preoperative and pre bowel preparation sample before&#xD;
      surgery. This will be given either in clinic or on the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that patients are sent for routine endoscopic or biopsy, samples of tissue will&#xD;
      be taken for metabonomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Intra-operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of smoke plumes by MS will be performed for each case. This will not interfere with&#xD;
      the standard operation and the operating surgeon will not be asked to make a decision based&#xD;
      on the data from the experiment. In cases of cancer resections, tissue samples will be&#xD;
      collected in keeping within the principals of oncological surgery. In the cases of breast&#xD;
      surgery, sentinel lymph nodes will also be harvested and analyzed by NMR. During colorectal&#xD;
      surgery, tissue from the mesorectum will be taken for analysis from standard collection&#xD;
      points and in upper GI cancer resections, similar principals will apply for sampling. In&#xD;
      acute or emergency situations, tissue will also be taken from areas of tissue thought to be&#xD;
      at risk of ischemia (e.g. anastomotic sites were bowel is to be joined).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool and small bowel effluent will be harvested at the time of surgery so that the effect of&#xD;
      surgery on the gut microbial ecosystem can also be accounted for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Post operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine and plasma will be sampled daily post operatively in keeping with current clinical&#xD;
      practice for the first week. Where ever possible, no extra samples will be collected beyond&#xD;
      those sampled by the clinical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples will also be collected. The first bowel motion will be collected after surgery,&#xD;
      and then each motion until the first week is completed, and then weekly after this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first motion from stoma / ileostomy: If stoma sited, daily samples will be taken for the&#xD;
      first week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly samples will then be collected until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a patient returns to theatre, the sample collection sequence will re&#xD;
      commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical data will be recorded for the duration of the patient stay. This will refer to&#xD;
      pre operative information and assessment where possible, physiological data, radiological&#xD;
      findings, clinical biochemistry, surgical and clinical outcome and length of stay. This will&#xD;
      be anonymous and coded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On discharge, patients will be bought back to clinic at 8 weeks for clinical assessment as&#xD;
      per the routine analysis. Samples of urine, blood and stool will be taken at this time.&#xD;
      Oncological patients will be followed up for five years as per the oncology protocol at St.&#xD;
      Mary's Hospital Paddington.&#xD;
