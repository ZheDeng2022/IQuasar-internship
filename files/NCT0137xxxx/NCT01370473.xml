    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create an institutional and population-based registry of&#xD;
      Hyponatremia with a prospective survey based on epidemiological data, risk factors,&#xD;
      diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, monitoring and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also describe the occurrence of hyponatremia in the population of HIBA in the&#xD;
      Central Hospital, as well as the characteristics of clinical presentation, evolution and&#xD;
      predisposing factors of hyponatremia.&#xD;

      Alterations in plasma sodium concentration (sodium ratio and solvent) are very common in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Since plasma sodium concentration is a major determinant of plasma&#xD;
      osmolality, it will determine the balance of the different body fluids compartments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyponatremia is defined as the measurement of plasma sodium below 136 mmol per liter.&#xD;
      Hyponatremia may be associated with normal tone, low or high. The pseudohyponatremia is an&#xD;
      artifact of measuring the concentration of sodium in the context of a growth in the&#xD;
      concentration of active osmoles (glucose, mannitol), which induce water movement from the&#xD;
      intracellular to extracellular. This can also occur in the context of substances that do not&#xD;
      generate osmolarity as triglycerides and plasma proteins. In the first case, the&#xD;
      investigators are in the presence of hypertonic hyponatremia, in the second case to an&#xD;
      isotonic hyponatremia, neither should be considered true hyponatremias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotonic hyponatremia is the one considered to be true. It represents the most common&#xD;
      electrolyte imbalance in hospitalized patients (2% to 22% depending on the series and the&#xD;
      cutoff points) and outpatients (7% to 18% in tertiary care center, being very dependent&#xD;
      variable and cutoffs series). It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality (18% in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients). It can be the cause of serious illness that requires immediate&#xD;
      attention or be a marker of morbidity and mortality for underlying diseases (congestive heart&#xD;
      failure, liver cirrhosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyponatremia can occur in a wide range of patients, from asymptomatic with good tolerance to&#xD;
      the critically ill. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and none is specific. They are mainly&#xD;
      neurological and generally reflect dysfunction associated with cerebral edema. They are&#xD;
      caused due to the magnitude of the alteration of plasma sodium concentration and the system&#xD;
      speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical management challenge is the identification and specific treatment of the cause,&#xD;
      understanding that the study of it brings the knowledge of its pathophysiology. The latter&#xD;
      can be grouped into a loss of sodium and / or gain of fluid. In turn, the gain of liquids is&#xD;
      possible by an alteration in kidney dilusorios mechanisms, as well as the variations that&#xD;
      according to the glomerular filtration rate and filtered sodium load. Its high prevalence and&#xD;
      potential neurologic sequelae associated with the disease and its treatment make the&#xD;
      diagnosis and appropriate treatment is mandatory. Traditionally, the initial assessment and&#xD;
      treatment are suboptimal in the descriptive series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have not found in the literature any systematic record of patients with abnormalities in&#xD;
      the sodium concentration in both inpatients and outpatients, except for a record of&#xD;
      pharmacological effects. We believe that while this is a highly prevalent disorder, is not&#xD;
      attractive to the pharmaceutical industry and this would partly explain the apparent lack of&#xD;
      studies with large groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also have not found any descriptive studies conducted in Argentina. While there are&#xD;
      multiple proposals for the evaluation of alterations in sodium, there is no standardization&#xD;
      in our single on the cleavage of specific sodium, appropriate diagnostic evaluation and&#xD;
      proposed the best treatment for hyponatremia. There are technical difficulties in the&#xD;
      standardization of the assessment of symptoms, physical examination, and the effectiveness of&#xD;
      clinical parameters to guide therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no reports of the strategy used in our country for diagnosis and decision making in&#xD;
      patients with alterations of plasma sodium concentrations. Nor Disnatremias epidemiological&#xD;
      data in our environment, risk factors, assessment and monitoring of survival, complications&#xD;
      and recurrences. We have no references in the literature that talk about the behaviour of the&#xD;
      disnatremias in the areas of inpatient and outpatient, there are no data to see whether&#xD;
      treatments aimed at the mere correction of hyponatremia, or interpretation of the&#xD;
      pathophysiological same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The systematic recording of cases of Disnatremias will reveal the characteristics of the&#xD;
      disease in our environment, the diagnostic strategies used and their results and the time&#xD;
      course of the disease. We believe that this knowledge will allow us to design studies to&#xD;
      optimize and standardize the diagnostic strategies, evaluation and treatment, resulting in a&#xD;
      benefit for the affected population.&#xD;
