      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Studies have shown that animals such as monkeys and dogs have excellent sight and touch&#xD;
      memory but perform poorly on sound memory tasks. Human brains have certain areas that are&#xD;
      important for speaking and understanding language. These areas may be involved in sound and&#xD;
      spoken word memory. Researchers want to study these areas of the brain to find out if the&#xD;
      memory for sounds requires brain structures that are usually associated with language&#xD;
      learning and are unique to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use magnetic resonance imaging to study areas of the brain involved in sound memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age. They must be native English&#xD;
      speakers and have completed high school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study requires a screening visit and 1 or 2 study visits to the National Institutes&#xD;
           of Health Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the screening visit, volunteers will have a medical history taken. They will also&#xD;
           have physical and neurological exams, and complete a questionnaire. Women of&#xD;
           childbearing age will give a urine sample. Participants who have not had a magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging (MRI) scan in the past year will have one at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second visit, participants will have tests of sound memory. They will listen to a&#xD;
           set of nonsense words spoken through earphones and memorize the words. Then they will&#xD;
           listen to the words again to judge if the words were part of the earlier list.&#xD;
           Participants will have a 1 hour break, then do the sound memory test again. During the&#xD;
           second test they will have repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which&#xD;
           stimulates different regions of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the group results from the testing sessions are positive, there will be a third&#xD;
           visit. At this visit, participants will have a sound perception test. They will listen&#xD;
           to words spoken through earphones and judge whether the words in the pair are the same&#xD;
           or different. Participants will have rTMS during these tests as well.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humans are the only animals that use language to communicate with each other. Among many&#xD;
      other requirements, humans need excellent auditory long-term memory to be able to master the&#xD;
      complicated task of learning a language. It is still not completely understood which brain&#xD;
      regions are involved in transferring auditory stimuli into long-term memory. The goal of this&#xD;
      research proposal is to examine whether brain structures that are known to be essential in&#xD;
      language production also play an important role in encoding auditory stimuli into long-term&#xD;
      memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to examine the role of&#xD;
&#xD;
      frontal and temporo-parietal cortical areas in the storage of auditory stimuli in long-term&#xD;
      memory. The whole study will comprise three experiments. Each of the three experiments will&#xD;
      consist of one to three sessions. Sessions 1 and 2 will be compulsory in every experiment.&#xD;
      Session 3 will only be required if positive results are obtained in session 2. Every&#xD;
      participant can only participate in one of the three planned experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Experiment 1, we will investigate the potential role of Broca s area in auditory memory.&#xD;
      If we find that rTMS in Broca s area interferes with performance on the memory task, we will&#xD;
      conduct a control (session 3) to determine whether or not the impairment was actually due to&#xD;
      interference with stimulus perception rather than with memory, per se. We will conduct&#xD;
      Experiment 2 to investigate the possible role of Wernicke s region in auditory memory. We&#xD;
      will conduct Experiment 3 to investigate the role of the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) in&#xD;
      auditory memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In experiment 2 and 3 we will also conduct the same control session 3, as in Experiment 1 if&#xD;
      the rTMS impairs performance on the auditory memory task. All experiments will consist of two&#xD;
      sessions and an additional, third session if rTMS-induced impairment is found. In that case&#xD;
      all participants will be called back for the control experiment. During session 1, a&#xD;
      neurological examination will be performed and a clinical, anatomical, and functional MRI&#xD;
      (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) will be taken (functional MRI for second repeat of experiment 1&#xD;
      and for experiment 3). In session 2, rTMS will be used in an attempt to temporarily disrupt&#xD;
      the function of Broca s area (experiment 1), the TPJ (experiment 2) or PMv (experiment 3)&#xD;
      while participants are performing an auditory recognition memory task. By temporarily&#xD;
      disrupting cortical functioning in those localized regions, we will be able to determine&#xD;
      whether or not their function is crucial for encoding auditory stimuli into long-term memory.&#xD;
      In the control session, to be conducted only if the experimental task yields a positive&#xD;
      result (i.e., impairment), we will test auditory perception by asking participants to make&#xD;
      same/different judgments on stimulus pairs (similar to those used in session 2) presented&#xD;
      with a very short delay while using the same rTMS routine as in session 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By amendment, we wish to expand session 1 to include functional MRI (fMRI) imaging designed&#xD;
      to identify and refine the targets for disruption by rTMS in the subsequent session: Broca s&#xD;
      area (experiment 1), and PMv (experiment 3). Specifically, we intend to (1) repeat Experiment&#xD;
      1 of the approved protocol using fMRI localization in an additional 15 subjects, and (2)&#xD;
      proceed with Experiment 3 as described in the original protocol, also with the addition of&#xD;
      fMRI localization. Initial results in experiment 1 (Broca s area) fell just short of&#xD;
      significance, possibly because anatomical landmarks are inconsistent between subjects (e.g.,&#xD;
      Amunts et al., 1999); an fMRI localizer in each subject could reduce this variability. Unlike&#xD;
      in the previous protocol, session 1 can not be skipped if the subject has had a neurological&#xD;
      exam and MRI in the past year (the exam may be skipped, but all subjects will need the fMRI).&#xD;
      The maximum number of sessions per experiment will remain unchanged at three: 1) intake exam&#xD;
      and anatomical/functional MRI, 2) rTMS, and 3) a control session only if a significant effect&#xD;
      of rTMS is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By amendment, we also wish to consider the three experiments to be independent, rather than&#xD;
      each contingent on the outcome of the previous experiment(s). As outlined below (sections&#xD;
      2.3-2.5), experimental evidence implicates all three regions in the auditory-motor network&#xD;
      under study. Preliminary evidence indicates a positive effect in experiment 2 (the TPJ), but&#xD;
      this does not render experiment 3 moot. Therefore we wish to apply fMRI-targeted rTMS to&#xD;
      Broca s area, and PMv, in independent experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In session 2, the primary outcome measure will be the number of correctly remembered auditory&#xD;
      stimuli. Secondary output will be reaction time during the recognition phase of the&#xD;
      experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control experiment (if conducted) the primary outcome measure will be the number of&#xD;
      correct same/different judgments and, again, reaction time will be the secondary measure.&#xD;
