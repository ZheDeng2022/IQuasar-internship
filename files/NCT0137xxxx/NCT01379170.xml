      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are known to promote weight loss,&#xD;
      which could be beneficial for treating obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Thyroid hormone&#xD;
      treatment stimulates energy expenditure resulting in increased body heat production, in which&#xD;
      brown adipose tissue play an important role. It is hypothesized that thyroid hormones would&#xD;
      induce increased energy expenditure via a process called mitochondrial uncoupling, thereby&#xD;
      creating an inefficient energy status. Indeed, an in vivo study showed a 70% increased flux&#xD;
      through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and an unchanged ATP synthesis rate upon T3&#xD;
      treatment in lean, healthy young men. The disproportionate increase in TCA flux compared with&#xD;
      ATP synthesis suggests increased mitochondrial uncoupling. It is however unknown whether&#xD;
      increased mitochondrial uncoupling would increase fat oxidation and exerts favorable effects&#xD;
      on insulin sensitivity. There is compelling evidence that type 2 diabetic patients have high&#xD;
      levels of fat accumulation in non-adipose tissues, such as skeletal muscle, heart and liver.&#xD;
      Ectopic fat accumulation is related to insulin resistance, however, why this fat accumulates&#xD;
      in peripheral organs is not known. Recently, studies reported compromised mitochondrial&#xD;
      oxidative capacity in type 2 diabetic patients and first-degree relatives of diabetic&#xD;
      patients, suggested to play an important role. Therefore, subjects suffering from overweight&#xD;
      and/or type 2 diabetes with overt hypothyroidism form an interesting group for examining the&#xD;
      metabolic effects of thyroid hormone treatment, as less is known about the effects of thyroid&#xD;
      hormone treatment in these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether thyroid hormone replacement therapy in type&#xD;
      2 diabetic patients suffering from overt hypothyroidism, will improve muscular mitochondrial&#xD;
      function, lower ectopic fat accumulation in muscle and liver, increase brown adipose tissue&#xD;
      activity and enhance insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetic patients diagnosed with hypothyroidism will undergo 3 months of thyroid&#xD;
      hormone replacement therapy (THRT) (Euthyrox®, Merck, Germany). Patients will be&#xD;
      metabolically characterized (such as insulin sensitivity and fat accumulation in peripheral&#xD;
      tissues) before and after this thyroid hormone replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      17 type 2 diabetic patients diagnosed with overt hypothyroidism (9 from the Netherlands, 8&#xD;
      from Germany which will only do the PET-CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid hormone-induced change in whole body insulin sensitivity (change in&#xD;
      insulin-stimulated glucose disposal) and muscle mitochondrial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid hormone-induced change of lipid content in skeletal muscle and liver and brown&#xD;
      adipose tissue activity.&#xD;

    <description>A dose of 25 μg per day of Euthyrox® will be administered orally during the first week and will be increased to 50 μg per day during the second week and to 75-100 μg per day in the third week depending on TSH, free T4 and T3 concentrations monitored throughout the treatment period. Patients will be instructed to take Euthyrox® after an overnight fast, 30 min before breakfast in the morning daily. After 3 months, free T4 and total T3 concentration must be in the normal range (free T4: 8.0-26 pmol/l, T4: 60-140 nmol/l and T3 1.2 - 3.4 nmol/l) and TSH 0.4-2.5 mU/l.</description>
