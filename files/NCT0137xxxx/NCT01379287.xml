  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iso-fludelone is a type of chemotherapy drug called an epothilone. Epothilones are drugs that&#xD;
      attach to proteins in your body called &quot;tubulins&quot;. Tubulins help cells to grow, and are found&#xD;
      in both normal and cancer cells. When research animals with cancer were given the study drug,&#xD;
      Iso-fludelone, the drug attached itself to &quot;tubulin&quot; and slowed or stopped the cancer cells&#xD;
      from growing. Other types of epothilones have been tested in cancer patients and were found&#xD;
      to be safe. A similar epothilone drug and other drugs called taxanes are currently approved&#xD;
      by the FDA for treating certain types of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see the effects, good and/or bad, of this investigational&#xD;
      drug, Iso-fludelone, on cancer. The term &quot;investigational&quot; means the study drug being tested&#xD;
      has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other&#xD;
      regulatory agencies. This study is the first time the investigators are using iso-fludelone&#xD;
      in people. This is a Phase I study. In a Phase I study, the first people to receive the drug&#xD;
      are given a fairly low dose.&#xD;
