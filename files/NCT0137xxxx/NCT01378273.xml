  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) is a promising novel neuroprotective agent. Epo&#xD;
      decreases neuronal programmed cell death resulting from brain injury; it has&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects, increases neurogenesis, and protects oligodendrocytes from injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that neonatal Epo treatment of ELGANs will decrease the combined outcome of&#xD;
      death or severe NDI from 40% to 30% (primary outcome), or the combined outcome of death plus&#xD;
      moderate or severe NDI from 60% to 40% (secondary outcome) measured at 24-26 months corrected&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether Epo decreases the combined outcome of death or NDI at 24-26 months&#xD;
           corrected age. NDI is defined as the presence of any one of the following: CP, Bayley&#xD;
           Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (Bayley-III) Cognitive Scale &lt; 70&#xD;
           (severe, 2 SD below mean) or 85 (moderate, 1 SD below mean). CP will be diagnosed and&#xD;
           classified by standardized neurologic exam, with severity classified by Gross Motor&#xD;
           Function Classification System (GMFCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether there are risks to Epo administration in ELGANs by examining, in a&#xD;
           blinded manner, Epo-related safety measures comparing infants receiving Epo with those&#xD;
           given placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test whether Epo treatment decreases serial measures of circulating inflammatory&#xD;
           mediators, and biomarkers of brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare brain structure (as measured by MRI) in Epo treatment and control groups at&#xD;
           36 weeks PMA. MRI assessments will include documentation of intraventricular hemorrhage&#xD;
           (IVH), white matter injury (WMI) and hydrocephalus (HC), volume of total and deep gray&#xD;
           matter, white matter and cerebellum, brain gyrification, and tract-based spatial&#xD;
           statistics (TBSS based on diffusion tensor imaging). As an exploratory aim, we will&#xD;
           determine which of the above MRI measurements best predict neurodevelopment (CP,&#xD;
           cognitive and motor scales) at 24-26 months corrected age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated outcomes: Early Epo treatment of ELGANs will decrease biochemical and MRI markers&#xD;
      of brain injury, will be safe, and will confer improved neurodevelopmental outcome at 24-26&#xD;
      months corrected age compared to placebo, and will provide a much-needed therapy for this&#xD;
      group of vulnerable infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, study of Epo treatment of preterm infants 24-0/7 to&#xD;
      27-6/7 weeks of gestation, beginning in the first 24 hours after birth. Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by site and gestational age at birth (&lt;26 week or 26-27-6/7). Study size sample is&#xD;
      940 patients. We expect to evaluate 752 subjects at 24-26 months corrected age, our primary&#xD;
      endpoint. There is no enrollment restriction based on gender, ethnicity or race. Enrollment&#xD;
      is expected to take 24-26 months, with each subject participating through 24-26 months&#xD;
      corrected age when neurodevelopmental outcomes are assessed. The combined outcome of death or&#xD;
      severe NDI will be compared between Epo-treated and control subjects. All outcomes will be&#xD;
      collected in a blinded manner. Subjects will be randomized by the data-coordinating center&#xD;
      (DCC) to Epo treatment or placebo, and Epo treatment will continue until 32-6/7 weeks post&#xD;
      menstrual age. Serial measurements of circulating inflammatory mediators and biomarkers of&#xD;
      brain injury will be made. A brain MRI will be done at 36 weeks post menstrual age in the&#xD;
      same subset of infants. Phone contact will occur at 4, 8, 12, and 18 months. Face to face&#xD;
      follow up will occur at 24-26 months corrected age. The primary outcome is death or severe&#xD;
      NDI at 24-26 months corrected age, with a secondary outcome of death or moderate NDI. Our&#xD;
      primary sample size calculation is based on the conservative assumptions that Epo treatment&#xD;
      will result in a 40% reduction in the severe NDI rate (the range in animal studies is 49-70%)&#xD;
      and minimal impact on death. This would yield a control group rate for the primary outcome of&#xD;
      40.4% and an expected treated rate of 31.5% thus yielding an 8.9% lower rate of Death + NDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical information including co-morbidities of extreme prematurity, information about&#xD;
      transfusions, and specific laboratory values were collected in the PENUT database.&#xD;

Cerebral palsy was classified as hemiplegia, diplegia, or quadriplegia, and severity was determined according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) (levels range from 0 [no impairment] to 5 [most severe impairment]).
