      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - One way to treat prostate cancer is to use a laser to direct extreme heat to a small area&#xD;
      of the prostate. The heat destroys tumor cells but does not affect healthy tissue. Doctors&#xD;
      want to see if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to improve this treatment. MRI&#xD;
      will be used to help locate tumor cells and guide the laser during surgery. However,&#xD;
      MRI-guided laser therapy has not been used to treat many people with prostate cancer. More&#xD;
      studies are needed to see whether it can destroy tumor cells permanently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of treating prostate tumors with laser therapy guided&#xD;
      by magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Men at least 18 years of age who have prostate cancer that can be seen with an MRI and has&#xD;
      not spread to other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have blood tests and imaging studies, and will complete questionnaires about their&#xD;
           health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the MRI-guided laser treatment in the hospital. The doctor will&#xD;
           use the MRI to control how much energy is delivered by the laser and how much tissue is&#xD;
           destroyed. The entire procedure usually takes from 1.5 to 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the treatment, participants will have a catheter put in to keep the bladder&#xD;
           emptied. The catheter will stay in for 1 to 7 days. Drugs to prevent infection and&#xD;
           bladder spasms will be given. Participants will leave the hospital once they are well&#xD;
           enough to go home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have followup visits 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after the&#xD;
           therapy. They will have physical exams, and blood and urine tests. They will also answer&#xD;
           questionnaires. Participants will have MRI scans 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after the&#xD;
           therapy. They will have a prostate biopsy to see if there is any tumor every 12 months&#xD;
           for the first 2 years. Another biopsy may be done in the third year.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pilot study is designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of thermal laser ablation&#xD;
           of focal prostate tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate cancer is relatively slow growing, with doubling times for local tumors&#xD;
           estimated at 2 to 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some prostate cancers prove to be small, low grade, and noninvasive and they appear to&#xD;
           pose little risk to the life or health of the host. Recent patient series suggest that&#xD;
           20% to 30% of men undergoing radical prostatectomy have pathologic features in the&#xD;
           radical prostatectomy specimen consistent with an insignificant or indolent cancer which&#xD;
           poses little threat to life or health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We propose that patients with low volume and low grade disease can be best served with&#xD;
           focal ablation of the visible prostate cancer without the side effects of urinary&#xD;
           incontinence and erectile dysfunction associated with radiation therapy or radical&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine feasibility and safety of magnetic resonance image-guided focal laser ablation&#xD;
      of biopsy confirmed and MR visible prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Greater than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organ confined prostate cancer, observed on MR, and confirmed by Transrectal biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative workup as dictated by the NCCN.org prostate cancer guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSA &lt; 15 ng or PSA density &lt; 0.15 ng/ml in patients with a PSA &gt; 15 ng&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pilot study, testing feasibility, safety and tolerability of thermal ablation of focal&#xD;
           prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is anticipated that 15 patients will be accrued for this study&#xD;
