      open-label, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, crossover study with incomplete wash-out to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of a high-fat, high calorie meal on the single dose PK of GSK1120212 in&#xD;
      subjects with solid tumors. Subjects will be assigned to a fast/fed sequence according to the&#xD;
      randomization code provided to the sites by GSK with subjects randomized to one of 2 possible&#xD;
      treatment sequences (Table 1) with each sequence consisting of 2 treatments: a single 2.0 mg&#xD;
      dose of GSK1120212 administered under fasted conditions and a single 2.0 mg dose of&#xD;
      GSK1120212 administered with a high-fat, high-calorie meal&#xD;
