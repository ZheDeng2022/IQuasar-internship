  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of platelet&#xD;
      rich plasma in the treatment of photoaged skin. This study will be divided into two parts.&#xD;
      The first part will assess the safety and tolerability of platelet rich plasma injections as&#xD;
      compared to sterile saline injections in subjects' arm with six months follow-up. The second&#xD;
      part will assess the effect of platelet rich plasma on the appearance of facial skin in a&#xD;
      split face study with platelet rich plasma injections on one side of the face and sterile&#xD;
      saline on the other. Outcomes will be recorded for twelve months.&#xD;

    <measure>Primary Outcome Study Part 1: Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measures will be the evaluation of safety and tolerability, which will be assessed by collection of adverse events throughout the feasibility study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary Outcome Study Part 2: Change in Photoaging scores from Baseline at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment visit, 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Photoaging scores will be recorded for each cheek by two blinded dermatologists at the treatment visit (before treatment)and during the 2 week, 3 month, and 6 month post-treatment visits. Individual scores for each variable (fine lines, mottled pigmentation, roughness, and sallowness) will be recorded by the blinded dermatologists.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Outcome of Study Part 1: Histologic analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcomes measures will involve the dermatopathologic review of the 2 skin biopsies taken from each subject at the one month post-treatment visit. One 3mm biopsy will be taken from the skin where the saline was injected and the other from the site of PRP injection. These will be reviewed by the dermatopathologists in the Department of Dermatology for significant histological changes, including collagen remodeling and possible reduction in photodamage. Histologic stains will include hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Outcome Study Part 2: Self-Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A subject self-assessment of each cheek will be performed at the 3 and 6 month follow up visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Outcome Study Part 2: Subject Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A subject overall satisfaction questionnaire will be performed at the 6 month follow up visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Outcome Study Part 2: Rate of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be recorded at each time point, if they occur. Statitical analysis will determine the rate of any adverse events between PRP and Saline.</description>
