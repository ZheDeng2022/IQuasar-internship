  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the relationship between performance of patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia and relationship with perceived quality of sleep. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      are: to establish the prevalence of schizophrenic patients reporting sleep disturbances; to&#xD;
      assess the potential epidemiological risk factors associated with the perceived impairment of&#xD;
      quality of sleep; to establish the relationship between the clinical condition and the&#xD;
      quality of sleep perceived; to assess the performance level of patients.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, cross-sectional, epidemiological study in the daily clinical practice&#xD;
      on the relationship between personal and social functionality and quality of sleep perceived&#xD;
      in outpatients with schizophrenia. It is proposed to perform a simple screening for detecting&#xD;
      schizophrenic patients reporting sleep disturbances. These patients will be assessed in a&#xD;
      single visit and will be administered a number of quality of life and functional assessment&#xD;
      scales. N/A&#xD;
