  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of sirolimus-based&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen in patients following living donor liver transplantation for&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma exceeding Milan criteria with respect to recurrence-free survival.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Milan criteria were adopted in most of western countries for deceased donor allocation&#xD;
      because they identify a subgroup of candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for whom&#xD;
      transplant results are similar to those in patients transplanted for end- stage liver disease&#xD;
      without HCC. There is a debate involving expanding the indications beyond the Milan criteria&#xD;
      in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Some transplant surgeons argue that despite the&#xD;
      poorer results, LDLT for advanced HCC may be justified, since donors voluntarily accept the&#xD;
      risks of donor hepatectomy to dedicate a graft for HCC patients, who may otherwise have no&#xD;
      effective treatment. Especially, in Korea where living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is&#xD;
      commonly performed, the expansion of Milan criteria is inevitable. Sirolimus is a macrolide&#xD;
      antibiotic produced by Streptomyces hygroscopic that has demonstrated potent&#xD;
      immunosuppressive activity in a number of studies. The efficacy of sirolimus as&#xD;
      immunosuppressives has been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials in kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. The use of sirolimus in liver transplantation is rapidly increasing from the&#xD;
      standpoint of reducing the conventional calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. Sirolimus emerged as&#xD;
      an effective alternative for patients with renal insufficiency related to calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitor toxicity. In recent studies, no differences have been observed with respect to&#xD;
      rejection or major complications.The use of sirolimus in transplant patients is associated&#xD;
      with a dose-dependent increase in serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require&#xD;
      treatment. In recent studies in liver transplant recipients using sirolimus as part of a&#xD;
      primary immunosuppressive regimen, the occurrence of acute cellular rejection is relatively&#xD;
      low. There is data suggesting that sirolimus is associated with hepatic artery thrombosis.&#xD;
      Numerous current studies have shown that sirolimus may have inhibitory effects on the&#xD;
      development of cancer. Immunosuppressive agent with antineoplastic activity is inherently&#xD;
      attractive in the setting of liver transplantation for HCC. If sirolimus shows some degree of&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect in transplant recipients with advanced HCC, the indication of LDLT for&#xD;
      advanced HCC can be expanded.Our hypothesis is that sirolimus based-regimen will improve the&#xD;
      HCC recurrence free survival. If sirolimus-based protocol shows better recurrence free&#xD;
      survival, the indication of LDLT for HCC can be expanded. LDLT can be one of the best&#xD;
      treatment modalities for advanced HCC. The patients with advanced HCC can have benefit by&#xD;
      liver transplantation.&#xD;
