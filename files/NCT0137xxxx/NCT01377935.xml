    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of hospitalization for acute kidney&#xD;
      injury among patients with type 2 diabetes who are new initiators of Saxagliptin and those&#xD;
      who are new initiators of other oral antidiabetic drugs in classes other than Dipeptidyl&#xD;
      peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors.&#xD;

      Prospectively designed retrospective database study. This study will be conducted using&#xD;
      administrative claims data and electronic medical records that are collected as part of&#xD;
      routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospectively-designed database cohort study comparing hospitalizations for&#xD;
      acute kidney injury among new initiators of Saxagliptin compared to those who are new&#xD;
      initiators of OADs in classes other than DPP4 inhibitors. The study time frame will be from&#xD;
      2009 through 2014.&#xD;

        This study will carried out using databases containing administrative claims data [&#xD;
        HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) and Medicare in the U.S.] and electronic&#xD;
        medical records [ General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and The Health Improvement&#xD;
        Network (THIN) in the UK]. The US population includes patients from health plans in the&#xD;
        northeast, southeastern, mid-Atlantic, central, mid-western, and western regions (HIRD) as&#xD;
        well as US citizens 65 years of age and older (Medicare). The UK population includes&#xD;
        patients seeking medical care from general practitioners (GPRD and THIN).&#xD;
