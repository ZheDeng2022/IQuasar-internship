  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young children who are overweight or at risk for overweight are at increased risk for&#xD;
      becoming obese as young adults and developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. To&#xD;
      date, there have been no interdisciplinary interventions that targeted predominantly ethnic&#xD;
      minority low-income children and parents and taught them to work together to improve&#xD;
      nutrition and exercise. Using a two-group, repeated measures experimental design, this&#xD;
      proposed study will test a 12-week intensive intervention on nutrition, exercise and coping&#xD;
      skills (Phase I) and 9 months of continued monthly contact (Phase II) to help overweight 2nd,&#xD;
      3rd, and 4th grade children and their parents improve self-efficacy, health behaviors, weight&#xD;
      status, and adiposity. The study will take this intervention to the community in which&#xD;
      children and parents live, working with four schools in Alamance-Burlington County, NC, and&#xD;
      four schools in Wilson County in the early evening. A total of 356 Black, Hispanic, and White&#xD;
      children with a BMI &gt;85th percentile and 356 parents with a BMI &gt;25 kg/m2 will be inducted&#xD;
      over 3 Â½ years and randomized by school to either the experimental or control group. Data&#xD;
      will be collected at Time 1 (Baseline), Time 2 (Post Phase I-Intensive Intervention), Time 3&#xD;
      (Post Phase II-Continued Contact), and Time 4 (6-Month Follow-Up). Data collected will&#xD;
      include scores on the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II in the parents; eating&#xD;
      self-efficacy in the children (CATCH) and parents (Eating Self-Efficacy Scale) and exercise&#xD;
      self-efficacy in the children (CATCH) and parents (Exercise Self-Efficacy); health behaviors&#xD;
      in the children and parents (3 Day 24-Hour Food Recall and 4 Day Accelerometry Measurement);&#xD;
      weight status in the children (BMI percentile) and parents (BMI); and adiposity in the&#xD;
      children and parents (waist circumference and triceps and subscapular skinfolds). Data&#xD;
      analysis will use general linear mixed models to test the hypotheses. Decreasing overweight&#xD;
      in children and parents is urgently needed, and helping children and parents to work together&#xD;
      to improve their nutrition and exercise patterns by making small lifestyle pattern changes&#xD;
      may decrease future health care costs and decrease morbidity and mortality. The knowledge to&#xD;
      be gained from this study may provide a foundation for extending this intervention to other&#xD;
      Black, Hispanic, and White children and parents in other communities to assist them to manage&#xD;
      their weight.&#xD;
