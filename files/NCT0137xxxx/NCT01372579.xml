  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving eribulin mesylate and carboplatin together before&#xD;
      surgery works in treating patients with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal&#xD;
      tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) at the time of definitive&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determination of the clinical response rate, as measured by clinical exam and imaging&#xD;
      studies prior to initiation of therapy and prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Measurement of alpha B-crystalline in tissue obtained before initiation of therapy and at&#xD;
      the time of definitive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Stem cell markers (cluster of differentiation [CD]44+, CD24-, CD133, aldehyde&#xD;
      dehydrogenase 1 [ALDH1] and evaluation of the NOTCH pathway) in tissue obtained before&#xD;
      initiation of therapy and at the time of definitive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Measurement of proliferation markers (Ki67) before and after treatment in tissue obtained&#xD;
      before imitation of therapy and at the time of definitive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Measurement of beta III tubulin in tissue obtained before initiation of therapy and at the&#xD;
      time of definitive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Measurement of Tau in tissue obtained before initiation of therapy and at the time of&#xD;
      definitive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Safety evaluation, including following of patients for alopecia and neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) staining before and after treatment in tissue&#xD;
      obtained before initiation of therapy and at the time of definitive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes and carboplatin IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.&#xD;
