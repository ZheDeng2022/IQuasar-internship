      This is a prospective, randomized study conducted in patients undergoing coronary&#xD;
      revascularization procedures (PCI) through angioplasty. All patients who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be randomized to receive, before the procedure, an oral aspirin reload (325 mg)&#xD;
      and to be re-evaluated at 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 6 hours, 48 hours, 5 and 30 day, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      Study population will be composed of 60 patients with a native coronary chronic occlusion&#xD;
      with a vessel diameter equal or superior to 3 mm. The vessels must be treated through a&#xD;
      balloon angioplasty and must be completely covered with two stent maximum with a maximum&#xD;
      length ≤ 33 mm each. The native coronary chronic occlusion is defined as a native coronary&#xD;
      obstruction, if established from at least 30 days, without lumen continuity and a&#xD;
      &quot;Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction&quot; (TIMI) flow grade equal or superior to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient must be treated with an chronic (at least 7 days) oral 100 mg/die aspirin treatment.&#xD;
      After the eligibility criteria confirmation, the patient will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to receive the aspirin reload or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary angiographies will be evaluated by the centralized laboratory with the Coronary&#xD;
      Quantitative Angiography method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial necrosis indexes, ejection fraction, TIMI frame count (TFC) and myocardial blush&#xD;
      grade (MBG) variations will represent the short term primary end-points. Clinical events&#xD;
      incidence, including death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization and stent&#xD;
      thrombosis, will be evaluated at 1, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design In every patient will be performed a baseline blood sample collection to&#xD;
      evaluate inflammation, platelet activation and oxidative stress indexes. After baseline&#xD;
      collection of blood samples, computer-generated random sequence were used for randomization&#xD;
      to an oral aspirin reload administration or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient, as guidelines described, will receive an oral clopidogrel reload (300 mg) that&#xD;
      will be turned to 75 mg/die oral administration for the next 6 months. After procedure, the&#xD;
      patient will turn back to the chronic aspirin 100 mg/die oral treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a percutaneous access will be obtained, it will be administered a 5000 U unfractioned&#xD;
      heparin bolus, treating the dose to obtain a clotting time equal or superior to 250 seconds&#xD;
      during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A basal angiography will be performed in at least two orthogonal adjoining projections using&#xD;
      a diagnostic 6F catheter. Every angiograms must include at least 2 cm catheter length to&#xD;
      allow accurate quantitative coronary angiographic evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target lesion will be crossed by a 0,0014&quot; metallic guide and a single&#xD;
      proper-dimensions-balloon predilatation will be performed inflating a nominal pression to the&#xD;
      balloon for 15 seconds long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1 minute from the dilatation will be implanted a sirolimus eluting stent (SES; Cypher ™,&#xD;
      Cordis, Johnson&amp; Johnson). Stent deployment will be obtained by an high pressure 10 seconds&#xD;
      balloon inflate (more than 15 atm) without any second dilatation. No direct stent&#xD;
      implantation will be realized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TFC and MBG will be evaluated before and after the procedure. At 60 and 120 minutes and at 6&#xD;
      hours after the procedure a blood sample collection will be performed to evaluate the same&#xD;
      baseline indexes. After 48 hours, 5 and 30 day ejection fraction will be re-evaluated. Every&#xD;
      3 months, for 12 months at least, patient will receive an ambulatorial follow up to recognize&#xD;
      the new ischemic symptoms or instrumental signs onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations Previous observations reported that after revascularization&#xD;
      procedure has been observed a 35% plasmatic thromboxane levels increase (in vivo platelet&#xD;
      activation index) in patients receiving chronic aspirin treatment (7 days). Hypothesizing&#xD;
      that the oral aspirin reload could produce a 25% absolute reduction in plasmatic thromboxane&#xD;
      levels (10%) this study needs a 50 patients for every treatment arm sample size (1-beta=90%;&#xD;
      alfa=5%).&#xD;
