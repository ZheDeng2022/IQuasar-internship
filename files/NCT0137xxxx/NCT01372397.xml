        Patients who are obese with heart failure and will undergo gastric bypass surgery or who&#xD;
        have already had gastric bypass surgery.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will have obesity and have a BMI &gt; 35kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be between the ages of 35 and 65 years, in order to limit the&#xD;
             confounding affect of age on our endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To determine if potential subjects meet these criteria, they will:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. be interviewed,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. their clinical charts reviewed, by the research study coordinator and/or the PI, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. undergo a history and physical by a physician (Study Day 2). Subjects who are to&#xD;
             undergo gastric bypass surgery will be in the intervention arm. They will be matched&#xD;
             with control subjects. We will attempt to have no more than one control subject for&#xD;
             each gastric surgery subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a condition that may masquerade as diastolic heart failure will be&#xD;
             excluded (see Research and Design).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are &lt; 35 or &gt; 65 years, &gt; 400lbs (the weight limit of the MRI table) not&#xD;
             obese, unstable, not able to lie flat for the imaging studies, not ambulatory, unable&#xD;
             to give informed consent, pregnant, lactating, with atrial flutter or fibrillation,&#xD;
             current smokers, or who will undergo a different type of bariatric surgery (not&#xD;
             Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) will be excluded from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who have evidence of other major systemic diseases (e.g., cancer, significant&#xD;
             lung disease, creatinine &gt; 2.0mg/dL, hemoglobin &lt; 10g/dL, and liver function tests&#xD;
             twice the normal range) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have &gt; class I hypertension will be excluded. The investigators will&#xD;
             exclude patients with an LV ejection fraction &lt; 45% and those with significant&#xD;
             pulmonary hypertension (peak artery pressure &gt; 55mmHg).&#xD;
