      Introduction and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound care is a major clinical challenge and presents an enormous burden to health care&#xD;
      worldwide. As wounds (chronic and acute) heal, a number of key biological changes occur at&#xD;
      the wound site at the tissue and cellular level. Among these are inflammation, reformation of&#xD;
      the epidermal barrier, and remodeling of the connective tissue in the dermis. However, a&#xD;
      common major complication arising during the wound healing process, which can range from days&#xD;
      to months, is bacterial infection. This can result in a serious impediment to the healing&#xD;
      process and lead to significant complications, especially in chronic non-healing wounds.&#xD;
      Currently, the standard wound care includes monitoring for possible infection by direct&#xD;
      visual inspection under white light and by taking samples for analysis in the laboratory&#xD;
      which takes approximately two days to provide a result. However, qualitative visual&#xD;
      assessment only provides a gross view of the wound site (i.e., presence of purulent material&#xD;
      and crusting) but does not provide the critically important information about underlying&#xD;
      changes that are occurring at the tissue and cellular level (i.e., infection, matrix&#xD;
      remodeling, inflammation, and necrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All chronic wounds contain bacteria. But whether the wound is in bacterial balance&#xD;
      (contamination with organisms on the surface or colonization with organisms in the tissue&#xD;
      arranged in micro colonies without causing damage) or bacterial imbalance (critical&#xD;
      colonization and infection) is of primary importance to healing. It is important to note that&#xD;
      there is a continuum of bacterial presence proÂ¬gressing from bacterial balance to bacterial&#xD;
      damage in a chronic wound. The diagnosis of infection is typically made clinically based on&#xD;
      signs and symptoms in and around the local wound bed, the deeper structures, and the&#xD;
      surrounding skin. The presence and severity of bacterial infection is typically diagnosed&#xD;
      based on the clinical appearance of the wound under white light (i.e., pain, purulent&#xD;
      exudate, crusting, swelling, erythema, heat). A major problem is that bacterial contamination&#xD;
      within and around a wound cannot be determined directly by visualization of the bacteria&#xD;
      themselves under white light, but is based on clinical signs and symptoms caused by bacterial&#xD;
      contamination and/or infection within the wound (i.e., pain, purulent exudate, crusting,&#xD;
      swelling, erythema, heat).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remodeling and healing of connective tissues in wounds involves simultaneous synthesis&#xD;
      and degradation of collagen fibrils. These bacteria include common species typically found at&#xD;
      wound sites (i.e., Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas species). Bacterial swabs are collected at&#xD;
      the time of wound examination and have the advantage of providing identification of specific&#xD;
      bacterial/microbial species and quantification of bacterial burden. However, often, multiple&#xD;
      swabs are collected randomly from the wound site and these are not targeted, and some&#xD;
      swabbing techniques may spread the microorganisms around with the wound during the collection&#xD;
      process, thus affecting patient healing time and morbidity. This may be a problem especially&#xD;
      with large chronic (non-healing) wounds where the detection yield for bacterial presence is&#xD;
      suboptimal, despite the collection of multiple swabs. Furthermore, bacteriological culture&#xD;
      results often take about 2-4 days to come back from the laboratory, thus significantly&#xD;
      delaying diagnosis and treatment. Thus, bacterial swabs do not provide real-time detection of&#xD;
      infectious status of wounds. In addition, although wound swabbing appears to be&#xD;
      straightforward, it can lead to inappropriate treatment, patient morbidity and increased&#xD;
      hospital stays if not performed correctly. An image-based method that allows real-time&#xD;
      monitoring of wound healing, particularly early dermal connective tissue remodeling, and the&#xD;
      presence of bacterial contamination and/or infection over time could have a significant&#xD;
      clinical impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autofluorescence imaging has been used in gastroenterology to image both collagen and&#xD;
      bacterial fluorescence in clinical studies. We wish to expand the use of tissue&#xD;
      autofluorescence imaging technology to wound care and management in order to provide obtain&#xD;
      biologically relevant information of the wound site at the tissue and biomolecular levels in&#xD;
      real-time during the healing process. When used to assess wounds, tissue autofluorescence may&#xD;
      aid in determining the degree of wound healing and the presence of bacterial infection. In&#xD;
      preliminary preclinical testing, we have discovered that when wounds are illuminated a&#xD;
      specific wavelength combination of excitation light, endogenous tissue components emit a&#xD;
      characteristic fluorescent signal, while bacteria emit a unique fluorescence signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently developed an innovative optical molecular imaging platform based on&#xD;
      high-resolution fluorescence and white-light technologies in a hand-held, real-time,&#xD;
      high-resolution, non-invasive (e.g. non-contact) format. This invention offers real-time&#xD;
      detection of important biological and molecular information of a wound for the first time,&#xD;
      and could have significant impact on improving conventional wound care and management. Based&#xD;
      on extensive preclinical testing, the proposed technology has the capability of collecting&#xD;
      autofluorescence images of wounds and detecting the presence and relative changes in&#xD;
      connective tissue content and biodistribution involved in wound healing. It can also detect&#xD;
      the earliest indication of bacterial/microorganism contamination within the wound (that are&#xD;
      occult to standard white light visually-based assessment), thus providing a measure of&#xD;
      infection status. This could significantly impact clinical wound care and management by i)&#xD;
      reducing the complications associated with missed detection of bacteria infection, ii)&#xD;
      facilitating image-guided swabbing/biopsy and iii) monitor wound healing over time.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the compact and portable design of the imaging device platform makes it ideal&#xD;
      for the clinical wound care environment as well as for point-of-care use for home-health care&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the use and effectiveness of our&#xD;
      'handheld' fluorescence digital imaging device platform for real-time non-invasive clinical&#xD;
      monitoring of chronic wounds for healing and bacterial contamination/infectious status over&#xD;
      time. This will enable us to determine if the device can detect and longitudinally track&#xD;
      intrinsic changes that may occur during the wound healing process including, but not limited&#xD;
      to, collagen re-modeling and bacterial infection of the wound site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary objective, we wish to obtain valuable end-user data on the clinical utility of&#xD;
      the device within the wound clinic environment. This information will be used to optimize&#xD;
      subsequent versions of the device during product development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most importantly, we hope to conclusively verify the added value that this imaging device&#xD;
      brings to traditional wound care practice, and to what extent it will change the gold&#xD;
      standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if the fluorescence imaging device can detect changes in connective tissue&#xD;
           over time that can be correlated with wound healing or re-modeling, compared with&#xD;
           changes in wound size over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effectiveness of the fluorescence imaging device in detecting the&#xD;
           presence (or contamination) of bacteria in and around a wound (including infection),&#xD;
           compared with standard best practice methods (e.g. white light visualization and&#xD;
           clinical signs and symptoms, with swabbing and bacteriology as the 'gold standard').&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify the relationships between autofluorescence imaging of tissues and bacteria&#xD;
           in wounds (including the wound margin) and the following: i) clinical signs of&#xD;
           infection, ii) microbial load (i.e., number of organisms per gram of wound tissue), and&#xD;
           iii) diversity of microbial species in the wound (i.e., number of different species&#xD;
           isolated per wound), and Gram signing.&#xD;
