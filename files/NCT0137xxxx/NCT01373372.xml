    <textblock>
      Chronic abdominal pain is the most common persistent pain condition in children and&#xD;
      adolescents, affecting 10-15% of children at any given time. One of the most often diagnosed&#xD;
      types of abdominal pain is functional dyspepsia (FD). FD is an abdominal pain or discomfort&#xD;
      (e.g., nausea, bloating) in the upper abdomen that does not get better by going to the&#xD;
      bathroom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some people it appears that stress can make FD worse. In adults, stress can cause the&#xD;
      release of a hormone called corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). The release of CRH can&#xD;
      cause abdominal pain by affecting how fast things move through a person's stomach and&#xD;
      intestines. This makes the organs in the abdomen more sensitive to pain, causing tenderness&#xD;
      of the inside lining of the stomach and intestines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different people react differently when the body releases CRH. Some people have abdominal&#xD;
      pain without feeling any stress or anxiety while other people who have a lot of stress or&#xD;
      anxiety don't have any abdominal pain. Some people have neither stress, anxiety, or abdominal&#xD;
      pain when CRH is released into the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to see how the bodies of children with functional dyspepsia and those without&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia react to CRH, we will do a CRH stimulation test. A CRH stimulation test&#xD;
      is routinely done in endocrine patients. It is not routinely done for patients with&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia or for patients who do not have functional dyspepsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of the CRH stimulation test is giving a synthetic type of corticotropin, Acthrel® (brand&#xD;
      name for Corticorelin), as injection. Acthrel® has been approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to see if there are differences in how the bodies of&#xD;
      children with functional dyspepsia react to CRH versus children who don't have functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being in this study involves one clinic visit where an IV placed and a CRH stimulation test.&#xD;
      In this test the child will be given an injection of CRH and then observed for one hour.&#xD;
      During that hour the child will have five blood draws through the IV and will be asked&#xD;
      questions about their anxiety and abdominal pain. This visit will take about 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following things will happen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your child will be asked to come to the clinic between 8a.m. and 10a.m. fasting. This&#xD;
           means your child will have had nothing to eat or drink for 8 hours before coming to the&#xD;
           clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your child is a female ten years of age or older, or has started having periods, a&#xD;
           urine pregnancy test will be done before receiving the CRH infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You and your child will each be asked to complete a survey that measures your child's&#xD;
           anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your child will have a biofeedback session that will measure your child's stress. In a&#xD;
           biofeedback session, sensors are placed on your child's fingers, wrists and forehead.&#xD;
           These sensors are connected to a computer that monitors your child's heartbeat, skin&#xD;
           temperature and electrical pulses on your child's skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your child will have an IV inserted into a vein in his/her arm. Your child may have a&#xD;
           cream put on their arm to help with the pain of the IV insertion. The IV will be used to&#xD;
           inject the CRH and draw blood. If the IV stops working and blood samples can no longer&#xD;
           be drawn from it, your child may have another IV started or blood samples may be drawn&#xD;
           by needle stick.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your child will then have 30 minutes to relax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your child will then have CRH infused through the IV over one minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your child will have blood drawn through the IV five times; right before the CRH&#xD;
           stimulation test begins and 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after the CRH infusion. The total&#xD;
           amount of blood drawn for the study will be about 2 ½ tablespoons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your child will be asked about their abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, stress and&#xD;
           anxiety at three separate times during the 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your child's heart rate will be measured throughout the CRH stimulation test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate whether there are differences in CRH&#xD;
      (Corticotropin Releasing Hormone) responsiveness in children and adolescents with FD&#xD;
      (Functional Dyspepsia) as compared to controls. Further, we intend to explore relationships&#xD;
      between CRH responsiveness, inflammatory cytokines, state and trait anxiety, and&#xD;
      self-reported symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if changes in serum cytokine profiles, heart rate variability, stress&#xD;
           profile parameters, state and trait anxiety, and self-reported symptoms differ between&#xD;
           patients with FD and controls following CRH infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if changes in serum ACTH (Adreno-corticotropic Hormone) or cortisol&#xD;
           following CRH infusion differ between patients with FD and controls or as a function of&#xD;
           the magnitude of state or trait anxiety among FD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-site pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical response to CRH stimulation will be explored for each of the cytokines, mediators&#xD;
      and hormones detailed herein by calculating their rate of formation, maximal concentration&#xD;
      (Cmax), time to maximal concentration (Tmax), total body exposure (AUC) and rate of recovery&#xD;
      (as relevant). Pharmacokinetic analyses will be applied to data where there are clear&#xD;
      ascending and descending phases on the concentration versus time profile. Concentration&#xD;
      versus time data will be curve fit using a peeling algorithm to generate initial&#xD;
      polyexponential parameter estimates. Final estimates of the apparent rate of recovery will be&#xD;
      determined from an iterative, nonlinear weighted least squares regression algorithm.&#xD;
      Assessment of goodness of fit for the pharmacokinetic model will be made using standard&#xD;
      criteria (e.g., Akaike and Schwartz Information Criteria, objective function and the&#xD;
      coefficients of variation for estimated parameters), the distribution of weighted residual&#xD;
      estimates and the association between the observed and predicted concentrations.&#xD;
      Model-independent pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using standard (i.e.,&#xD;
      statistical moment theory) techniques. Individual Cmax and Tmax will be estimated by&#xD;
      inspection of the observed plasma concentration versus time data. The area under the plasma&#xD;
      concentration versus time curve will be determined using the mixed log-linear trapezoidal&#xD;
      rule (no extrapolation of the AUC to infinity will be performed). These analyses will be&#xD;
      performed in Kinetica v5.0 (ThermoElectron, Philadelphia, PA). Differences between cases and&#xD;
      controls on continuous response variables will be compared using a two-sided independent&#xD;
      sample t-tests. Relationships among continuous response variables will be evaluated by&#xD;
      univariate analysis of variance, linear and nonlinear regression techniques. Categorical&#xD;
      patient factors and response variables will be compared with the Fisher's exact test on a 2 x&#xD;
      2 cross-tabulation. All statistical analyses will be conducted using the SSPS software&#xD;
      package (version 15.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 12 for each group (controls and FD patients) was chosen. Twelve patients per&#xD;
      group provides 99% power to detect a 1.5-fold greater ACTH secretion in FD patients as&#xD;
      compared to controls with the standard deviation assumed to be 20% based on 2 previous adult&#xD;
      studies (both of which detected approximately a 2-fold increase). Power may be lower for&#xD;
      secondary analysis, however, this is considered acceptable given the pilot nature of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two groups consisting of subjects who have been seen in the Abdominal Pain&#xD;
      Clinic for abdominal pain of at least 8 weeks duration and fulfilling symptom-based criteria&#xD;
      for FD and are scheduled for endoscopy and controls, who have no recent history of abdominal&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will undergo the same tests/procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fast for a minimum of 8 hours prior to the evaluation, which will begin&#xD;
      between 8 and 10 AM. Female participants &gt; 10 years of age will be given a UCG as standard&#xD;
      practice before receiving any medication or drug. The parent and child will complete the&#xD;
      BASC-2 and the state and trait versions of the STICSA-C. A biofeedback stress profile will be&#xD;
      performed. Next, an IV catheter will be placed and the participant will be allowed to relax&#xD;
      for 30 minutes prior to the next part of the study. The participant then will undergo 30&#xD;
      minute baseline monitoring of heart rate prior to the CRH stimulation test. Following the 30&#xD;
      minute baseline period, a blood sample will be obtained for serum cytokines, ACTH, cortisol,&#xD;
      and CBG. The participant will rate the severity of abdominal pain, nausea, and bloating,&#xD;
      respectively, on 10-point scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the CRH stimulation test, corticorelin (an analogue of human CRH) will be administered at&#xD;
      a dose of 1 mcg per kg body weight (to a maximum of 100mcg) delivered over 1 minute. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be obtained at 15 minute intervals for 60 minutes for determination of ACTH,&#xD;
      cortisol, and CBG concentrations. The following will be obtained or recorded at 15, 30, and&#xD;
      60 minutes: blood samples for cytokine concentrations, ratings (on a 10-point scale) of&#xD;
      abdominal pain, nausea, and bloating, stress profile parameters, and self-reported state&#xD;
      anxiety (i.e. STICSA-C Your Mood at this Moment). Heart rate monitoring will be conducted for&#xD;
      the duration of the 60 minute period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRH stimulation test is a routinely used diagnostic test in Endocrine. It is not,&#xD;
      however, routine for either of the two groups of participants in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Heart rate variability (HRV)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The electrocardiogram will be recorded and HRV assessed utilizing an I-330 C2&#xD;
           Physiograph (J &amp; J Engineering, Poulsbo, WA) and Window USE Physiolab software. MC-5SGW&#xD;
           electrode cables will be used to connect to 2 wrist electrodes (+ on left) and an EDR&#xD;
           ground which will be placed on a finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The HRV signal will be derived from the ECG data. Overall power spectral analysis will&#xD;
           be applied to the HRV signal to extract the sympathovagal parameters: power in low&#xD;
           frequency (LF) and power in high frequency (HF). LF is defined as the area under the&#xD;
           curve in the frequency range of 0.04-0.15 Hz and HF is defined as the area under the&#xD;
           curve in the frequency range of 0.15-0.50 Hz. The power in the LF band (0.04-0.15 Hz)&#xD;
           represents mainly sympathetic activity and power in the HF band (0.15-0.5 Hz) of the HRV&#xD;
           power spectrum represents purely parasympathetic or vagal activity. The LF-to-HF ratio&#xD;
           will also be calculated as a measure of sympathovagal balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stress Profile&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biofeedback stress profile readings will be recorded with a single I-330 C2 Physiograph&#xD;
           (J &amp; J Engineering, Poulsbo, WA), utilizing Windows USE 3 Physiolab software.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following modalities will be monitored on all patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Surface Electromyograph (sEMG)- readings will be measured in microvolts (mcv) using&#xD;
                wide band placement on the frontalis; after standard skin preparation pre-gelled&#xD;
                silver/silver chloride Red Dot patch sensors will placed a finger's width above&#xD;
                each eyebrow, and attached to an MV-1L sEMG cable via CL 50 alligator clips. sEMG&#xD;
                sensors also will be placed on the pulse points on both wrists to monitor and&#xD;
                feedback heart beat.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Peripheral skin temperature (TEMP)- will be measured in degrees Fahrenheit (F.) via&#xD;
                a thermistor (RV-5 TEMP/EDR sensor) attached to the pad of the participant's middle&#xD;
                finger (or substitute 3rd digit) on the dominant hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Electrodermal Response (EDR)- skin conductance activity (SCA) will be measured in&#xD;
                microohms (µohm) by an (RV-5 TEMP/EDR sensor) attached to the dominant index finger&#xD;
                by an SE 35 EDG 8mm snap style silver/silver chloride disc imbedded in a Velcro&#xD;
                fastener with saline based gel on the disk, to ensure skin contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Plasma Proteins (cytokines/ mediators/ hormones)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Approximately 39 mL of blood will be collected through the IV catheter for plasma&#xD;
           protein determinations including TNF-α, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, eotaxin-3, MCP-1, MMP-9, ECP,&#xD;
           MBP, cortisol, ACTH and CBG. Plasma proteins will be measured by commercially available&#xD;
           immunoassay kits. Table 1 presents a breakdown of the amount of blood that will be&#xD;
           collected per each time-point. Table 2 presents sample requirements and testing&#xD;
           laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Free Plasma Cortisol&#xD;
&#xD;
           Free plasma cortisol will be calculated using the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
           U = √ Z2 + 0.0122 C - Z(mean)M Where U = molar concentration of unbound cortisol, C =&#xD;
           molar concentration of total cortisol, T= molar concentration of CBG, and Z = 0.0167 +&#xD;
           0.182 (T-C)(mean) M&#xD;
&#xD;
           (0.0167 and 0.182 are constants for the affinity of CBG for cortisol at 37 degrees C and&#xD;
           the proportion of albumin-bound to unbound cortisol, respectively.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. BASC-2 Profile The parent and child versions of the Behavioral Assessment Scale for&#xD;
           Children - Second Edition (BASC-2) will be completed by the participant and one parent,&#xD;
           respectively. The BASC-2 is an objective rating system of psychological functioning in&#xD;
           youth that provides standardized descriptions of problems and competencies. There are&#xD;
           different versions for children (ages 8-11), adolescents (ages 12-18), and parents&#xD;
           (different version for those with children ages 6-11 and 12 -18). (36) Raw scores are&#xD;
           standardized as T-scores (M=50, SD=10) based on a normative sample of 3,483 children&#xD;
           aged 4 - 18 stratified according to US Census data. Individual subscales have good&#xD;
           reliability (internal consistency), with the exception of the Atypicality subscale on&#xD;
           the BASC-PRS and the Somatization and Self-Reliance subscales on the BASC-SRS (r&lt; .70).&#xD;
           The BASC has also demonstrated criterion-related and construct validity. The T-scores&#xD;
           for the anxiety subscales (parent- and self-report) will be used as a measure of trait&#xD;
           anxiety for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STICSA-C&#xD;
&#xD;
           The State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety, Child Version (STICSA-C)&#xD;
           was adapted from the adult version of the measure, the STICSA. (37) The STICSA-C is&#xD;
           comprised of two separate self-report scales, each with 21 items, for measuring two&#xD;
           distinct anxiety concepts: state anxiety and trait anxiety. The latter asks children to&#xD;
           respond to items by indicating how they feel, in general; the former asks children to&#xD;
           respond about how they feel right now, at this very moment. Unique to the STICSA-C,&#xD;
           items on each scale distinctly and stably assess cognitive and somatic manifestations of&#xD;
           anxiety. Children are asked to provide their responses using a 4-point scale (i.e., from&#xD;
           &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Almost always&quot; on the Trait form, and from &quot;Not at all&quot; to Very much&quot; on the&#xD;
           State form). The somatic and cognitive subscales of the STICSA-C trait scale will be&#xD;
           used as a measure of trait anxiety, while these subscales of the state scale will be&#xD;
           used as a measure of state anxiety, in the statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. GI symptom severity&#xD;
&#xD;
           Symptom severity will be determined for pain, nausea, and bloating, respectively, on 10&#xD;
           point scales with 0=none and 10=most severe with the Global Response Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Histology&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those who undergo endoscopy, routine biopsies obtained as part of usual care will be&#xD;
      evaluated in a blinded fashion for eosinophil density. Immunohistochemistry evaluation of&#xD;
      tissue will be performed utilizing anti-tryptase and anti-CD4. Cell densities for&#xD;
      eosinophils, tryptase-positive cells, and CD4-positive cells, respectively, will be&#xD;
      determined for specimens from the gastric antrum and the duodenal bulb, respectively. A&#xD;
      minimum of five high power fields will be evaluated with the determination of mean and peak&#xD;
      cell counts, respectively. Pathologic diagnoses will be determined by pathologist evaluation&#xD;
      as part of routine care.&#xD;
