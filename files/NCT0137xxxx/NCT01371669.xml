    <textblock>
      In the investigators study, and regarding results of small cohorts in the literature, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that hypoxemia is frequent in IPAH and CPEPH. The investigators&#xD;
      will explore these patients with a one night polysomnography and transcutaneous capnography,&#xD;
      searching for hypoxemia and hypercapnia and by determining its physiopathologic mechanisms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare and severe disease of young adults, characterized by a&#xD;
      progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistances leading to cardiac failure and death.&#xD;
      Patients with PH are categorized in two major groups: primary PH (PPH) wich is idiopathic,&#xD;
      and secondary PH associated with many conditions such as chronic pulmonary embolic diseases&#xD;
      (CPED).Increase in vascular resistance in PH is secondary to vasoconstriction and to a&#xD;
      proliferative remodeling process of the arterial wall leading to obliteration of the small&#xD;
      arterioles. On the other hand, hypoxemia is known to cause similar changes in vascular&#xD;
      architecture. Also, some small cohorts study in the literature mentioned an increase of sleep&#xD;
      hypoxemia prevalence accounting for almost 70% of cases. The mechanisms of this hypoxemia are&#xD;
      completely unknown.Our study is observational, prospective and transversal, searching for&#xD;
      hypoxemic respiratory sleep disorders (HRSD) in PPH and in CPEPH. Included patients will have&#xD;
      one night polysomnography (CIDELEC) with a continuous measurement of transcutaneous PCO2.The&#xD;
      major objectives are to determine the prevalence of HRSD, their physiopathologic mechanisms&#xD;
      and their possible causal factors according to PH history, clinical findings and hemodynamic&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;

        Patients with IPAH or CPEPH hospitalized in our pulmonary department for a standard&#xD;
        follow-up. They have to be in a stable condition, as defined by the New York Heart&#xD;
        Association classes for dyspnea and the six minutes walking test. Furthermore, no changes&#xD;
        in medical therapy could have been made during the last three months.&#xD;
