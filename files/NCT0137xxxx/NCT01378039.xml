  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) are common diseases, which tend to&#xD;
      even increase in many countries. Both from a clinical and a pathophysiological point of view,&#xD;
      this is an important issue. However, an understanding of the relationship between the complex&#xD;
      array of cells and mediators involved in asthma and COPD is not yet fully dissected which&#xD;
      makes difficult to find a specific and sensitive panel of biomarkers that can reflect&#xD;
      intensity of these pathological processes and can help to predict the individual outcome.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the patterns of pathophysiology and genetic predisposition of COPD and asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate patients that respond to corticosteroids and those who do not&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the inflammatory markers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  of COPD and asthma patients before and after treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  of COPD and asthma patients that respond to inhaled glucocorticoids and those who do not&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  of nonsmokers and smokers asthma patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify a small set of markers that can be used to predict corticosteroid-treatment&#xD;
      response in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate epigenetic factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare gene mutation and polymorphism between study groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the relationship between genetic predisposition and pathophysiology, clinical&#xD;
      symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the relationship between patterns of pathophysiology and clinical symptoms, lung&#xD;
      function, quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.&#xD;
