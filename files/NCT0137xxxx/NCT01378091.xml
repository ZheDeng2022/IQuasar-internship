      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of daily lenalidomide and docetaxel given&#xD;
      every three weeks and prednisone, as combination therapy to subjects with androgen&#xD;
      independent prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety profile of the combination of daily lenalidomide and every three week&#xD;
      docetaxel and prednisone when given to subjects with androgen independent prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the anti-tumor activity of the combination of daily lenalidomide and every 3 week&#xD;
      docetaxel and prednisone when given to subjects with androgen independent prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. There is&#xD;
      medication available to help treat this disease, which typically lengthens life by 10 to 12&#xD;
      months. More recent studies have shown average survivals of 20 to 23 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope that the experimental (research) drug called lenalidomide (Revlimid®),&#xD;
      which is being used in this study, will lengthen the lives of these patients by even more&#xD;
      time. A different drug in the same drug family has demonstrated activity against a variety of&#xD;
      solid tumors as well as hematological malignances. It works against cancer in different ways&#xD;
      than chemotherapy by affecting the immune system (the body's ability to naturally fight&#xD;
      disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the study drug helps build up patients' immune systems than&#xD;
      some of the other popular drugs on the market, and may potentially increase survival rates&#xD;
      for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years at the time of signing informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological documentation of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographic or clinical evidence of measurable or evaluable androgen independent&#xD;
             prostate cancer stages D1 or D2.&#xD;

             castration, the patient must have a serum testosterone level of &lt;50 ng/dl/. The&#xD;
             patient should maintain treatment with LH RH antagonists or agonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have metastatic prostate cancer unresponsive or refractory to androgen&#xD;
             blockade by one or more of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression of unidimensionally measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression of non measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rising PSA (absolute value of PSA &gt; 5 mg/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rising PSA is defined as at least 2 consecutive rises in PSA to be documented&#xD;

                  taken at least 7 days after the reference value. A third confirmatory PSA is&#xD;
                  required, and it must be obtained at least seven days after the second measure.&#xD;
                  If the third measure does not confirm the rise in PSA, a fourth PSA measure is&#xD;
                  required to be taken to confirm the rise over the second measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who were treated with antiandrogens such as flutamide, or other hormonal&#xD;
             agents such as estrogens, or ketoconazole must have been stopped for at least 28 days&#xD;
             prior to enrollment. In the case of nilandron and bicalutamide, treatment with these&#xD;
             agents must have stopped at least 42 days prior to treatment. If the patient is being&#xD;
             treated with corticosteroids, the dose should be stable for 14 days prior to study&#xD;
             entry&#xD;
&#xD;

             exposure. See Appendix V: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and&#xD;
             Acceptable Birth Control Methods, AND also Appendix VI: Education and Counseling&#xD;
             Guidance Document.&#xD;
