    <textblock>
      Skin cancer is the most common cancer in Caucasians. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most&#xD;
      frequent skin cancer with around 44.000 new tumours per year in the Netherlands, and its&#xD;
      incidence is still rising. Prior to treatment, a punch biopsy (PB) is taken from the&#xD;
      suspected lesion, in order to determine the subtype of BCC. There are three different&#xD;
      histological subtypes of BCC, from least to most aggressive: superficial, nodular and&#xD;
      aggressive. Based on the most aggressive subtype seen in the PB, a suitable surgical margin&#xD;
      is chosen. Surgical excision (SE) is the treatment of first choice in all BCC subtypes&#xD;
      according to the Dutch guidelines. Recent developments of non-invasive therapies for&#xD;
      superficial BCC might be the first choice of treatment in the future. These non-invasive&#xD;
      treatments (photodynamic therapy (PDT), Imiquimod and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)) have better&#xD;
      cosmetic results than SE and are therefore also used in the Maastricht University Medical&#xD;
      Center. Drawback is a higher recurrence rate than SE. As nodular and aggressive subtypes grow&#xD;
      deeper into the dermis, they have to be treated with SE with a 3 mm and 5 mm margin&#xD;
      respectively. If BCC are located in the H-zone, the treatment will be Mohs micrographic&#xD;
      surgery (MMS). Unfortunately, 30% of subtypes seen in the PB do not correspond with the&#xD;
      subtype seen in the subsequent SE/MMS. The consequence is overtreatment and undertreatment. A&#xD;
      potential better or equal way to determine the BCC subtype might be the clinical diagnosis.&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there is no literature about the diagnostic value of the clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      to determine the subtype of BCC seen in the SE/MMS specimen. We want to confirm the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the clinical diagnosis is as good as, or even better than the histological&#xD;
      diagnosis by PB to determine the BCC subtype in the subsequent SE/MMS. In this case, patients&#xD;
      don't have to undergo an extra procedure, diagnostic route is shortened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Primary objective: to establish the observed agreement of clinical diagnosis compared to&#xD;
      histological diagnosis by to determine the most aggressive subtype of BCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Secondary objectives: inter-observer and intra-observer variability of dermatologists and&#xD;
      pathologists to determine subtype BCC.&#xD;

      - Basal cell carcinoma throughout the world:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer, with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) being the most&#xD;
      frequent form of all skin cancers, and the incidence is still rising without future signs of&#xD;
      a plateau. Because there is no national registry for BCC in the Netherlands, incidence rates&#xD;
      are derived from the only register centre in the southern part of our country. From a recent&#xD;
      study we know that approximately 26.625 new patients with BCCs occurred in 2006 in the&#xD;
      Netherlands. The average number of BCC per patient is 1.65, resulting in 44.000 new BCCs in&#xD;
      that year. With an increase of approximately 10% per year the estimated incidence rate at&#xD;
      2011 will be around 70.800 in the Netherlands. Three important histopathologic subtypes of&#xD;
      BCC can be distinguished, namely superficial, nodular and aggressive. In the past, nodular&#xD;
      basal cell carcinoma (nBCC) was the most common histopathologic subtype, but superficial&#xD;
      basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) and aggressive basal cell carcinoma (aBCC) are the subtypes with&#xD;
      the fastest growing incidences. Nowadays, the distribution of histopathologic subtypes of BCC&#xD;
      is 40.6% nodular, 30.7% superficial and 28.7% aggressive. The shift from nodular BCCs to&#xD;
      other subtypes needs accurate detection of the correct subtype, as treatment per subtype is&#xD;
      different. The sharp raising incidence of 10% annually makes BCC an even bigger health&#xD;
      problem in the near future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Diagnosis of BCC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCC is diagnosed with a 3 mm punch biopsy (PB) of the suspected skin lesion. Based on the&#xD;
      most aggressive histopathologic subtype seen in this biopsy, an appropriate treatment is&#xD;
      chosen. Three subtypes are relevant for a suitable treatment choice: superficial, nodular and&#xD;
      aggressive. The last one includes all BCCs with aggressive growth, such as&#xD;
      infiltrative/morpheaform BCC, micronodular BCC, and BCC with squamous differentiation.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, 31-33% of histopathologic subtypes seen on punch biopsies of primary and&#xD;
      recurrent BCCs do not correspond with the subtype seen in the subsequent surgical excision&#xD;
      (SE)/ Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). The consequence is overtreatment and undertreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Guidelines on the treatment of basal cell carcinoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The national advisory board of Dutch dermatologists and plastic surgeons has published&#xD;
      multidisciplinary guidelines on the treatment of BCCs in 2007. In these guidelines the&#xD;
      different treatment options for all sort of BCCs are discussed and conclusions are drawn for&#xD;
      each treatment option. Recommended treatments for all BCCs regardless of the&#xD;
      histopathological subtype is SE. Both sBCC and nBCC have to be excised with 3 mm margin while&#xD;
      aggressive subtypes need a 5 mm margin. BCCs in the H-zone will be excised with MMS.&#xD;
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT), Imiquimod and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are also options for sBCC on&#xD;
      low-risk sites because of better cosmetic results.Recent studies show overall estimated&#xD;
      treatment success at 5-year follow-up of 65% for PDT and 78-80% for Imiquimod. These&#xD;
      percentages are far lower than the 99% overall estimated treatment success of SE in sBCC.&#xD;
      There is no literature on treatment effect of 5-FU at long term follow-up. Only two studies&#xD;
      report 86-87% complete response rate to different 5-FU treatment regimens after 6-12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Treatment of basal cell carcinoma at the Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, BCC has been a disease of the elderly patient but as a consequence of&#xD;
      recreational sun exposure and tanning beds, more young patients develop a skin cancer as&#xD;
      well. Therefore, cosmetic results play a more important role when choosing a suitable&#xD;
      treatment. Therefore in today's dermatologic practice at the MUMC patients with a sBCC can be&#xD;
      treated non-invasively with PDT, Imiquimod, 5-FU or with SE/MMS. These non-invasive&#xD;
      treatments show good cosmetic results but higher recurrence rates than SE. Any non-responding&#xD;
      or recurrent sBCC has to be retreated with SE/MMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Undertreatment and overtreatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from our own study show that in case of a discrepancy between&#xD;
      histopathologic BCC subtype in the PB and excision, 58% of patients are overtreated and 42%&#xD;
      undertreated. Half of the overtreated patients will have a histological nBCC or aBCC on PB,&#xD;
      but only superficial in the SE/MMS. This could be partly due to the fact that the most&#xD;
      suspected part has already been biopsied and is not present in surgical excision anymore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overtreatment consists of unnecessary tissue loss because of too wide SE margins. In&#xD;
      addition, large excisions might lead to more complications like scarring, infection,&#xD;
      continued or subsequent bleeding and dehiscent wounds. Undertreated patients have to be&#xD;
      re-treated again in case of positive resection margins with SE, resulting in extra stress for&#xD;
      patients, time and health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Clinical diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological diagnosis of BCC subtype by PB might not be the perfect procedure because of the&#xD;
      30% mismatch with the subtype seen in the SE/MMS. A potential better way to determine the BCC&#xD;
      subtype might be the clinical diagnosis. To our knowledge, there is no literature about the&#xD;
      observed agreement of the clinical diagnosis to determine the most aggressive histological&#xD;
      subtype of BCC. We want to confirm the hypothesis that the clinical diagnosis is as good as&#xD;
      or even better than the histological diagnosis by PB to determine the most aggressive BCC&#xD;
      subtype. Confirmation of this hypothesis will result in clinical diagnosis instead of punch&#xD;
      biopsies, more patients receiving early and correct treatment, saving time and health care&#xD;
      costs. The conclusions from the proposed study can serve as a basis for updating guidelines&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of BCC.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Punch biopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>Punch biopsy is a 10 minutes treatment at the outpatient department of dermatology. Patient will lie down on a bed, the skin will be disinfected and local anaesthesia (lidocaine 1% with epinephrine) will be given, which is briefly painful. Then a PB of 3 mm is taken from the most suspected area. In the case of continuing bleeding the wound will be sutured. A properly taken biopsy will leave no or minimal scarring, but this is not relevant since a SE will be performed afterwards. In very rare cases post-biopsy bleeding or infection occurs.</description>

    <intervention_name>Surgical excision</intervention_name>
    <description>Surgical excision takes place in 30 minutes. Patient will lie down on a bed, the skin will be disinfected and local anaesthesia will be given. sBCC and nBCC will be excised with a 3 mm margin, aBCC with a 5 mm margin. Most BCC can be surgically excised, but some have to be treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). MMS ensures total BCC removal, preserving as much surrounding skin with 100% margin control. All BCCs will be excised with a 2 mm margin and examined under the microscope. This will totally take 1.5-2.0 hours. If tumour is still present, another tissue layer with 2 mm margin will be excised. It usually takes removal of 1-3 tissue layers to complete MMS.&#xD;
After both treatments, wounds will be sutured and removed after 1-2 weeks, depending on the localisation. Within the first two weeks posttreatment, patients have to avoid physical heavy movements and keep the suture dry. Possible complications: scarring, continuous or subsequent bleeding, infection and dehiscent wounds.</description>
