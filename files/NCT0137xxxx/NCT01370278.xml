    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the effects of sodium bicarbonate to&#xD;
      normal saline when used for clearing mucus blockage in patients with airway stents.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Study Agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium bicarbonate is also called baking soda. In this study it will be mixed with water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal saline is a salt water solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a&#xD;
      coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. The study doctor will use either sodium bicarbonate or normal&#xD;
      saline during your bronchoscopy to clear mucus from your stent:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, the study doctor will use sodium bicarbonate. The amount of&#xD;
           sodium bicarbonate in the solution will be the same for all patients in Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, the study doctor will use normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have an equal chance of being assigned to either group. Neither you nor the study&#xD;
      staff can choose the group you will be in, and neither you nor your doctor will know if you&#xD;
      are receiving sodium bicarbonate or normal saline. However, if needed for your safety, the&#xD;
      study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have more than 1 stent, only 1 of your stents will be checked for clearance of mucus&#xD;
      in this study. However, all stents will be cleared of mucus if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of your standard of care, you will have photographs and videos taken before and after&#xD;
      your bronchoscopy. You will sign a separate consent form for your bronchoscopy. Your complete&#xD;
      medical history will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the bronchoscopy, you will be given drugs to help you relax, and then a local anesthetic&#xD;
      will be sprayed into your nose and throat to numb those areas. A slim, flexible tube with a&#xD;
      light will be placed through your nose or mouth and into your airway tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, a small amount of sodium bicarbonate will be sprayed into your&#xD;
      stent/airway tubes and then suctioned out through the bronchoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, a small amount of normal saline will be sprayed into your stent/airway&#xD;
      tubes and then suctioned out through the bronchoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, 3 study doctors will check how well the mucus in your stent was cleared. If the study&#xD;
      doctors think not enough mucus has been cleared from your stent, you will &quot;crossover&quot; into&#xD;
      the other study group and receive the other agent to clear your mucus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about 7 days, and then again 30 days after your bronchoscopy, you will come to the clinic&#xD;
      for a follow-up visit. The following procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood&#xD;
           pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also be asked about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Normal saline and sodium bicarbonate are agents used in&#xD;
      bronchoscopies performed in patients with airway stents as standard of care. The comparison&#xD;
      of sodium bicarbonate to normal saline to clear mucus from airway stents is considered&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
