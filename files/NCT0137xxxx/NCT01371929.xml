  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that the plasma inducible nitric oxide synthase&#xD;
      (iNOS) assay (PliNOSa® test) has an acceptable relative risk ratio for predicting the onset&#xD;
      of sepsis within 72 hours of testing when performed on the first day a patient is admitted or&#xD;
      transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is considered to be at risk of becoming&#xD;
      septic. The PliNOSa® test measures inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in plasma and uses&#xD;
      a pre-determined iNOS cut-off value to identify patients at risk for the onset of the sepsis&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, an accurate and definitive clinical test to predict early the onset of the sepsis&#xD;
      pathology does not exist. At least 7 million people per year enter into the early stages of&#xD;
      the sepsis pathology, which will lead to more than 250,000 deaths per year in the USA and&#xD;
      more than 750,000 worldwide. An early, accurate, and reliable test that can assess an&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) patient's risk of becoming septic would be a major medical&#xD;
      breakthrough. A large unmet clinical laboratory need exists for a test that can aid&#xD;
      physicians in assessing their patient's risk for the onset of the sepsis pathology. The&#xD;
      current culture procedures suffer from a number of problems. (1) They are slow. The first&#xD;
      answer is obtained only after 24 hours of culture, and an absolute answer requires a minimum&#xD;
      of 48 hours of culture. (2) Blood culture only yields positive results (i.e. sepsis is&#xD;
      present) in approximately 28% of patients who become septic, thus over 70% of the patients do&#xD;
      not yield positive blood cultures. Everyone in the sepsis field agrees that better IVD tests&#xD;
      for the sepsis pathology are desperately needed. Our PliNOSa IVD test based upon the presence&#xD;
      of iNOS in plasma should identify those patients as being at risk for developing sepsis since&#xD;
      our assay is not dependent upon the culturing of live bacteria or other micro-organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis develops from a variety of bacterial and fungal sources stemming from the patient's&#xD;
      inability to fight infection, and is commonly acquired while recovering from severe injuries&#xD;
      and surgery in hospitals. An early, accurate, and reliable clinical diagnostics test for the&#xD;
      onset of sepsis currently does not exist, but an enormous clinical laboratory need does&#xD;
      exist. In January 2008, Levenson reviewed the current status of the clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      sepsis and concluded [1] that none of the currently FDA cleared risk-assessment tests work&#xD;
      well and [2] that new biomarkers specific for the sepsis pathology would be a major medical&#xD;
      breakthrough. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science estimated&#xD;
      the cost to the US healthcare system to be $17 - 29 billion annually. The presence in plasma&#xD;
      of a normally intracellular protein, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), has been found&#xD;
      to be an early and accurate biomarker for the onset of the sepsis pathology. Data gathered&#xD;
      using our in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test to analyze more than 1,200 blood samples collected&#xD;
      during our clinical studies on 350 study subjects (295 ICU patients and 55 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers) demonstrated that iNOS is present only in plasma samples obtained from people&#xD;
      suffering from the onset of sepsis. In our three clinical studies, the latter two of which&#xD;
      were partially funded by the NIH, our candidate IVD test for plasma iNOS was found to predict&#xD;
      the onset of sepsis 24 - 72 hours before the appearance of the physiological symptoms of the&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The superiority of plasma iNOS as compared to other potential biochemical markers of SIRS&#xD;
      (pre-sepsis) and sepsis was assessed using the data from our third clinical study. Four&#xD;
      cohorts from this study were analyzed for the plasma levels for four potential biomarkers of&#xD;
      the sepsis pathology: iNOS, procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor-alpha (TNFα). The four cohorts are (1) 36 normal healthy individuals as Group A; (2)&#xD;
      critically injured patients who remained SIRS and septic negative throughout the entire study&#xD;
      period as Group B; (3) critically ill patients who became septic during the study period,&#xD;
      with their plasma levels 24 hours before the symptoms of sepsis were recognized by the&#xD;
      attending doctors as Group C; and (4) confirmed septic patients who were enrolled in our&#xD;
      study and had not received antibiotics prior to their enrollment as Group D. Only plasma iNOS&#xD;
      was found to differentiate between non-septic critically ill patients (Group B) and the&#xD;
      critically ill patients who were developing sepsis (Group C) or were already septic (Group&#xD;
      D). The plasma level of procalcitonin, one of the FDA cleared IVD tests, was not specific for&#xD;
      sepsis since a number of normal healthy volunteers and many of the non-SIRS and non-septic&#xD;
      patients had elevated plasma levels of procalcitonin (PCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize, infections in intensive care units and other hospital settings can be caused by&#xD;
      different types of organisms, such as bacteria and fungi. These infections annually cause&#xD;
      more than 7,000,000 cases of SIRS (pre-sepsis) that can deteriorate to sepsis, severe sepsis&#xD;
      with organ dysfunction, and septic shock with multiple organ failure. To date, three clinical&#xD;
      studies have been conducted on this project in which 295 ICU patients and 55 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers have been enrolled and studied. The data obtained during these prior clinical&#xD;
      studies clearly demonstrate that a measurable increase in the plasma level of iNOS occurs&#xD;
      during the onset of the sepsis pathology. The main focus of this research proposal is to&#xD;
      gather the data needed to obtain FDA clearance to market our new PliNOSa® test by&#xD;
      demonstrating in a statistically significant number of critically ill ICU patients that the&#xD;
      presence of iNOS in plasma is a reliable early biomarker as a risk assessment aid for the&#xD;
      onset of sepsis.&#xD;
