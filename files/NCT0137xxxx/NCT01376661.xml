  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to prospectively monitor the outcome associated&#xD;
      with men who meet the eligibility criteria for low risk prostate cancer and elected to&#xD;
      participate in the active surveillance program at The Center for Cancer Prevention and&#xD;
      Treatment at St. Joseph Hospital. We hope to demonstrate that men who are compliant with a&#xD;
      closely monitored active surveillance program for low risk prostate cancer will achieve&#xD;
      favorable outcomes by: 1) avoiding the side effects of definitive therapy that may not be&#xD;
      necessary; 2) retaining quality of life (QOL) and normal activities; 3) avoiding unnecessary&#xD;
      treatment; and 4) decreased health care costs. In addition, we will monitor the possible&#xD;
      adverse outcomes that may be associated with the active surveillance program including&#xD;
      suboptimal response and/or greater side effects due to delayed initiation of therapy;&#xD;
      psychological impact on the patients and caregivers due to anxiety of living with an&#xD;
      untreated cancer and/or the requirement for frequent medical examination and periodic&#xD;
      prostate biopsies.&#xD;
