  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls and their consequences are among the major problems in the medical care of older&#xD;
      individuals. The long-term goal of this research is to establish the efficacy of a&#xD;
      scientifically grounded and mechanism-based therapeutic intervention for improving balance&#xD;
      function and preventing falls in older people. When human balance is challenged, protective&#xD;
      stepping is a vital strategy for preventing a fall during activities of daily life. Many&#xD;
      older people at risk for falls have particular difficulties with successfully stepping&#xD;
      sideways as a protective response to loss of balance in the lateral direction. We propose&#xD;
      that age-related declines in lateral balance function through impaired protective stepping&#xD;
      that precipitates falls, result from neuromechanical (NM) limitations in hip&#xD;
      abductor-adductor (AB-AD) muscle strength (torque and power). Moreover, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      these functional and NM impairments are reversible with combined high intensity induced step&#xD;
      training (IST) and muscle strengthening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls and their consequences are among the major problems in the medical care of older&#xD;
      individuals. Some 30 percent of community dwelling people aged 65 years and older, and over&#xD;
      50 percent of those living in institutions fall each year. Among older adults, complications&#xD;
      of falls are the leading cause of deaths due to injury and are the most common cause of&#xD;
      nonfatal injuries and hospitalization for trauma. The total lifetime healthcare cost of&#xD;
      fall-related injuries for the elderly have been projected to reach $85 billion by the year&#xD;
      2020. Even in the absence of injury due to falling, the tendency to lose balance among the&#xD;
      elderly commonly results in an overall reduction in the level of physical activity, and to a&#xD;
      decreased ability to satisfactorily function in social roles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the contributions of multiple risk factors to age-related falls (e.g., environmental&#xD;
      hazards, orthostatic hypotension, disorientation, sedation), it is well recognized that those&#xD;
      who fall present greater impairments in neuromechanical (NM) factors than do older&#xD;
      non-fallers. Aging changes in balance and gait associated with NM impairments have also been&#xD;
      consistently found to be among the most important risk factors for falls. What is presently&#xD;
      unresolved, however, is which among the age-associated NM impairments, altered balance and&#xD;
      mobility functions are best associated with falls and responsive to interventions (training).&#xD;
