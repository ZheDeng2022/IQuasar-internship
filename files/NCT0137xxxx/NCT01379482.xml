      The aims of this study are to investigate whether multimodal treatment of peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis from gastric cancer is feasible and to evaluate the clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy followed by cytoreductive surgery&#xD;
      + hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy + early postoperative intraperitoneal&#xD;
      chemotherapy, as compared to systemic chemotherapy only, in patients with peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis from gastric cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between January 2005 and March 2009, 18 consecutive patients with PC from gastric cancer were&#xD;
      scheduled for neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy followed by CRS+HIPEC+EPIC at Uppsala&#xD;
      University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. The regional ethics committee approved the study and&#xD;
      informed consent was obtained from each patient and the study was registered in&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov, with identifier NCT01379482. The eligibility requirements for treatment&#xD;
      were: histologically confirmed diagnosis of primary gastric adenocarcinoma; histologically&#xD;
      and radiologically confirmed PC diagnosis; no distant metastases; adequate renal,&#xD;
      haematopoietic and liver functions, and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of &gt; 70. Table 1&#xD;
      summarises demographic and basic clinical patient data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Eighteen patients (eight female and ten male), with a median age of 57 years (range&#xD;
      38-74), were included in the study. Treatment began with three months' (range 2-4.5)&#xD;
      neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Four weeks after receiving the last course of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, patients with no clinical and radiological signs of tumour progression&#xD;
      underwent laparotomy in preparation for CRS+HIPEC followed by EPIC for five days. Patients&#xD;
      with clinical and radiological signs of tumour progression during the neoadjuvant systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy did not undergo the planned loco-regional treatment but continued with&#xD;
      palliative systemic chemotherapy at the discretion of the physician in charge of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy The intention was to treat the patients with combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy for three months. The choice of chemotherapy was individualised, but all&#xD;
      patients received optimal drug combinations suitable for good performance patients with&#xD;
      metastatic gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine clinical controls and blood sampling were done before every treatment cycle. In order&#xD;
      to rule out patients with progressive disease and distant metastasis, abdominal and thoracic&#xD;
      CT scan evaluations were performed prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment Depending on disease extent, CRS was performed as described by Sugarbaker.&#xD;
      Immediately postoperatively, tumour load and completeness of cytoreduction for PC were&#xD;
      recorded using the Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) [12] and Completeness of Cytoreduction&#xD;
      scores (CC) respectively. The PCI (range 1-39) consists of lesion size scores in 13 different&#xD;
      regions of the abdomen: 0=no tumour seen, 1=tumour up to 0.5 cm, 2=tumour up to 5 cm and&#xD;
      3=tumour&gt;5 cm. The PCI score is calculated by adding together the lesion size scores for the&#xD;
      13 regions. The CC score is based upon the size of tumour left after cytoreduction: CC0=no&#xD;
      peritoneal seeding visible, CC1=nodules up to 2.5 mm, CC2=nodules up to 2.5 cm and&#xD;
      CC3=nodules&gt;2.5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIPEC and EPIC HIPEC was administered according to the Coliseum technique and was combined&#xD;
      with EPIC for five days. Before perfusion, the patient's body temperature was lowered to 35°C&#xD;
      with a cooling blanket (Allon®). The intra-abdominal temperature during perfusion ranged from&#xD;
      42°C to 44°C. Four intra-abdominal drains were left in place after surgery and EPIC was given&#xD;
      daily during the first five postoperative days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour markers, histopathology and adverse events Five serum tumour markers (CEA, CA 125, CA&#xD;
      19-9, CA 15-3 and CA 72-4) were taken one to six days before surgery and ten days after&#xD;
      surgery, to analyse the frequency of the impact of gastric cancer with PC on these tumour&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sixth edition of the TNM classification was used. The presence of signet ring cells and&#xD;
      the grade of differentiation according to Lauren's classification were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy-related adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's&#xD;
      common toxicity criteria (NCI-CTC) version 3.0. OS was calculated for all patients from the&#xD;
      date of the first neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods All analyses were performed on the basis of intention-to-treat. OS and&#xD;
      disease-free survival (DFS) were analysed for patients treated with CC0. Results were&#xD;
      presented as the median, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A P-value of less than 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. The computer software package STATISTICA AXA version&#xD;
      10.0, StatSoft Scandinavia, Sweden, was used for statistical evaluation of the survival data.&#xD;
