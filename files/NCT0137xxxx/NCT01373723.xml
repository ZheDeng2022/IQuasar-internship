      The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and the costs of three types of&#xD;
      population interventions to increase the number of female participants in the screening&#xD;
      programmes for cancer of the cervix carried out by Primary Care in four Basic Health Care&#xD;
      Areas.&#xD;

      Background A high percentage of cervical cancer cases have not undergone cytological tests&#xD;
      within 10 years prior to diagnosis. Different population interventions could improve coverage&#xD;
      in the public system, although costs will also increase. The aim of this study was to compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness and the costs of three types of population interventions to increase the&#xD;
      number of female participants in the screening programmes for cancer of the cervix carried&#xD;
      out by Primary Care in four basic health care areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from the perspective of public health&#xD;
      system including women from 30 to 70 years of age (n=20,994) with incorrect screening&#xD;
      criteria from four basic health care areas in the Valles Occidental, Barcelona, Spain. The&#xD;
      patients will be randomly distributed into the control group and the three Intervention&#xD;
      Groups (IG1: invitation letter to participate in the screening; IG2: invitation letter and&#xD;
      informative leaflet; IG3: invitation letter, informative leaflet and a phone call reminder)&#xD;
      and followed for three years. Clinical effectiveness will be measured by the number of Human&#xD;
      Papillomavirus (HPV), epithelial lesions and cancer of cervix cases detected. The number of&#xD;
      deaths avoided will be secondary measures of effectiveness. The temporal horizon of the&#xD;
      analysis will be the life expectancy of the female population in the study. Costs and&#xD;
      effectiveness will be discounted at 3 %. In addition, univariate and multivariate sensitivity&#xD;
      analysis will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results IG3 is expected to be more cost-effective intervention than IG1 and IG2,&#xD;
      with greater detection of HPV infections, epithelial lesions and cancer than other&#xD;
      strategies, albeit at a greater cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      An economic evaluation of three populational screening strategies for cervical cancer will be&#xD;
      performed. Particularly, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted. These interventions&#xD;
      will be compared to the current opportunistic screening strategy using data of the&#xD;
      multicentre randomised trial (CRICERVA). The analysis will be conducted from the National&#xD;
      Health Care System perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Pragmatic, blinded, multicentre, randomised, controlled clinical trial with four&#xD;
      branches, and a three years follow-up. The randomisation unit was Basic Health Care Area&#xD;
      (BHCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Primary Health Care Services (PCS) of Cerdanyola-Ripollet, province of Barcelona,&#xD;
      comprising 4 municipalities and 5 BHCA. The population covered by this Primary Care Service&#xD;
      (PCS) is 120,293 inhabitants over 14 years. As there are four study groups and 5 BHCAs, only&#xD;
      4 BHCAs with most homogeneous socioeconomic criteria will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: 20,994 women from 30 to 70 years of age with incorrect screening criteria (data&#xD;
      obtained from Data Base of Primary Health Care Services) ascribed to the BHCA will be&#xD;
      included in the study. Incorrect screening will be defined as [9]: 1.- No cytology in the&#xD;
      last 3 years from women between 30 to 40 years, 2.- No cytology in the previous 5 years from&#xD;
      women between 40 to 65 years, 3.- No previous cytology history for females older than 65&#xD;
      years or women who have not had their last cytology before the age of 60. The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be: (a) hysterectomised women, with a current history of pre-malignant lesions&#xD;
      [Atypical Glandular Cells of Undetermined Significance (AGUS), Atypical Squamous Cells of&#xD;
      Undetermined Significance (ASCUS), Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (LSIL),&#xD;
      High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (HSIL)], carcinoma in situ and cervical-uterine&#xD;
      cancer, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive or other causes of immunosuppression&#xD;
      (since these women follow a specific protocol); (b) those residing outside the study setting&#xD;
      for more than 6 months; and (c) those ascribed to the study BHCA but with a physician&#xD;
      assigned in an UBA of another zone different from the one considered in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The sample size has been calculated based on the detection of a difference in&#xD;
      effectiveness compared with the Non Intervention Group (NIG). It has been calculated by&#xD;
      multiplying the size of a simple randomised design by the design effect or factor of&#xD;
      inflation. For the simple randomised design, on accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta&#xD;
      risk of 0.20 in a bilateral contrast, 59 subjects will be required in the first group and 59&#xD;
      in the second group to detect a difference greater than or equal to 28.4 % in the screening&#xD;
      coverage of the 41.6 % in the Non Intervention Group (NIG). The lost to follow up rate has&#xD;
      been estimated at 20 %. The calculation of the sample has been performed with the Granmo 5.2&#xD;
      computer programme for Windows. According to a review of the literature [23-25], considering&#xD;
      an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.05 and a mean number of 3,500 women from 30 to 70&#xD;
      years of age with incorrect screening by BHCA, the design effect will be 176 and thus, 20,768&#xD;
      women with incorrect screening will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS The investigators are committed to respect the prevailing norms of Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice as well as the requisites of the Declaration of Helsinki and the clauses of&#xD;
      general and particular ethical conditions related to the right to privacy, anonymity and&#xD;
      confidentiality. Neither the first name nor surname or any other type of data indicating the&#xD;
      identification of the women will be registered. Therefore, identification will be made by&#xD;
      numeric codes. Since this type of study is developed in the usual clinical setting,&#xD;
      authorisation and support must be and has already been granted by the representatives and&#xD;
      authorities of the collectives involved and thus, individualised informed consent is not&#xD;
      necessary. Nonetheless, the research team decided that women attending the consultation for&#xD;
      the cytology should sign the consent form. The protocol has been evaluated by the Clinical&#xD;
      Investigation Ethics Committee of the IDIAP Jordi Gol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIMITATIONS Randomisation by groups will avoid the potential introduction of selection bias&#xD;
      which may be produced among the interventions performed at the same site. Since the&#xD;
      characteristics of the study do not allow the application of the double-blind masking&#xD;
      technique, the masked response evaluation will be used to ensure that the measurement and&#xD;
      interpretation of the dependent variables is carried out the same way in all groups. The&#xD;
      possible loss of information, which may be produced in women doing screening outside public&#xD;
      health care if they are not contacted by the research team, will be minimised with a phone&#xD;
      call reminder. This will be made when the women do not attend the appointment. The language&#xD;
      difficulties in women from other countries will be solved with cultural mediators at each&#xD;
      site. Within the setting of the study, the administrative personnel have been updating the&#xD;
      postal addresses of the users attending the BHCA since 2007 and, therefore the postal&#xD;
      registry is quite precise, thereby reducing the potential loss of letters.&#xD;
