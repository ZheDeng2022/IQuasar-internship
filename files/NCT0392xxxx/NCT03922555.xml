  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this research study is evaluating the highest dose of ASTX727 that can be administered safely&#xD;
      to recurrent/progressive non-enhancing IDH mutant gliomas patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ASTX727 as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASTX727 is made up of the 2 study drugs cedazuridine and decitabine. Cedazuridine is believed&#xD;
      to work by slowing down how fast decitabine is broken down by the body. Decitabine is&#xD;
      believed to work by blocking abnormal cells or cancer cells from growing.&#xD;
