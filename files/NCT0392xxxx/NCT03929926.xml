      This trial studies how well proactive outreach and shared decision making works in improving&#xD;
      lung cancer screening rates in primary care patients. Proactive outreach and shared decision&#xD;
      making strategies may help to improve the detection of lung cancer at an earlier stage&#xD;
      through screening.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the combined intervention group (Outreach Contact Group [OC]/Outreach Contact&#xD;
      and Decision Counseling Group [OC-DCP]) versus the control usual care group (UC) with respect&#xD;
      to time to screening with low dose computed tomography (LDCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the combined intervention (OC/OC-DCP) and usual care (UC) groups with respect&#xD;
      to the fraction of patients who are referred/scheduled for screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the combined intervention (OC/OC-DCP) and usual care (UC) groups with respect&#xD;
      to the proportion of the referred/scheduled patients who actually keep their screening&#xD;
      appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine cost of implementing the OC and OC-DCP interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the two intervention groups (OC-DCP versus [vs.] OC) on the primary and&#xD;
      secondary study endpoints (time to LDCT screening, proportion of patients referred/scheduled&#xD;
      for screening, proportion of patients keeping their screening appointments, and cost).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the feasibility of patient eligibility review by providers in the OC and OC-DCP&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the difference in success in identifying eligible patients between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the difference in reaching referred patients between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (USUAL CARE): Patients receive usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (OUTREACH CONTACT): Patients receive educational materials in the mail about lung&#xD;
      cancer screening with a cover letter from their physician. A week later, they receive a phone&#xD;
      call from the study staff to assess their eligibility. Eligible and interested patients&#xD;
      receive an office visit at the Jefferson Lung Cancer Screening Program (JLCSP) for shared&#xD;
      decision-making and possible lung cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III (OUTREACH + DECISION COUNSELING PROGRAM): Patients receive educational materials in&#xD;
      the mail about lung cancer screening with a cover letter from their physician. A week later,&#xD;
      they receive a phone call from the study staff to assess their eligibility. Patients then&#xD;
      undergo a decision counseling session through a semi-structured Decision Counseling Program&#xD;
      that includes a review of the mailed educational materials and completion of an interactive&#xD;
      exercise intended to clarify personal preference related to screening options (to have LDCT&#xD;
      or not to have LDCT). Patients interested in screening schedule an office visit at JLCSP for&#xD;
      possible screening or are referred to their primary care physician for consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 90 days.&#xD;

    <description>Will be assessed through a review of electronic health records data at the end of the study. The main analysis will compare the combined intervention group and the usual care group (Outreach Contact [OC]/OC-Decision Counseling Program [DCP] versus [vs.] usual care [UC]) with the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test (stratified by practice). Further analyses will rely on Cox proportional hazards regression to explore the difference between OC and OC-DCP groups, as well as differences across practices and patient characteristics (age, gender, race, current vs. former smoking, etc.).</description>
