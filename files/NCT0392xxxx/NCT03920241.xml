  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at comparing the differential effects of two widely used standardized&#xD;
      meditation programs: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Compassion Cultivation&#xD;
      Training (CCT) in general population samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this goal, the effects will be measured by self-report questionnaires belonging to&#xD;
      different domains (mindfulness, compassion, well-being, psychological distress, and&#xD;
      psychological functioning) as well as information processing measures (i.e., Attentional&#xD;
      Blink), and psychophysiological measures (EEG and EKG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes will be assessed immediately after finishing the 8-week programs and through several&#xD;
      inter-session assessments. Data analysis will include the mean change scores differences, as&#xD;
      well as novel network analysis procedures to assess topological reorganization of constructs&#xD;
      derived from the programs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has a twofold goal. Firstly, it will address whether the practice of different&#xD;
      standardized meditation programs (MBSR and CCT) modify the distribution of limited&#xD;
      attentional resources towards emotional information, measured by the performance in a variant&#xD;
      of the Emotional Attentional Blink. Secondly, novel procedures of Network analysis will be&#xD;
      used to examine whether the practice of different standardized meditation programs&#xD;
      (mindfulness and compassion) impact on the network dynamics between mindfulness, compassion,&#xD;
      well-being, psychological distress, and emotional and cognitive control constructs and how&#xD;
      these constructs are eventually reorganized after the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main corresponding hypotheses. First, meditation practice in general (both&#xD;
      mindfulness and compassion) will change the attentional processing of emotional information,&#xD;
      reflected by a significant reduction of the attentional blink deficit after the programs as&#xD;
      compared to the performance of participants in matched Control group. Differences between&#xD;
      both intervention groups will be analyzed. The second hypothesis states that, after&#xD;
      meditation programs, the networks of these constructs will become topologically reorganized;&#xD;
      more specifically, mindfulness, emotion regulation, and well-being constructs are expected to&#xD;
      increase their centrality in the resulting network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow a pre-post design where participants will be blind to the aims of the&#xD;
      study. Participants will be invited to participate at the moment they register in the&#xD;
      official website offering the MBSR and CCT programs. After being recruited, those who accept&#xD;
      to participate will fill out a brief online screening questionnaire on demographics and&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and will sign an informed consent. Then participants will complete an&#xD;
      online set of questionnaires (via Qualtrics software) of selected psychological domains&#xD;
      associated to the main outcomes and variables studied in meditation literature (i.e.,&#xD;
      mindfulness, compassion, well-being, psychological distress, and emotional and cognitive&#xD;
      control constructs). The online assessment will be completed the week before starting the&#xD;
      program (baseline assessment) and during the week after the end of the MBSR&#xD;
      (post-assessment). When necessary, reminders will be scheduled for those participants who&#xD;
      have not completed the questionnaires. Each pre and post online evaluation will last&#xD;
      approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are invited to attend a one-hour experimental session (i.e. Attentional Blink&#xD;
      task) within the week before starting the meditation program. After completing a second&#xD;
      informed consent, participants will fill out a set of questionnaires with mood (EEE),&#xD;
      mindfulness (SM) and compassion (S_SC) state measure. Participants then will begin the&#xD;
      Emotional Attentional Blink task divided into three blocks with a 1-minute break between the&#xD;
      blocks. At the end of the task, participants will complete the &quot;state measures&quot; again and the&#xD;
      session will end. After this lab session, participants will attend one of the two 8-week&#xD;
      standardized meditation programs (MBSR or CCT). Finally, the same procedure will be followed&#xD;
      for the post-experimental session within the week after the end of the programs. Each&#xD;
      pre-post experimental session will last approximately one hour. After completing the&#xD;
      post-treatment assessments, participants will be debriefed and will receive an individualized&#xD;
      report of their questionnaires scores and the purposes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programs description&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an 8-week standardized program consisted of&#xD;
      2.5-hours of face-to-face weekly sessions, and 45 minutes of daily home formal and informal&#xD;
      practices. Training will be conducted in groups of 20-30 participants. During the program,&#xD;
      different mindfulness practices are performed, including focused attention on the breath,&#xD;
      open monitoring of awareness in body-scanning, prosocial meditation (i.e. loving kindness and&#xD;
      compassion) and gentle yoga.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT) is also an 8-week standardized program consisting&#xD;
      of 2.5-hours of face-to-face weekly sessions and 30 minutes of daily home formal and informal&#xD;
      practices. Training will be conducted in groups of 20-30 participants. The CCT consists of&#xD;
      six sequential steps: 1) Settling the mind and learn how to focus it; 2) Loving-kindness and&#xD;
      compassion for a loved one practice; 3) Loving-kindness and compassion for oneself practice;&#xD;
      4) compassion toward others, embracing shared common humanity and developing appreciation of&#xD;
      others; 5) compassion toward others including all beings; and 6) active compassion practices&#xD;
      (Tonglen) which involve explicit evocation of the altruistic wish to do something about&#xD;
      others' suffering. Finally, participants learn an integrative compassion practice combining&#xD;
      the six essential elements into an integrative compassion meditation practice.&#xD;
