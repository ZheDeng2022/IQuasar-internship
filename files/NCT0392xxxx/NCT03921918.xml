      A functional model of a fluid-filled, smaller dead volume breast pump has been developed in&#xD;
      order to more closely mimic the breastfeeding infant. The technology of fluid-filled pumping&#xD;
      has been tested in one prior clinical study and has now progressed to a complete prototype&#xD;
      with which the user can assemble, pump, disassemble, clean and reuse.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current breast pumps function in a way that is different to breastfeeding. These include the&#xD;
      seal to the breast, the movement of the nipple, the sensations of warmth and moisture, the&#xD;
      variability in frequency, and the strength of the applied vacuum. During breastfeeding the&#xD;
      mother's nipple and the infant's mouth form a chamber that is a fluid-filled, no dead volume&#xD;
      system, which is needed to create a working vacuum to remove milk from the breast. There is&#xD;
      no air visible in the natural system according to ultrasound measurements. This is unlike&#xD;
      breast pumps which use an air-filled, large dead volume system, to create a working vacuum.&#xD;
      Therefore, a functional model of a fluid-filled, smaller dead volume breast pump has been&#xD;
      developed in order to more closely mimic the breastfeeding infant. The technology of&#xD;
      fluid-filled pumping has been tested in one prior clinical study and has now progressed to a&#xD;
      complete prototype with which the user can assemble, pump, disassemble, clean and reuse.&#xD;

             health questionnaire&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is predominantly breastfeeding (80% of all feeds, i.e. ≤150 ml formula/day or&#xD;
             equal representative amount of solid food)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject agrees to pump or feed the last time a minimum of 2 hours (hr) before the&#xD;
             start of the pumping session at the study site&#xD;

             conduct the usability part of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The mother accepts that the pumped milk in visit 2 must be donated to the study i.e.&#xD;
             cannot be fed to the baby&#xD;
