  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholelithiasis occurs in 10-20% of the general population. Up to 18% of these subjects will&#xD;
      present symptoms. In patients with symptomatic choledocholithiasis who are not candidates for&#xD;
      surgery with indication for ERCP, transmural drainage of the gallbladder reduces the risk of&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a multicentric double-blind randomized trial. Our primary objective&#xD;
      is to assess whether ERCP associated with transmural gallbladder drainage is able to reduce&#xD;
      biliary disease income compared with ERCP in patients not candidates for surgery with&#xD;
      symptomatic choledocholithiasis and cholelithiasis during one year of follow-up. Also the&#xD;
      investigators will analyze the proportion of technical success and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes all patients older than 75 years with symptomatic&#xD;
      choledocholithiasis. An estimated 75 subjects per group (ERCP alone and ERCP and transmural&#xD;
      drainage) are needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Introduction Cholelithiasis occurs in 10-20% of the general population (1). Up to 18% of&#xD;
           these subjects will present symptoms and, of these, 1.5% will present an episode of&#xD;
           pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis (2). In this way, the pathology&#xD;
           associated with biliary lithiasis is the first digestive cause of hospital admission&#xD;
           (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The treatment of the pathology associated with biliary lithiasis therefore deals with&#xD;
           two problems, controlling the acute process and preventing new episodes. In general,&#xD;
           laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the recommended method to reduce the risk of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Conceptual hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In patients with symptomatic choledocholithiasis who are not candidates for surgery with&#xD;
           indication for ERCP, transmural drainage of the gallbladder reduces the risk of&#xD;
           recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Operational hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In subjects&gt; 75 years with symptomatic choledocholithiasis, performing an ERCP with&#xD;
           sphincterotomy and transmural drainage of the gallbladder vs. ERCP with sphincterotomy&#xD;
           reduces the risk of admission due to complications of cholelithiasis during a 1-year&#xD;
           follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - To assess whether ERCP associated with transmural gallbladder drainage is able to&#xD;
           reduce biliary disease income compared with ERCP in patients not candidates for surgery&#xD;
           with symptomatic choledocholithiasis and cholelithiasis during one year of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Describe the proportion of technical successes and complications associated with&#xD;
                transmural biliary drainage, ERCP and those associated with admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare the proportion of income from non-biliary causes in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare mortality during admission and during follow-up in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To compare the incidence of biliary and non-biliary admissions during the follow-up&#xD;
                year in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare the hospital costs of the index income and those generated in the 12 months&#xD;
                of follow-up between the patients assigned to the control group and the&#xD;
                experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Design Multicentric double-blind randomized trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Methods Study population The study population includes all patients older than 75 years&#xD;
           with symptomatic choledocholithiasis. This includes the pictures of acute cholangitis,&#xD;
           obstructive jaundice or biliary colic secondary to choledocholithiasis. Participation in&#xD;
           the study will be offered to all consecutive patients who meet inclusion criteria and do&#xD;
           not present exclusion criteria diagnosed in the participating centers once the project&#xD;
           is started until the estimated sample size is completed (see below). Given that in these&#xD;
           patients the usual clinical practice is the realization of an ERCP, they will be&#xD;
           identified from the ERCP requests received in the endoscopy units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not present any exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be invited to participate in the study. Between the formalization of the&#xD;
      request and the endoscopic exploration the informed consent will be completed according to&#xD;
      the law 41/2002 of autonomy of the patient without that for that reason the relationship with&#xD;
      his doctor is altered or there is any prejudice in his treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Endoscopic act&#xD;
&#xD;
           It will be held at the Rio Hortega University Hospital, the University General Hospital&#xD;
           of Alicante or the Ramón y Cajal University Hospital. First, ERCP will be performed.&#xD;
           Subsequently, an endoscopic ultrasound will be performed to rule out local causes of&#xD;
           exclusion. If there is no contraindication, randomization and placement of transmural&#xD;
           vesicular drainage will be carried out if assigned to the intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control group: An ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy will be performed. The&#xD;
                performance of other techniques (balloon extraction, dilation, placement of biliary&#xD;
                prosthesis ...) is at the expense of the endoscopist. The procedure will be&#xD;
                performed under direct sedation with propofol controlled by the endoscopist team,&#xD;
                and with CO2 (carbon dioxide) insufflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention group: ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy will be performed. The&#xD;
                performance of other techniques (balloon extraction, dilation, placement of biliary&#xD;
                prosthesis ...) is at the expense of the endoscopist. After this, transmural&#xD;
                drainage of the gallbladder will be performed by placing a LAMS (lumen apposing&#xD;
                metal stent) Axios (Boston Scientific) usually 15x10 mm or 10x10 mm to allow direct&#xD;
                cholecystoscopy with a conventional gastroscope or transnasal gastroscope. The&#xD;
                placement of the drainage will be performed in the same endoscopic act, by means of&#xD;
                an Olympus® sectorial echoendoscope, assisted with X-rays, which allows puncturing&#xD;
                the vesicle from the gastric antrum or the duodenal bulb to generate a&#xD;
                cholecysto-gastrostomy or cholecysto-duodenostomy respectively. After the puncture&#xD;
                of the vesicle from the most optimal anatomical point, it will be tutored with&#xD;
                guidance and a Hot Axios® LAMS will be placed on it to generate the anastomosis&#xD;
                between the aforementioned structures. After the placement of the prosthesis, it&#xD;
                will be subject to the decision of the endoscopist to perform cholescystoscopy to&#xD;
                perform the maneuvers it deems appropriate (extraction of stones, taking biopsies,&#xD;
                resection of polyps ...). The performance of both procedures will be performed&#xD;
                under direct sedation with propofol controlled by the endoscopist team, and with&#xD;
                CO2 insufflation, according to the usual practice of the HURH (Universitary&#xD;
                Hospital Río Hortega) Endoscopy Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hospitalization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, the hospital management is in the hands of its responsible physicians in&#xD;
      plant at the requesting center. A report will be delivered that does not show if the patient&#xD;
      has had the LAMS implanted or not. Therefore, physicians responsible for plant management&#xD;
      will not receive information about the assigned group or whether transmural vesicular&#xD;
      drainage has been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.3) Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be held in each of the participating centers. It will consist of 4 face-to-face&#xD;
      visits (after 1 day, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the procedure) and 2 phone calls&#xD;
      (7 days after the procedure and 9 months). In the case of institutionalized patients or those&#xD;
      with serious mobility problems, in-person visits may be made by telephone in an exceptional&#xD;
      manner. The physician responsible for the follow-up will be blinded as to the procedure&#xD;
      performed (it will not be specified if transmural drainage was performed in the endoscopic&#xD;
      report, nor will images of the drainage be included in the discharge report available in the&#xD;
      electronic medical record until after the completion of the study or if complications are&#xD;
      suspected). During the follow-up visits, it will be confirmed that the prosthesis remains&#xD;
      normalized by abdominal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Assuming a proportion of readmissions of biliary cause of 25% in the control&#xD;
      group and 7% in the experimental group, with an alpha risk of 5% and a power of 80% and using&#xD;
      the arc transformation sine given the proportion of the experimental group, an estimated 60&#xD;
      subjects per group are needed. Given the age of the patients to be included and the mortality&#xD;
      associated with the underlying disease, a proportion of losses of 20% is estimated, which&#xD;
      would require 75 patients per group. The annual number of ERCP performed at the Río Hortega&#xD;
      university hospital ranges from 1,000 to 1100. Assuming also a number of examinations to be&#xD;
      carried out in the collaborating centers, with the inclusion and exclusion criteria exposed,&#xD;
      a recruitment interval of 12-18 months is estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization It will be done once the patient agrees to participate in the work and has&#xD;
      verified the absence of exclusion criteria. To avoid imbalances between the groups, it will&#xD;
      be stratified by baseline diagnosis (cholangitis vs others), given that the mortality during&#xD;
      admission associated with acute cholangitis is significantly greater than in the rest of the&#xD;
      included conditions. Within each stratum a pure randomization will be carried out by means of&#xD;
      a sequence generated by computer where the probability of belonging to each group will be&#xD;
      0.5. For each stratum, there will be a total of n numbered closed opaque envelopes (where n =&#xD;
      total sample size) that will be stored in the endoscopy unit and will be opened consecutively&#xD;
      as participants are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects monitoring The adverse effects identified during the study will be classified&#xD;
      according to the classification of ASGE (for adverse endoscopic effects) for those associated&#xD;
      with hospitalization. According to the interval from the procedure they will be divided&#xD;
      between postprocedure (in the first 7 days from the same) and late (after this time). Its&#xD;
      relationship with the procedure will be classified as definitive, probable, possible or&#xD;
      improbable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collect The data collection will be done by the main researcher or collaborating&#xD;
      researchers through a data collection notebook (CRD) anonymously and dissociated from the&#xD;
      clinical information by means of a patient identification code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Data management Data from the data collection notebooks will be merged by the main&#xD;
      researcher or collaborating researchers anonymously, encrypted and decoupled from the&#xD;
      clinical information by means of a patient identification code (ID), in a database made&#xD;
      through the application RedCap available through the Spanish Association of Gastroenterology&#xD;
      and the data will be downloaded in the form of an Excel file (Microsoft Corporation,USA). The&#xD;
      responsible researcher will define an ID for each participant. The data entered in the&#xD;
      database will be anonymous and the database will be protected with a password to which only&#xD;
      the researchers will have access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unified file will be kept in the Río Hortega University Hospital and will be maintained&#xD;
      until the end of the study. Regarding the application of the Organic Law on Data Protection&#xD;
      15/1999 and Royal Decree 1720/2007 that develops it, it should be noted that the protocol&#xD;
      defined in the project oriented to epidemiological analysis, determines that the files will&#xD;
      record information completely anonymized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Statistical analysis It will be done through the STATA program (StataCorp, 2013. Stata&#xD;
      Statistical Software: Release 13. College Station, StataCorp LP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis In the quantitative variables the arithmetic average and the standard&#xD;
      deviation will be calculated (the variables that do not follow a normal distribution will be&#xD;
      described with median, minimum, maximum and interquartile range), and the categorical ones&#xD;
      will be expressed as percentages and their 95% confidence intervals .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis contrast The analysis of the primary objective, the hospital admission of biliary&#xD;
      cause, will be carried out through the Z test of homogeneity without using the correction of&#xD;
      Yates. The confidence interval of the difference between the two groups will also be&#xD;
      estimated. An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed, regardless of the endoscopic&#xD;
      treatment received after randomization.&#xD;
