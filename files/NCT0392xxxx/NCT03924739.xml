  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effects of a nurse-coordinated, empowerment-based integrated&#xD;
      care model on self-care behaviors and psychosocial outcomes in patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (AF), and to explore how this intervention affects the self-care behaviors and&#xD;
      quality of life from the patients' perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke prevention by oral anticoagulants (OAC) and control of arrhythmia and risk factors&#xD;
      remain the cornerstones of AF management. However, under-prescription, non-adherence to&#xD;
      treatment, and suboptimal anticoagulation control limit the efficacy of OACs. The poor&#xD;
      abilities of patients regarding the self-control of arrhythmia and risk factors further&#xD;
      contributes to worse outcomes. According to the World Health Organization, the best approach&#xD;
      to chronic disease management involves the empowerment of patients to become active self-care&#xD;
      agents. The literature indicates that a multifaceted, nurse-coordinated care model&#xD;
      integrating all important care components with an empowerment approach could most effectively&#xD;
      and actively engage patients in self-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mixed-methods study comprises a randomized controlled trial and an exploratory&#xD;
      qualitative study. A total of 392 community-dwelling patients aged ≥65 years with a confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of AF, a high stroke risk, and no OAC treatment will be recruited from the medical&#xD;
      outpatient clinics of a university-affiliated teaching hospital. The patients will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to intervention or control groups, which will receive treatment via the&#xD;
      nurse-coordinated integrated care model or standard care, respectively. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      compared to patients receiving standard care, AF patients exposed to the nurse-coordinated&#xD;
      care model will be more likely to achieve compatible patient and physician decisions&#xD;
      regarding the use of OAC, as well as better changes in medication adherence, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression and health-related quality of life both immediately and 6 months post&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will uniquely adopt an empowerment-based approach to equip patients as active&#xD;
      agents in AF management through a nurse-coordinated integrated care model that&#xD;
      comprehensively addresses their needs. The findings will advance our knowledge of patients'&#xD;
      self-care behaviors in the context of AF and will provide a new model of care to improve&#xD;
      health outcomes in this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will have two aims: i) to evaluate the effects of a nurse-coordinated&#xD;
      integrated care model with a patient empowerment approach on the compatibility of patients'&#xD;
      and physicians' decisions regarding oral anticoagulants (OAC) use, medication adherence,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and ii) to explore how and&#xD;
      why the intervention affects health outcomes from the patients' perspectives. The first aim&#xD;
      is based on a research hypothesis in which AF patients exposed to the nurse-coordinated&#xD;
      integrated care model will be more likely to report achieving compatible patient and&#xD;
      physician decisions regarding OAC use, better changes in medication adherence, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and HRQoL, compared to patients who receive conventional care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This will be a sequential mixed-methods study with two phases. Phase 1 will&#xD;
      comprise a prospective, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of the nurse-coordinated integrated care model on various health outcomes among&#xD;
      patients with AF. Phase 2 will comprise an exploratory qualitative study to determine how and&#xD;
      why the intervention works. After collecting baseline data, the research nurse (RA1) will&#xD;
      randomly allocate patients into the intervention or control group. Block randomization (block&#xD;
      size: 8, 10, or 12) will be used to ensure even participant distribution between the two&#xD;
      groups. The block size and respective study group allocation sequence will be determined&#xD;
      using a computer-generated sequence. Chronologically recruited patients will be allocated to&#xD;
      the study groups by RA1 according to this computer-generated sequence. Participants allocated&#xD;
      to receive the nurse-coordinated integrated care model will be provided with an appointment&#xD;
      1-2 weeks before their next scheduled medical appointment to initiate the intervention. The&#xD;
      participants allocated to the control group will continue to receive conventional care as&#xD;
      arranged by the hospital. An independent research assistant (RA2) who is blinded to the study&#xD;
      group allocations will collect post-intervention data through medical record reviews and&#xD;
      telephone interviews upon completion of the intervention and 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase 2 of the study, a purposive sample of 30 participants from the intervention group&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in a qualitative interview. Participants with different&#xD;
      treatment responses to the nurse-coordinated integrated AF care model will be recruited&#xD;
      according to changes in their post-intervention HRQoL scores. Ten participants will be&#xD;
      selected from each range of HRQoL changes: 0-34th percentile, 35th-68th percentile, and &gt;68th&#xD;
      percentile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study interventions Intervention group: Nurse-coordinated integrated care model for AF&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will participate in a 13-week, nurse-coordinated&#xD;
      integrated care model comprising the following care components intended to comprehensively&#xD;
      address the needs of AF patients: 1) a risk profile assessment and shared decision-making&#xD;
      regarding OAC use; 2) an empowerment-based educational module on AF self-care; 3)&#xD;
      nurse-initiated telephone support; and 4) patient-initiated contact for professional advice.&#xD;
      The details of each care component of the intervention are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Risk profile assessment and shared decision-making regarding OAC use A pre-consultation&#xD;
           session will be provided 1-2 weeks before the patient's next medical clinic&#xD;
           consultation. This session will comprise two components: an individualized assessment&#xD;
           and a group-based session to enhance patients' participation in shared decision-making.&#xD;
           First, RA1 will conduct a comprehensive, individualized risk assessment of patients. The&#xD;
           risk assessment will address multiple aspects, including i) the stroke risk based on the&#xD;
           CHA2DS2-VASc score, ii) bleeding risk based on the HAS-BLED score, and iii) quality of&#xD;
           vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulation therapy based on the SAMe-TT2R2 score.&#xD;
           Details of the CHA2DS2-VASc score were elaborated in a previous section of this&#xD;
           proposal. The HAS-BLED score predicts the bleeding risk according to the following risk&#xD;
           factors: hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or&#xD;
           predisposition, labile International normalized ratio (INR), age &gt;65 years, and&#xD;
           concomitant drug/alcohol use. The SAMe-TT2R2 score assesses the likelihood of poor INR&#xD;
           control among patients with AF on VKA therapy according to sex, age, medical history,&#xD;
           treatment, tobacco use, and race. These risk stratification scores provide information&#xD;
           crucial to determining the optimal treatment options for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the risk assessment, the nurse will conduct a face-to-face session in a&#xD;
           small-group (6-8 patients/group) format to empower patients regarding decision-making&#xD;
           and communication with physicians. This face-to-face approach was selected in accordance&#xD;
           with literature suggesting it to be more effective than a written format. Additionally,&#xD;
           group teaching can promote peer learning and modeling. The session will begin with a&#xD;
           structured educational session on AF and its complications, with emphasis placed on&#xD;
           understanding the link between AF and ischemic stroke and the deleterious effects of&#xD;
           rapid ventricular rates on cardiac function. The currently available and suitable OAC&#xD;
           options (warfarin and Non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants (NOACs)) and their pros and cons&#xD;
           (including the self-financed nature of novel OAC) as well as the rationales for rate and&#xD;
           rhythm control will also be discussed. To assist patients with decision-making regarding&#xD;
           OAC use, a patient decision aid developed by the National Institute of Health and Care&#xD;
           Excellence will be used. This aid organizes treatment options in an Option Grids format,&#xD;
           wherein 10 frequently asked questions are presented vertically downwards with the&#xD;
           options presented horizontally across the table. This format facilitates comparison and&#xD;
           clarifies the options. Numeric and graphic formats with pictograms will be used to help&#xD;
           patients understand the absolute and relative risks of a stroke when not using OACs or a&#xD;
           major bleeding episode while using OACs. Patients' individual risk profiles will be used&#xD;
           to illustrate their stroke risks with and without OAC and their bleeding risk with OAC&#xD;
           in a graphical format. The nurse will present the risk and benefit information in a fair&#xD;
           and balanced manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Another care component will engage patients in shared decision-making regarding OAC use&#xD;
           by empowering them to better communicate their decisions to physicians during upcoming&#xD;
           medical consultations. This component will highlight the key points of assertive&#xD;
           communication, including asking questions, expressing concerns, and stating opinions and&#xD;
           preferences regarding OACs for stroke prevention. The patients will be encouraged to&#xD;
           generate a list of questions and concerns to propose to their physicians. To enhance&#xD;
           patients' confidence in their ability to maintain assertive communication in stressful&#xD;
           situations, a series of scenario-based patient models in video format will be used to&#xD;
           optimize the acquisition of skills for handling challenging encounters. A&#xD;
           role-play-based rehearsal will be conducted to allow patients to practice their new&#xD;
           skills and observe others' behavior. The nurse will debrief patients to discuss their&#xD;
           performance and provide feedback. Throughout the session, the nurse will adopt a&#xD;
           supportive and non-judgmental attitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Empowerment-based group educational module The same group of patients will attend an&#xD;
           empowerment-based educational module beginning 1 week after their medical appointments.&#xD;
           The module will comprise five weekly educational sessions covering the following major&#xD;
           topics related to AF self-care: i) medication management, ii) symptom monitoring, iii)&#xD;
           crisis management, iv) activities and exercise, and v) risk factor management to reduce&#xD;
           risks of stroke and bleeding. The educational content of each session will comply with&#xD;
           the recommendations of major practice guidelines for AF management.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During each session, the nurse will implement the empowerment process to enhance&#xD;
           patients' knowledge, skill acquisition, and confidence in AF self-care. The empowerment&#xD;
           approach emphasizes the use of interactive teaching strategies, experiential learning,&#xD;
           and self-reflection during the educational process to optimize learning. First, the&#xD;
           nurse will deliver a structured educational session about the topic of the week.&#xD;
           Emphasis will be placed on assisting patients with understanding the links between their&#xD;
           self-care behaviors and health consequences to ensure that they appreciate the&#xD;
           importance of their own efforts in managing AF. The nurse will encourage patients to&#xD;
           share their current practices, and facilitate them to identify discrepancies between the&#xD;
           suggested self-care and their current practices. The nurse will also highlight possible&#xD;
           health consequences of these discrepancies and assist patients with setting&#xD;
           self-directed goals related to those areas. After goal-setting, a subsequent interactive&#xD;
           skill-building session will ensure that patients acquire the skills required to perform&#xD;
           specific self-care behaviors. For example, to enhance patients' confidence regarding&#xD;
           crisis management, a series of scenario-based patient models in video format will be&#xD;
           used to optimize the acquisition of skills needed to handle challenging encounters&#xD;
           related to possible crises, such as a major bleeding event or suspected stroke episode.&#xD;
           A role-play-based rehearsal will be conducted, and the nurse will discuss the patients'&#xD;
           performances and provide feedback. The nurse will make use of group dynamics by&#xD;
           encouraging peer discussions of successful self-care actions, feelings, concerns, and&#xD;
           perceived barriers to goal achievement. The nurse will also work with the patients to&#xD;
           mutually develop action plans for achieving goals set during each weekly educational&#xD;
           session. Each subsequent session will begin with a discussion of progress in goal&#xD;
           attainment. Challenges and barriers faced while implementing the action plans set during&#xD;
           the previous week will also be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nurse-initiated telephone support The nurse will provide continued support by telephone&#xD;
           after the face-to-face sessions have been completed (two weekly and two bi-weekly&#xD;
           calls). A telephone record containing patients' clinical profiles, AF-related&#xD;
           treatments, self-management goals, and action plans will be used to facilitate the&#xD;
           process. The nurse will monitor patients' adherence, symptom profiles, treatment&#xD;
           efficacies, adverse effects, and goal attainment progress; identify barriers in the&#xD;
           self-care process; and provide resolutions and continued support via the telephone.&#xD;
           Health counseling and advice given will be documented to guide subsequent telephone&#xD;
           correspondence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient-initiated contact for professional advice All participants from the intervention&#xD;
           group will be provided with telephone access to the nurse for inquiries regarding&#xD;
           disease management during office hours. The nurse will provide health advice and&#xD;
           counseling accordingly. For severe undesirable symptoms and adverse reactions to&#xD;
           medications, the nurse will attempt to advance patients' follow-up appointments or&#xD;
           advise patients to seek emergency medical care if necessary. All correspondence and&#xD;
           advice given will be documented in patients' profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Conventional care The control group will receive the conventional care&#xD;
      provided by the study hospital.&#xD;
