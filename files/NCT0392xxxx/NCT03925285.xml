  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In sinonasal inverted papilloma (SNIP) it is very challenging to discriminate between tumor&#xD;
      and surrounding tissue. Local recurrence is a frequent phenomenon as it occurs in 16.5% of&#xD;
      the cases. There is need for an instrument that is able to guide the surgeon in removing all&#xD;
      tumor tissue, whereas resection of healthy tissue is minimalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular fluorescence guided surgery enables the visualization of targeted tumor-specific&#xD;
      biomarkers by using fluorescence, thereby enhancing the contrast between normal mucosa and&#xD;
      tumor tissue. The objective of this feasibility study is to determine if the intravenously&#xD;
      administered conjugate bevacizumab-IRDye800CW accumulates more in SNIP than in normal&#xD;
      sinonasal epithelium.&#xD;

      Rationale: During surgical resection, it is very challenging to discriminate between&#xD;
      sinonasal inverted papilloma (SNIP) and surrounding tissue, as SNIP is associated with&#xD;
      inducement of granulomatous inflammation of the environment. As a result, the surgeon has to&#xD;
      perform a thorough resection in order to remove the complete inverted papilloma, which is&#xD;
      associated with substantial morbidity. Clearly, there is need for an instrument that is able&#xD;
      to guide the surgeon to discriminate between SNIP and surrounding tissue. Molecular imaging&#xD;
      techniques using targeted optical contrast agents is a promising technique to accommodate&#xD;
      this need. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is overexpressed in SNIP compared to&#xD;
      normal epithelium of the sinonasal area and has been used effectively in molecular imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The main objective is to study if the conjugate bevacizumab-IRDye800CW&#xD;
      accumulates more in sinonasal inverted papilloma than in normal sinonasal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The current study is a non-randomized, non-blinded, prospective, single center,&#xD;
      pilot dose-escalation study. A minimum of five and a maximum of eight patients with SNIP will&#xD;
      be included. Five patients will be administered with 10 mg bevacizumab-IRDye800CW. An interim&#xD;
      analysis is performed after inclusion of the first three patients to determine if a&#xD;
      tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) of ≥2 is obtained by either intraoperative fluorescence in&#xD;
      vivo measurements or by ex vivo back-table fluorescence imaging. If a TBR of ≥2 is found,&#xD;
      inclusion is continued to five patients. If not, the dose is adjusted to 25 mg. Again, a&#xD;
      similar interim analysis is performed after inclusion of the first three patients to&#xD;
      determine the TBR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All included patients will meet the in- and exclusion criteria and have a&#xD;
      biopsy confirmed diagnosis of primary or recurrent sinonasal inverted papilloma and are&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient related study procedures: Patients will - after written informed consent - receive an&#xD;
      intravenous injection of the fluorescent tracer. The dose will be either 10 mg or 25 mg. Two&#xD;
      to four days later, the peroperative fluorescence imaging and multidiameter single fiber&#xD;
      reflectance and single fiber fluorescence (MDSFR/SFF) spectroscopy will be performed of the&#xD;
      tumor and woundbed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints are macroscopic fluorescent signal levels, tumor to&#xD;
      background ratio (TBR) and tracer distribution observed by fluorescence imaging and&#xD;
      quantification of the fluorescent signal observed by means of MDSFR/SFF spectroscopy. Results&#xD;
      of fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy will be correlated with standard histopathological&#xD;
      assessment (i.e. hematoxylin and eosin staining) and VEGF immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burden: Time investment: Patients need to visit the UMCG two to four days before their&#xD;
      planned surgery which will take approximately two hours. Extra procedures: 1) Intravenous&#xD;
      administration of bevacizumab-IRDye800CW. 2)The estimated time for taking fluorescence images&#xD;
      and MDSFR/SFF spectroscopy measurements is approximately 15 minutes, which will result in&#xD;
      prolongation of general anesthesia with 15 minutes. 3) Prior to surgical resection, the&#xD;
      surgeon takes biopsies of fluorescent and non-fluorescent areas, or areas of inverted&#xD;
      papilloma and normal mucosal lining of sinonasal cavities involved as identified by the&#xD;
      surgeon when intraoperative fluorescent signal is not detected. 4) Immediately after&#xD;
      resection of the inverted papilloma, biopsies will be taken from areas in the wound bed&#xD;
      showing high fluorescent signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: risks to study participants are mainly related to the, already present, risks of the&#xD;
      surgical procedure and to the administration of the tracer in increasing dosages. A data&#xD;
      safety monitoring board (DSMB) will not be installed as in more than two hundred patients&#xD;
      receiving bevacizumab-IRDye800CW, no (serious) adverse events were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit: Patients will have no benefit from this study directly. Surgery will be planned as&#xD;
      usual. During surgery, no decisions will be made based on the fluorescence imaging.&#xD;
