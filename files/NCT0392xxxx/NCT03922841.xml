  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pleural disease i.e. with effusions or pneumothorax have a high disease burden to patients.&#xD;
      This is because most patients require diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the form of&#xD;
      drainage and biopsies. With increasing age, the incidence of pleural disease is likely to&#xD;
      rise with concomitant rise in pulmonary malignancy and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of pleural disease, especially ambulatory drainage depends not only on patient&#xD;
      factors such as effusion size, cardiopulmonary co-morbidities and underlying aetiology. It&#xD;
      also depends on socioeconomic factors such as ability to afford ambulatory equipment (which&#xD;
      is not covered by Medisave), availability of care-givers and coping mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To phenotype patients presenting to Singapore General Hospital with pleural disease and&#xD;
      evaluate impact on outcomes of pleural interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect existing or prospective data that is part of standard clinical care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Source of the data: electronic medical record of patients (ambulatory and inpatient)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be collected prospectively.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pleural disease i.e. with effusions or pneumothorax have a high disease burden to&#xD;
           patients. This is because most patients require diagnostic and therapeutic interventions&#xD;
           in the form of drainage and biopsies. With increasing age, the incidence of pleural&#xD;
           disease is likely to rise with concomitant rise in pulmonary malignancy and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The impact of pleural disease, especially ambulatory drainage depends not only on&#xD;
           patient factors such as effusion size, cardiopulmonary co-morbidities and underlying&#xD;
           aetiology. It also depends on socioeconomic factors such as ability to afford ambulatory&#xD;
           equipment (which is not covered by Medisave), availability of care-givers and coping&#xD;
           mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, translating internationally accepted pleural interventions into an Asian&#xD;
           context, moreover a Singaporean one, is challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Asian patients with pleural disease have unique phenotypes and outcomes from pleural&#xD;
           interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
           To phenotype patients presenting to Singapore General Hospital with pleural disease and&#xD;
           evaluate impact on outcomes of pleural interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. EXPECTED RISKS AND BENEFITS&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are likely to be no benefits to subjects. They will not be subject to any novel&#xD;
           therapy and their clinical data will only be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risks are minimal because patients are subject to only standard therapy and existing&#xD;
           clinical data collected. There will be no new additional interventions, consultations or&#xD;
           hospital visits. They will be asked to complete validated quality of life surveys that&#xD;
           will be included into the clinical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1. List the number and nature of subjects to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will only be enrolled from those who present to Singapore General Hospital&#xD;
           (either in an ambulatory or inpatient setting). There is no exclusion of women, children&#xD;
           or minorities, although clinical catchment includes mostly adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2. Criteria for Recruitment and Recruitment Process&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be recruited if they already have radiographic evidence of pleural&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3. Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subject must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to participate in this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Evidence of pleural disease on chest radiograph or bedside ultrasound or Computed&#xD;
                Tomography regardless of underlying aetiology&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. No age or gender restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Ability to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;

        6. SAFETY MEASUREMENTS 6.1. Definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
           An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs as a result of the&#xD;
           study. This will reported to CRIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2. Collecting, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events to&#xD;
           CIRB&#xD;
&#xD;
           PI will be responsible for submitting to the approving CIRB the completed serious AE&#xD;
           Reporting Form within 7 calendar days after the investigator is aware of the event,&#xD;
           followed by a complete report within 8 additional calendar days. AE that are related&#xD;
           events should be reported at least annually (together with Study Status Report for&#xD;
           annual review).&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.3. Safety Monitoring Plan&#xD;
&#xD;

        7. DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.1. Data Quality Assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection will be done by the investigators through the clinical team managing the&#xD;
           patient to ensure completion and accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.2. Data Entry and Storage&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data will be entered and stored in a secure web application (REDCap)/password&#xD;
                controlled hospital computer. When subject data collection is complete, the data&#xD;
                will be de-identified and kept in an electronic database (password secured) for&#xD;
                analysis. Only investigators will have access to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There are no plans to keep any documentation of patients beyond the informed&#xD;
                consent forms. These will be stored in the locked department office of the&#xD;
                investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1. Determination of Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample size is determined by the number of patients accrued into the database during&#xD;
           the study period. As this is a non-comparative study, study size calculation not&#xD;
           applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Continuous safety analyses tracking for AE&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Interim Analyses of data on an annual basis&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The CRIB will be permitted to audit the database as needed. Source documents are from&#xD;
           electronic medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection will be done by the investigators through the clinical team managing the&#xD;
           patient to ensure completion and accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.1. Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be sought from the patient or legal guardian (in the case of minors) by&#xD;
      the study investigators before any data collection is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2. Confidentiality of Data and Patient Records&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be entered and stored in a secure web application (REDCap)/password controlled&#xD;
           hospital computer. When subject data collection is complete, the data will be&#xD;
           de-identified and kept in an electronic database (password secured) for analysis. Only&#xD;
           investigators will have access to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are no plans to keep any documentation of patients beyond the informed consent&#xD;
           forms. These will be stored in the locked department office of the investigators.&#xD;
