    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to undertake clinical development of a hybrid compact gamma camera&#xD;
      that combines gamma ray and optical imaging. It is an extension of the previous pilot study&#xD;
      using a newly developed handheld hybrid compact gamma camera in clinical arena.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single visit study involving patients who have been referred to the Nuclear&#xD;
      Medicine Clinic at Nottingham University Hospitals as part of a standard diagnostic test.&#xD;
      Each patient's participation will be approximately 30 minutes and not normally longer than&#xD;
      one hour. The study will run for 11 months commencing February 2017 and ceasing at the end of&#xD;
      December 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of their routine care, patients will be sent a letter booking their diagnostic test&#xD;
      through a Nuclear Medicine Clinic. Once they have confirmed that they will be attending this&#xD;
      diagnostic test, one of the clinical study team trained to take consent will contact the&#xD;
      patient by phone. At this point they will be informed of the reason for the study, why they&#xD;
      have been approached and the study schedule. If they express interest in participating they&#xD;
      will then be sent a copy of the patient informed consent forms. They will be given a minimum&#xD;
      of 24 hours before formally signing consent at the study site immediately before&#xD;
      participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the administration of the routine radiopharmaceutical and the standard wait before&#xD;
      clinical diagnostic imaging, the patient will have research images acquired using the hybrid&#xD;
      prototype gamma camera. All research images will be anonymised and the additional imaging&#xD;
      performed as part of this study will fit in with the patient and the diagnostic test&#xD;
      schedules. Should the patient wish to stop at any point, the research study procedure will be&#xD;
      terminated. Once these images have been acquired then the patient will go home or proceed&#xD;
      with the requirements of their diagnostic test. 75 participants will be recruited for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
