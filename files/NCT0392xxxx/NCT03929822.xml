  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM)&#xD;
      may be able to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in women whose screening mammograms&#xD;
      had abnormal findings.&#xD;

    <description>A standard dose of contrast material for other contrast mammography examinations and for body CT scanning, 1.5 ml/kg of Iohexol350 will be injected intravenously (IV) using a power injection (3-4 ml/s) with a maximum does of 150 ml. The IV injection is performed while the patient is in a sitting position. The mammogram will be performed in a standing position.</description>
