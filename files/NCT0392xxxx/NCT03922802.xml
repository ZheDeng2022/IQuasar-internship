      spinal cord stimulation on gait and balance function for individuals after spinal cord&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether acute intermittent hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with&#xD;
           transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation during ambulation training modulates spinal&#xD;
           locomotor networks in individuals with spinal cord injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether acute intermittent hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with&#xD;
           transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation during ambulation training improves locomotor&#xD;
           function in individuals with spinal cord injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether acute intermittent hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with&#xD;
           transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation during ambulation training improves symmetry of&#xD;
           gait in individuals with spinal cord injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether acute intermittent hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with&#xD;
           transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation during ambulation training improves standing&#xD;
           posture and balance in individuals with spinal cord injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether ambulation efficiency (improved cardiovascular conditioning)&#xD;
           improves with a combination of AIH, transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation and&#xD;
           ambulation training in individuals with spinal cord injury&#xD;

    <description>The 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) measures the distance a subject can walk indoors on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes, using assertive devices, as necessary. The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The test will be used to determine participant's gait efficiency at baseline and at study completion. The walk test is patient self-paced and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test, however, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded.</description>

    <measure>Change in 10 Meter Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1 (baseline test, initial visit), After 5 intervention sessions (Post Test), 1 week post (1 week follow up Post)</time_frame>
    <description>This test will examine the patient's gait speed. Patients will be directed to walk at their preferred maximum but safe speed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test: Assesses mobility, balance, walking ability and fall risk</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1 (baseline test, initial visit), After 5 intervention sessions (Post Test), 1 week post (1 week follow up Post)</time_frame>
    <description>The participant starts seated in a chair with his/her back against the chair back. On command, the participant rises from the chair, walks 3 meters, turns, walks back to the chair and sits down. Timing begins when the command to start is given and stops when the participant returns to a seated position. This test may be repeated up to 3 times during each assessment visit and during each training visit.</description>
