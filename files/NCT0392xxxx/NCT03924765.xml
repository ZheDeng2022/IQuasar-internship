  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increased metabolic and biomechanical demands of ambulation limit community mobility in&#xD;
      persons with lower limb disability due to neurological damage. There is a critical need for&#xD;
      improving the locomotion capabilities of individuals with stroke to increase their community&#xD;
      mobility, independence, and health. Robotic exoskeletons have the potential to assist these&#xD;
      individuals by increasing community mobility to improve quality of life. While these devices&#xD;
      have incredible potential, current technology does not support dynamic movements common with&#xD;
      locomotion such as transitioning between different gaits and supporting a wide variety of&#xD;
      walking speeds. One significant challenge in achieving community ambulation with exoskeletons&#xD;
      is providing an adaptive control system to accomplish a wide variety of locomotor tasks. Many&#xD;
      exoskeletons today are developed without a detailed understanding of the effect of the device&#xD;
      on the human musculoskeletal system. This research is interested in studying the question of&#xD;
      how the control system affects stroke biomechanics including kinematic, kinetics and muscle&#xD;
      activation patterns. By optimizing exoskeleton controllers based on human biomechanics and&#xD;
      adapting control based on task, the biggest benefit to patient populations will be achieved&#xD;
      to help advance the state-of-the-art with assistive hip exoskeletons.&#xD;

      One significant challenge in achieving community ambulation with exoskeletons is providing an&#xD;
      adaptive control system to accomplish a wide variety of locomotor tasks. Many exoskeletons&#xD;
      today are developed without a detailed understanding of the effect of the device on the human&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system. The study is interested in exploring the question of how the control&#xD;
      system affects human biomechanics including kinematic, kinetics and muscle activation&#xD;
      patterns. By optimizing exoskeleton controllers based on human biomechanics and adapting&#xD;
      control based on task, this work will be able to provide the biggest benefit to patients and&#xD;
      advance the state-of-the-art with assistive hip exoskeletons. A large patient population that&#xD;
      could benefit from lower limb assistive technology are stroke survivors, which is the&#xD;
      specific population this proposal targets. One common characteristic of stroke survivors who&#xD;
      regain their ability to walk is that the hip muscles are overtaxed due to distal weakness.&#xD;
      The investigators propose to use a powered hip exoskeleton to augment their proximal&#xD;
      musculature, which needs to produce significant power output in most locomotion activities&#xD;
      such as standing up, walking, and going up stairs or slopes. Another biomechanical aspect of&#xD;
      stroke survivors is an asymmetric gait in terms of kinematics, kinetics and muscle&#xD;
      activations. The research will examine what kind of exoskeleton assistance is most beneficial&#xD;
      to stroke survivors for enhancing community ambulation. The hypothesis is that since the gait&#xD;
      is asymmetric, the controller will need to be asymmetric to provide optimal assistance to aid&#xD;
      in mobility. The long-term research goal is to create powered assistive exoskeletons devices&#xD;
      that are of great value to individuals with serious lower limb disabilities by improving&#xD;
      clinical outcomes such as walking speed and community ambulation ability. The overall&#xD;
      objective of the proposed project is to study the biomechanical effects of using a hip&#xD;
      exoskeleton with adaptive controllers for assisting stroke survivors with lower limb deficits&#xD;
      to improve their community ambulation capabilities. The central hypothesis overarching both&#xD;
      aims is that exoskeleton control that adapts to environmental terrain will improve mobility&#xD;
      metrics for human exoskeleton users on community ambulation tasks. The rationale is that&#xD;
      since human biomechanics change based on task, exoskeleton controllers likewise need to&#xD;
      optimize their assistance levels to match what the human is doing. The team has previously&#xD;
      designed and extensively tested an autonomous hip exoskeleton in able-bodied subjects on a&#xD;
      treadmill and plan to follow this up with a separate study on able bodied subjects during&#xD;
      overground locomotion of walking, stairs, and ramps. The aim of this study is to translate an&#xD;
      autonomous robotic hip exoskeleton to provide adaptive assistance in community ambulation for&#xD;
      stroke survivors with mobility impairment. The team will analyze the biomechanical effects&#xD;
      and clinical benefits with using an autonomous hip exoskeleton for a walking impaired user&#xD;
      (due to stroke). The primary hypothesis for this aim is that stroke survivors will increase&#xD;
      their mobility in community ambulation tasks using the adaptive control framework. A&#xD;
      sub-hypothesis is that stroke survivors who present with unilateral impairment will have&#xD;
      superior biomechanical and clinical outcomes using a controller with asymmetric assistance.&#xD;
      The investigators expect a controller that provides a greater assistance to the impaired side&#xD;
      to improve overall symmetry and help the stroke survivor maintain a more efficient gait&#xD;
      pattern to help improve walking speed (primary outcome measure). The expected outcome of&#xD;
      these aims will be an increased understanding of the biomechanical and clinical effects in&#xD;
      applying hip assistance with a robotic exoskeleton in community ambulation tasks such as&#xD;
      overground walking, ramps and stairs. This work will serve as a foundational start for a&#xD;
      broader planned study of optimizing controllers to improve biomechanics in the walking&#xD;
      impaired using powered hip autonomous exoskeletons. This aim will have a positive impact by&#xD;
      helping to inform the design and control of future exoskeleton for assisting individuals with&#xD;
      lower limb disabilities, with specific insight in stroke survivors with mobility impairment.&#xD;
