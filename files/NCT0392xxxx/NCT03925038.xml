    <textblock>
      Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental health conditions in the United States,&#xD;
      and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality and overall impairment in&#xD;
      functioning. These conditions often have an onset in adolescence and can be especially&#xD;
      problematic during this time-period because it can impede normal development and attainment&#xD;
      of important milestones. While there are evidence-based treatments for these disorders, these&#xD;
      disorders often go untreated or under-treated with negative outcomes, particularly suicide in&#xD;
      the case of mood disorders. Electronic communication via text messages and social media are&#xD;
      ubiquitous and are often the predominant form of communication in adolescents and young&#xD;
      adults. A growing body of research suggests that - at the individual level - electronic&#xD;
      communication, including social media, activity can reflect the underlying course of mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders and reveal associated risks for worsening course and negative outcomes such&#xD;
      as suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, the investigators propose to develop and evaluate a dashboard for mental&#xD;
      health therapists to augment the care of patients with mood/anxiety disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mood and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health disorder in the United&#xD;
      States, and these disorders are associated with significant morbidity, mortality and overall&#xD;
      impairment in functioning. These disorders often have an onset in adolescence, and suicide is&#xD;
      now the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year-olds. Furthermore, adolescent mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders are increasing, with lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder for&#xD;
      adolescents now estimated at 11%. For adolescents and young adults, untreated mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders can impede normal development and attainment of important milestones (i.e.,&#xD;
      high school or college graduation, transition to employment), in addition to greatly&#xD;
      increasing the risk of suicide. While there are evidence-based treatments for these&#xD;
      disorders, 40% of depressed adolescent patients, for example, do not have a substantial&#xD;
      response to initial treatment and only a third experience remission of symptoms.&#xD;
      Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve upon current treatments and develop novel&#xD;
      approaches to care of depression, as well as other mood and anxiety disorders, in&#xD;
      adolescents, young adults, and adults in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic communication is ubiquitous. Given this, it has been hypothesized that monitoring&#xD;
      electronic communication, including social media, activity in partnership with patients as&#xD;
      part of routine clinical care has the potential to prevent negative outcomes of mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders and greatly improve care of these conditions. At the individual level,&#xD;
      electronic communication activity can reflect the underlying course of these disorders and&#xD;
      reveal associated risks for worsening course and negative outcomes such as suicide. Automated&#xD;
      technologies (e.g., natural language processing systems) may assist therapists in assessing&#xD;
      these conditions and risks, by identifying aspects of language use or other key behavior&#xD;
      patterns, such as number of friends or time of electronic communication activity, that&#xD;
      correlate with an individual's mental health status. At the population level, analysis of&#xD;
      aggregated electronic communications data can illuminate important mental health trends&#xD;
      across a range of disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, eating disorders).&#xD;
      In this pilot study, the investigators propose to develop and evaluate a dashboard for mental&#xD;
      health therapists in alliance with patients to augment the care of patients with mood/anxiety&#xD;
      disorders and to improve clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, changes to primary, secondary, and other pre-specified outcomes were made prior to&#xD;
      intervention implementation.&#xD;
