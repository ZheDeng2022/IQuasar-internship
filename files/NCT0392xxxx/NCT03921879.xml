  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will test OT-82, which is an investigational (&quot;research&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;experimental&quot; ) drug. The study has two stages (Stage 1 and Stage 2). The purpose of Stage 1&#xD;
      is to determine the safety and tolerability and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the&#xD;
      maximum tested dose of OT-82 administered orally to participants. The purpose of Stage 2 is&#xD;
      to determine the preliminary efficacy of OT-82 in relapsed or refractory lymphoma at the MTD&#xD;
      or the maximum tested dose. Both parts of the study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) of OT-82.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OT-82 treatment slowed the growth, reduced the size, or in some cases cured certain cancers&#xD;
      in animal studies. It is hoped that participants with relapsed or refractory lymphoma treated&#xD;
      with OT - 82 in this study will experience slowing tumor growth and/or reduction of tumor&#xD;
      size.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OT-82 affects an enzyme in the cancer cell called nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase&#xD;
      (abbreviated NAMPT), which is involved with making energy for the cancer cell. OT-82 deprives&#xD;
      the cancer cell of the energy that it needs to grow and divide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, non-randomized (all participants will receive the study medication),&#xD;
      open-label (identity of the study drug will be known to the participant and the study staff),&#xD;
      controlled (the methods of the study are not random) study. Approximately 45 -50 participants&#xD;
      at approximately 10 study centers across the USA will take part in this research study. The&#xD;
      starting dose for Stage 1 is 16.5 mg/m2 per day. Participants in Stage 1 will be assigned a&#xD;
      dose dependent on when he or she entered the study. Doses will increase for each new group of&#xD;
      3 to 6 participants until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the maximum tested dose is&#xD;
      reached. OT-82 is an oral liquid suspension that will be taken by mouth once per day for 3&#xD;
      days followed by a 4-day rest period.. A participant may continue to receive treatment with&#xD;
      OT-82 as long as the study doctor feels it is in their best interest; as long as the&#xD;
      participant does not develop intolerable side effects; as long as the participant wishes to&#xD;
      remain in the study; or as long as the sponsor does not close the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Stage 2 of the study will receive either the MTD or the maximum tested dose&#xD;
      of OT-82 determined in Stage 1. Assessment of anti-tumor activity will primarily focus on&#xD;
      categorical objective response (Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR)) as defined&#xD;
      according to the consensus recommendations of the Lugano Classification criteria for&#xD;
      malignant lymphoma (Cheson et al., 2014).&#xD;
