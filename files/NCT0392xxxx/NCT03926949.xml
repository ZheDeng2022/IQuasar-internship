  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is common in surgical patients. Many studies have shown a clear association&#xD;
      between malnutrition and poor surgical outcomes. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a nutrition&#xD;
      intervention that is given by vein and can be safely provided to malnourished patients. It&#xD;
      contains carbohydrates, fats, and protein just like you would normally in your diet.&#xD;
      Pre-operative PN is able to improve outcomes in surgical patients. However, pre-operative PN&#xD;
      has traditionally required hospital admission which results in increased length of stay,&#xD;
      hospital cost, and hospital-acquired infection. Moreover, in hospital pre-operative PN may&#xD;
      not be feasible or prioritized when access to inpatient surgery beds is limited. Outpatient&#xD;
      PN provides the opportunity to solve this problem. The feasibility and impact of outpatient&#xD;
      PN in malnourished patients undergoing major surgery have not previously been studied. This&#xD;
      study aims to evaluate the feasibility of outpatient pre-operative PN and its effect on&#xD;
      patient's outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Clavien-Dindo Classification classifies postoperative complications into 5 grades (grade I to grade V) from mild to severe complications Grade I: no need specific intervention Grade II: need phamacological treatment Grade III: need surgical/endoscopic/radiological intervention Grade IV: life-threatening complications requiring ICU managment Grade V: death of a patient</description>

    <measure>Quality of life: Short Form (SF)-12 questionnaire</measure>

    <description>Quality of life evaluated by Short Form (SF)-12 questionnaire A mental component score (MCS-12) and a physical component score (PCS-12) are calculated by summation of mental and physical questions, respectively. The score range from 0-100, which the higher score means the better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Nutrition status</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 days during parenteral nutrition infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Nutrition status evaluated by patient-generated subjective global assessment&#xD;
Patient-generated subjective global assessment divides a patient into 3 groups:&#xD;
A = well-nourished B = moderately malnourished or suspected malnutrition C = severely malnourished The total score is also calculated by summation of scores from weight, food intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, activity, metabolic demand, and physical examination. It ranges from 0-55, which the lower score means the better nutrition status.</description>
