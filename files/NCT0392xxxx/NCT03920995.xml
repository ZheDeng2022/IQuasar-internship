    <textblock>
      In this study the Investigator's propose to validate a newly developed approach, DeepGRAI&#xD;
      (Deep Gray Rating via Artificial Intelligence), to simplify the calculation of thalamic&#xD;
      atrophy in a clinical routine and allow academic and community neurologists to plan, perform,&#xD;
      and publish novel and influential clinical research using data from clinical routine, by&#xD;
      employing deep machine learning (DML) pattern recognition (PR) information through use of&#xD;
      artificial intelligence (AI).&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective, cross-sectional and longitudinal&#xD;
      population study of brain volume changes in MS patients. The retrospective electronic medical&#xD;
      record (EMR) and brain MRI image data will be collected at participating MS centers and&#xD;
      de-identified data will be integrated into a central research database. All the data to be&#xD;
      integrated into the database has already been collected by physicians at the centers as part&#xD;
      of their routine clinical practice and is thus non-interventional and retrospective in&#xD;
      nature. This new approach will be compared to existing approaches of brain volume measurement&#xD;
      that are currently widely available. This breakthrough approach would lead to potentially&#xD;
      abandoning classis measurement of the specific brain volume structures and would be&#xD;
      applicable in real-time in clinical routine.&#xD;
