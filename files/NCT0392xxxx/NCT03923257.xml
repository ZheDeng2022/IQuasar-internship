  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT) trial of 177Lu-DOTA-OCTREOTATE in&#xD;
      children and adolescents with neuroendocrine tumors and pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT)&#xD;
      using 177Lu-DOTA-OCTREOTATE given intravenously in children and adolescents is an effective&#xD;
      treatment and to describe its toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consists of children and adolescents ages 1-20 years with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory neuroendocrine tumors and pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.&#xD;

    <description>Six subjects will have whole body imaging and SPECT/CT of kidneys performed at 3-8 hours plus whole body and SPECT at 20-28 hours, 44-52 hours, 92-100 hours and 116-124 hours after the administration of the radiopharmaceutical. Data will be analyzed using method of Madsen[1,2]. Single point dosimetry will be utilized with subsequent cohorts if data demonstrates agreement with adult dosimetry. Biological effective dose (BED) to kidneys will be calculated according to Bodei et al [3].&#xD;
The information on renal uptake, renal mass and residence time will be entered into OLINDA software to calculate the radiation dose. If single point dosimetry proves to be accurate, any remaining Phase I subjects and all Phase II subjects will receive single point dosimetry for both renal and bone marrow radiation dose estimation.</description>

&#xD;
          -  The effects of 177Lu-DOTATATE on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason and because Class C agents are known to be teratogenic, all subjects capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant must agree to practice a medically acceptable birth control measure&#xD;
             (abstinence, birth control pills, intrauterine devices, vaginal diaphragm, vaginal&#xD;
             sponge, or condom with spermicidal jelly) throughout the study and for eight months&#xD;
             following the end of the last treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she&#xD;
             is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent's ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document for children &lt; seven (7) years of age. Children ≥ seven (7) years of age will&#xD;
             sign assent along with parental consent or will co-sign consent with parent in&#xD;
             accordance with rules of the state in which treatment is received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 177Lu-DOTATATE is a Class C agent&#xD;
             with potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with 177Lu-DOTATATE, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued until 3 months after the last administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 8 weeks of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  External beam radiation to both kidneys (scatter doses of &lt;500 cGy to a single kidney&#xD;
             or radiation to &lt; 50% of a single kidney is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior PRRT with 90Y-DOTATOC (TATE) or 177Lu-DOTATOC (TATE) or 131I-MIBG for this&#xD;
             malignancy within 12 months of first study dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Another investigational drug within 8 weeks of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent, malignant disease for which patient is on active therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Another significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition which is currently&#xD;
             uncontrolled by treatment and which would likely affect the subject's ability to&#xD;
             complete this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received Sandostatin LAR or long-acting lanreotide in the past 28&#xD;
             days must be appropriately delayed. Subjects may be maintained on short acting&#xD;
             octreotide during the time from last injection of long-acting somatostatin analogue&#xD;
             until 8-24 hrs prior to injection of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known antibodies to Octreotide, Lanreotide, or DOTATATE or history of allergic&#xD;
             reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to&#xD;
             177Lu-DOTATATE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection,&#xD;
             uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, hepatic cirrhosis or severe impairment, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corticosteroids: Patients receiving corticosterods who have not been on a stable or&#xD;
             decreasing dose of corticosteroid for at least 7 days prior to enrollment are not&#xD;
             eligible. If used to modify immune adverse events related to prior therapy, ≥ 14 days&#xD;
             must have elapsed since last dose of corticosteroid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received a prior solid organ transplantation are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if they have a known allergy to any of the drugs used in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anti-cancer agents known to be myelosuppressive. At&#xD;
             least 21 days after the last dose of cytotoxic or myelosuppressive chemotherapy (42&#xD;
             days if prior nitrosourea).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anti-cancer agents not known to be myelosuppressive (e.g. not associated with reduced&#xD;
             platelet or ANC counts): ≥ 7 days after the last dose of agent. Short-acting&#xD;
             somatostatin analogue may be administered up to eight hours prior to infusion of study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antibodies: ≥ 21 days must have elapsed from infusion of last dose of antibody, and&#xD;
             toxicity related to prior antibody therapy must be recovered to Grade ≤ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematopoietic growth factors: ≥ 14 days after the last dose of a long-acting growth&#xD;
             factor (e.g. Peg-Filgrastim) or 7 days for short-acting growth factor. For agents that&#xD;
             have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period&#xD;
             must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur. The&#xD;
             duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair and the&#xD;
             study-assigned Research Coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Interleukins, Interferons and Cytokines (other than Hematopoietic Growth Factors): ≥&#xD;
             21 days after the completion of interleukins, interferon or cytokines (other than&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Allogeneic (non-autologous) bone marrow or stem cell transplant, or any stem cell&#xD;
             infusion including donor lymphocyte infusion or boost infusion: ≥ 84 days after stem&#xD;
             cell infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autologous stem cell infusion including boost infusion: ≥ 42 days; cellular therapy: ≥&#xD;
             42 days after the completion of any type of cellular therapy (e.g. modified T cells,&#xD;
