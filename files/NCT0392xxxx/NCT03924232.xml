      the Bioelectrical impedance analysis and muscular Ultrasound in the detection of nutritional&#xD;
      Status in critically ill patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill patients are characterized by wide variations in their carbohydrate, lipid,&#xD;
      and protein metabolism. Such variations can lead to increase in their energy requirement with&#xD;
      accelerated protein catabolism and ultimately alterations of their immune and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal systems, and in a variable frame time, it lead to a disruption of muscular&#xD;
      function that increased the ICU and hospital stay and mortality. It has been observed that&#xD;
      most of the critically ill patients who survive acute respiratory distress syndrome have to&#xD;
      deal with a wide variety of consequences, including muscular wasting and weakness, and these&#xD;
      conditions could last for at least one year. Intensive care unit acquired weakness has been&#xD;
      defined as generalized weakness that develops during critical illness and where no other&#xD;
      explanation than critical illness is present and is associated with long-term consequences&#xD;
      from the medical, human, and socioeconomic point of view. In the normal weight person, the&#xD;
      metabolic response to injury causes an increase in protein and energy requirements. As a&#xD;
      result, endogenous substrates serve as fuel sources and as precursors for protein synthesis.&#xD;
      From the nutrition perspective, one of the main challenges of providing nutritional support&#xD;
      to critically ill patients is to stop or slow lean mass losses. For these reasons, it is&#xD;
      fundamental for the nutritional support clinician to be able to measure and assess muscle&#xD;
      wasting during critical illness, using an easy and accessible technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple methods to conduct these measurements. Usually, admission weight and&#xD;
      height should be used to calculate the ideal body weight (IBW), the percentage of IBW, and&#xD;
      the Body Mass Index (BMI). However, the accuracy of these measures could be very scares.&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle wasting in the critically ill is often masked by fluid retention. In these&#xD;
      circumstances the normal anthropometric methods of assessing changes in body mass and&#xD;
      composition are not applicable, as the techniques all assume a normal state of hydration.&#xD;
      Thus, additional anthropometric data although useful in ambulatory patients, are not as&#xD;
      accurate measures of malnutrition in the critically ill patients. Moreover, some serum&#xD;
      proteins (such as albumin level and several other transport proteins) are commonly measured&#xD;
      as surrogates of visceral protein status. However, all of them are influenced by many factors&#xD;
      such as synthesis and degradation rates and vascular losses into the surrounding&#xD;
      interstitium, in addition to losses through the gut or kidney. As a result, their levels drop&#xD;
      by inflammation or sepsis where high levels of interleukin-6 stimulate acute phase protein&#xD;
      production as it inhibits transport protein production. Thus, they are a poor indicator of&#xD;
      critically ill patients' nutritional status as they serve as a marker of injury and metabolic&#xD;
      response to stress. For these reasons, in the last few decades, several different tools have&#xD;
      been developed to integrate the clinical and biochemical nutritional evaluations. Among&#xD;
      these, the bioimpedance analysis (BIA) and the muscular ultrasonography (MU) seem to be&#xD;
      promising tools for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to compare and integrate the data collected by BIA and MU and the&#xD;
      routinely clinical used parameters of nutrition to define the nutritional status of&#xD;
      critically ill patients. The data from these tools and the biochemical and anthropometric&#xD;
      nutritional data (including the nutritional support) will be collected at the admission in&#xD;
      ICU and followed up within the first week of ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioimpedance analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is the collective term that describes the non-invasive&#xD;
      methods to measure the electrical body responses to the introduction of a low-level,&#xD;
      alternating current. Recently, advances in BIA technology gave rise to detailed and&#xD;
      sophisticated data analyses and targeted applications in clinical practice included the&#xD;
      critical care environment. The Bioelectric Impedance Vector Analysis (BIVA) is today a&#xD;
      commonly used approach for body composition measurements and assessment of clinical condition&#xD;
      and has recently been developed to assess both nutritional status and tissue hydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basically, BIA measures the opposition of body tissues to the flow of a small alternating&#xD;
      current (i.e. the impedance). The classical BIA method consists of the use of four electrodes&#xD;
      attached to the hands, wrist, foots and ankles in which a painless electrical current at a&#xD;
      fixed or multiple frequency is introduced in the organism. Thus, BIA only measures the end&#xD;
      to-end voltage across the entire path between the voltage-sensing electrodes. This voltage is&#xD;
      the energy expended per unit of charge for the total current path and it does not provide any&#xD;
      direct information with respect to the amount of current traveling through intracellular&#xD;
      versus extracellular volumes, in blood versus muscle, or in fat versus fat-free media. The&#xD;
      impedance is a function of two components (or vectors): the &quot;resistance&quot; (R) of the tissues&#xD;
      themselves and the additional opposition or &quot;reactance&quot; (Xc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioimpedance in the Nutritional assessment The metabolic response to critical illness is&#xD;
      characterized by increased energy expenditure, proteolysis, gluconeogenesis and myolysis with&#xD;
      an increment that exceeds 100% of predicted energy expenditure. This prediction can be&#xD;
      influenced by volume overload, since body weight is often used in equations to predict energy&#xD;
      needs. Increased proteolysis leads to accelerated protein loss, which occurs despite&#xD;
      provision of exogenous protein and non-protein intakes. Thus, muscle wasting often occurs due&#xD;
      to increased metabolic demands on the body, determining major losses of lean tissue due to&#xD;
      severity of illness and organ dysfunction, prolonged immobility, and malnutrition. The&#xD;
      variability of BIA measurements has often been cited as a major limitation for its clinical&#xD;
      use in evaluating nutritional status. Moreover, the oldest studies were performed using a&#xD;
      classical BIA to determine the body composition while the more recent studies focused the&#xD;
      attention on the use of BIVA and phase angle (PA) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bedside muscular ultrasonography in critically ill patients With growing interest in&#xD;
      understanding muscle atrophy and function in critically ill patients and survivors,&#xD;
      ultrasound is emerging as a potentially powerful tool for skeletal muscle quantification. It&#xD;
      represents a simple, non-invasive method of quantification not only of central muscular (such&#xD;
      as the diaphragm) contractile activity, but also for the peripheral skeletal muscle atrophy.&#xD;
      This muscle quantification combined with metabolic, nutritional, and functional markers will&#xD;
      allow optimal patient assessment and prognosis. It is now well accepted how to assess the&#xD;
      diaphragm excursion and diaphragm thickening during breathing and the meaning of these&#xD;
      measurements under spontaneous or mechanical ventilation, as well as features of skeletal&#xD;
      muscle (including muscle quantity measures like mass and cross-sectional area and muscle&#xD;
      quality measures such as architecture and evidence of myonecrosis) may provide a more&#xD;
      feasible and objective approach to assessing muscle health in ICU patients. Moreover,&#xD;
      objective quantifications of muscle (which include, but are not limited to, muscle mass,&#xD;
      thickness, and cross-sectional area) that are sufficiently sensitive to detect small changes&#xD;
      over acute timeframes may ultimately facilitate evaluation of interventions to counter muscle&#xD;
      atrophy and weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diaphragmatic evaluation The relative contribution of patient effort during assisted&#xD;
      breathing is difficult to measure in clinical conditions. Moreover, the diaphragm is&#xD;
      inaccessible to direct clinical assessment. Bedside ultrasonography, which is already crucial&#xD;
      in several aspects of critically illness has recently been proposed as a simple, non-invasive&#xD;
      method of quantification of diaphragm contractile activity. Ultrasound can be used to&#xD;
      determine diaphragm excursion, which may help to identify patients with diaphragm&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonographic examination can also allow for the direct visualization of diaphragm&#xD;
      thickness in its zone of apposition. Thickening during active breathing has been proposed to&#xD;
      reflect the magnitude of diaphragm effort, similarly to an ejection fraction of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of recent studies employed ultrasound to measure diaphragm thickness and inspiratory&#xD;
      thickening in ventilated patients. Some of them focused on the feasibility and&#xD;
      reproducibility of the technique, while other36 showed how with increasing levels of pressure&#xD;
      support (PSV), parallel reductions were found between diaphragm thickening and both diaphragm&#xD;
      and esophageal pressure-time product suggesting that diaphragm thickening is a reliable&#xD;
      indicator of respiratory effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of diaphragm thickness The right hemidiaphragm can be visualized in the zone of&#xD;
      apposition of the diaphragm to the rib cage with the probe placed in the midaxillary line,&#xD;
      between the 8th and 10th intercostal space, as a 3-layered structure consisting of pleural&#xD;
      and peritoneal (hyperechogenic) membranes and the hypoechogenic layer of muscle itself. This&#xD;
      site is ideal for ultrasonographic visualization, since the diaphragm is bounded by soft&#xD;
      tissue on either side and lies parallel to the skin surface and, therefore, the transducer&#xD;
      face. The diaphragm is additionally dynamically identified as the most superficial structure&#xD;
      that is obliterated by the leading edge of the lung upon inspiration. Eventually, it is&#xD;
      identified by direct visualization of its contraction at the beginning of the respiratory&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-mode Using a 7.5-10 MHz linear probe, set in B-mode and placed parallel to a intercostal&#xD;
      space between the VIII and X, the inferior edge of costophrenic angle is identified by the&#xD;
      transient appearance of the lung artifact with breathing. Diaphragm thickness (Tdi) can be&#xD;
      measured both during tidal breathing and during a maximal inspiratory effort. Several studies&#xD;
      were performed to establish reference values of Tdi in supine healthy subjects, showing for&#xD;
      the right hemidiaphragm mean values of 0.3238 cm or 0.3339 cm, independently of sex, age or&#xD;
      body constitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M-mode The probe is placed with the same landmark previously described for B-mode with the&#xD;
      aim to identify pleural and peritoneal membranes around the diaphragm. Diaphragm thickness is&#xD;
      measured at end-expiration (Tdi,ee) and peak inspiration (Tdi,pi) as the distance between the&#xD;
      diaphragmatic pleura and the peritoneum using M-mode .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral muscular assessment It has been shown that muscle mass measurement by&#xD;
      ultrasonography (US) is a reliable technique in most of the patients even when oedema and&#xD;
      fluid retention are present. Muscle mass loss in critically ill patients has been assessed by&#xD;
      US, histological, and molecular biology techniques, showing a significant reduction of&#xD;
      approximately 10% of the rectus femoris (RF) cross-sectional area (CSA) measured by US&#xD;
      correlating with a decrease in muscle fibres CSA and less protein synthesis. US has become a&#xD;
      widely used research technique to quantify muscle wasting showing remarkable accuracy and&#xD;
      reliability with strong clinimetric properties and excellent intra- and interobserver&#xD;
      reliability in healthy people measured by clinicians with no previous experience in US45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower limbs muscles are prone to early atrophy, showed by a greater decrease of thickness&#xD;
      within the first five days of admission to the intensive care unit compared with upper limbs,&#xD;
      making these muscles a good target for muscle mass assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quadriceps femoris is a group of muscles composed by three vastus muscles (medialis,&#xD;
      intermedius, and lateralis) and the RF. The latter one presents a proximal insertion in the&#xD;
      anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) and other insertion in the supra-acetabular sulcus. The&#xD;
      quadriceps femoris is distally inserted in the tibial tuberosity by a common ligament and is&#xD;
      a hip flexor and a knee extensor. Before starting, make sure the patient is in supine&#xD;
      position with extended knees and toes pointing to the ceiling. This is the most used position&#xD;
      in this kind of measurements. This position helps the practitioner to place the patient in&#xD;
      the AIIS Patella 1/2 AIIS Patella 1/2 1/3 1/3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific technique technique has been proposed: using a non-stretchable measuring tape,&#xD;
      trace an imaginary line in the anterior part of the thigh from the AIIS to the midpoint of&#xD;
      the proximal border of the patella and mark the middle and one third point between these two&#xD;
      references which easily give us access to the RF and VI. The reason to use de AIIS and not&#xD;
      the anterior superior iliac spine is because using the exact middle point of the muscle helps&#xD;
      us to find its thickest part using as reference the insertion points of this muscle (RF) and&#xD;
      the reason to use a third of the distance will be discussed latter. To obtain a&#xD;
      cross-sectional image, the transducer must be oriented transversally to the longitudinal axis&#xD;
      (the imaginary line marked before) of the thigh forming a 90∘ angle in relation to the skin&#xD;
      surface. Tilting or moving the probe from its original position and angle will contribute to&#xD;
      obtaining an incorrect measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The aim of the present study is to investigate and compare the diaphragmatic&#xD;
      thickness and the cross sectional area of the rectus assessed with ultrasound using the above&#xD;
      mentioned methodology and the data collected from BIVA as well as the nutritional and&#xD;
      anthropometrics parameters routinely used in clinical practice. The investigators will study&#xD;
      consecutive mechanically ventilated patients admitted in the ICU of our teaching hospital.&#xD;
      The investigators will screen each consecutive patient who required mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      for at least 72 hours. Non-inclusion criteria will be age &lt;18 years, pregnancy, prevision of&#xD;
      ICU stays less than 7 days, history/diagnosis of neuromuscular disease. Within the first 24&#xD;
      hours of ICU admission (T1), patients will be evaluated with muscular ultrasonography&#xD;
      comprehensive of diaphragm thickness and rectus femoris (medial vastus) cross-sectional area.&#xD;
      At the same time, anthropometric measure will be collected (such as body height, ideal body&#xD;
      weight, real body weight declared, right arm circumference) as well as BIVA measure (Xc, R,&#xD;
      PA, lean body weight and % of extracellular body weight) and biochemical analysis (inclusive&#xD;
      albumin, pre-albumin, blood count, lymphocyte count, magnesium, phosphorus, reticulocytes,&#xD;
      renal and hepatic function test). The day after, the fluid balance will be calculated as well&#xD;
      as the nitrogen balance. All the same measures will be repeated at day 3 (T3) and 7 days&#xD;
      (T7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of the study is to evaluate the derived BIVA parameters, especially the&#xD;
      variation of PA, within the first week after ICU admission. The secondary outcomes are to&#xD;
      evaluate the BIVA parameters variations and the &quot;central&quot; and &quot;peripheral&quot; muscular&#xD;
      sonographic parameters as well as the anthropometric and biochemical nutritional indexes and&#xD;
      their eventually correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using Stata/SE 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station) statistical software&#xD;
      package. Normality will be assessed by the Shapiro-Francia test. Results will be reported as&#xD;
      mean¬ ± standard deviation if normally distributed, or median [25-75th percentiles]&#xD;
      otherwise. Comparison between related variables will be performed by paired Student's t-test&#xD;
      or Wilcoxon sign-rank test, as needed. Two-tailed p values less than 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant. The computation of the study power is based on the primary&#xD;
      outcome. In a previous study, Kim and colleagues49 evaluated the variation of the PA in&#xD;
      critically illness patients and the mean PA value was 3.5±1.5. Assuming a variation of 20% of&#xD;
      the PA within the first week, a total sample size of 97 patients is calculated for 80% power&#xD;
      at a 5% significance level.&#xD;
