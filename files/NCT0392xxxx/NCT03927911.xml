      Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to compare postsurgical opioid&#xD;
      consumption through 72 hours postsurgery in patients receiving local infiltration analgesia&#xD;
      (LIA) with EXPAREL and bupivacaine HCl (EXPAREL group) with that of patients receiving&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) (control group) in adult subjects undergoing posterior lumbar spine&#xD;
      surgeries where both groups are receiving a multimodal pain regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare safety and effectiveness outcomes following LIA with EXPAREL and bupivacaine&#xD;
           hydrochloride (HCl) versus SOC in adult subjects undergoing posterior lumbar spine&#xD;
           surgeries through 72 hours, including time to first opioid and opioid-related adverse&#xD;
           events (ORAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare health outcomes following LIA with EXPAREL and bupivacaine hydrochloride (HCl)&#xD;
           versus SOC in adult subjects undergoing posterior lumbar spine surgeries, including&#xD;
           discharge readiness, hospital (or other facility) length of stay (LOS), discharge&#xD;
           disposition, hospital readmissions, and health service utilization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, multicenter, prospective, active-controlled, real world, study in&#xD;
      approximately 225 adult subjects undergoing posterior lumbar spine surgery under general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to surgery; screening on the day of surgery&#xD;
      will be allowed but is discouraged. If a subject can only be screened on the day of surgery,&#xD;
      the informed consent process must still be started at least 24 hours prior to the conduct of&#xD;
      any screening procedures that are not considered SOC at the institution and such procedures&#xD;
      may not be performed until written informed consent is provided. All screening procedures&#xD;
      that are not SOC must be performed and documented within the 30-day time window (inclusive of&#xD;
      the day of surgery for those subjects who can only be screened on the day of surgery) as&#xD;
      described here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit, subjects will be assessed for any past or present medical&#xD;
      conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude them from study&#xD;
      participation. After the ICF is signed, the following information will be recorded and&#xD;
      procedures done: medical history, surgical history, medication history, the subject's opioid&#xD;
      use history will be recorded to calculate mean daily mg oral morphine equivalent dosing (MED&#xD;
      PO) in the last 30 days, demographic and background information, height, weight and body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), a urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential, and the subject's&#xD;
      current adverse experiences (AEs), if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked questions and/or be asked to fill forms as part of the following&#xD;
      assessments: Brief Pain Inventory - short form (BPI-sf), 5-item Opioid Compliance Checklist&#xD;
      (OCC), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Survey of Pain Attitudes (SOPA), Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS) ti assess pain and Opioid Related Symptom Distress Scale (ORSDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the planned surgical procedure, subjects will be placed in one of three cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 - Open lumbar spinal fusion technique; (&quot;open&quot; cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 - Minimally invasive tubular and/or percutaneous pedicle screw insertion for&#xD;
           lumbar decompression with or without fusion;(&quot;tubular/percutaneous without midline&#xD;
           incision&quot; cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3 - Lumbar decompression surgery (LDS) without fusion (discectomy or laminectomy&#xD;
           outpatient cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial sample size in each study cohort (i.e., cohort 1, cohort 2 and cohort 3) is&#xD;
      estimated at 75 subjects (50 subjects with EXPAREL and 25 subjects with Control group), for a&#xD;
      total of 225 subjects in all three cohorts. Within each assigned cohort, subjects will be&#xD;
      allocated in a 2:1 ratio to the EXPAREL (50 subjects) and Control group (25 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following sequence will be followed for all cohorts: First, the subjects who meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be treated according to the institution's SOC. Their data will be&#xD;
      collected prospectively. Next, at each investigational site, the administration of EXPAREL&#xD;
      and bupivacaine HCl to the first 1 to 3 subjects in each cohort will be observed to ensure&#xD;
      that the correct procedure for infiltration as described in the infiltration guide is being&#xD;
      followed. If the infiltration was performed correctly, the subject will be included in the&#xD;
      study. If the infiltration was performed incorrectly, the subject will continue in the study&#xD;
      but will be removed from statistical analysis and will be replaced to ensure at least 50&#xD;
      evaluable EXPAREL patients are enrolled per cohort. If subjects are discontinued for other&#xD;
      reasons, they will be replaced such that a total sample size of 75 fully evaluable subjects&#xD;
      is obtained in each study cohort, with 50 in the EXPAREL group and 25 in the Control group.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to protocol feasibility given the rapid evolution of medical practice for spinal procedure.&#xD;
    Data from approximately 65 FUSION study subjects will be analyzed with the intent to create&#xD;
    either a future study or registry for this patient population.&#xD;
