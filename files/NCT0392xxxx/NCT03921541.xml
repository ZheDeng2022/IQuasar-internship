      CAEB1102-300A is a multi-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of pegzilarginase in patients with ARG1-D. This study will&#xD;
      consist of a screening period; a randomized, double-blind treatment period; a long-term&#xD;
      extension; and a follow up visit for final safety assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to treatment following completion of all screening assessments&#xD;
      and confirmation of study eligibility in a 2:1 ratio to receive weekly IV infusions of&#xD;
      pegzilarginase plus individualized disease management (IDM) or placebo plus IDM during the&#xD;
      24-week double blind treatment period. After completion of the 24-week double-blind treatment&#xD;
      period, each subject will enter the long term, open-label extension, the first 8 weeks of&#xD;
      which are blinded. During the long-term extension, all subjects receive pegzilarginase plus&#xD;
      IDM. After 8 weeks of the LTE study, patients have the option to receive treatment by&#xD;
      subcutaneous administration (SC).&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are eligible to be included in the study only if all the following criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject and/or parent/guardian provides written informed consent/assent, which&#xD;
             includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed&#xD;
             consent form (ICF) and in this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A current diagnosis of ARG1 D as documented in medical records, which must include 1&#xD;
             of the following: elevated plasma arginine levels, a mutation analysis that results in&#xD;
             a pathogenic variant, or reduced RBC arginase activity. For entry into this study,&#xD;
             subjects must also fulfill the following plasma arginine criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The average of all measured values of plasma arginine during the screening period&#xD;
                  prior to the randomization visit (Visit 1, Study Day 1) is ≥ 250 µmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If a subject is re-screened, the only values that are considered for eligibility&#xD;
                  assessment are those in the current screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must be ≥ 2 years of age on the date of informed consent/assent&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject must be assessable for clinically meaningful within-subject change&#xD;
             (clinical response) on at least one component of one assessment included in the key&#xD;
             secondary/other secondary endpoints. To be considered assessable, the subject must be&#xD;
             able to complete the assessment, and must have a baseline deficit in at least one&#xD;
             component as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have received documented confirmation from the investigator and/or dietician that the&#xD;
             subject can maintain their diet in accordance with dietary information presented in&#xD;
             the protocol, ie, can maintain the current level of protein consumption, including&#xD;
             natural protein and EAA supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects receiving ammonia scavenger therapy, anti-epileptic drugs, and/or medications&#xD;
             for spasticity (eg, baclofen) must be on a stable dose of the medication for at least&#xD;
             4 weeks prior to randomization and be willing to remain on a stable dose during the&#xD;
             double-blind portion and blinded follow-up portions of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female and male subjects may participate. Female subjects of childbearing potential&#xD;
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test during the screening period before receiving&#xD;
             the first dose of study treatment, and a negative urine pregnancy test on the day of&#xD;
             the first dose, prior to the first dose. If the subject (male or female) is engaging&#xD;
             in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, must be surgically sterile,&#xD;
             postmenopausal (no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause or a high&#xD;
             FSH level in the postmenopausal range in women not using hormonal contraception or&#xD;
             hormonal replacement therapy), or must agree to use a highly effective method of birth&#xD;
             control during the study and for a minimum of 30 days after the last study drug&#xD;
             administration. Highly effective methods of contraception include: combined (estrogen&#xD;
             and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
             ovulation; progesterone-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
             ovulation; intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); or&#xD;
             abstinence (refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk&#xD;
             associated with study treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Hyperammonemic episode (defined as an event in which a subject has an ammonia level&#xD;
             ≥100 µM with one or more symptoms related to hyperammonemia requiring hospitalization&#xD;
             or emergency room management) within the 6 weeks before the first dose of study drug&#xD;
             is administered&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active infection requiring anti-infective therapy within 3 weeks prior to first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or&#xD;
             hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Extreme mobility deficit, defined as either the inability to be assessed on the GFAQ&#xD;
             or a score of 1 on the GFAQ&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Other medical conditions or comorbidities that, in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             would interfere with study compliance or data interpretation (eg, severe intellectual&#xD;
             disability precluding required study assessments)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has participated in a previous interventional study with pegzilarginase&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has a history of hypersensitivity to polyethylene glycol (PEG) that, in the judgment&#xD;
             of the investigator, puts the subject at unacceptable risk for adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject is being treated with botulinum toxin-containing regimens or plans to initiate&#xD;
             such regimens during the double-blind or blinded follow-up portions of the study or&#xD;
             received surgical or botulinum-toxin treatment for spasticity-related complications&#xD;
             within the 16 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Is currently participating in another therapeutic clinical trial or has received any&#xD;
             investigational agent within 30 days (or 5 half-lives whichever is longer) prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of study treatment in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Previous liver or hematopoietic transplant procedure.&#xD;
