    <textblock>
      This phase 3 study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of&#xD;
      lorecivivint injected intra-articularly (IA) into the target knee (most painful) joint of&#xD;
      moderately to severely symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) subjects at a single dose of 0.07 mg&#xD;
      lorecivivint per 2 mL injection. This study will utilize radiographs and patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes (PROs) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorecivivint.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluate change from baseline OA function in the target knee as assessed by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) physical function subscore (WOMAC Function). The WOMAC is a widely-used, proprietary outcome measurement tool used to evaluate the condition of subjects with OA of the knee and hip, including pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), and physical functioning (17 questions) of the joints. Each question is measured on a scale from 0 (lowest pain/lowest stiffness/highest function) to 4 (highest pain/highest stiffness/lowest function). The WOMAC Function subscore ranges from 0 to 68.</description>

The Patient Global Assessment is an 11-point [0-10] Numeric Rating Scale [NRS] on which the subjects will rate how they feel their target knee OA is doing, considering all the ways in which their target knee OA may affect them. The NRS is anchored by descriptors at each end (&quot;Very Good&quot; on the left and &quot;Very Bad&quot; on the right).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate change from baseline in HRQOL as assessed by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health). Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. A score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
