  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders affect over a quarter of the population, yet very little is known about the&#xD;
      variables that predict treatment outcome. The planned study explores whether a patient's&#xD;
      response to a physiological test involving inhalation of carbon dioxide predicts their&#xD;
      response to exposure therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety Sensitivity (AS) refers to an individual's fear of experiencing anxiety-related&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g., dyspnea or heart palpitations) and is a core construct underlying the&#xD;
      initiation and maintenance of pathological anxiety. Recent evidence suggests that reducing AS&#xD;
      may be critical for the prevention and treatment of anxiety across diagnostic categories.&#xD;
      Exposure therapy, an important component of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), is one of the&#xD;
      most effective treatments for reducing AS, and has been shown to improve symptoms across a&#xD;
      number of different anxiety disorders. Meta-analyses reveal an approximately 50% treatment&#xD;
      response rate, with the remaining half of patients showing either no response or dropping out&#xD;
      of treatment early. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research exploring which variables&#xD;
      predict treatment outcome and there are currently no tests for predicting which patients&#xD;
      would benefit the most from exposure therapy. In this study, participants will complete two&#xD;
      sessions of a carbon dioxide (CO2) habituation paradigm, a safe and noninvasive physiological&#xD;
      test that entails repeated exposures to single vital capacity inhalations of 20% CO2. Both&#xD;
      CO2 testing sessions will be completed within a 72-hour time period. Patients then complete a&#xD;
      10-week group-based exposure therapy to determine whether an individual's degree of&#xD;
      habituation to CO2 predicts treatment outcome.&#xD;
