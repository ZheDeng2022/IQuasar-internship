      Several previous studies have investigated the impact of a pharmacists-provided medication&#xD;
      reconciliation service on medication discrepancies in the hospital settings Results showed&#xD;
      that pharmacists were able to identify a range of 1.5-2.3 unintentional discrepancies per&#xD;
      patient, leading to a significant reduction of 40-75% of the total identified medication&#xD;
      discrepancies. No previous study has investigated the outcomes of involving the clinical&#xD;
      pharmacist in a medication reconciliation service in in Jordan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acknowledging the importance of evaluating the value of medication reconciliation services in&#xD;
      the different healthcare settings, this study is designed with the aim to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of pharmacists directed services (reconciliation plus counseling) on reducing medication&#xD;
      discrepancies and improving patient's outcomes at discharge.&#xD;

      Impact of Pharmacists Directed Medication Reconciliation on Reducing Medication Discrepancies&#xD;
      in a Surgery Ward in an Educational Hospital in Jordan&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Introduction Medication reconciliation is a technique used by healthcare providers at&#xD;
           different care settings in order to prevent medication errors. According to the&#xD;
           Institute for Safe Medication Practices Canada, medication reconciliation is defined as&#xD;
           &quot;a formal process in which healthcare providers work together with patients, families&#xD;
           and care providers to ensure accurate and comprehensive medication information is&#xD;
           communicated consistently across transitions of care&quot;. ISMP Canada has described the&#xD;
           process of medication reconciliation as &quot; a systematic and comprehensive review of&#xD;
           patient's Best Possible Medication History (BPMH) to identify any possible medication&#xD;
           discrepancies and to inform and enable prescribers to make the most appropriate&#xD;
           prescribing decisions for the patient to solve identified discrepancies&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pharmacists are the healthcare providers responsible for providing optimal&#xD;
           pharmaceutical care services. Regular medication review and medication reconciliation,&#xD;
           beside the development of patient care plan, are considered as important pharmaceutical&#xD;
           care tools.The Institute of Medicine reports acknowledged pharmacists as an essential&#xD;
           resource of information on medication safe use, and their vital participation during&#xD;
           hospital rounds as it improves medication safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Currently, all hospitals have a pharmacy department to ensure that all patients receive&#xD;
           their medications in the correct way by implementing the eight rights of medication&#xD;
           administration (right patient, right medication, right dose, right route, right time,&#xD;
           right documentation, right reason and right response). Clinical pharmacists can ideally&#xD;
           influence physicians on their prescribing of medicines because they have the appropriate&#xD;
           knowledge regarding therapeutics and are in continuous contact with them.Pharmacists&#xD;
           have an important role in reducing discharge medical errors and patients'&#xD;
           re-hospitalization.[6] Clinical pharmacists were found aware of the importance of their&#xD;
           role in providing medication reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several previous studies have investigated the impact of a pharmacists-provided&#xD;
           medication reconciliation service on medication discrepancies in the hospital settings&#xD;
           Results showed that pharmacists were able to identify a range of 1.5-2.3 unintentional&#xD;
           discrepancies per patient, leading to a significant reduction of 40-75% of the total&#xD;
           identified medication discrepancies. No previous study has investigated the outcomes of&#xD;
           involving the clinical pharmacist in a medication reconciliation service in in Jordan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acknowledging the importance of evaluating the value of medication reconciliation&#xD;
           services in the different healthcare settings, this study is designed with the aim to&#xD;
           evaluate the effect of pharmacists directed services (reconciliation plus counseling) on&#xD;
           reducing medication discrepancies and improving patient's outcomes at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods 2.1. Study Design, participants and clinical setting This randomized controlled&#xD;
           study will be conducted over three months at the Jordan University Hospital (JUH), a 550&#xD;
           beds tertiary teaching hospital located in Amman, the capital of Jordan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, 128 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria will be approached&#xD;
      and asked to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria are: age â‰¥18 years; using at least&#xD;
      4 regular pre-admission medications; with more than 48 hours expected length of stay in the&#xD;
      hospital; speaks Arabic; has no cognitive deficiency, and not involved in any other clinical&#xD;
      trial. Patients will be excluded if they were in isolation; discharged within 24 hours of&#xD;
      admission; discharged against medical advice; unable or unwilling to provide written informed&#xD;
      consent; unable to provide a personal phone number; also patients who were enrolled were&#xD;
      ineligible for re-inclusion in the study if they were admitted to JUH a second time during&#xD;
      the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the Jordan University Hospital&#xD;
      (JUH) was obtained (Reference number: 65/2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Sample Size Calculation Setting alpha at 0.05, power of 80%, and using effect size of 0.5&#xD;
      (medium value), the minimum Required sample size to obtain a significant difference was&#xD;
      calculated as 64 subjects per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account the possibility for dropout during the study period, a sample size of 128&#xD;
      patients is selected in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Data collection and identification of medication discrepancies Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      from all internal medicine department subdivisions at JUH. For each recruited patient, a&#xD;
      pre-prepared validated data collection form will be used for data collection.Patients'&#xD;
      specific data including demographic data, administrative data, medical related data, and&#xD;
      BPMH. BPMH including pre-admission medications will be collected from the patients' medical&#xD;
      records, followed by interviewing the patient (or their caregivers), and finally by&#xD;
      interviewing the responsible clinicians (details about data collection are presented in a&#xD;
      previously published study. For each patient, comorbidity will be calculated using Charlson&#xD;
      Comorbidity Index (CCI). This index represents a tool that will be used to predict the ten&#xD;
      year mortality rate in individuals with comorbid conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following data collection, a comparison between patients' current admission medications and&#xD;
      patient's pre-admission medications will be done to identify any discrepancies between the&#xD;
      two medication lists. Discrepancies will be categorized into dose discrepancies, frequency&#xD;
      discrepancies, addition of a new drug, duplication of drugs, omission of drugs, or using&#xD;
      wrong drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identified discrepancies will then be classified into documented or undocumented&#xD;
      discrepancies. Documented discrepancies are defined as any change in medications that was&#xD;
      justified in the patient's medical file. If the discrepancy is undocumented, the pharmacist&#xD;
      will review the differences with the clinician in order to verify if the changes are&#xD;
      intentional or made by error. In case of intentional discrepancies, the problem will be&#xD;
      recorded as a 'documentation error'. Otherwise, unintentional discrepancies will be&#xD;
      considered as 'medication errors'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unintentional discrepancies (medication errors) are classified into three classes based on&#xD;
      the level of their seriousness as described by Cornish and others: &quot;class 1 discrepancies are&#xD;
      those unlikely to cause patient discomfort or clinical deterioration. Class 2 discrepancies&#xD;
      are those with the potential to cause moderate discomfort or clinical deterioration, and&#xD;
      class 3 discrepancies are those with the potential to cause severe discomfort or clinical&#xD;
      deterioration&quot;. Discrepancies are classified by the two researchers of the study, and in the&#xD;
      case of disagreement on classification, the discrepancy will be discussed until consensus is&#xD;
      reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Pharmacist delivered intervention Following medication discrepancy identification,&#xD;
      patients will be divided randomly into two groups, intervention and control. Patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to their groups based on Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 22&#xD;
      generated random table for assignment (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in the intervention group, upon identification of drug discrepancies, pharmacist&#xD;
      responsible for enrollment will be intervened by contacting the responsible clinician using a&#xD;
      structured written consult form. The number of accepted recommendations by the clinicians&#xD;
      will be documented and recorded. When the researcher suggests resolving an identified&#xD;
      discrepancy and the responsible clinicians accept the suggestion will be called an accepted&#xD;
      recommendation (just an acceptance without any correction), if the accepted suggestion is&#xD;
      implemented then this will be called implemented recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At discharge, the number of medication discrepancies will be assessed again for both groups.&#xD;
      Also, the pharmacist provided intervention group patients with education about their&#xD;
      medications, including: information about efficacy/side effects of medications, proper use&#xD;
      and storage of medications, the importance of adherence, medication changes will be made&#xD;
      while in hospital (i.e. reviewing pre-admission medications vs. medications at discharge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of carry-over effect of pharmacists' intervention on the number of&#xD;
      discrepancies over months will be also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Statistical analysis Data will be entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for&#xD;
      Social Science (SPSS) version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive analysis will be&#xD;
      done using mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables, and percentage for&#xD;
      categorical variables. Checking for normality will be carried out using Shapiro-Wilk test,&#xD;
      with P-value â‰¥ 0.05, indicating normally distributed continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group differences between control and intervention groups will be conducted using independent&#xD;
      sample t-test/Mann Whitney U test (depending on data normality) or by using Chi-Square/Fisher&#xD;
      exact test when appropriate. A paired t-test/Wilcoxon sign rank test will be performed to&#xD;
      ascertain whether pharmacist's recommendations are effective in reducing the number of&#xD;
      medication discrepancies An analysis of trend will be carried out using One-Way ANOVA to&#xD;
      evaluate the trend in change of the number of discrepancies over the study period (to&#xD;
      evaluate the carry-over study effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A P-value of less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant and all tests are two&#xD;
      tailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Conflict of interest None of the authors have any conflict of interest.&#xD;
