  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to validate a ventricular pacing test as a predictor of preload&#xD;
      dependency in post cardiac surgery patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the immediate postoperative period of cardiac surgery and in intensive care unit (ICU), a&#xD;
      systemic arterial hypotension is frequently observed. This hypotension is often due to&#xD;
      hypovolemia but also to pump dysfunction and/or vasoplegia. Early recognition of the&#xD;
      hypotensive mechanism is necessary because it requires immediate specific treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of a vascular filling is usually estimated by a preload dependence test (fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness), showing an increase in the stroke volume when preload is increased according&#xD;
      to the Starling the law of the heart. To date, a preload dependency test is usually performed&#xD;
      by passive leg raise (PLR) or by measuring the respiratory pulse variation (ΔPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PLR response varies according to the legs venous volume and capacitance. The derivation&#xD;
      of ΔPP has been validated in patients intubated, sedated, and ventilated in standard&#xD;
      conditions, in sinus rhythm but the ΔPP directly displayed by the monitors is unreliable and&#xD;
      the manual calculation on pressure curve is fastidious. Faced with these difficulties, the&#xD;
      trend is to realize a blind filling with physiologic saline solution and to judge his&#xD;
      interest on clinical and / or hemodynamic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After cardiac surgery, ventricular epicardial electrodes are systematically placed allowing a&#xD;
      temporary stimulation by an external pacemaker in case of postoperative atrio-ventricular&#xD;
      blocks. The ventricular stimulation without atrial pacing (VESAP) leads to a loss of the&#xD;
      atrial systole and therefore a decrease in the left ventricular preload. During the&#xD;
      functional test of epicardial electrodes at a frequency greater than the patient's, it is&#xD;
      possible to observe in certain circumstances a decrease of the arterial blood pressure, but&#xD;
      of varying importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suspect that the eventual fall in blood pressure during a ventricular&#xD;
      pacing test, could be correlated with preload dependence. Therefore, investigator hypothesize&#xD;
      that ventricular pacing can be used to realize a functional testing of preload dependence,&#xD;
      easy to achieve. Indeed, if doctors admit that during a brief ventricular stimulation, heart&#xD;
      rate and systemic vascular resistance remain unchanged, the drop in blood pressure should&#xD;
      reflect the decrease in stroke volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate that the response to VESAP can predict the&#xD;
      preload dependence of patients after a cardiac surgery. The primary endpoint will study the&#xD;
      predictive value of the change in blood pressure during the VESAP and the change in stroke&#xD;
      volume after an infusion of 500 cc of crystalloid solution. Secondary endpoints will 1)&#xD;
      compare the predictive values of the VESAP and ΔPP; 2) look for pertinent VESAP threshold in&#xD;
      correlation with the expected increase in stroke volume; and 3) collection of the possible&#xD;
      complications due to the VESAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients will be enrolled in this monocentric, open label, non-randomized study.&#xD;
