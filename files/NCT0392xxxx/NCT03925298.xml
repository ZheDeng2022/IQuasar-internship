  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated level of serum troponin (T-I) has been regarded as a prognostic biomarker of poor&#xD;
      outcome in acute ischemic stroke. However, its role in outcome in thrombolysed ischemic&#xD;
      stroke patients remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of T-I as a&#xD;
      predictive biomarker of short-term outcome in thrombolysed ischemic stroke participants.&#xD;

      Elevated level of serum troponin (T-I) has been regarded as a prognostic biomarker of poor&#xD;
      outcome in acute ischemic stroke. However, its role in outcome in thrombolysed ischemic&#xD;
      stroke patients remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of T-I as a&#xD;
      predictive biomarker of short-term outcome in thrombolysed ischemic stroke patients. Methods:&#xD;
      This study included 72 acute ischemic stroke participants were treated with intravenous&#xD;
      thrombolytic therapy. All participants were subjected to general and neurological evaluation&#xD;
      including assessment of stroke severity using National Institute of Health Stroke Scale&#xD;
      (NIHSS) at admission and investigations including measurement of serum level of T-I on&#xD;
      admission. Outcome was assessed three months after stroke onset using NIHSS and modified&#xD;
      Rankin scale (mRS).&#xD;

      Serum troponin I (T-I) was collected at hospital admission at the emergency department,&#xD;
      before any treatment. Serum samples from patients were drawn using standard venipuncture&#xD;
      techniques. Blood samples were left to clot for 4 hours at room temperature, then centrifuged&#xD;
      to obtain the serum which was stored frozen at (-20C). Serum T-I levels were quantified in an&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay technology (ELISA) following manufacturer's instructions&#xD;
      (ALPCO, 26G Keewaydin Drive, Salem NH03079, USA). Upper reference limit for apparently&#xD;
      healthy individuals is &lt;0.01μg/l.&#xD;

        Eighty one thrombolysed ischemic stroke patients were enrolled in this study. Participants&#xD;
        who did not complete the study (9 Participants were lost during follow up) were eliminated.&#xD;
        So the study included seventy two Participants (34 males and 38 females) who fulfilled the&#xD;
        inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
