      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of replacing starchy vegetables and&#xD;
      refined grains with beef in a vegetarian diet on cardio-metabolic disease risk factors in&#xD;
      adults in a cross-over, randomized controlled feeding trial. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      isocalorically replacing predominantly starchy vegetables and refined grains with 6 oz. of&#xD;
      beef/day will enhance improvements in cardiometabolic disease risk factors, particularly&#xD;
      atherosclerotic-promoting lipids and lipoproteins. It is also hypothesized that participant&#xD;
      satisfaction and acceptance of a healthy eating pattern with 6 oz. of beef per day will be&#xD;
      higher compared to without beef.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 16-week randomized, cross-over, controlled, single-blind study. During weeks 1 and 11, participant's usual, unrestricted dietary intakes will be assessed. At week 2, they will be randomized and assigned to consume either the controlled lacto-ovo vegetarian diet or beef diet for the first 5-week dietary intervention during weeks 2-6. They will consume the other diet during weeks 12-16. Two fasting-state serum samples and one stool samples will be collected during study weeks 1,6,11, and 16.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The hypothesis is that substituting starchy vegetables and refined grain with lean unprocessed beef in a plant based eating pattern will result in greater reduction in the concentrations of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and total apolipoprotein B, but greater increase in concentration of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol.</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire score of consumer satisfaction of a plant-based eating pattern</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The hypothesis is that substituting starchy vegetables and refined grain with lean unprocessed beef in a plant-based eating pattern will result in a higher score of consumer satisfaction using the Dietary Satisfaction Questionnaire designed by study investigators. The Dietary Satisfaction Questionnaire is a six-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. The questionnaire includes 23 questions on overall satisfaction of different aspects of the intervention diets, such as fullness after meals, enjoyment of study foods, and impact of study foods on personal well-being. The Likert scale will be matched to numerical values for scoring (0=strongly disagree, 1=disagree, 2=slightly disagree, 3=slightly agree, 4=agree, 5=strongly agree). Total score ranges from 0 to 115 and higher score represents higher dietary satisfaction.</description>
