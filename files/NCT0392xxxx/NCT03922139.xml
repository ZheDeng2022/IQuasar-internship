    <textblock>
      After diagnosis of Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome (CECS), the participants will be&#xD;
      referred to both physical therapy and Botox injection. In physical therapy, the therapist&#xD;
      will perform strength measurements of the lower leg (ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion)&#xD;
      which will be repeated 2 months following the injection. An ultrasound-guided injection of 50&#xD;
      units of Botox will be administered into the tibialis anterior. 25 units will be injected&#xD;
      into two different spots in the muscle one being more proximal and the other distal. This&#xD;
      will be a one-time injection and will be observed as to how it effects participant symptoms&#xD;
      over the next 6 months at either a clinic visit (at 2 months) or telephone call (at 4 and 6&#xD;
      months after injection) via the University of Wisconsin Running Index. Two months following&#xD;
      the injection, the participant will undergo repeat measurements of strength using the Kiio&#xD;
      Force Sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should potential participants of childbearing potential wish to enroll in the study, a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test will be performed prior to enrollment; participants will not be enrolled if&#xD;
      test is positive.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) is an overuse injury first described by Mavor&#xD;
      in 1956 that typically affects young endurance athletes, classically distance runners. CECS&#xD;
      occurs primarily in the lower leg, predominantly in the anterior compartment, although it has&#xD;
      been reported elsewhere in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of CECS is not completely understood. Similar to acute compartment&#xD;
      syndrome, it is thought to result from increased pressure within the restrictions of the&#xD;
      fascial planes of a muscle compartment. Exercise increases blood flow to active muscles&#xD;
      causing them to expand. If constricted by surrounding noncompliant fascia, such swelling&#xD;
      increases pressure within the muscle compartment. Ultimately, pressure within the compartment&#xD;
      reduces blood flow leading to muscle ischemia and pain when metabolic demands cannot be met.&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated decreased blood flow and oxygenation in the legs of&#xD;
      symptomatic patients with CECS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cessation of inciting activities resolves symptoms in most cases of CECS. Without this&#xD;
      cessation, the prognosis for CECS is poor if treated non-operatively. Should symptoms&#xD;
      continue, patients are referred for possible muscle compartment release, currently the most&#xD;
      widely accepted treatment approach despite a significant number of treatment failures. To&#xD;
      date, no alternative non-operative approach has successfully treated refractory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been hypothesized that botulinum toxin could reduce intramuscular pressure&#xD;
      in CECS . Isner-Horoboti et al, performed abobotulinum toxin A injections into the anterior&#xD;
      and anterior/lateral compartments in 16 individuals with a mean follow up of 4.4 months&#xD;
      (range 3-6 months). Fifteen (95%) patients were asymptomatic after intervention with fourteen&#xD;
      (88%) exhibiting normalized post-exercise compartment pressures. Using manual muscle testing,&#xD;
      they determined that 11 patients displayed decreased strength though did not produce&#xD;
      noticeable subjective weakness. A later case report by Baria and Sellon presented the first&#xD;
      long-term follow up (14 months) of a CECS case treated with botulinum toxin injections&#xD;
      (Botox) in which the patient reported continued pain relief and had resumed her active&#xD;
      lifestyle without adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed investigation will aim to build upon the results of existing studies. The&#xD;
      novelty of this approach involves a differing dosage of the toxin (Botox) into a more&#xD;
      targeted muscle group, specifically the tibialis anterior, while also utilizing a smaller&#xD;
      dosage than in previous studies. Further, while previous studies have used manual muscle&#xD;
      testing to test strength, many studies have found this method unreliable. As such, a Kiio&#xD;
      force sensor will be used at multiple time points to determine weakness quantitatively.&#xD;
      Lastly, the reliable and validated University of Wisconsin Running Index will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate return to sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After diagnosis of CECS, the participants will be referred to both physical therapy and Botox&#xD;
      injection. In physical therapy, the therapist will perform strength measurements of the lower&#xD;
      leg (ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion) which will be repeated 2 months following the&#xD;
      injection. An ultrasound-guided injection of 50 units of Botox into the tibialis anterior&#xD;
      will be performed. 25 units will be injected into two different spots in the muscle, one&#xD;
      being more proximal and the other distal. This will be a one-time injection that will be&#xD;
      monitored to see how it effects participant symptoms over the next 6 months at either a&#xD;
      clinic visit (at 2 months) or telephone call (at 4 and 6 months after injection) via the&#xD;
      University of Wisconsin Running Index. Two months following the injection, the participant&#xD;
      will undergo repeat measurements of strength using the Kiio Force Sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should potential participants be of childbearing potential wish to enroll in the study, a&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to enrollment; participants will not be enrolled&#xD;
      if test is positive.&#xD;
