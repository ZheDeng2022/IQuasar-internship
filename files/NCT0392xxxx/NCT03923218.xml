      The aims of our study were 1) to evaluate levels of gingival crevicular fluid( GCF) human&#xD;
      cathelicidin peptide LL-37 and serum vitamin D3 in smoker and non-smoker patients with&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis(CP) 2) to determine whether any correlation between GCF LL-37 and&#xD;
      vitamin D3 serum levels exist and 3) to asses the correlation between clinical parameters and&#xD;
      biochemical markers&#xD;

      Background: Cathelicidin LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide, is part of the host innate immune&#xD;
      response in the oral cavity. The aims of this study are to evaluate; gingival crevicular&#xD;
      fluid (GCF) levels of LL-37, serum vitamin D3 levels and periodontal clinical recordings in&#xD;
      smoker and nonsmoker patients with chronic periodontitis (CP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consisted a total of 60 volunteers including 20 smoker patients with CP (CP-1&#xD;
      group), 20 non-smoker patients with CP (CP-2 group) and 20 periodontally healthy subjects&#xD;
      (CTRL group). Prior to participation, the design and purpose of the research were explained&#xD;
      to each subjects, and written informed consent form was obtained from 60 individuals before&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The periodontal status of the patients were determined by measuring the probing depth (PD),&#xD;
      clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI) All clinical&#xD;
      parameters were measured on six sites per tooth from the full-mouth teeth (mesiobuccal,&#xD;
      distobuccal,midbuccal, mesiolingual, distolingual and midlingual) using a William's&#xD;
      periodontal probe calibrated in millimeters by the same examiner. All samples were obtained&#xD;
      on the day following clinical examinations of the individuals. The deepest six pockets site&#xD;
      per individual were chosen for collection of GCF across both of the periodontitis groups. Six&#xD;
      pocket locations showing a lack of clinical inflammation were also tested to guarantee&#xD;
      collection of a sufficient volume of GCF across the CTRL groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCF levels of LL-37 were measured by ELISA and serum levels of vitamin D3 were analysed by&#xD;
      High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Statistical analysis were performed.&#xD;
