  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overexpression of the HER2 gene accounts for 20% to 30% of breast cancer. Although&#xD;
      trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy has become the basic treatment for patients with&#xD;
      HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, For patients who have progressed or relapsed after&#xD;
      trastuzumab treatment, There are still many issues to explore on the choice of program of&#xD;
      retargeted therapy. In HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, the results of Phase I and Phase&#xD;
      I/II trials of pyrotinib or pyrotinib combined with capecitabine show that the anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect is rapid, efficient and sustainable, and the patient is safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
      Capecitabine is an oral cytotoxic drug that has high selectivity and specificity against&#xD;
      tumors. Many patients need to adjust the dose due to adverse reactions, especially for&#xD;
      patients after multi-line treatment. Previous studies have shown that sustained low-dose&#xD;
      capecitabine reduces the adverse effects of the drug while ensuring efficacy. Based on the&#xD;
      above, this study is to conduct a single-center, one-arm phase II clinical trial to explore&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib and capecitabine in the treatment of HER2-positive&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
