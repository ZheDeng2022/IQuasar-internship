  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subchondroplasty procedure has been used to treat bone marrow edema mostly located in the&#xD;
      periarticular region of the knee. In the past few years, it has expanded its use in the foot&#xD;
      and ankle. There has, however, been very minimal research documented on its utilization in&#xD;
      that area. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the course of treatment and outcomes of&#xD;
      painful bone marrow lesions in these associated podiatric circumstances using&#xD;
      subchondroplasty. It is hypothesized that use of calcium phosphate bone substitute in the&#xD;
      foot and ankle to treat bone marrow edema will have more favorable short and long-term&#xD;
      outcomes than joint destructive and joint sparing procedures more commonly performed for&#xD;
      treatment in the past.&#xD;

      The subchondroplasty procedure has been used to treat bone marrow edema mostly located in the&#xD;
      periarticular region of the knee. In the past few years, it has expanded its use in the foot&#xD;
      and ankle. There has, however, been very minimal research documented on its utilization in&#xD;
      that area. Bone marrow edema arises from altered stresses on bones due to osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      biomechanical abnormalities, coalitions, infection, and trauma. This study aims to&#xD;
      prospectively evaluate the course of treatment and outcomes of painful bone marrow lesions in&#xD;
      these associated podiatric circumstances using subchondroplasty. This should, therefore,&#xD;
      expose this modality as a viable treatment option for bone marrow edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated in the office/clinic setting with a positive diagnosis of bone&#xD;
      marrow edema confirmed via MRI. They must have failed 3 months of conservative treatment&#xD;
      measures including, but not limited to, orthotic modifications, taping, immobilization or&#xD;
      offloading, and anti-inflammatories. The study population includes individuals over the age&#xD;
      of 18 with no significant comorbidities or previous foot and ankle surgical interventions.&#xD;
      These patients will go on to have calcium phosphate mineral compound injected into the bone&#xD;
      marrow lesions. We will track the progression of their symptoms and evaluate via Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS) pain score and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) at&#xD;
      3-month, 6-month, and 1-year follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subchondroplasty procedure is a viable treatment option for bone marrow edema in the&#xD;
      setting of altered pedal biomechanics, gait abnormalities, osteoarthritis, and trauma. It is&#xD;
      a minimally invasive procedure that maximizes positive outcomes, allows the patient to be&#xD;
      immediately weight bearing following surgery, and has short operating room times. This&#xD;
      surgical procedure is a new and innovative technique introduced to the podiatric field that&#xD;
      will allow the surgeon to intervene at an earlier stage in efforts to alleviate symptoms. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that use of calcium phosphate bone substitute in the foot and ankle to treat&#xD;
      bone marrow edema will have more favorable short and long-term outcomes than joint&#xD;
      destructive and joint sparing procedures more commonly performed for treatment in the past.&#xD;
