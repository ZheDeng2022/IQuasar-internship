  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well contrast enhanced mammography works in diagnosing patients&#xD;
      with suspicious breast findings. Diagnostic procedures, such as contrast enhanced&#xD;
      mammography, may help to reclassify findings seen on diagnostic mammography and ultrasound as&#xD;
      benign or likely benign with what would otherwise require biopsy for confirmation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary data to support the hypothesis that contrast enhanced mammography&#xD;
      (CEM) can reduce benign tissue diagnosis (FP3) and therefore improve positive predictive&#xD;
      value 3 (PPV3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify specific CEM characteristics that accurately classify a finding as benign,&#xD;
      high-risk or malignant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the positive and negative predictive values for each digital breast tomosynthesis&#xD;
      (DBT), breast ultrasound and CEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the outcomes/endpoints stratified by age to determine if age affects the&#xD;
      ability of CEM to accurately define a lesion as benign, probably benign or suspicious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo contrast enhanced mammography prior to scheduled standard of care core&#xD;
      needle biopsy of the breast on the same day or up to 3 days later.&#xD;
