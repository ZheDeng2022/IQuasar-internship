  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) surgery, one of the most successful surgical procedures&#xD;
      for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is predominantly used to manage patients&#xD;
      with moderate to severe OSA. However, limiting factors include incomplete response in some&#xD;
      cases, unfavorable facial changes as a result of large advancements, and risk of malocclusion&#xD;
      or malunion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done to determine predictors of success with MMA surgery in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe OSA. Studies have already shown the value of a remote controlled&#xD;
      mandibular positioner (RCMP) device to identify the correct level of therapeutic protrusion&#xD;
      needed with oral appliance therapy. Moreover, some patients experience a dose dependent&#xD;
      improvement in sleep parameters based on the degree of protrusion during the titration study.&#xD;
      Use of RCMP as a means to identify potential candidates for MMA, may help customize treatment&#xD;
      options for patients with OSA by providing predictive value.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of a remotely controlled mandibular protrusion (RCMP) device allows for customization&#xD;
      of treatment by titrating the extent of mandibular protrusion during a polysomnogram. Use of&#xD;
      the RCMP device has a high degree of positive and negative predictive value in determining&#xD;
      the effectiveness and degree (effective target protrusive position) of mandibular advancement&#xD;
      need with oral appliance therapy (Remmers, 2013). Preliminary data from 4 patients (Hoekena&#xD;
      2006) indicates that patients with a significant response to oral appliance therapy (&gt;50%&#xD;
      reduction in AHI) may have a better response to MMA. This study will determine the efficacy&#xD;
      of MMA in patients with moderate to severe OSA, and determine if the RCMP titration can&#xD;
      predict success or failure with MMA for treatment of OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo detailed history and physical examination by Oral &amp; Maxillofacial&#xD;
      Surgery. Those patients found to be potential candidates for jaw advancement (MMA) surgery&#xD;
      will be recruited to enroll in the study. Once consented and enrolled, study participants&#xD;
      will undergo a titration study using a remote controlled mandibular positioner (RCMP&#xD;
      titration study) to evaluate changes in polysomnographic parameters (i.e. Apnea-hypopnea&#xD;
      index and oxygen saturation) with mandibular protrusion. Patients will then undergo&#xD;
      maxillomandibular advancement surgery (MMA surgery). During MMA surgery, a standard 10 mm&#xD;
      advancement of the upper and lower jaw is performed. Slight modifications may be made to the&#xD;
      degree of advancement in order to achieve acceptable facial esthetics. Data from the RCMP&#xD;
      titration study will not affect how the MMA surgery is performed. After surgery, participants&#xD;
      will have a follow-up polysomnogram four to eight months post-operatively to assess for&#xD;
      treatment response and compared this to the predicted response based on the RCMP titration&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
