      Main Study Up to 100 subjects, both non-CF volunteers and Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients, will&#xD;
      participate in a single study visit that will include a DEXA scan, micro CT, and blood&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denosumab (Prolia) Sub study Approximately 10 adult subjects with CF who participated in the&#xD;
      main study and have results indicating bone disease will receive treatment with Denosumab for&#xD;
      up to 5 years. They will be asked to return annually for repeat DEXA scans, micro CT, and&#xD;
      blood collection.&#xD;
