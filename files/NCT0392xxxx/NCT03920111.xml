  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need for a better experimental system to understand flavivirus antibody&#xD;
      responses, beyond dengue, to make sure the investigators are using current vaccines to&#xD;
      greatest effect and to inform the development of next-generation vaccines. This study will&#xD;
      use live chimeric JE vaccine IMOJEV® as a tool for flavivirus epitope discovery. This will&#xD;
      allow experimental JEV infection using replication competent, live, attenuated virus as a&#xD;
      model, in a setting where the flavivirus infection history of humans can be tightly&#xD;
      controlled.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that in previously flavivirus-exposed individuals, the&#xD;
      antibody response is more broadly cross neutralising, and that this will lead to the&#xD;
      identification of conserved virion surface epitopes that could be the target of second&#xD;
      generation vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Primary Objectives/Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish a human model system of JEV infection in healthy adult volunteers using&#xD;
           live attenuated JE vaccine IMOJEV®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To sort and sequence individual responding B cells (plasmablasts) after vaccination with&#xD;
           IMOJEV®, and to generate human monoclonal antibodies to JEV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To generate JEV specific human monoclonal antibodies from the sequences derived in (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To describe the development, specificity, cross-reactivity and function of the T cell&#xD;
           response to IMOJEV®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To establish a sample bank for future work on cross-reactive and other responses to&#xD;
           flaviviruses, flavivirus vaccines and other emergent viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibody response after JE&#xD;
           vaccination, using serum and human monoclonal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether there are epitopes which can serve as the target of broadly&#xD;
           cross-neutralising antibody responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimentally the fine specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibody response will be&#xD;
      studied by cloning antibodies from plasmablasts (B cells responding to the vaccine) that have&#xD;
      been single cell sorted by flow cytometry then sequenced at one week post vaccine. These&#xD;
      human monoclonal antibodies will then be mapped on to the surface of the virus particle using&#xD;
      established approaches, and tested to look for cross-reactive antibodies. T cell responses to&#xD;
      the vaccine will be studied using custom pools of synthetic peptides by ELISpot and flow&#xD;
      cytometry.&#xD;
