      Phase 1, Single-Center, Dose-Escalating, Open-Label, Safety Clinical Trial of Parenteral&#xD;
      Ascorbate-Meglumine as a Novel Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Adjunctive Therapeutic for&#xD;
      Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS).&#xD;

      Phase 1, single-center, open-label study in subjects receiving SRS for brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 4 principal cohorts (n=3 in each cohort). Each cohort will receive&#xD;
      an escalating dose of ascorbate-meglumine as an MRI-detectable adjunctive therapeutic to SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a planning MRI for SRS with gadolinium- diethylenetriamine&#xD;
      penta-acetic acid (GD-DPTA) per standard of care for SRS. Forty-eight hours after the&#xD;
      planning MRI, the subjects will complete the study MRI with ascorbate-meglumine contrast&#xD;
      agent. Each cohort will receive an escalating dose of ascorbate-meglumine by intravenous&#xD;
      administration over 1 hour during the MRI. The total dose of ascorbate-meglumine-will&#xD;
      escalate from the first cohort to the next cohort in a sequential manner. During&#xD;
      ascorbate-meglumine infusion, MRI scans will be performed to evaluate the contrast effect and&#xD;
      PK blood draws will occur at defined time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return for the SRS procedure within 1 week following the planning MRI per&#xD;
      standard of care. During SRS, subjects will receive a second dose of ascorbate-meglumine as&#xD;
      an adjunctive therapeutic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will enter into a follow up phase within 2 weeks after the SRS procedure per&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety of parenteral ascorbate-meglumine as a&#xD;
      MRI-detectable adjunctive therapeutic to SRS.&#xD;
