  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 study of the combination of CPI-613 and hydroxychloroquine for the&#xD;
      treatment of high risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients who have failed a hypomethylating&#xD;
      agent.&#xD;

      Primary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the combination of CPI-613 and&#xD;
           Hydroxychloroquine therapy for patients with high risk MDS who have failed&#xD;
           hypomethylating therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the overall response rate (complete remission (CR), marrow CR, partial&#xD;
           remission (PR), Hematologic improvement (HI)) of high risk MDS patients who have failed&#xD;
           hypomethylating agents, treated with the combination of CPI-613 and the maximally&#xD;
           tolerated dose of hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of the combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess progression-free-survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the overall survival of MDS patients who have failed hypomethylating agents&#xD;
           treated with the combination of CPI-613 and hydroxychloroquine defined as the time from&#xD;
           enrolment on study to death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess any changes in the frequency of blood transfusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of hydroxychloroquine, followed by a phase&#xD;
      II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive hydroxychloroquine orally (PO) and 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5. Treatments repeat every 14 days for 2 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 3, patients&#xD;
      receive hydroxychloroquine PO and 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days&#xD;
      1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>Measurements for response criteria will be based upon the Modified International Working Group (IWG) 2006 response criteria for altering natural history of myelodysplastic syndrome. Overall response rates criteria - complete remission (CR), partial response (PR) marrow CR, hematologic improvement (HI), or stable disease, failure, relapse after complete response or partial response, cytogenetic response, disease progression and survival) of high risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients who have failed hypomethylating agents treated with the combination of CPI-613 and the maximally tolerated dose of hydroxychloroquine.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Serious medical illness, such as significant cardiac disease (e.g. symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic coronary artery&#xD;
             disease, myocardial infarction within the past 3 months, uncontrolled cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, pericardial disease or New York Heart Association Class III or IV), or&#xD;

          -  Patients with uncontrolled HIV infection. (Note: Patients with known HIV infection are&#xD;
             excluded because patients with an immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, and because there may be&#xD;
             unknown or dangerous drug interactions between CPI-613 and anti-retroviral agents used&#xD;
             to treat HIV infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received radiotherapy, surgery, treatment with cytotoxic agents&#xD;
             (except a hypomethylating agent, i.e. azacytidine or decitabine), treatment with&#xD;
             biologic agents, immunotherapy, or any other anti-cancer therapy of any kind, or any&#xD;
             other standard or investigational treatment for their cancer, or any other&#xD;
             investigational agent for any indication, within the past 2 weeks prior to initiation&#xD;
             of CPI-613 treatment.&#xD;
