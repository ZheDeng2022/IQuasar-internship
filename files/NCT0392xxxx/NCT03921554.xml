      The primary objective of this study is to assess safety as well as efficacy of baricitinib, a&#xD;
      Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor, in patients with Aicardi Goutières Syndrome (AGS), a&#xD;
      multisystem heritable disorder of the innate immunity resulting in excessive interferon&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aicardi Goutières Syndrome (AGS) is a multisystem heritable disorder of the innate immunity&#xD;
      resulting in excessive interferon production. Most characteristically, AGS manifests as an&#xD;
      early-onset encephalopathy that results in severe intellectual and physical handicap.&#xD;
      Interferon is thought to cause injury not only to the brain, but also the skin, liver, lungs,&#xD;
      heart and many other organs. Treatment with Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors offers the promise&#xD;
      of decreasing interferon signaling and limiting the morbidity of this devastating disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine if the administration of baricitinib to patients with&#xD;
      AGS results in an improvement or stability of the AGS scale at baseline at 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will include longitudinal stability of safety measures, improvement of&#xD;
      interferon signaling scores, improvement of GMFM-88 and functional measures of neurologic&#xD;
      disability, and improvement of a daily disease severity scale, for the duration of the&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to determine if the administration of baricitinib to patients with AGS results in a change or stability of the AGS scale at baseline at 52 weeks.&#xD;
The AGS scale is a neurologic scale used to evaluate neurologic function of patients under treatment. The scale includes items for head circumference and developmental milestones. A lower score suggests a worse outcome. The range of scores is from 0 (most severe) to 11 (least severe).&#xD;
In addition, longitudinal changes will be evaluated, based on measurements collected at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and every 3 months post-baseline for up to 288 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of interferon signaling scores</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Interferon signature scores (IFN Scores) are based on the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of six type I IFN (Interferon)-inducible genes. Scores are derived from blood sampling, which will occur every three months. IFN scores are elevated in the AGS population and not elevated in healthy controls. The scale has not been published yet but it is hypothesized that a lower value in IFN score reflects a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) assessment tool include 88 items, each receiving a score from 0 to 3 (0 = does not initiate; 1 = initiates; 2 = partially completes; 3 = completes). Items span the spectrum of gross motor activities in five dimensions: A: Lying and Rolling (17 items), B: Sitting (20 items), C: Crawling and Kneeling (14 items), D: Standing (13 items), E: Walking, Running, Jumping (24 items). Every dimension score is expressed with a percentage. GMFM-88 will be performed every 6 months.</description>

                       absence of sperm in the ejaculate)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Overall health status that in the opinion of the investigator limits the safety of the&#xD;
             use of bariticinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been exposed to a live vaccine within 12 weeks prior to entry or are expected to&#xD;
             need/receive a live vaccine (including herpes zoster vaccination) during the course of&#xD;
             the study, with the exception of oral rotavirus vaccinations for which the time period&#xD;
             is 2 weeks. Young patients who are not yet vaccinated and will be unable to receive&#xD;
             live vaccines while they are receiving the program drug (baricitinib) may be included&#xD;
             after a documented conversation by a physician not affiliated with the study or the&#xD;
             medical monitor with the parents to ensure parental consent and understanding of the&#xD;
             risk/benefit ratio of not receiving scheduled vaccinations. These subjects will only&#xD;
             be included in the study after a physician obtaining consent also describes the&#xD;
             risk/benefit ratio of not receiving scheduled vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have the following evidence of renal insufficiency:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the most recent available&#xD;
                  serum creatinine of &lt;40 mL/min/1.73 m2 if greater than 2 year of age. eGFR will&#xD;
                  be calculated using the Bedside Schwartz Equation: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = (0.413&#xD;
                  x height) / SCr, with height measured in cm, and serum creatinine (SCr) in units&#xD;
                  of mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Children with an eGFR of &lt;40 mL/min/1.73 m2 will not be enrolled, unless &lt;24&#xD;
                  months of age in which case a cut off of &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m2 will be used due to&#xD;
                  age-based differences in normal eGFR. Normal eGFR of &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 is common&#xD;
                  in children &lt;12 months, and a normal eGFR &lt;40 ml/min/1.73 m2 is common in infants&#xD;
                  &lt;3-6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The creatinine should be measured using the Isotopic Dilution Mass Spectrometry&#xD;
                  (IDMS) technique to monitor the eGFR if available. Other methods are allowed but&#xD;
                  are not preferred. Laboratory testing using other methods will not be used to&#xD;
                  monitor the eGFR.&#xD;

                  threshold&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;500 cells/µL]&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;30,000/µL). Patients who are on anticoagulation or&#xD;
                  having a history of life-threatening bleeding should be excluded if platelet&#xD;
                  count is &lt;50,000/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any of the following infectious risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of active infection, at the time of entry or during the screening&#xD;
                  period, that in the opinion of the investigator, would pose an unacceptable risk&#xD;

             Association (AHA) guidelines, an left ventricle ejection factor (LVEF) &lt;50% is&#xD;
             considered impaired] or right heart failure (RV function described as qualitatively&#xD;
             more than mildly diminished systolic function), that in the consideration of the&#xD;
             investigator places them at greater risk for participation in the study; have&#xD;
             screening electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, are clinically significant and indicate an unacceptable risk for the&#xD;
             patient's participation in the study (for example, Bazett's corrected QT interval &gt;450&#xD;
             msec for males and &gt;470 msec for females); have echocardiogram results that, in the&#xD;

             and/or are unwilling to follow study restrictions/procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received an immunosuppressive biologic agent/monoclonal antibody within 4&#xD;
             half-lives prior to entry, for example, anakinra (4 half- lives=18 hours); etanercept&#xD;
             (4 half-lives=18 days); infliximab; or adalimumab (4 half-lives=36 days). Use is not&#xD;
             indicated in subjects receiving Natalizumab, Nivolumab, Trastuzumab, Denosumab, and&#xD;
             Belimumab. Use of intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received or be currently treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)&#xD;
             (Intravesical), Cladribine, Dipyrone, Pimecrolimus, and Tacrolimus (Topical).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 30 days from, a clinical&#xD;
             trial involving an investigational product or non-approved use of a drug or device&#xD;
             (other than the investigational product used in this study), or concurrently enrolled&#xD;
             in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically&#xD;
             compatible with this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have screening laboratory test values outside the reference range for the population&#xD;
             or investigative site that, in the opinion of the investigator, pose an unacceptable&#xD;
             risk for the patient's participation in the study and are not attributable to AGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have screening thyroid-stimulating hormone and/or thyroxine values outside of the&#xD;
             laboratory's reference range and are assessed to be clinically significant. If results&#xD;
             are available from testing within 1 month, then the patient will not have to be&#xD;
             retested. Patients who are receiving thyroxine as replacement therapy may participate&#xD;
             in the study provided stable therapy has been administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have evidence of active or latent TB as documented by a positive purified protein&#xD;
             derivative (PPD) test (≥5 mm induration between approximately 2 and 3 days after&#xD;
             application, regardless of vaccination history), medical history, and chest x-ray at&#xD;
             screening. The patient may also have a QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test. If the test is&#xD;
             positive or indeterminate, the patient may undergo evaluation including a chest x-ray&#xD;
             (CXR) and PPD and assessed for likely risk of active tuberculosis infection. In&#xD;
             infants &lt; 12 months of age, maternal and paternal testing can be used instead of&#xD;
             testing the patient. Risk for TB will also be assessed using validated questions from&#xD;
             The Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Validated Questions for Determining Risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in&#xD;
        Children in the United States&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a family member or contact had tuberculosis disease?&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a family member had a positive tuberculin skin test result?&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Was your child born in a high-risk country (countries other than the United States,&#xD;
             Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Western and North European countries)?&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has your child traveled to a high-risk country? How much contact did your child have&#xD;
             with the resident population?&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have a positive test for hepatitis B defined as (1) positive for hepatitis B&#xD;
                  surface antigen, or (2) positive for anti-hepatitis B core antibody, but negative&#xD;
                  for hepatitis B surface antibody (unless the anti-hepatitis B core antibody is&#xD;
                  thought to be a false positive result). In the latter case, confirmation of the&#xD;
                  presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) by DNA testing is required. An HBV DNA&#xD;
                  indeterminate result is considered HBV infection. If results are available from&#xD;
                  testing within the previous 3 months, then the patient will not have to be&#xD;
                  retested: If any of the hepatitis B tests have an indeterminate result,&#xD;
                  confirmatory testing will be performed by an alternate method. In infants &lt; 3&#xD;
                  months of age, maternal testing can be used instead of testing the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have hepatitis C virus (positive for anti-hepatitis C antibody with confirmed&#xD;
                  presence of hepatitis C virus);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have evidence of HIV infection and/or positive HIV antibodies. If results are&#xD;
                  available from testing within the previous 3 months, then the patient will not&#xD;
                  have to be retested. In infants &lt; 12 months of age, maternal testing can be used&#xD;
                  instead of testing the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have HIV virus. In infants &lt;12 months of age, maternal testing can be used&#xD;
                  instead of testing the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Taking a concomitant medication on the list of exclusion criteria (please consult&#xD;
                  study team as needed).&#xD;
