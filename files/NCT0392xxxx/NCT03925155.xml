  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate if the rate of infectious morbidity is&#xD;
      decreased with the use of chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine vaginal scrub before cesarean&#xD;
      section after ruptured membranes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postpartum endometritis is an infection of the endometrial lining of the uterus clinically&#xD;
      diagnosed by fever and uterine fundal tenderness. The most important risk factor for&#xD;
      developing endometritis is cesarean section, as it occurs in 11% of cesarean sections after&#xD;
      labor and 3% of elective cesarean sections. Other risk factors for endometritis are&#xD;
      chorioamnionitis, prolonged labor, prolonged rupture of membranes and vaginal colonization&#xD;
      with Group B Streptococcus. Some complications of endometritis include prolonged hospital&#xD;
      stay, sepsis, peritonitis and intrapelvic abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical site infections are infections of the incision, organ or space after a procedure and&#xD;
      are responsible for 38% of infections in patients undergoing surgery. In obstetric patients,&#xD;
      infectious morbidity (wound complication, surgical site infections, endometritis) occurs in&#xD;
      5-10% of cesarean sections, which is 5-fold higher than vaginal deliveries. Additionally,&#xD;
      infectious morbidity is thought to be highest in those patients who have cesarean sections&#xD;
      after undergoing labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practices endorsed by ACOG and the CDC to reduce the incidence of infectious&#xD;
      morbidity after cesarean section include pre-operative antibiotics and pre-operative skin&#xD;
      cleansing with chlorhexidine skin preparation. Chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine are chemical&#xD;
      antiseptics that reduces bacteria found on the skin. Additionally, vaginal scrub with 4%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate and 10% povidone-iodine antiseptic solution immediately prior to&#xD;
      cesarean section has been embraced into some practices as a means to decrease infectious&#xD;
      morbidity. There is abundant literature showing pre-operative vaginal cleansing prior to&#xD;
      hysterectomy has been shown to decrease vaginal surgical site antisepsis, however research on&#xD;
      its use prior to cesarean section is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the effectiveness of pre-operative vaginal scrub with 4%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine or 10% povidone iodine in reducing infectious morbidity (specifically&#xD;
      endometritis and SSI) in patients undergoing cesarean section with previously ruptured&#xD;
      membranes. Current standard of care is use of pre-operative vaginal scrub with 10% povidone&#xD;
      iodine. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups using pre-operative vaginal scrub&#xD;
      for 30 seconds: 4% chlorhexidine or 10% povidone iodine. In addition both groups will receive&#xD;
      pre-operative antibiotics with cefazolin and azithromycin, as well as abdominal cleansing&#xD;
      with chlorhexidine-alcohol based skin preparation and 0.25% chlorhexidine wipe for 30&#xD;
      seconds, as this is standard of care for women undergoing cesarean section with ruptured&#xD;
      membranes. In the event of penicillin allergy, antibiotics are adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
