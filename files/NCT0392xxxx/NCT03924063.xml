  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial investigates the safety and the preliminary clinical benefit of the&#xD;
      hemiverse shoulder prosthesis. Implantation of this newly developed hemi-prosthesis is&#xD;
      intended for patients who do not qualify for a regular reverse or hemi-prosthesis due to&#xD;
      severe medical conditions, poor bone stock or critical status of the rotator cuff. The&#xD;
      expected benefit is, that patients will have a minimally invasive surgical procedure, only&#xD;
      addressing the humeral shaft, however with the biomechanical advantage of a total reverse&#xD;
      shoulder prosthesis, meaning, that with a minimally invasive surgery a comparable result as&#xD;
      with a regular total shoulder prosthesis is accomplished. Patients will be closely monitored&#xD;
      within the study protocol for 18 months and thereafter in regular interval was as with a&#xD;
      normal prosthetic followup.&#xD;

      This clinical trial investigates the safety and the preliminary clinical benefit of the&#xD;
      hemiverse shoulder prosthesis. Implantation of this newly developed hemi-prosthesis is&#xD;
      intended for patients who do not qualify for a regular reverse or hemi-prosthesis due to&#xD;
      severe medical conditions, poor bone stock or critical status of the rotator cuff. To&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical condition of the patient a clinical examination with thorough control&#xD;
      of the blood parameters (hemoglobin, leucocytes, platelets, infection parameters) and&#xD;
      including constant score and the quick dash score will be performed before the operation. To&#xD;
      evaluate the bone stock and the musculature a conventional radiological status and a computed&#xD;
      tomography of the shoulder will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure: A delto-pectoral approach is preferred. The incision starts immediately&#xD;
      lateral to the coracoid tip and extends to the insertion of the deltoid on the Humerus. The&#xD;
      subscapularis tendon is exposed and detached from the humerus. The humeral head is exposed&#xD;
      and dislocated from the joint using an oscillating saw the humeral head is resected. The&#xD;
      shaft is prepared to receive a regular humeral stem which is definitely implanted with 0°&#xD;
      retroversion. A trial implant is inserted and reduced into the joint. Free mobility of the&#xD;
      joint is tested and the stability of the implant documented. According to the trial implants&#xD;
      the definite implant is assembled and implanted. After reduction of the implant the&#xD;
      subscapularis tendon is reattached to the humerus using transosseous sutures. Regular closure&#xD;
      of the incision is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After-care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately post operatively a anteroposterior radiograph is performed. For the first two&#xD;
      post-operative weeks the arm is immobilised in a sling and external rotation is allowed until&#xD;
      0° and flexion until 90° in internal rotation. Thereafter gradual increase of active mobility&#xD;
      is allowed until the weeks post operatively, when full load bearing of the arm is allowed.&#xD;
      Regular followup visits include a constant score, quick dash-score and conventional&#xD;
      radiographic status(anteroposterior lateral and axillary view) and are performed to be&#xD;
      post-operative 3 months 6 months 1 year and 18 months post operatively.&#xD;
