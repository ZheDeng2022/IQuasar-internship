  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose this study is to test the utility of pairing external neuromodulation with&#xD;
      behavioral language treatment to boost therapy outcomes and to investigate the mechanisms&#xD;
      associated with recovery. Because all PWA have word retrieval deficits, this project will&#xD;
      test if greater language gains can be achieved by supplementing anomia intervention with&#xD;
      excitatory brain stimulation to the left hemisphere and will evaluate associated functional&#xD;
      brain changes to aid the optimization of neural reorganization to facilitate language&#xD;
      processing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is a language impairment that commonly occurs following brain damage (e.g., stroke).&#xD;
      While language rehabilitation can yield improved language functioning, treatment outcomes&#xD;
      vary greatly across individuals. In chronic aphasia, language gains occur through the brain's&#xD;
      inherent ability to reorganize (i.e., neuroplasticity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While Speech-language therapy (SLT) can target various language skills and modalities, the&#xD;
      most pervasive deficit across all persons with aphasia (PWA) is difficulty with word finding.&#xD;
      Thus, aphasia treatment often includes some form of intervention focused on improving naming&#xD;
      abilities. As with language function in general, naming abilities in PWA seems to be&#xD;
      associated with left hemisphere recruitment, particularly with the viable tissue at the rim&#xD;
      of the lesion (perilesional areas). This project investigates an innovative approach to&#xD;
      improving current therapy by examining the benefits of using excitatory transcranial direct&#xD;
      current stimulation (tDCS) stimulation/neuromodulation during anomia treatment (i.e.&#xD;
      word-finding treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates an innovative approach to improving current therapy by examining the&#xD;
      benefits of using excitatory tDCS stimulation/neuromodulation during anomia treatment. This&#xD;
      project will provide novel mechanistic understanding of changes in functional brain&#xD;
      connectivity in persons with post-stroke aphasia and how connectivity relates to treatment&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To investigate the benefits of using broad transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) to improve word retrieval in persons with aphasia (PWA). Aim 2. To study functional&#xD;
      brain changes related to this treatment. Aim 3. To examine behavioral and neural&#xD;
      re-organization correlates related to treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete the following 3 components: (1) Baseline Assessment, (2)&#xD;
      Interventions (i.e., SLT with active tDCS &amp; sham tDCS , and (3) Outcome Testing (i.e.,&#xD;
      Behavioral &amp; Brain Imaging). During the first week, each participant will complete all of the&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Testing Battery and the first round of the outcome measures as pre-testing&#xD;
      before starting SLT. Then the participant will complete 2 weeks of SLT accompanied with&#xD;
      either active tDCS or sham tDCS. Once the SLT is completed, the participant will complete&#xD;
      round 2 of outcome testing (i.e., post-testing for 1st SLT phase and pre-testing for 2nd SLT&#xD;
      phase). Then, the participant will complete another 2 weeks of SLT but with the other tDCS&#xD;
      condition. Once SLT is completed, the participant will complete round 3 of outcome testing&#xD;
      (i.e., post-testing for 2nd SLT phase). Lastly, the participant will complete round 4 of&#xD;
      outcome testing (i.e., follow-up)&#xD;

Excitatory stimulation to the left hemisphere will be achieved through a 1x1 montage utilizing two carbon-rubber electrodes and 5x7 EASY pad sponges (A-tDCS [excitatory]left target; C-tDCS [inhibitory]right hemisphere). Each PWA will have a unique 5-digit tDCS program code for each treatment phase. One code will instruct the 1x1 tDCS-CT to administer active stimulation as describe above (i.e., 1.5 mA for 20 min). The other will administer 1.5 mA for only a few seconds to simulate active stimulation. SLT will consist of Semantic Feature Analysis, Phonological Component Analysis, and Verb Network Strengthening Treatment</description>
