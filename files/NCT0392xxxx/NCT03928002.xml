  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease is the most common congenital anomaly. The life expectancy of&#xD;
      children with congenital heart disease has increased considerably in recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the evolution of these patients is marked by an increased risk of&#xD;
      complications. Arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and&#xD;
      endocarditis may be promoted by the absence or delay of management in childhood, by residual&#xD;
      lesions or post-operative cardiac scars and by the presence of prosthetic materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAH is a common complication of congenital heart disease, especially in non-operated shunts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAH corresponds to an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and mean pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      pressure that becomes greater than 25mmHg at rest, leading to right ventricular failure and&#xD;
      ultimately to the patient's death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eisenmenger's syndrome corresponds to a non-reversible pulmonary arterial hypertension with a&#xD;
      left-right shunt initially left open, then right-left secondary to the increase in pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular resistance, leading to cyanosis, polycythemia and multivisceral involvement. It is&#xD;
      the most advanced form of PAH with congenital heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAH will be suspected during echocardiographic follow-up of any patient with congenital heart&#xD;
      disease, on the analysis of the velocity of tricuspid and/or pulmonary regurgitation flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography allows the monitoring of the VD (right ventricle) function, which is the&#xD;
      major prognostic element in PAH. Cardiac catheterization is systematically recommended and&#xD;
      remains the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis of PAH, establish its pathophysiology and&#xD;
      prognosis but also for the follow-up under medical treatment of these patients in tertiary&#xD;
      centres every 6 months. Although this tool is the gold standard, rigorously performed, it&#xD;
      remains an invasive examination often poorly experienced by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4D Flow MRI is a promising imaging that allows the acquisition of anatomical, volume, right&#xD;
      ventricular remodeling and intracardiac flow information in a single step with 2D (only 8&#xD;
      minutes extra), in free breathing and totally autonomous mode. Thus, at the same time as the&#xD;
      realization of a 2D MRI, essential for the diagnosis and follow-up of PAH, with an additional&#xD;
      8 minutes for 4D flow, the investigators could have additional fundamental information on&#xD;
      pulmonary cardiac output but also prognostic markers of right ventricular dysfunction turning&#xD;
      dramatic in pulmonary vascular disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiac catheterization is systematically recommended and remains the gold standard to&#xD;
      confirm the diagnosis of PAH, establish its pathophysiology and prognosis but also for the&#xD;
      follow-up under medical treatment of these patients in tertiary centres every 6 months. Some&#xD;
      centres repeat invasive hemodynamic assessment in the event of clinical aggravation before&#xD;
      considering a change in drug management or overall management. This is the reference&#xD;
      examination for the calculation of PVRs, an extremely rigorous methodology is required in&#xD;
      patients with intracardiac shunt: the Fick principle must then be applied to calculate Qp.&#xD;
      Usually, it is calculated by thermodilution but is no longer applicable in the case of&#xD;
      intracardiac shunt, as is significant valvulopathy or massive tricuspid leakage. Qp is equal&#xD;
      to the oxygen consumption (MVO2) divided by the difference in oxygen content (CaO2) between&#xD;
      the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins (VP). Qp= MVO2/ (CaO2VP- CaO2 AP). They must be&#xD;
      carried out with a rigorous methodology adapted on a case-by-case basis according to the&#xD;
      anatomy and hemodynamics of the heart disease and a precise knowledge of the limits of the&#xD;
      technique, in expert centres in PAH and congenital heart disease and must not be seen as&#xD;
      without consequences for the patient . Although this tool is the gold standard, rigorously&#xD;
      carried out in our reference centre, with rare accidents or potential risks, it remains an&#xD;
      invasive examination often poorly experienced by patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged in recent years as the reference technique for&#xD;
      non-invasive morphological and functional evaluation of the right ventricle. It also seems&#xD;
      relevant for the study of pulmonary arterial hemodynamics while providing prognostic values&#xD;
      for PAH. Its regular implementation is indicated in the 2015 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis&#xD;
      and follow-up of patients, with more particularly an injection of gadolinium for the search&#xD;
      for myocardial fibrosis, a marker of right ventricular remodelling. Also considered are:&#xD;
      decrease in right ventricular ejection fraction, paradoxical septal kinetics, decrease in&#xD;
      left ventricular dimensions, compliance of the pulmonary artery (mL/mmHg) and mean flow&#xD;
      velocity (cm/s). Carrying out this examination using conventional techniques (2D MRI) has&#xD;
      some limitations. Extrinsic, linked to operators and observers. The quality of the&#xD;
      examinations here depends on the quality of the acquisitions made by the radiology&#xD;
      manipulators (sequences / section plans) as well as an adapted analysis of these&#xD;
      cardiopathies. All of this involves a high degree of technical expertise on the part of&#xD;
      paramedical staff, as well as expertise in congenital heart disease and cardiac imaging for&#xD;
      medical staff. Finally, this examination has intrinsic limitations, since it does not allow&#xD;
      the characteristics of intracardiac or vascular flows (turbulence, direction, vortex) to be&#xD;
      explored. All this implies an examination time of about 30 minutes 4D Flow MRI is a promising&#xD;
      imaging that allows the acquisition of anatomical, volume, right ventricular remodeling and&#xD;
      intracardiac flow information in a single step with 2D (only 8 minutes extra), in free&#xD;
      breathing and totally autonomous mode. It is a sequence allowing a quasi-isotopic,&#xD;
      retrospective analysis, providing information on blood flow in the 3 planes of the space,&#xD;
      during the cardiac cycle. It is not influenced by the quality of the medical teams and, above&#xD;
      all, it allows an unlimited post-processing capacity. This innovative imaging method is&#xD;
      therefore particularly suitable for the study of cardiac output such as Qp. The right&#xD;
      ventricular volume is difficult to analyze due to the complexity of its geometry, automatic&#xD;
      segmentation is still under development, this element seems to be a promising hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameter since it is quantitatively calculated and seems to be correlated with the systolic&#xD;
      function of the left ventricle and inaccessible to conventional techniques due to the&#xD;
      particular geometry of the right ventricle. Previous studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      possibility of qualitative analysis of intraventricular blood flows by studying retrograde&#xD;
      flows, vortices and their kinetic energy, which are involved in diastolic dysfunction of the&#xD;
      right ventricle .Studies have shown that these structures can be altered in PAH dog models&#xD;
      but also in repaired Fallot tetralogy series and Fontan type circulations .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, at the same time as the realization of a 2D MRI, essential for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      follow-up of PAH, with an additional 8 minutes for 4D flow, the investigators could have&#xD;
      additional fundamental information on pulmonary cardiac output but also prognostic markers of&#xD;
      right ventricular dysfunction turning dramatic in pulmonary vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to evaluate the contribution of 4D MRI flow imaging to the measurement of&#xD;
      pulmonary cardiac output compared to the gold standard which is cardiac catheterization using&#xD;
      the Fick method. But also, to compare 2D and 4D MRI flow for the evaluation of volumes,&#xD;
      function and right ventricular remodeling, as well as the quantification of pulmonary,&#xD;
      tricuspid and systemic flows.&#xD;
