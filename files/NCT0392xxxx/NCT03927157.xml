  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a regional, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group, phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 210 mg Q4W (SC) of&#xD;
      tezepelumab in adults with severe, uncontrolled asthma on medium to high-dose ICS and at&#xD;
      least one additional asthma controller medication with or without OCS. Approximately 396&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized regionally (China/non-China). Subjects will receive tezepelumab,&#xD;
      or placebo, administered via subcutaneous injection at the study site, over a 52-week&#xD;
      treatment period. The study also includes a post-treatment follow-up period of 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AERR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The annualized exacerbation rate is based on exacerbations reported by the investigator in the eCRF over 52 weeks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in pre-dose/pre-bronchodilator (pre-BD) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in FEV1 as compared to placebo at Week 52. FEV1 is defined as the volume of air exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced expiration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 years and older (AQLQ(S)+12) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 as compared to placebo at Week 52. The AQLQ(S)+12 is a questionnaire that measures the health-related quality of life experienced by asthma subjects. The total score is defined as the average of all 32 questions in the AQLQ(S)+12 questionnaire. AQLQ(S)+12 is a 7-point scale questionnaire, ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in ACQ-6 as compared to placebo at Week 52. The ACQ-6 captures asthma symptoms and short-acting β2-agonist use via subject-report. Questions are weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The ACQ-6 score is the mean of the responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in weekly mean daily Asthma Symptom Diary score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in Asthma Symptom Diary score as compared to placebo at Week 52. The Asthma Symptom Diary comprises of 10 items (5 items in the morning; 5 items in the evening). Asthma symptoms during night time and daytime are recorded by the patient each morning and evening in the daily diary. A daily ASD score is the mean of the 10 items. Responses for all 10 items are required to calculate the daily ASD score; otherwise, it is treated as missing. For the 7-day average asthma symptom score, scoring is done with no imputation using the mean of at least 4 of the 7 daily ASD scores as a mean weekly item score. The 7-day average ASD score ranges from 0 to 4.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in weekly mean rescue medication use at Week 52 to assess the effect of 210 mg of tezepelumab SC Q4W on other asthma control metrics. The number of rescue medication inhalations (puffs) and nebulizer treatments taken will be recorded by the subject in the Asthma Symptom Diary twice daily (i.e., in the morning and evening). Each timepoint is calculated as weekly means based on daily diary data.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions 5 Levels Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L at Week 52. EQ-5D-5L has two sections. The first section assesses five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Patients rate each of these items from &quot;no problem,&quot; &quot;slight problem&quot; &quot;moderate problem&quot;, &quot;severe problem&quot; and &quot;unable&quot;. A composite health index is defined by combining the levels for each dimension. The second section measures self-rated (global) health status using a vertically oriented visual analogue scale where 100 represents the &quot;best possible health state&quot; and 0 represents the &quot;worst possible health state&quot;. EQ-5D-5L assesses health status in terms of a single index value or health utility score. It allows &quot;weighting&quot; by the patient of particular health states and the generation of patient utilities. Published weights are available for the creation of a single summary health utility score. Overall scores range from 0 to 1, with lower scores representing a higher level of dysfunction.</description>
