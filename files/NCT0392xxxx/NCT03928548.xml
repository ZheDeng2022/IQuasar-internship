  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the validity of the adult and pediatric&#xD;
      Malnutrition Clinical Characteristics (MCC). In addition, this project will: examine the&#xD;
      relationship between the MCC and an objective measure of body composition; and establish the&#xD;
      relationship between in-patient Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) care and medical&#xD;
      outcomes for all in-patients requiring nutrition care, and specifically for malnourished&#xD;
      patients. Sixty pediatric and 60 adult in-patient acute care facilities will participate in&#xD;
      this research study. The total number of participants enrolled across the 120 facilities will&#xD;
      be between 2400-9600.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the interrater reliability of the MCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the predictive validity of the adult and pediatric MCC relative to a portfolio&#xD;
           of patient medical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the relationship between the adult and pediatric MCC and body composition&#xD;
           measurements conducted via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in a subset of&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify the utility of BIA for body composition analysis in clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Estimate the level of RDN care necessary to improve patient outcomes within the&#xD;
           portfolio of outcomes. Specifically: quantify the dose (minutes of care and frequency of&#xD;
           encounters) of RDN care that is associated with improved medical outcomes in patients&#xD;
           already identified as requiring nutrition care, after adjusting for disease severity and&#xD;
           other potential confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Identify the additional level of RDN care necessary to improve the medical outcomes in&#xD;
           patients who have been identified as malnourished using the MCC.&#xD;
