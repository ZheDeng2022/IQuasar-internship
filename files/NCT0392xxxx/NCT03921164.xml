    <textblock>
      In patients under general anesthesia, the prevention of intraoperative hypotension to&#xD;
      maintain blood pressure (BP) close to the initial blood pressure, i.e. before anesthesia, is&#xD;
      essential to reduce the risk of death and improve surgical outcomes. Vasoactive agents are&#xD;
      commonly used to correct this hypotension (Phenylephrine Ephedrine Noradrenaline). These&#xD;
      three vasoconstrictors have specific effects on the afterload of the heart and can impair its&#xD;
      function. The analysis of the left ventricular pressure-volume curve (PV Loop) allows&#xD;
      continuous information on the post-charge state of the left ventricle and the changes induced&#xD;
      by the vasoconstrictors to be observed. However, the investigators currently have no way of&#xD;
      monitoring these effects. In clinical practice if these loops are obtained non-invasively&#xD;
      they can be used in the evaluation of cardiac function of at-risk patients in perioperative&#xD;
      and also in intensive care to allow therapeutic adaptation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators have conducted several studies on the differential effects of different&#xD;
      vasopressors used in general anesthesia to correct sympatholysis-induced hypotension&#xD;
      occurring under anesthetic drugs and after eliminating hypovolemia or overdose in&#xD;
      anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study investigators described a method for analyzing Velocity-Pressure&#xD;
      interactions to monitor ventricular afterload in the operating room with the construction of&#xD;
      Velocity-Pressure aortic loops (VP Loop).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These loops were constructed from an aortic velocity signal measured by esophageal Doppler&#xD;
      and aortic blood pressure signal from a femoral catheter. The Global Afterload Angle (GALA)&#xD;
      measured on the loop were then higher in patients at cardiovascular risk (RCV+) at 68 ± 6°&#xD;
      compared to 41 ± 15° in patients (RCV-) (p&lt;0.001). In addition, GALA variations were&#xD;
      associated with variations in the three components of ventricular afterload: compliance,&#xD;
      resistance and waves reflection. Finally, under the effect of vasopressors, there was a&#xD;
      modification in the shape of the VP Loop and the value of GALA, showing GALA as a reliable&#xD;
      marker potential for ventricular afterload in patients under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to develop a totally non-invasive method that would produce a pressure velocity&#xD;
      curve, the investigators propose to combine an estimation of aortic pressure by a tonometry&#xD;
      method and an estimation of ventricular volumes by three-dimensional echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is then to compare VP Loop parameters obtained&#xD;
      non-invasively to VP loop obtained invasively according to patient cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac afterload can be schematically defined by the combination of three components:&#xD;
      peripheral vascular resistance (PVR), total arterial compliance (Ctot) and aortic wave&#xD;
      reflections (WR). WR could be assessed by pulse wave pressure analysis with the augmentation&#xD;
      index (Aix) or after pulse wave pressure separation into a forward and backward wave with the&#xD;
      wave reflection index (WRi) or the wave reflection area (WRa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive Aortic pressure measurements: As required by the standard of care of the&#xD;
      interventional neuroradiology procedure, the neuroradiologist also cannulated the femoral&#xD;
      artery. At the end of the procedure, during catheter withdrawal, pressure waveforms are&#xD;
      recorded in the descending thoracic aorta just in front of the esophageal Doppler probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descending aortic velocity is measured with a transesophageal Doppler CardioQ-ODM+ monitor&#xD;
      (Deltex Medical, Chichester, UK) in order to construct the VP Loop in descending thoracic&#xD;
      aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive Non-invasive Aortic velocity recording VP Loop in aorta is measured in the&#xD;
      flushing chamber of the left ventricle from the apical five chamber view by trans-thoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography (TTE) (Philips, EPIQ 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of ventricular diastolic pressure by measuring mitral and aortic flow gradients by&#xD;
      echocardiography (EPIQ G7 Philips© or similar) Determination of left ventricular volumes&#xD;
      during the cardiac cycle by echocardiography (3D EPIQ G7 Philips© or similar).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive central pressure measurement by an arterial tonometer reconstructing the central&#xD;
      aortic curve (ShygmoCor, AtCor©) The SphygmoCor radial tonometer (AtCor Medical, Pty Ltd,&#xD;
      Sydney, Australia) is the most widely used tonometer in clinical research for non-invasive&#xD;
      central pressure measurement and pulse wave analysis. The central blood pressure is then&#xD;
      estimated using a validated radial-aortic transfer function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tonometer requires prior calibration by mean (MAP) and diastolic (PAD) blood pressure&#xD;
      measured with the conventional brachial cuff as validated in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VP Loop construction Digitalization of pressure and velocity signals are performed with the&#xD;
      IntelliVue MP60 monitor (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at a sampling frequency of 125&#xD;
      Hz and saved using ixTrend software (IXELLENCE, Wildau, Germany) on a computer. Briefly, the&#xD;
      velocity coordinates is plotted on the x axis and the pressure coordinates on the y axis. The&#xD;
      investigators characterize the VP Loop by 4 points (A, B, C, D), allowing us to identify 3&#xD;
      angles: Alpha, Beta and GALA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to compare these parameters of cardiac after load obtained&#xD;
      non-invasively with the same parameters invasively obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: This is a single-center, interventional, category II prospective study&#xD;
      (minimal risks and constraints)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population concerned: Patients will be included if their perioperative risk required a&#xD;
      continuous monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output (CO). The study&#xD;
      involves major patients under general anesthesia in interventional neuroradiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Proceedings For all patients, data from trans-esophageal Doppler, trans-thoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography (TTE) and hemodynamic data are collected at the end of the procedure. During&#xD;
      catheter withdrawal, pressure waveforms are recorded in the descending thoracic aorta just in&#xD;
      front of the esophageal Doppler probe. All data from monitoring are connected to the main&#xD;
      monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual benefit: There is no benefit for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collective benefit: Targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP) with boluses of selective&#xD;
      peripheral vasopressors (without positive inotropic or chronotropic effects) could have&#xD;
      deleterious effects on cardiac output. Thus, it seems important to use a combined analysis of&#xD;
      MAP and CO with low invasive methods to estimate the Afterload-related cardiac performance&#xD;
      (ACP) in surgical patients considered with &quot;high cardiovascular risk&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and minimal constraints added by the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No added risk. Patients are included if their perioperative risk required a continuous&#xD;
      monitoring of MAP and CO. The standard of care for the interventional neuroradiology&#xD;
      procedure needs a catheterization of the femoral artery using the Seldinger technique and&#xD;
      insertion of a catheter. All the other ones measures are obtained non-invasively. Patients&#xD;
      are assigned to one of two groups according to their risk of increased arterial stiffness as&#xD;
      reported in cardiological publications. The criteria investigators used are as follows: age &gt;&#xD;
      50 years old as a major criterion 20 and cardio-vascular risk factors (history of congestive&#xD;
      heart failure, history of cardiovascular event, current smoking, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, and arterial hypertension) as minor criteria. Patients were classified into the&#xD;
      high risk group (Hi-risk) if they had at least one major criterion or two minor criteria or&#xD;
      into the low risk group (Lo-risk) if they presented with no or one minor criterion. During&#xD;
      their interventional neuroradiology procedure, all patients' routine monitoring will consist&#xD;
      of electrocardiogram, pulsated oxygen saturation, endtidal carbon dioxide (CO2), respiratory&#xD;
      rate, tidal volume and monitoring of neuromuscular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients whatever the comorbidities, anesthesia induction will be performed using a&#xD;
      target-controlled infusion (Orchestra® Base Primea Fresenius Kabi France). According to our&#xD;
      standard of care, intra-operative episodes of hypotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) &lt; 65&#xD;
      mmHg or &lt; 80% baseline) are treated by Norepinephrine bolus of 10 µg. For all patients, data&#xD;
      from trans-esophageal Doppler, trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) and hemodynamic data are&#xD;
      collected at the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of selected subjects Selection of patients up to 55 analyzable patients Number of&#xD;
      centers: 1 Research center Agenda inclusion period: 12 months duration of participation&#xD;
      (treatment + follow-up): duration of the interventional neuroradiology procedure: 1 day Total&#xD;
      duration: 12 months Number of planned inclusions by center and month: 2-3 Number of subjects&#xD;
      required: 55&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Continuous data are expressed in median [interquartile] and qualitative data in n&#xD;
      (%). The risk α has been set at 5%. The categorical variables will be compared by&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test and the continuous variables by Wilcoxon test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concordance between the two methods will be evaluated by the intra-class correlation&#xD;
      coefficient as well as by the Bland-Altman representation (with determination of bias and&#xD;
      approval limits) for the various parameters of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of patients until 55 analyzable patients is obtained (signal quality obtained and&#xD;
      possible analysis). The estimate of the number of subjects to be included is based on the&#xD;
      main evaluation criterion, the intra-class correlation coefficient. Thus, to highlight, an&#xD;
      intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.9 with a confidence interval of 0.1, for an alpha&#xD;
      risk of 5%, it is necessary to include 56 patients.&#xD;
