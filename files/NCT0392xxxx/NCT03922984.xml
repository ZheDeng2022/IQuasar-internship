  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MRI including ASL will be performed before, during and after the treatment, in a total of 7&#xD;
      MRI sessions until 8 months after the first session. Thereafter, patients will be followed&#xD;
      through standard clinical examinations for the next 3 years or until demise, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, GBM patients are imaged every 8-weeks, beginning at 10 weeks after the completion&#xD;
      of chemoradiation, since morphological (i.e. size) changes are not anticipated earlier.&#xD;
      However, our preliminary experience and others have shown functional changes including&#xD;
      perfusion and diffusion as early as 3-weeks after the initiation of the treatment . Thus, our&#xD;
      T10, T18, T26 and T34 MRI sessions will be performed along with the clinical imaging&#xD;
      sessions, while the T3 and T6 MRI sessions will be performed additionally for this proposal.&#xD;
      All MR imaging sessions will be scheduled within ±1 or ±2 weeks of the target time period, as&#xD;
      indicated in the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI including ASL will be performed before, during and after the treatment, in a total of 7&#xD;
      MRI sessions until 8 months after the first session. The research MR imaging may take&#xD;
      approximately an additional 15 minutes per each imaging session. However, the T3, and T6 MR&#xD;
      imaging sessions will be performed additionally for the purpose of this study, with each&#xD;
      taking approximately one hour. Thereafter, patients will be followed through standard&#xD;
      clinical examinations for the next 3 years or until demise, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) represents about 15% of all primary brain tumors with approximately 19,000&#xD;
      new cases diagnosed annually. The one-, five- and ten-year survival rates for patients with&#xD;
      GBM is 37.2%, 5.1% and 2.6% from diagnosis respectively, making it one of the most lethal&#xD;
      cancers known, among all cancers. GBMs can be challenging to treat and new cancer therapies&#xD;
      are continuously being developed for GBM treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high cost and potential risks associated with human trials for these experimental&#xD;
      therapies have emphasized the need for sensitive monitoring of tumor response. Imaging&#xD;
      approaches can play an important role in the evaluation and selection of potential new&#xD;
      therapies with non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of treatment response. Currently, the&#xD;
      radiological assessment of treatment outcomes predominantly relies on morphological (i.e.&#xD;
      size) changes using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and other&#xD;
      similar scores. This is a major limiting factor as the effects of many therapeutic agents at&#xD;
      the microscopic level precede the eventual changes in tumor size. One such tumor property&#xD;
      that has gained increased attention is angiogenesis, which has been shown to support tumor&#xD;
      proliferation and infiltration. Increasing numbers of clinical trials have begun targeting&#xD;
      tumor vascular supplies either directly inhibiting angiogenesis (e.g. antiangiogenic therapy)&#xD;
      or indirectly disrupting cell proliferation and eventually angiogenesis (e.g. cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemoradiation). Such clinical trials and the eventual clinical use of these therapies would&#xD;
      be greatly assisted by the availability of robust imaging indicators of angiogenesis (i.e.&#xD;
      tissue perfusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using 15O-labeled water (15O-PET) is considered the gold&#xD;
      standard for non-invasive measurement of tissue perfusion. However, the use of 15O-PET&#xD;
      requires a cyclotron in close proximity to PET to produce short lived 15O-water (half life&#xD;
      2.4 min), limiting its applicability in clinical settings. Alternative imaging techniques&#xD;
      include ultrasound using microbubbles, perfusion computed tomography (CT) using iodinated&#xD;
      contrast agent and perfusion MRI using gadolinium based contrast agents. All of these&#xD;
      techniques require exogenous agents, restricting their use in longitudinal monitoring of&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial spin labeled (ASL) MRI has recently emerged as a quantitative imaging (QI) method to&#xD;
      measure perfusion (or capillary blood flow) without the administration of exogenous contrast&#xD;
      agents. ASL magnetically &quot;labels&quot; the highly permeable water in the blood as a tracer and&#xD;
      measures their accumulation in the tissue of interest, without injecting any exogenous&#xD;
      contrast. Various versions of ASL have been validated in animals using microspheres, and in&#xD;
      humans using 15O-PET in the brain. ASL also has a number of advantages compared to dynamic&#xD;
      contrast enhanced (DCE) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) based MR perfusion&#xD;
      measurements. Specifically, ASL does not require exogenous agent alleviating the concerns of&#xD;
      gadolinium accumulation or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with impaired&#xD;
      renal function and, unlike DCE/DSC, the contribution of vascular permeability to ASL measured&#xD;
      perfusion is negligible enabling absolute perfusion quantification in physiological units&#xD;
      (ml/100g/min).&#xD;
