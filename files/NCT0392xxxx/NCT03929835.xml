  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS), is a chronic skin disease, manifested as inflamed areas of&#xD;
      hair follicles around apocrine sweat glands found in areas most commonly the axillae,&#xD;
      inguinal and anogenital regions. Patients experience great deal of physical pain as well as&#xD;
      profound psychological problems. HS patients may also be prone to health complications and&#xD;
      diseases. Treatment to date is limited and consist mainly of antibiotic administration and&#xD;
      novel biological drug with up to 40% efficiency. Recently it was shown that cannabinoids&#xD;
      reduces the folliculo pilosebaceous activity, most likely due to activating arachnoiditis,&#xD;
      lipostat , anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory agents and reduce inflammation inducing&#xD;
      cytokines.&#xD;

      Forty participants will be recruited over two years. After determine eligibility by examining&#xD;
      the study criteria for inclusion and exclusion, the patient will be asked to sign the&#xD;
      informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The YAKAR form of medical cannabis license application and a confidentiality waiver form will&#xD;
      be sent to the YAKAR. The physician will explain to the patients that his/her participation&#xD;
      in the trial can be terminated at any time and will explain the medical license conditions:&#xD;
      It is absolutely forbidden to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use cannabis in the presence of minors or in public&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drive under the influence of cannabis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant shall take measures to prevent the theft of cannabis and inform the&#xD;
           Investigator and the YAKAR of an attempt to steal or lose of cannabis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient license arrives, the patient will be scheduled an appointment for the first&#xD;
      visit of the trial at the hospital. Tikun-Olam will be informed and asked to supply the&#xD;
      patient product on the visit day. The copy of the patient's license will be included into the&#xD;
      trial source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive Avidekel oil or placebo&#xD;
      oil. Patients will receive the oils as drops applied under the tongue 3 times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of study participation for each subject is expected to be 12 weeks (84 days),&#xD;
      about 4 weeks from visit 0 until receiving the license and 8 weeks trial,of which, six weeks&#xD;
      of dose titration. Over the course of twelve weeks, four visits will be conducted and there&#xD;
      will be 3 telephone evaluations. During first visit screening and enrolment will be&#xD;
      conducted. The second visit will take place four weeks later where patients will receive the&#xD;
      oils and start the trial, followed by a phone call evaluation at day 5-7 after starting the&#xD;
      treatment and at week 2±2 days. Than a visit approximately four weeks later, following&#xD;
      another phone call evaluation at week 5±2 days from treatment beginning, F Last visit will be&#xD;
      conducted at week 8±3 days. In each visit, the relevant variables will be collected (Please&#xD;
      refer to Table 3. Schedule of events). At the end of the eight-week experiment, patients from&#xD;
      the treatment and control groups will be given the option to use the Avidekel oil for a&#xD;
      period of one year. First, all the patients will use the drug in the open label phase for 8&#xD;
      weeks, during this period 3 phone calls and 2 visits in the hospital will be conducted, using&#xD;
      PI-NRS and HS-PGA score to evaluate treatment success. Patients who will have at least 1&#xD;
      point reduction on the HS-PGA score will be permitted to continue to the 1 year follow-up.&#xD;
      During that period 2 visits, six months and one year, will be conducted and the relevant&#xD;
      variables will be collected (see Table 3). All visits will take place at the hospital.&#xD;
