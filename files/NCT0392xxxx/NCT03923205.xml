  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Buckwheat is a unique crop because is naturally rich in compounds that have shown beneficial&#xD;
      effects on glucose metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A constant high glucose level in blood after meal consumption is an independent risk factor&#xD;
      for cardiovascular complications and death. In order to prevent Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
      (T2D) and/or its complications it is important to have a strict control of the blood glucose&#xD;
      levels after a meal. There are known therapies for the control of the high glucose blood&#xD;
      levels such as agents that act on intestinal digestion of carbohydrates and therapeutic&#xD;
      agents that mimic the insulin response after a meal. The combination of these type of agents&#xD;
      was commonly prescribed in the treatment of T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of a buckwheat beverage on postprandial glucose&#xD;
      metabolism in healthy individuals and those with T2D controlled by medication and diet.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ability of the buckwheat beverage to modulate postprandial sugar metabolism will be&#xD;
      tested in a dietary study in healthy volunteers and people with T2D. Three groups will be&#xD;
      recruited; healthy volunteers, individuals with T2D controlled by medication and individuals&#xD;
      with T2D controlled by diet and lifestyle only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the human volunteers who have T2D controlled by medication, there will be targeted those&#xD;
      who have been prescribed metformin only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers will visit the Human Nutrition Unit (HNU) three times (a screening visit and&#xD;
      two study visits) during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of two weeks between the study visits will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the consent form has been signed, the volunteers taking part in the study will answer a&#xD;
      specific health questionnaire and have their blood sugar level measured. The HbA1c (glycated&#xD;
      haemoglobin) will be measured using the AS-100 (finger spot blood). We will follow the NHS&#xD;
      guideline to establish the values for HbA1c. A normal HbA1c target is below 48 mmol/mol (or&#xD;
      6.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, for the volunteers with T2D, a consultant from the study research team will&#xD;
      access the medical records to ensure their eligibility for the study. Permission will be&#xD;
      obtained from the volunteers for this via the study consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary study test meal and control meal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test meal The buckwheat beverage is prepared from sprouted buckwheat flour without adding&#xD;
      any extra sugar, spices or aromas. The test meal contains 100 g of the buckwheat beverage and&#xD;
      75 g glucose dissolved in 300 mL water followed by 100 mL water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control meal The control meal will be a standard OGT test containing 75 g glucose&#xD;
      dissolved in 300 mL of water followed by 100 mL water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both meals will be advised to be consumed within 5 minutes. The T2D volunteers which are on&#xD;
      metformin will be advised to take their medication as usual. We will record the dose and time&#xD;
      when the metformin will be taken by the volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following recruitment, screening and consent, the three groups of volunteers will start the&#xD;
      study by random allocation to one of the test meals. On the study day, the volunteers will be&#xD;
      advised to come to the HNU in the morning after an overnight fasting (10 h). A cannula will&#xD;
      be inserted into the volunteers' arm and baseline blood will be collected. The cannulation&#xD;
      and blood sampling will be performed by trained phlebotomists. Additionally a baseline urine&#xD;
      sample will be collected. The urine sample either will be brought in by the volunteers in the&#xD;
      morning or produced in HNU before the test meals. The volunteers will be served the control&#xD;
      and test meal (depending on allocation) and advised that it is to be consumed within five&#xD;
      minutes. Volunteers which are on metformin will be asked to take their medication as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each study visit, blood will be collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150,&#xD;
      180 and 300 min. The blood will be collected in 4 mL lithium heparin tubes and 4 mL glucose&#xD;
      (fluoride oxalate) tubes at each time point. A volume of 96 mL of blood will be collected at&#xD;
      each study visit. Additionally a volume of 5 Î¼L blood will be collected for each time point&#xD;
      in order to instantly measure the glucose levels. At least two samples will be collected at&#xD;
      t=0 in order to obtain a good baseline value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The movements of the volunteers will be restricted to minimum for the entire blood collection&#xD;
      period. They will be asked to stay resting and comfortable position and relaxed for the&#xD;
      entire (300 min) sampling period and to not leave the HNU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After five hours, once all the blood samples have been collected the cannula will be&#xD;
      extracted from the volunteer's arm and lunch will be provided.&#xD;
