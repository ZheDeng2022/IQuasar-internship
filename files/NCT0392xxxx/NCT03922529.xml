      Modified Application of Cardiac Rehabilitation for Older Adults (MACRO) responds to a&#xD;
      critical underuse of cardiac rehabilitation in older adults with a coaching model that&#xD;
      addresses issues related to aging as a means to better facilitate cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      (CR). MACRO is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which older adults with a CVD event are&#xD;
      randomized between a MACRO intervention (MACRO-I) versus usual care. The MACRO-I is designed&#xD;
      to facilitate CR as a means to augment functional recovery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic RCT of 374 older adults eligible for CR: hospitalized adults aged â‰¥70&#xD;
      years with a primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction/ acute coronary syndrome,&#xD;
      stable ischemic heart disease, revascularization (coronary artery bypass graft surgery,&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention), valvular heart disease (surgical or transcatheter valve&#xD;
      replacement or repair), heart failure (with reduced or preserved ejection fraction) or&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease. Participants who consent to participate will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to a MACRO-intervention (MACRO-I) versus usual care. In the MACRO-I arm,&#xD;
      participants receive coaching that incorporates innovative features designed to address needs&#xD;
      of older adults. These include holistic risk assessment (medical, functional, psychosocial),&#xD;
      guidance to facilitate CR in a format that aligns with each patient's own risks as well as&#xD;
      their preferences (i.e., CR formatted as either site-based, home-based, or in a hybrid format&#xD;
      [site transitioning to home]), behavioral reinforcements to promote CR based on their goals&#xD;
      of care, and deprescribing of sedating medications. While usual care may include CR, it&#xD;
      provides no coaching, and none of the innovations associated with MACRO-I coaching. Endpoints&#xD;
      focus particularly on functional capacity achieved by improved implementation of CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To establish efficacy, safety, and acceptability of the MACRO-I via a RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that after 3 months, compared to usual care, participants randomized into&#xD;
      MACRO-I will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1.1: Greater improvements in function as measured by Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care&#xD;
      Computer Adaptive Test (AM-PAC-CAT) Basic Mobility Domain (3 month changes; primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1.2: Greater improvements in function as measured by AM-PAC CAT daily activity domain;&#xD;
      accelerometry; depression; frailty; self-efficacy; quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1.3: Greater CR participation and adherence. H1.4: Greater impact on readmissions and&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine the durability of benefit of MACRO-I compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that after 6 and 12 months (12 months will be captured as timing allows),&#xD;
      compared to usual care, participants randomized into MACRO-I will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2.1: Greater improvement in AM-PAC-CAT basic mobility and daily activity domains;&#xD;
      accelerometry; depression; frailty; self-efficacy; quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2.2: Greater impact in readmissions and hospitalization at 6 and 12 months (12 months will&#xD;
      be captured as timing allows).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To explore characteristics of patients who benefit the most from the MACRO-I as&#xD;
      compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3.1: We anticipate functional capacity and other baseline characteristics will identify&#xD;
      those who benefit from the MACRO-I (exploratory).&#xD;

    <measure>AM-PAC-CAT - Basic Mobility Domain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, i.e., baseline to 3-month change</time_frame>
    <description>AM-PAC-CAT is a self-reported activity limitations measure that assesses perceived difficulty and level of assistance/limitations (Basic Mobility Domain). The Basic Mobility domain characterizes basic movement and physical functioning activities, such as bending, walking, carrying, and climbing stairs. Scaled scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating greater activity levels/fewer limitations.</description>
