      This trial is an examination of a modified WW food program. The intention is to document the&#xD;
      acceptability and efficacy of the dietary plan over 24 weeks. Subjects will participate in a&#xD;
      program similar to WW Freestyle and have access to study-specific weekly workshops and a&#xD;
      suite of study-specific digital tools for tracking eating, activity, and weight. Within a WW&#xD;
      program, participants are provided instructions on calculating points for the foods and&#xD;
      beverages they eat and drink. This study will examine the impact of the modified WW food&#xD;
      program on weight and fitness levels of adults with overweight and obesity.&#xD;
