  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifty patients were randomly selected with oral and/or maxillofacial swelling, thorough case&#xD;
      history and clinical examination were done, then ultrasound examinations were done for all of&#xD;
      them and they were classified into five groups (I. inflammatory/space infection and abscess&#xD;
      swellings), (II. cystic swellings), (III. lymph node swellings), (IV. benign swellings) and&#xD;
      (V. malignant neoplastic swellings) according to their ultrasound features. The patients were&#xD;
      subjected to histopathologic evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty patients with swellings in the oral and/or maxillofacial region were randomly selected.&#xD;
      Any other swellings that were caused by trauma and/or fracture, extended below the neck or&#xD;
      patient reluctant to undergo US were excluded from the study. This study was approved by the&#xD;
      (Research Ethics Committee) (REC), Faculty of Dentistry, Minia University before starting the&#xD;
      research and all the entire patients had signed a standardized informed consent laid down by&#xD;
      REC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive questionnaire was used to assess history and through extra-oral &amp; intra-oral&#xD;
      examinations were carried out and recorded on the basis of criteria reported by Das.11 The&#xD;
      ultrasonographic investigations were carried using an ultrasound diagnostic modality (LOGIQ-&#xD;
      P5) (GE Medical System, Korea) with color Doppler function by using a linear array&#xD;
      transducer, operating at a frequency of (7.5-12 MHz). All the examinations were performed&#xD;
      over the swellings and also compared to the contra-lateral/normal side whenever needed. (Fig.&#xD;
      1) All sonographic images were interpreted by an expert sonologist (15 years experience) and&#xD;
      US features were recorded to extract ultrasonographic guided (USG) diagnosis and patient's&#xD;
      swellings were categorized into five groups: inflammatory/infection/abscess swellings (Group&#xD;
      I), cystic swellings (Group II), lymph node swellings (Group III), benign swellings (Group&#xD;
      IV) and malignant neoplastic swellings (Group V).12 Finally, the included patients were&#xD;
      subjected to either fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) or surgical intervention for&#xD;
      histopathological examination to extract the histopathological diagnosis&#xD;
