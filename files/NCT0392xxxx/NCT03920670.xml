  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this investigation is to compare the performance of two quantitative monitors&#xD;
      utilized on post-anesthesia recovering patients. The ToFscan (Draeger Medical Inc., Telford,&#xD;
      PA) represents one of the few standalone acceleromyography (AMG)-based quantitative monitors&#xD;
      available for routine clinical use in the United States. The TetraGraph (Senzime AB, Uppsala,&#xD;
      Sweden) is a standalone electromyography (EMG)-based quantitative monitor that recently&#xD;
      received Conformité Européene (CE) approval. While both of these quantitative monitors can be&#xD;
      utilized to guide intraoperative NMBA re-dosing and confirm recovery, they provide their&#xD;
      objective data via drastically different techniques.&#xD;

    <description>TetraGraph device is a neuromuscular transmission monitor capable of estimating the depth of neuromuscular block in anesthetized patients who received neuromuscular blocking agents. TetraGraph uses EMG to measure the muscle action potentials that are generated in response to percutaneous electrical neurostimulation. Following simultaneous ulnar nerve stimulation on each arm, the response of the adductor pollicis will be measured.</description>

TetraGraph device is a neuromuscular transmission monitor capable of estimating the depth of neuromuscular block in anesthetized patients who received neuromuscular blocking agents. TetraGraph uses EMG to measure the muscle action potentials that are generated in response to percutaneous electrical neurostimulation. Following simultaneous ulnar nerve stimulation on each arm, the response of the adductor pollicis was measured.&#xD;
ToFscan is a nerve stimulator module used for the measurement of neuromuscular transmission via accelerometry. ToFscan was developed by Drager Technologies, Canada, and it uses a three dimensional piezoelectric sensor that attaches to the thumb via a hand adapter to measure acceleration in multiple planes (Murphy et al, 2018). Following simultaneous ulnar nerve stimulation on each arm, the response of the adductor pollicis was measured.&#xD;
