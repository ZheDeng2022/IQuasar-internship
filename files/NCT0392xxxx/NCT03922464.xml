    <description>Evaluations of the blinded reviewer's Nürnberger-Müller Scale for Cellulite between Baseline (Visit 0/1) and Follow up visits (Visits 4 to 6).&#xD;
The Nurnberger-Muller Scale classifies cellulite into four categories:&#xD;
Stage Zero No dimpling is seen on the skin when you are standing naked in front of the mirror. When the skin is pinched no orange peel effect is seen.&#xD;
Stage One No dimpling is seen on the skin when you are standing, but when you pinch your skin you have bumps and lumps.&#xD;
Stage two You can see dimpling or the orange peel appearance when standing naked in front of the mirror, but not when lie down.&#xD;
Stage three You can see dimpling both when you are standing and lying down.</description>

    <measure>Evaluations of patient satisfaction using the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire at all visits</measure>
    <time_frame>All Visits; Baseline to month 6</time_frame>

Very dissatisfied; Dissatisfied; Slightly satisfied; Satisfied; Very satisfied.</description>

    <description>The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) is a 5-point scale rating global aesthetic improvement in appearance, compared to pretreatment, as judged by the investigator. The rating categories are &quot;worse,&quot; &quot;no change,&quot; &quot;improved,&quot; &quot;much improved,&quot; and &quot;very much improved.&quot;</description>

    <intervention_name>Poly-L-lactic acid (Sculptra® Aesthetic)</intervention_name>
    <description>Sculptra® Aesthetic is a commercially available product that is licensed for sale in Canada. It is an injectable implant that contains microparticles of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), a biocompatible, biodegradable, synthetic polymer from the alpha-hydroxy-acid family. Sculptra® Aesthetic is suitable for increasing the volume of depressed areas, particularly to correct skin depressions, such as in skin creases, wrinkles, folds, scars and for skin aging. Sculptra® Aesthetic is also suitable for large volume corrections of the signs of facial fat loss (lipoatrophy).&#xD;
The safety and efficacy of Sculptra® Aesthetic has been investigated in the literature and is generally considered safe and effective. PLLA has been used successfully to reverse HIV-associated lipoatrophy as well as to rejuvenate the face, neck, décolletage, hands, abdomen and gluteal regions.</description>
