    <textblock>
      Alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse and violence in families are co-occurring risk factors&#xD;
      that drive health disparities and mortality among Native Americans (NA), making the long-term&#xD;
      goal of this research is to promote health and wellness, while preventing and reducing AOD&#xD;
      abuse and violence in NA families by testing an efficacious, sustainable, culturally-relevant&#xD;
      and family-centered intervention for cross-national dissemination. The central hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the sustainable and community-based Weaving Healthy Families program, will reduce and&#xD;
      postpone AOD use among NA adults and youth, decrease and prevent violence in families, and&#xD;
      promote resilience and wellness (including mental health) among NA adults and youth. The&#xD;
      expected outcomes of the proposed research are an efficacious, culturally relevant, and&#xD;
      sustainable community based program to promote health and wellness that will address the&#xD;
      factors that drive health disparities and promote individual, family, and community&#xD;
      resilience.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol and drug (AOD) abuse and family violence are co-occurring risk factors for Native&#xD;
      American (NA) health disparities and are associated with the leading causes of death, such as&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. However, extant interventions often fail to&#xD;
      holistically promote resilience, health, and wellness and instead address problems in&#xD;
      isolation. There have been few NA culturally-based and family-focused, interventions that&#xD;
      enhance family resilience and prevent and reduce AOD abuse and violence in families. Given&#xD;
      the gap in community and culturally-grounded programs to prevent AOD abuse and violence in&#xD;
      families, there is a critical need to test the efficacy of such sustainable community-based&#xD;
      interventions. The long-term goal of this research is to promote health and wellness, while&#xD;
      preventing and reducing AOD abuse and violence in NA families by testing an efficacious,&#xD;
      sustainable, culturally-relevant and family-centered intervention for cross-national&#xD;
      dissemination. Using community-based participatory research methods (CBPR), the overall&#xD;
      objectives of the proposed research is to use a stepped-wedge trial design (SWTD) to test the&#xD;
      efficacy of a culturally modified intervention that is facilitated by Tribally-based&#xD;
      community health representatives (CHRs) and to use the consolidated framework for&#xD;
      implementation research (CFIR) to examine the barriers and facilitators for intervention&#xD;
      sustainability and implementation. The central hypothesis is that the sustainable and&#xD;
      community-based, &quot;Weaving Healthy Families program&quot;-a shortened and culturally adapted&#xD;
      version of the Celebrating Families! Program-will reduce and postpone AOD use, decrease and&#xD;
      prevent violence in families, and promote resilience and wellness (including mental health)&#xD;
      among NA adults and youth. This intervention seeks to promote wellness by targeting key&#xD;
      behavioral (AOD), mental/emotional (emotional regulation/anger management, cognitions,&#xD;
      resilience), social and familial (healthy and safe relationships, the family environment, and&#xD;
      parenting), cultural (values, traditions), and physical (nutrition) factors. Investigators&#xD;
      test the efficacy and gain knowledge in sustainability and implementation by: Aim 1: Test the&#xD;
      efficacy of the modified intervention on AOD and violence reduction and resilience&#xD;
      enhancement. Using an open cohort, multiple baseline SWTD and multilevel and longitudinal&#xD;
      modeling, investigators will test our working hypothesis that the intervention will reduce&#xD;
      parental AOD misuse and violence, postpone youth AOD use, and enhance family members'&#xD;
      resilience and wellness. Aim 2: Evaluate the sustainability and feasibility of the&#xD;
      intervention's implementation. Investigators will use the CFIR and a convergent mixed-method&#xD;
      design to evaluate barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation, testing our&#xD;
      working hypothesis that the modified intervention will provide a culturally relevant and&#xD;
      feasible model to promote wellness in a sustainable way. The expected outcomes of the&#xD;
      proposed research are an efficacious, culturally relevant, and sustainable community based&#xD;
      program to promote health and wellness for tribes cross-nationally.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, Pre-test, Post-test (within one month of completion of intervention), 6, 9, and 12 month follow-ups.</time_frame>
    <description>The CTS2 is a comprehensive self-reported inventory designed to measure five scales: Negotiation (positive verbal conflict resolution skills), Psychological Aggression, Physical Assault, Sexual Coercion, and Injury. Respondents rate each item on a 7-point Likert- style frequency scale (0 = this has never happened before, 1 = once in the past year, 2 = twice in the past year, 3 = 3-5 time in the past year, 4 = 6-10 times in the past year, 5 = 11-20 times in the past year, 6 = more than 20 times in the past year, and 7 = not in the past year, but it did happen before). To create interpretable scores, values 1 and 2 remained the same, and values 3 through 6 were recoded to be the midpoints (3 = 4, 4 = 8, 5 = 15, 6 = 25). Frequency scores (how often) for each subscale are added (Range 1-12 for frequency, higher scores indicating higher levels of each subscale). Dummy are created with each item and subscale for prevalence (1=yes in the past year; 0=not in the past year).</description>

    <description>Measure of depressive symptoms for adults. Participant's indicate how often over the past two weeks they were bothered by depressive symptoms. For each of the nine items, four response options were available. These were: 0 = 'not at all', 1 = 'several days', 2 = 'more than half the days', and 3 = 'nearly every day'. When summed, the nine scale items had a possible range of 0 to 27 and the total score corresponded to an individual's level of depressive symptoms along a continuum that was scored as: minimal (score of 0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-19), and severe (20-27) depression. PHQ-9 scores of 10 or higher indicate clinical depression, a cut point validated across numerous studies.</description>

    <measure>Change in the PC-PTSD=Primary Care PTSD Screen</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, Pre-test, Post-test (within one month of completion of intervention), and 12 month follow-ups.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of PTSD for adults. Preliminary results from validation studies suggest that a cut-point of 3 on the PC-PTSD-5 (e.g., respondent answers &quot;yes&quot; to any 3 of 5 questions about how the traumatic event(s) have affected them over the past month) is optimally sensitive to probable PTSD. Optimizing sensitivity minimizes false negative screen results. Using a cut-point of 4 is considered optimally efficient. Optimizing efficiency balances false positive and false negative results.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, Pre-test, and Post-test (within one month of completion of intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of perceived historical loss. The Historical Loss Scale (HLS) is an adapted version, creating a 15 time scale measuring the frequency with which people think of historical loss from a continuum of the following: 1 = 'several times a day'; 2 = 'daily'; 3 = 'weekly'; 4 = 'monthly'; 5 = 'yearly or at special times'; and 6 = 'never'. The following items were added the following culturally relevant items to the original 12-item scale: &quot;Loss of family unity and increase in family violence&quot;; &quot;Loss of respect for women&quot;; and &quot;Losses from man-made disasters, flooding, pollution, and destruction of natural resources.&quot; Responses were summed (range = 15-75) and higher values indicated a higher degree of historical loss.</description>

    <description>The Weaving Healthy Families program is created from integrating the widely disseminated, ecological, innovative, and culturally grounded Framework of Historical Oppression, Resilience, and Transcendence (FHORT) with the the Celebrating Families! evidenced-based program (EBP). The goal of this program is to reduce and postpone Alcohol and other Drug (AOD) use, decrease and prevent violence in families, and promote resilience and wellness (including mental health) among NA adults and youth. This intervention seeks to promote wellness by targeting key behavioral (AOD), mental/emotional (emotional regulation/anger management, cognitions, resilience), social and familial (healthy and safe relationships, the family environment, and parenting), cultural (values, traditions), and physical (nutrition) factors.</description>
