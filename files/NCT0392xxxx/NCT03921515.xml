      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The way the body heals and protects itself from getting sick is called the immune response.&#xD;
      Some people with weak immune systems get sick often or get rashes and skin infections.&#xD;
      Researchers want to find out how the immune system and skin problems are related so they can&#xD;
      help these people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about how immune response and skin healing are related to each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-65 with hyper IgE syndrome or Job syndrome or people ages 7-65 with chronic&#xD;
      granulomatous disease. Healthy volunteers ages 18 65 are also needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 to 3 visits within about a week. Visits will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a wells device strapped to the inside of the forearm. It will suction&#xD;
      the skin and pull the top layer away to form 8 blisters. The skin over the blisters and the&#xD;
      liquid inside will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 4 skin biopsies. A sharp tool will remove a small plug of skin&#xD;
      from the forearm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin on participants skin will be rubbed with a cotton swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have an overnight visit. They will have the blister device placed back&#xD;
      on the arm. The wells will be lined up over the blister wounds. The wells will be filled with&#xD;
      either saline or the participant s blood serum. The device will be covered and left on the&#xD;
      arm for up to 24 hours. Doctors will periodically remove some liquid from the wells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of community-associated (CA) staphylococcal infections, especially those caused&#xD;
      by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), has increased in recent years. Skin&#xD;
      and soft tissues are the primary sites for these infections. Although many patients without&#xD;
      apparent underlying immune dysfunction suffer from recurrent and persistent skin infections&#xD;
      with S.aureus, patients with conditions such as hyper immunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES, or Job&#xD;
      s syndrome) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) are disproportionately affected. Although&#xD;
      underlying host molecular defects responsible for some of these predisposing conditions have&#xD;
      been uncovered in recent years, the skin immune response to S. aureus infections has not been&#xD;
      elucidated in either healthy volunteers or susceptible populations. We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      local skin response determines susceptibility to S. aureus skin infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sample collection protocol, we will perform exploratory evaluations of&#xD;
      anti-staphylococcal immune responses in healthy volunteers, subjects with HIES, and subjects&#xD;
      with CGD. Following screening and baseline procedures, including blood draw and skin swab,&#xD;
      subjects will have the option to undergo blister induction, where a suction device will be&#xD;
      used to induce skin blisters on the forearm. The tops of the blisters and blister fluid will&#xD;
      be collected for research testing and storage for future research. An optional overnight&#xD;
      inpatient stay may be performed to collect additional cellular infiltrates in response to&#xD;
      autologous serum and/or sterile saline. Subjects may also have up to 4 skin punch biopsies&#xD;
      from the forearm over the course of a week to capture wound healing progress and identify&#xD;
      involved genes. All research procedures will be performed at the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Clinical Center (NIH CC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this research is to perform ex vivo assessment of wound healing&#xD;
      pathways using a skin blister model and skin biopsies to obtain keratinocyte cultures and&#xD;
      evaluate skin immune responses. We will use three experimental approaches: 1) ex vivo&#xD;
      evaluation of anti-microbial responses and tissue remodeling through derivation of&#xD;
      keratinocyte cultures from skin blisters and biopsies, 2) in vivo and ex vivo assessment of&#xD;
      cellular response after blister induction using overnight exposure to autologous serum and/or&#xD;
      sterile saline, and 3) evaluation of in vivo responses to skin biopsies. We anticipate that&#xD;
      the research will provide critical new information on the human skin immune and remodeling&#xD;
      responses and will have direct relevance for the development of vaccines, diagnostics, and&#xD;
      therapeutics.&#xD;
