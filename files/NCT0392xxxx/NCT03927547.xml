      Overall objective: To understand the feasibility of performing a randomized trial using a&#xD;
      simple, minimally-invasive postural therapy approach to improve sleep disordered breathing&#xD;
      (SDB).&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the relative efficacy of postural therapy (a 15-degree wedge mattress) on&#xD;
           measures of chronic cardiometabolic stress in high altitude residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the tolerability of postural therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes, at 4 and 8 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation (SPO2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of hypoxemia exposure: the investigators will evaluate for differences in&#xD;
           average hemoglobin and erythropoietin concentrations between intervention groups using&#xD;
           t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as considered appropriate. If transformations are&#xD;
           necessary, the investigators will use Box-Cox power transform to identify the best&#xD;
           transformation for the investigators' data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of metabolic dysfunction: the investigators will evaluate for differences in&#xD;
           average Glycated hemoglobin test (HbA1c), homeostatic model assessment of insulin&#xD;
           resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL),&#xD;
           High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides, SVEGF-R1 , and soluble&#xD;
           Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (SVEGF-1) concentrations between intervention groups&#xD;
           using t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as appropriate. If transformations are&#xD;
           necessary, the investigators will use Box-Cox power transform to identify the best&#xD;
           transformation for the investigators' data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of cardiometabolic stress: the investigators will evaluate for differences in&#xD;
           average systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse, and %&#xD;
           change in endothelial function (reactive hyperemia index) as assessed by brachial artery&#xD;
           reactivity testing (BART) between intervention groups using t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum&#xD;
           tests, as considered appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence (the average number of nights during the 8-week period that participants slept&#xD;
           on the wedge mattress),&#xD;
