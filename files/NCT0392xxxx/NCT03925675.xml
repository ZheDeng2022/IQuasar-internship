  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the use of the investigational agent Axumin&#xD;
      (fluciclovine-F18) with PET/CT imaging in combination with standard MR imaging to detect&#xD;
      remaining or recurrent brain tumor.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with recurrent enhancing mass on MRI in the side of a diagnosed and treated high&#xD;
      grade glioma or metastatic brain tumor and consenting to study protocol will undergo&#xD;
      18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT imaging once prior to surgery for brain tumor recurrence. Surgery for&#xD;
      recurrent brain tumor will follow standard of care treatment that includes either biopsy of&#xD;
      the region or interest or as complete as possible tumor resection followed by&#xD;
      histopathological analysis. Outcome evaluation will be analysis of tumor histology and&#xD;
      imaging results, comparison of MRI, MRSI, and 18F-Fluciclovine imaging and relationship of&#xD;
      imaging findings with histopathology and anatomical location of recurrent tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In this study, we will investigate the potential of 18F-fluciclovine to aid the&#xD;
           visualization of residual or recurrent gliomas as depicted by 18F-Fluciclovine PET&#xD;
           imaging compared to standard MRI sequences [T1 weighted imaging (T1WI) with contrast,&#xD;
           diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion weighted imaging (PWI), T2 weighted fluid&#xD;
           attenuated inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR)] using 3D image fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the residual or recurrent of glioma as depicted by 3D short echo time MR&#xD;
           spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) using metabolic tumor markers such as elevated choline,&#xD;
           myo-Inositol and lipids and reduced N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) compared to standard MRI&#xD;
           sequences (T1WI with contrast, PWI, T2 FLAIR) using 3D image fusion before neurosurgical&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To spatially register the residual or recurrent glioma as depicted by 18F-Fluciclovine&#xD;
           PET imaging with MR T1WI, DWI, PWI, and 3D MRSI to a) quantitate (SUVmax, SUVmean,&#xD;
           ADCmean, rCBV, Cho, NAA, lipids, Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA) and correlate areas of PET+, T1WI+ and&#xD;
           MRSI+ areas and b) characterize different metabolic profiles measured with MRSI in areas&#xD;
           of glioma infiltration depicted by PET imaging and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Biopsy and pathology confirmation of tumor vs treatment-induced necrosis in spatially&#xD;
           registered areas of interest will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis Although 18F-Axuminâ„¢ is an FDA approved PET imaging agent for biological&#xD;
      recurrent prostate cancer with extensive safety and toxicity data already documented, all&#xD;
      patients will be monitored closely for adverse reactions after administration.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subject who agree to participate in this study prior to surgery and sign the consent document, will have the following procedures done:&#xD;
Axumin (fluciclovine-F18) PET/CT scan will be done to evaluate possible recurrence to help differentiate scar (fake recurrence) from true tumor recurrence, which could be at any time point after initial surgery.&#xD;
Standard of care imaging surveillance will be done after initial tumor surgery&#xD;
Standard of care surgery will include the removal of the tumor.&#xD;
Tumor sample will then be analyzed and compared to the imaging (comparison of MRI, MRSI, and Axumin (fluciclovine-F18) imaging) results to determine an accurate diagnosis and location of tumor in the body.</intervention_model_description>
