      atezolizumab treatment in patients with Stage IIIb or Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) who have progressed following standard systemic chemotherapy (including if given in&#xD;
      combination with anti-PD-1 therapy or after anti-PD-1 as monotherapy).&#xD;

    <description>EQ-5D-5L, EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire is a self-report health status questionnaire that consists of six questions used to calculate a health utility score for use in health economic analysis. The EuroQol EQ-5D has two components: a five-item health state profile that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, as well as a visual analog scale (VAS) that measures health state. Overall scores range from 0 to 1, with low scores representing a higher level of dysfunction.</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-LC13, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Supplemental Lung Cancer Module will be used to assess self-reported outcomes. EORTC QLQ-LC13 includes 13 items that address key lung cancer symptoms (cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and site-specific pain), treatment-related adverse effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy and alopecia) and pain medication. The dysphagia scale is multi-item, while the rest are single-item scales.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from all acute toxicities from previous therapy,&#xD;
             excluding alopecia and toxicities related to prior anti-PD-1-therapy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with EGFR mutation or ALK fusion oncogene&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic CNS metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Leptomeningeal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled pericardial effusion or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Significant cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant renal disorder requiring dialysis or indication for renal transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
