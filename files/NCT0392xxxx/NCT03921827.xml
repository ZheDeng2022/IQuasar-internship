  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial stenosis is prevalent among Asians and constitute a common cause of cerebral&#xD;
      ischemia. While the best medical therapy carries stroke recurrence rates in access of 10% per&#xD;
      year, intracranial stenting was associated with unacceptable peri-procedural ischemic events.&#xD;
      Cerebral ischemic events are strongly related to the severity of intracranial stenosis, being&#xD;
      high in patients with severe intracranial stenosis with poor vasodilatory reserve. Enhanced&#xD;
      External Counter-Pulsation (EECP) therapy is known to improve myocardial perfusion by&#xD;
      facilitating the development of collateral blood vessels in the heart. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that EECP therapy may be useful in patients with severe stenosis of intracranial&#xD;
      internal carotid (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among Asian patients, intracranial stenosis is more common and accounts for about 30-50% of&#xD;
      all strokes. The risk of recurrent stroke or TIA in presence of intracranial stenosis of a&#xD;
      major intracranial artery and recent TIA/ stroke is about 23% at 1 year despite treatment.&#xD;
      Recurrence rate for stroke/TIA in intracranial atherosclerosis is dependent on degree of&#xD;
      stenosis as well as presence of collaterals. In WASID study, patients with more than 70%&#xD;
      stenosis had greater risk of recurrent event then those with 50-69%. Interestingly, patients&#xD;
      with more than 70% intracranial stenosis with good collaterals demonstrated a lower risk for&#xD;
      subsequent cerebral ischemic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two main mechanisms of ischemic stroke (IS) in these patients are thromboembolism and&#xD;
      cerebral hemodynamic insufficiency. While Transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring can establish&#xD;
      thrombo-embolic phenomenon and help in planning the appropriate antithrombotic treatment,&#xD;
      assessment of dynamic cerebral hemodynamic insufficiency remains a complex issue, and may&#xD;
      serve as a potential target for improving the outcomes (and reducing recurrent cerebral&#xD;
      ischemia) in patients with severe intracranial stenoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options for Intracranial stenosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-platelet agents are recommended for secondary prevention of IS. WASID trial compared&#xD;
      warfarin with INR of 2-3 against aspirin, did not show any difference in outcome of stroke&#xD;
      recurrence. Furthermore, aspirin was found to be safer as compared to warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of short-term double antiplatelet therapy is shown to be effective in reducing stroke/TIA&#xD;
      recurrence risk. In CLAIR study, patients with recent symptoms (&lt;/=7 days) and with&#xD;
      intracranial stenosis were randomized to clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy.&#xD;
      Combination anti-platelet therapy reduced micro-embolic signals on TCD on Day 2 and 7. Use of&#xD;
      double antiplatelet in intracranial stenosis was also supported by findings of SAMMPRIS trial&#xD;
      in which patient with recent stroke of TIA with 70-99% intracranial stenosis were randomized&#xD;
      to angioplasty or maximal medical treatment. The 90 day recurrence risk of 5.8% in the&#xD;
      medical arm was much lower than 10.7% recurrence rate observed in WASID trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracranial to intracranial bypass has been compared with medical management in patients&#xD;
      with intracranial stenosis and it did not lower the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it was associated with worse outcome as compared to medical management. Also,&#xD;
      the recently published COSS study failed to show any benefit of surgical treatment for&#xD;
      carotid occlusion, largely related to better than expected event rates in the medical arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular treatment has been used as a potential therapeutic option for intracranial&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. In 2005, FDA approved self expanding Wingspan stent for use in medically&#xD;
      refractory patients who harbor 50-99% stenosis of major intracranial artery. In 2011&#xD;
      Chimowitz et al published results of SAMMPRIS trial, which compared percutaneous&#xD;
      trans-luminal angioplasty and stenting with medical management. Patients with recent TIA or&#xD;
      stroke attributed to 70-99% stenosis of intracranial vessels were recruited in this trial.&#xD;
      Enrollment of this trial was stopped after 451 patients were recruited as angioplasty and&#xD;
      stenting group was associated with 14.7% event rate (stroke or death) at 30-days as compared&#xD;
      to medical management arm (5.8% event rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral vasodilatory reserve:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of cerebral vasodilatory reserve (CVR) in patients with persistent arterial&#xD;
      occlusive disease is important since inadequate CVR in symptomatic patients is considered a&#xD;
      major risk factor for subsequent ischemic events. By using refined techniques for measuring&#xD;
      cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), in addition to standard clinical&#xD;
      and angiographic studies, it is possible to identify a small subgroup of patients with&#xD;
      impaired CVR who are at risk of subsequent stroke. Accordingly, impaired CVR is often&#xD;
      regarded as the basis for performing extra-/intracranial (EC/IC) bypass surgery with the aim&#xD;
      of increasing CBF and restore CVR in this highly selected patient subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying patients who are at increased risk for hemodynamic stroke is important because&#xD;
      they may benefit from flow augmentation procedures, such as carotid endarterectomy, EC-IC&#xD;
      bypass, or even angioplasty. The cerebral hemodynamic status can be determined by measuring&#xD;
      CBF before and after vasodilatory challenge, which can be done with either hypercapnia or&#xD;
      acetazolamide. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, has been shown to increase CBF&#xD;
      in healthy subjects by inducing transient vasodilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral autoregulation enables a constant CBF over a wide range of systemic blood pressure&#xD;
      by varying the diameter of the intracranial arterioles. This may fail in some patients with&#xD;
      severe steno-occlusive disease. TCD can measure vasomotor reactivity (VMR) by assessment of&#xD;
      flow velocities in response to increasing carbon dioxide levels. This can be performed by&#xD;
      simple breath-holding test and calculating the so-called 'breath holding index (BHI)', BHI is&#xD;
      calculated as the relative increase in the MFV during breath holding divided by the time of&#xD;
      apnea in seconds. In normal persons, the BHI amounts to 1.2Â±0.6. Silverstrini et al&#xD;
      prospectively evaluated BHI in case-controlled studies and showed that impaired VMR can help&#xD;
      to identify patients at higher risk of stroke in a population with asymptomatic carotid&#xD;
      stenosis or a previously symptomatic carotid occlusion. A decreased VMR suggests failure of&#xD;
      collateral flow to adapt to the stenosis progression. Various studies, using different&#xD;
      provocative measures for assessing the VMR, demonstrated a remarkable ipsilateral event rate&#xD;
      of around 30% (30% risk of stroke/ TIA during about 2 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study, the investigators demonstrated the phenomenon of 'intracranial steal' in&#xD;
      patients with persisting intracranial occlusions where, hypercapnia can paradoxically&#xD;
      decrease the residual flow velocity in the affected vessel at the expected time of normal&#xD;
      brain vasodilation when blood pool is shifted to non-ischemic areas. The phenomenon of&#xD;
      &quot;reversed Robin Hood&quot;, an analogy with &quot;rob the poor to feed the rich&quot; was replicated by&#xD;
      acetazolamide-challenged HMPAO-SPECT imaging. The investigators have demonstrated recently&#xD;
      the value of multimodality evaluation of CVR is feasible and may aid in taking therapeutic&#xD;
      decisions regarding revascularization procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP) is a new noninvasive therapy used to treat&#xD;
      patients with angina, congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic&#xD;
      shock by augmenting blood flow to the cardiac and systemic arterial circuits. EECP's&#xD;
      hemodynamic effects include 20% to 25% improvement in arterial flow volume in the carotid,&#xD;
      renal and hepatic arteries, with a 20% to 40% improvement in coronary artery blood flow&#xD;
      accompanied by a 12% increase in left ventricular (LV) stroke volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EECP as a frontline treatment for revascularization in patients with angina refractory to&#xD;
      medical therapy has shown similar findings to coronary artery bypass and percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary interventions including improvement in cardiac functional class, decreased anginal&#xD;
      episodes, and reduction in nitroglycerin use. EECP has been shown to produce similar&#xD;
      hemodynamic effects to intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP), yet is a noninvasive technology&#xD;
      carrying less implementation risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, TCD measurements in recovering ischemic stroke patients undergoing EECP have&#xD;
      demonstrated a significant increase in MCA flow velocities. Peak diastolic augmented&#xD;
      velocities (PDAV) averaged 72 + 29 cm/second a 196% increase in flow(RMCA), and 78 + 30&#xD;
      cm/second a 199% increase in flow (LMCA) on EECP, significantly higher than pre-procedural&#xD;
      EDV (RMCA 37+11cm/second, p=0.014; LMCA 39+9cm/second, p=0.022). Given the altered waveform&#xD;
      morphology, traditional calculation of MFV using peak systole and end-diastole would fail to&#xD;
      capture EECP's flow augmentation effects. Augmented MFV (AMFV) was recalculated by&#xD;
      substituting EDV with a measure derived from the summed average of PDAV and EDV (augmented&#xD;
      diastolic velocity [ADV]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in whom a long stenotic segment involved both terminal ICA and proximal MCA would be&#xD;
      classified as having a steno-occlusive disease of terminal ICA. Steno-occlusive disease of&#xD;
      ICA or MCA would be considered severe (&gt;70%) according to the velocity criteria and presence&#xD;
      of 'blunted' flow spectra in the arterial segment distal to the stenosis. Therefore, tandem&#xD;
      lesions in a single arterial tree (intracranial ICA and MCA, proximal MCA and distal MCA,&#xD;
      extracranial ICA and ipsilateral intracranial ICA or extracranial ICA and ipsilateral MCA),&#xD;
      if associated with blunted flow spectra in distal MCA would qualify the criteria for &gt;70%&#xD;
      stenosis. Importantly, the TCD diagnostic criteria for intracranial stenosis in our&#xD;
      neurovascular laboratory have been validated against CT angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be randomized (1:1 by using drawing previously prepared chits in a bag) into&#xD;
      either maximal medical management (plus sham EECP) or maximal medical management plus EECP.&#xD;
      EECP sessions are planned 5 times/week for a total of 35 sessions. CVR would be measured at&#xD;
      baseline as well as at 4 months of EECP treatment initiation. Improvement in CVR on&#xD;
      symptomatic side would be measured by TCD-BHI as well as acetazolamide challenged HMPAO-SPECT&#xD;
      and compared with patients in medical management (and sham EECP) arm for significant&#xD;
      difference. Patients will also be followed up for recurrence of stroke/TIA during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal medical management would be same in both groups as per the current AHA/ASA&#xD;
      guidelines. Briefly, all ischemic stroke cases with intracranial stenosis receive dual&#xD;
      antiplatelet agents (aspirin and clopidogrel for 1 month followed by clopidogrel or aspirin&#xD;
      long term). The investigators aim to keep HbA1c at 7% or less in all cases. Blood pressure&#xD;
      target in the stroke patients eligible for this study (at least 1 month after acute stroke)&#xD;
      is less than 140/90mmHg. For lipids, the target LDL is less than 2.6mmol/L.&#xD;
