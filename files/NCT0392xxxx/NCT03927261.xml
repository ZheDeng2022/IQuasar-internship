  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human dose escalation/dose expansion study to evaluate safety and identify&#xD;
      best dose (or recommended Phase 2 dose) of modified immune cells, PRGN-3006 (autologous&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells), in adult patients with relapsed or recurred acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML), high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CMML). Autologous CAR T cells are modified immune cells that have been engineered&#xD;
      in the laboratory to specifically target a protein found on tumor cells and kill them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, nonrandomized, investigator-initiated Phase 1/1b safety and&#xD;
      tolerability study. The safety and tolerability of PRGN-3006 T cells will be assessed&#xD;
      following intravenous administration of escalating doses in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory AML or higher risk MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll in two phases: an initial dose escalation phase followed by a dose&#xD;
      expansion phase.&#xD;
