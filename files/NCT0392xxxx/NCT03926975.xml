  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of two instruments to measure changes in two&#xD;
      ocular structures: 1) the anterior chamber depth (ACD) - measured using low coherence optical&#xD;
      biometry, and 2) minimum rim width of the optic nerve head (MRW) - measured using optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography. Changes in these ocular structures indicate fluctuations in intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP) and will be measured during scleral contact lens (SGP) wear to determine if&#xD;
      SGP wear influences IOP. We hypothesize that a scleral lens increases the intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP) during active wear and that the ACD and MRW will also change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contact lenses are often used to correct vision blur. The most common types of contact lenses&#xD;
      include those referred to as 'soft' and 'rigid'. Visual acuity through rigid lenses often&#xD;
      surpasses that of soft lenses. Historically, these lenses have been small in diameter, and&#xD;
      hence patients also felt discomfort when wearing the lenses. Scleral lenses are relatively&#xD;
      new, customized devices that have gained popularity with patients and practitioners in the&#xD;
      past 5-10 years, because they are more comfortable and provide more stable vision than the&#xD;
      small diameter rigid contact lenses. However, relatively little is known about the&#xD;
      physiologic response of the eye to the scleral lens, or the long-term effects of their use,&#xD;
      since they are such a new modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintaining the IOP within the eye is imperative to prevent damage to ocular tissue, which&#xD;
      can occur in glaucoma. Given the landing of scleral lens overlying the sclera and ciliary&#xD;
      body, which assist in modulating the transport of fluid in the eye, there is a potential for&#xD;
      these lenses to impinge on fluid drainage which could lead to increases of IOP during scleral&#xD;
      lens wear. The placement of the lens creates an obstacle in evaluating IOP while the lens is&#xD;
      actually on the eye (covering the cornea), and since increases in IOP may only occur during&#xD;
      lens wear, which is removed when determining clinical IOP measurements, it is difficult to&#xD;
      monitor IOP during scleral lens wear with traditional IOP instrumentation (ie. iCare,&#xD;
      Goldman, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive imaging technology that has revolutionized how&#xD;
      the retina and optic nerve are clinically evaluated. The optic nerve head is typically&#xD;
      assessed using radial scans, from which the minimal distance from the Bruch's membrane&#xD;
      opening to the inner limiting lamina is quantified as the minimum rim width (MRW). With&#xD;
      changes in IOP, the MRW is known to also change in thickness. Many studies are investigating&#xD;
      the MRW changes during IOP fluctuations, with studies finding a decrease in MRW during acute&#xD;
      IOP increase. In this project, MRW will be used to indirectly assess changes in IOP by&#xD;
      measuring the MRW periodically during active scleral lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we are incorporating low coherence optical biometry (Lenstar) to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of the scleral lens pressure on the anterior chamber. Using the Lenstar, corneal&#xD;
      thickness, anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness and vitreous chamber depth can be&#xD;
      quantified. In this project, ACD will be used to indirectly evaluate changes in the pressure&#xD;
      within the anterior chamber. The assumption is that the ACD will change based on changes in&#xD;
      pressure in the scleral lens tear reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will add to the knowledge of how the scleral lens affects the dynamic pressure&#xD;
      system of the eye. Based on the implications for disease with chronic increases and&#xD;
      fluctuations in IOP, this is important information to understand with the scleral lens, a&#xD;
      relatively new refractive treatment modality.&#xD;
