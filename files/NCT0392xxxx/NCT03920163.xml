      ERAS IN TRAUMA Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) or enhanced recovery protocols (ERP) is&#xD;
      a concept first described by Kehlet in the early 1990s .Since its introduction, ERAS&#xD;
      protocols have been successfully used in elective gastrointestinal surgery (colorectal,&#xD;
      hepatobiliary and gastric), and there has been widespread acceptance and implementation in&#xD;
      other surgical disciplines including urology, vascular , thoracic surgery and orthopaedics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach employs a multimodal perioperative care pathway designed to attenuate the&#xD;
      surgical stress response and accelerate postoperative recovery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      These benefits should be easily transferrable to the trauma patient population, if not&#xD;
      greater, since trauma patients are generally younger, fitter and metabolically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma centres in developing countries constantly battle with reduced bed availability and&#xD;
      restricted health care budgets. Optimization of health care practice is therefore urgent,&#xD;
      particularly in trauma surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Penetrating abdominal trauma is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in large urban&#xD;
      trauma centres. It accounts for a significant number of hospital admissions and consumes a&#xD;
      large portion of the health care budget.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the trauma patient, the aim is to maintain the 'pre- injury' physiological status.&#xD;
      Improving patient outcomes with reduced morbidity and early hospital discharge reduces the&#xD;
      cost of treating these patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The small pilot study by Moydien et al., showed that ERPS can be successfully implemented&#xD;
      with significant shorter hospital stays without any increase in postoperative complications&#xD;
      in a select group of trauma patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for isolated penetrating&#xD;
      abdominal trauma. Furthermore, the study showed that ERPS can also be applied to patients&#xD;
      undergoing emergency surgery. Given the fact that penetrating abdominal trauma remains a&#xD;
      substantial burden of disease, especially in developing countries such as South Africa, this&#xD;
      proven approach to patient care in elective surgery can now be safely employed in the trauma&#xD;
      and emergency setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Penetrating abdominal trauma remains a substantial burden of disease, especially in&#xD;
      developing countries such as South Africa, and especially the Western Cape, where we have&#xD;
      seen an increase in the number of trauma patients being treated for penetrating injuries at&#xD;
      our level 1 centre. This has in turn led to severe constraints on the available resources,&#xD;
      with the trauma ward often at maximum capacity with delayed discharges due to poor&#xD;
      ambulation, post operative complications, and delay in return to enteral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no randomized controlled study in the trauma literature, evaluating&#xD;
      enhanced recovery after trauma procedures .It is our hypothesis to that implementing an&#xD;
      &quot;ERATS&quot; protocol , will lead to a reduction in morbidity, reduction in hospital stay , with a&#xD;
      subsequent decrease in costs. This will allow us to implement this as a new standard protocol&#xD;
      , and thus change the current practice in stable penetrating trauma patients undergoing&#xD;
      explorative laparotomy in our unit, nationally and worldwide.&#xD;
