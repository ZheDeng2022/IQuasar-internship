  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, single dose, non-randomized, sequential, fixed-sequence&#xD;
      study, which will evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of dolutegravir (DTG) in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects. The study will contain 6 periods with five prototype liquid formulations for&#xD;
      evaluation in fasted state. In period 1, 2 and 3 single reference dose of 2 dispersible&#xD;
      tablets of 5 milligram DTG will be administered and at least 2 liquid prototype DTG&#xD;
      formulations (containing a target total dose of 10mg DTG). There will be a wash-out period of&#xD;
      7 days between each period. In period 4 through 6, there would be options to evaluate&#xD;
      additional prototype liquid formulations. The total duration of study will be up to 17 weeks.&#xD;
      DTG has been found to be safe and effective in adults infected with human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV). DTG dispersible tablets have been developed primarily for use in children from 4&#xD;
      weeks to 6 years of age, and a DTG liquid formulation are is being developed to study the&#xD;
      appropriate dose needed for the HIV-exposed and infected neonatal population in the first&#xD;
      four weeks of life. Approximately 18 subjects will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>This was a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, single dose study in healthy adult participants conducted at a single center in the United Kingdom (UK) to assess the prototype liquid fomulations of dolutegravir (DTG) versus DTG dispersible tablets (reference).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 22 participants were enrolled in the study. The washout time between dosing in consecutive study periods was a minimum of 7 days.</pre_assignment_details>
