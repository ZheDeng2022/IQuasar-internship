    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CAPA-IVM versus standard&#xD;
      IVM in women with polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) .&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Patients preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PCOM are allowed to enroll in the study: (1) women with normal menstrual cycle&#xD;
      lengths (≤35 days), and (2) women with oligomenorrhea (menstruation occurring at intervals&#xD;
      &gt;35 days with 4-9 periods/year) or total amenorrhea. Patients were followed up until the end&#xD;
      of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have their first clinic visit on day 2 of the menstrual cycle. At this visit a blood&#xD;
      sample was taken for assessment of FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone), LH (Luteinizing&#xD;
      Hormone), estradiol and progesterone, and they have their gonadotropin injection 150 IU&#xD;
      (international unit) once a day in the afternoon. All patients return in the morning of the&#xD;
      next day (cycle day 3) for ultrasound and and the final dose of gonadotropin was given in the&#xD;
      afternoon (2pm). When all follicles were &lt;8 mm in diameter, another dose of gonadotropin was&#xD;
      given, and patients returned the next day for ultrasound, blood tests and have their final&#xD;
      dose of gonadotropin that afternoon (2pm). The maximum number of gonadotropin injections are&#xD;
      three, and oocyte retrieval is scheduled at 42-46 hours after the last gonadotropin injection&#xD;
      in all patients. Ultrasound and blood tests to determine FSH, LH, estradiol and progesterone&#xD;
      levels are performed on the day of OPU (Oocyte Pick-up). During OPU, follicle size is&#xD;
      measured before puncture. Larger follicles (≥6 mm) are punctured first, then the needle&#xD;
      flushes, then smaller follicles (&lt;6 mm) are punctured. Therefore, each tube contains COCs&#xD;
      (Cumulus-Oocyte Complex) of a specific size (&lt;6 or ≥6 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyte culture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocytes from patients in the CAPA-IVM group are collected and processed in the presence of&#xD;
      CNP (C-type Natriuretic Peptide) as meiotic inhibitor. In the CAPA-IVM group, COCs are plated&#xD;
      into a 4-well dish (Nunc, Denmark) at 10 COCs/well using CAPA medium (Medicult IVM medium;&#xD;
      Origio, Denmark) supplemented with 1 mIU/mL rFSH, 5 ng/mL insulin, 10 nM estradiol, 10 mg/mL&#xD;
      human serum albumin [SAGE, Denmark] and 25 nM (nanoMol) CNP under oil for 24 hours at 37°C,&#xD;
      6% carbon dioxide in air). After 24 hours, COCs are washed and transferred into IVM medium&#xD;
      (Origio, Denmark) containing 5 ng/mL insulin, 10 nM estradiol, 100 ng/mL human recombinant&#xD;
      amphiregulin and 100 mIU/mL rFSH (recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone), and incubated&#xD;
      under oil for 30 h at 37°C, 6% carbon dioxide in air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the standard IVM group (control), COCs were plated into a 4-well dish at 10 COCs/well&#xD;
      using IVM medium supplemented with 75 mIU/mL recombinant FSH (Merck, Switzerland), 100 mIU/mL&#xD;
      hCG (MSD, USA), 0.01 mg/mL growth hormone (Merck, Switzerland) and 10 mg/mL human serum&#xD;
      albumin (SAGE, Denmark). COCs are incubated for 30 hours using the same physical and&#xD;
      atmospheric conditions as the CAPA-IVM group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fertilization and embryo culture&#xD;
&#xD;
      After IVM, matured oocytes are fertilized using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and&#xD;
      cultured in an incubator at 37°C, 5% carbon dioxide, 5% oxygen. Fertilization check is&#xD;
      performed at 16-18 hours after ICSI. Embryos are cultured to day 3 in Global Total LP (Life&#xD;
      Global, Canada) in groups of 2-3 embryos per 30 µL microdroplet. Embryos that fulfill the&#xD;
      freezing criteria were vitrified (Cryotech, Japan) as cleaving day 3 embryos. Embryos of&#xD;
      extremely poor quality (Istanbul consensus on embryo quality assessment) defined as&#xD;
      fragmentation &gt;30%, &lt;6 cells, and multi nucleation are not frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial priming and embryo transfer&#xD;
&#xD;
      No fresh embryo transfers is performed. Patients receive oral estradiol 2 mg 4 times daily&#xD;
      from day 2 of their menstrual cycle. After an estradiol treatment period of at least 10 days&#xD;
      and when endometrial thickness was ≥8 mm, progesterone 200 mg is administered intra-vaginally&#xD;
      4 times daily. Embryo transfer is scheduled 3 days after starting progesterone. Serum beta&#xD;
      hCG is tested 14 days after embryo transfer. If a woman become pregnant, beta human chorionic&#xD;
      gonadotropin (hCG) &gt;5 mIU/mL, progesterone administration is maintained at the same dose&#xD;
      until at least 11 weeks of pregnancy. An ultrasound scan to determine the viability of&#xD;
      pregnancy is performed at 7 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of the ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) procedure in PCOS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety is monitored at each clinic visit or, if any side effects occurred, by questioning and&#xD;
      examining the patient, with adverse events and serious adverse events recorded on case report&#xD;
      forms. Adverse events are defined as any unexpected medical occurrence (symptoms or signs,&#xD;
      abnormal laboratory findings or diseases) that emerge or worsen during the trial, relative to&#xD;
      the initial trial visit. Possible adverse events including ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage,&#xD;
      medication-related reactions such as overdose, sensitivity and toxicity, and any adverse&#xD;
      outcomes related to egg collection. Serious adverse events are defined as any unexpected&#xD;
      medical occurrence that resulted in death, life-threatening, required inpatient&#xD;
      hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or resulted in persistent or&#xD;
      significant disability or incapacitation. Congenital anomaly or birth defect are considered&#xD;
      to be serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key goal of this study is to determine feasibility, acceptability, and outcome variability&#xD;
      to aid in planning a larger, adequately-powered efficacy trial. The planned sample size is 80&#xD;
      patients (40 per group), which should allow relatively precise conclusions regarding&#xD;
      feasibility outcomes. Given that this is the first time that CAPA-IVM has been used&#xD;
      clinically at our center, the objective of this pilot study is to estimate the live birth&#xD;
      rate and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the new intervention in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Nonparametric statistical methods such as Wilcoxon rank sum is applied to&#xD;
      continuous or ordinal outcomes. To estimate 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the difference&#xD;
      between two medians, bootstrapping and related resampling methods is applied. The incidence&#xD;
      of outcomes is estimated for each treatment group, and the difference between groups was&#xD;
      analyzed using relative risk (RR), 95% CI of RR and Fisher exact test. A subgroup analysis is&#xD;
      performed based on follicular size (&lt;6 versus ≥6 mm). Data are presented as mean values with&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD), medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), or proportions. All&#xD;
      analyses are performed using R (Version 3.0.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing,&#xD;
      Vienna, Austria). Statistical significance is defined as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
