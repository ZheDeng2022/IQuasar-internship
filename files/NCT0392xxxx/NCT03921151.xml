  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the role of molecular interactions between&#xD;
      5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR in behavioral phenotypes that confer risk for cocaine dependence and&#xD;
      relapse. Specifically, this project will evaluate the role of the 5-HT2CR:5-HT2AR balance in&#xD;
      impulsive action and cue reactivity in cocaine-dependent subjects as compared to non-drug&#xD;
      using controls. Brain and behavioral responses to the 5-HT2AR blocking medication mirtazapine&#xD;
      will be compared between subjects who have high and low functioning of the 5-HT2CR based on&#xD;
      presence of a specific, functionally-relevant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the&#xD;
      5-HT2CR (Cys23Ser). The 5-HT2CR Cys23Ser SNP is thought to decrease the function of the&#xD;
      protein and a preliminary observation indicates cocaine-dependent subjects carrying the CC&#xD;
      genotype (Ser23 protein variant) display significantly higher cue reactivity. For Aims 1 and&#xD;
      2, two fMRI analysis methods will be used: 1) a voxelwise whole brain analysis; 2) a region&#xD;
      of interest analysis based on proposed integrative circuitry shown in the model below.&#xD;
      Because neuroimaging studies have shown that performance of impulsive action tasks and&#xD;
      exposure to cocaine-associated cues (cue reactivity paradigms) activate brain regions in&#xD;
      brain circuits in humans, impulsive action and cue reactivity may be engendered in related&#xD;
      pathways. To explore this hypothesis, researchers will employ functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI)-based dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to ascertain the causal influences of one&#xD;
      brain region over another. Employing DCM, researchers will uncover the effective connectivity&#xD;
      within nodes of the neurocircuitry involved in impulsive action and cue reactivity. This&#xD;
      project will parallel preclinical work studying the relationship between 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR&#xD;
      on impulsive action and cue reactivity.&#xD;
