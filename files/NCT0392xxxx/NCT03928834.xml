      The overall goal of this study is to determine if implementation of a package of&#xD;
      interventions that includes DBS-based VL monitoring, coupled with an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention to improve ART adherence using cognitive-behavioral principles and genotyping&#xD;
      for those with persistent viremia decreases 12-month virologic failure rates among&#xD;
      HIV-infected adolescents compared with standard of care (SOC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2014, UNAIDS set ambitious goals to achieve 90% virologic suppression rates among&#xD;
      individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). In Zimbabwe, this is an ambitious target,&#xD;
      particularly among adolescents; less than 5% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected&#xD;
      individuals received HIV viral load (VL) testing in 2015, as reported by Ministry of Health&#xD;
      and Child Care in Zimbabwe and treatment failure rates among adolescents range between 25-37%&#xD;
      (Makadzange et al., 2015). Adolescents failing ART also have high rates of drug resistance.&#xD;
      Scalable strategies to facilitate improved VL monitoring, adherence support, and genotyping&#xD;
      for those with persistent viremia are urgently needed. The investigators have shown that&#xD;
      dried blood spot (DBS) samples can be used for routine VL monitoring on existing technologies&#xD;
      (Makadzange et al., 2017) They have also adapted an evidence-based, widely-used, cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT) adherence intervention (Life-Steps) for use in Zimbabwe and have&#xD;
      identified a low-cost genotyping strategy that can facilitate detection of drug resistance&#xD;
      mutations (DRMs) using already existing real-time polymerase chain reaction technology. The&#xD;
      primary study objective is to determine if implementation of a package of care that includes&#xD;
      DBS-based VL monitoring, coupled with an evidence-based intervention to improve ART adherence&#xD;
      using cognitive-behavioral principles as well as genotyping for individuals with persistent&#xD;
      viremia decreases 12-month virologic failure rates among HIV-infected adolescents compared&#xD;
      with standard of care (SOC). The investigators hypothesize that the proposed package of care&#xD;
      will result in a decrease in virologic failure rates among adolescents. They will also adapt&#xD;
      and integrate Nzira Itsva for Adolescents (NI), a cultural adaptation of Life-Steps, into&#xD;
      routine care as an adherence support intervention for HIV-infected adolescents, and implement&#xD;
      a novel, low-cost genotyping assay using Pan-Degenerate Amplification and Adaptation (PANDAA)&#xD;
      of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) as a point mutation assay for the detection of drug&#xD;
      resistance in parallel with Sanger sequencing. Process and cost data will be collected for&#xD;
      subsequent cost-analysis. The proposed intervention will be a two-arm, cluster-randomized&#xD;
      trial in Mashonaland West and Matabeleland North provinces of Zimbabwe. The units of&#xD;
      randomization will be public and largely rural clinics within the provinces, with sites&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention or to the SOC. The study is anticipated to show that the use&#xD;
      of DBS in routine monitoring of adolescents is feasible, and to show that CBT, if&#xD;
      incorporated into routine counselling activities, can complement VL monitoring and genotyping&#xD;
      to reduce treatment failure rates and preserve therapeutic options for infected adolescents.&#xD;
      The results of this study will have important implications in Zimbabwe and other low-income&#xD;
      countries in sub-Saharan Africa with a large proportion of HIV-infected adolescents. The&#xD;
      study will include young adolescents aged 10- &lt;14years, as well as older adolescents aged&#xD;
      15-19 years and therefore provide data that will guide implementation of strategies for&#xD;
      virologic success in the growing number of perinatally-infected children who are surviving on&#xD;
      ART into adolescence, as well as for behaviorally-infected adolescents. The study will be&#xD;
      performed within 44 clinics in Matabeleland North and Mashonaland West provinces, and will&#xD;
      recruit 828 adolescents. A multidisciplinary consortium with the expertise to conduct this&#xD;
      study has been assembled. The consortium includes public health practitioners, a&#xD;
      biostatistician, basic scientists with extensive experience in virology and development of&#xD;
      novel technologies, HIV clinicians with experience in implementation science, global mental&#xD;
      health, and behavioral psychology experts. The consortium will work in partnership with the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health (MOH) to implement this protocol and ensure its success.&#xD;
