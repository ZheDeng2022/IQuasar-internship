      This research protocol tests a new technique and devices that we have developed to treat&#xD;
      functional mitral valve regurgitation, called transcatheter mitral valve cerclage&#xD;
      annuloplasty, otherwise known as cerclage. Functional mitral valve regurgitation is a&#xD;
      condition caused by damaged heart muscle involving the left ventricle which results in mitral&#xD;
      valve leakage. This leakage causes heart failure (breathlessness and lack of energy&#xD;
      especially when walking or exercising, and hospital admissions for fluid buildup).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an early feasibility study (EFS) evaluation of special devices, permanently implanted&#xD;
      in the heart, to perform mitral cerclage annuloplasty. Mitral cerclage annuloplasty is a&#xD;
      catheter procedure performed under X-ray and ultrasound guidance without surgery. The&#xD;
      cerclage devices compress the mitral valve like a purse-string. The cerclage device has a&#xD;
      special feature that prevents a coronary artery from getting squeezed as part of this&#xD;
      purse-string.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol has been changed to allow patients who have mitral valve regurgitation despite&#xD;
      prior Mitra-Clip treatment, and to allow patients who have symptomatic heart failure with&#xD;
      mild mitral regurgitation....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Functional mitral regurgitation (also known as secondary mitral regurgitation) is a common&#xD;
      complication of left ventricular dysfunction. Ventricular dysfunction leads to dilation,&#xD;
      which in turn leads to mitral annular dilation and leaflet traction. This causes a failure of&#xD;
      coaptation of the otherwise intact leaflets of the mitral valve, leading to regurgitation&#xD;
      through a central orifice between the mal-coapting leaflet tips. Functional mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation contributes to heart failure symptoms.Transcatheter Mitral Cerclage&#xD;
      Annuloplasty (TMCA) is a new catheter technique that reduces the septal-lateral dimension of&#xD;
      the dilated annulus through circumferential compression, prevents extrinsic compression and&#xD;
      entrapment of coronary arteries by incorporating a protection element, and exhibits planar&#xD;
      discordance that achieves annular reduction even when the coronary sinus is anatomically&#xD;
      located along the posterior left atrial wall. This is an entirely right-sided procedure and&#xD;
      device.&#xD;

    <description>The Transcatheter Mitral Cerclage Annuloplasty implant is attached to a guidewire and pulled through the internal jugular sheath, along the coronary sinus, through the basal septum, through the tricuspidvalve, and back out of the internal jugular sheath. The position of the TMCA implant is adjusted so that the coronary protection element lies directly over any underlying branc of the left coronary artery.</description>

    <description>The Transcatheter Mitral Cerclage Annuloplasty implant comprises two components, with or without a coronary artery protection element, and the wishbone lock with coronary sinus and RVOT limbs. The procedure is performed from a transjugular venous approach. Coronary guidewires and microcatheters are used to navigate into a coronary vein towards the target capture catheter. The implant is then attached to the back end of the guidewire and pulled out of the internal jugular sheath. The position of the implant is adjusted so that the coronary protection element lies directly over any underlying branch of the left coronary artery. The wishbone lock is then advanced over the two limbs of the implant and the desired tension is titrated to the degree of mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography is performed to confirm there is no coronary compression. Once the desired tension has been achieved, the wishbone lock is locked and the two limbs of the implant are cut with a cutter catheter.</description>
