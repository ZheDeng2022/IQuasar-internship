      Integrating Intergenerational Cultural Knowledge Exchange with Zero Suicide is an innovative&#xD;
      study in a Southwestern tribal nation that incorporates Zero Suicide into Indian Health&#xD;
      Services (IHS) primary care settings. The goal of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Zero Suicide plus a cultural component (ZS+) (experimental group) compared&#xD;
      to Zero Suicide (ZS) alone (control group) on suicidal ideation, behaviors, and resiliency in&#xD;
      a randomized control trial of 138 AI youth ages 12-24 at two rural IHS clinics on the Pueblo&#xD;
      of San Felipe. The long-term goal of this study is to determine which is more effective at&#xD;
      reducing suicidal ideation and behaviors and increasing resiliency, ZS+ or ZS alone. Year 1&#xD;
      will focus on training providers on the Zero Suicide model and manualizing the Katishtya&#xD;
      Intergenerational Culture Knowledge Seminars (KICKS) curriculum that was piloted and&#xD;
      positively evaluated over the past three summers as a cultural module to improve the adoption&#xD;
      and acceptability of Zero Suicide. Years 2-4 will focus on participant recruitment,&#xD;
      assignment to experimental and control groups, and implementation. Year 5 will focus on data&#xD;
      analysis and dissemination. Data will be collected from all experimental and control group&#xD;
      participants at 4 time points: baseline, 12-weeks, 6-months and 9-months to explore the&#xD;
      effects of the intervention over time. The central hypothesis is that ZS+ will be more&#xD;
      effective then ZS alone. The investigators propose three aims: (1) Specific Aim 1: Using&#xD;
      Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR), partner with tribal stakeholders and&#xD;
      researchers to formally manualize the KICKS cultural module for Zero Suicide (ZS+); (2)&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine if adding a cultural component to the Zero Suicide model is more&#xD;
      effective at reducing risk factors and increasing resiliency in AI youth than Zero Suicide&#xD;
      alone; and (3) Specific Aim 3: Determine the essential features of the KICKS module for&#xD;
      adaptation by other tribes and disseminate the model.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Across the nation, suicide is the second leading cause of death in youth 10-24 years old.&#xD;
      This public health crisis is particularly acute in American Indian (AI) communities where the&#xD;
      suicide rate is 50% higher than that of non-Hispanic Whites. From 2009-2012, the age-adjusted&#xD;
      suicide rate for American Indian/Alaska Native youth ages 10-24 years old was alarmingly&#xD;
      higher than the overall rate for youth in this same age group nationally (14.66/100,000 vs.&#xD;
      8.25/100,000). In New Mexico (NM), the youth suicide rate is consistently at least 1.5 times&#xD;
      the U.S. rate at 14.2/100,000, which is 75% higher than the national average. Importantly, NM&#xD;
      has the highest proportionate AI population in the continental USA, and among the 22 tribes&#xD;
      in NM the youth suicide rate is even greater (21.4/100,000). Also in NM, the percent of&#xD;
      deaths due to suicide among AI youth by age range compared to all races is 29% vs.13% for&#xD;
      ages 10-14, 32% vs.18% for ages 15-19, and 25% vs.16.5% for ages 20-24.3 The Pueblo of San&#xD;
      Felipe, a tribal nation in NM and the target population for the proposed study, has&#xD;
      incredibly high rates of suicidal ideation and behavior with 21.8% of students reporting that&#xD;
      they seriously considered suicide, 14.9% reporting that they made a suicide plan, and 11.6%&#xD;
      reporting that they attempted suicide in the past year compared to 19%, 11.3%, and 7%&#xD;
      respectively statewide. A recent school needs assessment of over 300 students found even&#xD;
      higher rates, as 40% of youth expressed feeling frequently depressed within the last year,&#xD;
      17% reported feeling sad or depressed most or all of the time within the last month, and 30%&#xD;
      noted they attempted suicide one or more times within the last month. Thus, suicide is of&#xD;
      grave concern to tribal communities in NM, especially the Pueblo of San Felipe, and&#xD;
      developing systematic strategies for reducing suicide among AI youth is of utmost importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Factors Associated with Youth Suicide. The probability of attempting suicide has been&#xD;
      found to dramatically increase as the number of risk factors increases. Research on suicidal&#xD;
      behavior in youth indicates that the odds of experiencing suicidal ideation and/or suicide&#xD;
      attempts are nearly three times more likely if the youth is using alcohol. Even more&#xD;
      concerning is that the odds of a completed suicide are five to 13 times greater for youth&#xD;
      diagnosed with a substance use disorder.6 Furthermore, lethality of suicide attempts&#xD;
      increases with alcohol use, and 40% of suicide attempts and 37% of suicides preceded by acute&#xD;
      use of alcohol. While depression is associated with suicidal behavior, depression predicts&#xD;
      suicide attempts significantly less well when controlling for substance use. Similarly,&#xD;
      exposure to violence, including domestic and intimate partner violence, increases the&#xD;
      probability of suicidal ideation and behaviors, as does historical trauma (defined as the&#xD;
      cumulative emotional and psychological wounding across generations which emanates from&#xD;
      massive group trauma). Unfortunately, AI youth experience exceptionally high rates of these&#xD;
      risk factors, including substance abuse, exposure to violence, and the profound repercussions&#xD;
      of historical trauma (domestic violence, abuse, etc.). The proposed study addresses risk&#xD;
      factors by incorporating these topics into the cultural component of the intervention known&#xD;
      as Katishtya Intergenerational Culture Knowledge Seminars (KICKS), as they are NOT addressed&#xD;
      in Zero Suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resiliency as a Buffer. Resilience is also a critical component of suicide prevention.&#xD;
      Buffering is the idea that having resources, such as social support or cultural grounding,&#xD;
      can mitigate against adverse stressful events.16 The Buffering Hypothesis is a model linking&#xD;
      resilience to suicidality that focuses on beliefs, which buffer individuals in the face of&#xD;
      stressors. Resilience factors are viewed as existing on a separate dimension to risk which&#xD;
      act to moderate the impact of suicidality. The presence of these factors results in&#xD;
      resilience and the absence increases risk for suicidality. Resiliency factors include&#xD;
      internal protective factors (positive beliefs or feelings about oneself and satisfaction with&#xD;
      life), external protective factors (ability to seek resources helpful when faced with&#xD;
      personal difficulties), and emotional stability (positive beliefs about one's ability to&#xD;
      regulate suicide-related thoughts and behaviors when confronting emotionally distressing&#xD;
      events). Importantly, research shows that increasing protective factors can be more effective&#xD;
      at reducing the probability of suicide attempts for AI youth then decreasing risk factors,&#xD;
      and other studies indicate that interventions are only effective to the extent that they&#xD;
      recognize and promote AI cultural values, traditional practices, and cultural identity&#xD;
      development. Thus, to improve suicide prevention program acceptability and adoption it is&#xD;
      critical to include culturally relevant strength-based and resilience focused components to&#xD;
      suicide prevention models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship between Suicide and Health Disparities. Health disparities are &quot;preventable&#xD;
      differences in the burden of disease, injury, violence, or opportunities to achieve optimal&#xD;
      health that are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations&quot;. Barriers to mental health&#xD;
      care utilization for AI youth include: lack of culturally competent treatment providers, a&#xD;
      general mistrust in services provided within a Western medical model, and personal&#xD;
      experiences of discrimination in health care settings. These barriers have been found to&#xD;
      reduce the likelihood of seeking care, even when suicidal ideation or behaviors are present,&#xD;
      thus, contributing to the higher incidence of youth suicide in AI communities. The proposed&#xD;
      study addresses disparities in access and acceptability by adding a cultural component to the&#xD;
      Zero Suicide model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Call to Develop and Test Innovative Suicide Prevention Models. In 2014, the National Action&#xD;
      Alliance for Suicide Prevention's Research Prioritization Task Force published strong&#xD;
      recommendations regarding the need to develop and test feasible and effective suicide&#xD;
      prevention interventions. Although there have been considerable studies focusing on youth&#xD;
      suicide prevention there is insufficient evidence to know which strategies are most effective&#xD;
      in preventing suicide among AI populations. Importantly, AI adolescents experience&#xD;
      significant risk factors for suicide, including substance abuse and exposure to violence&#xD;
      (e.g., physical and sexual violence, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, and&#xD;
      premature death of relatives due to violence, accidents, or suicide).5 Although suicide&#xD;
      prevention has been shown effective in reducing suicidal ideation and behaviors with youth,&#xD;
      there are limited Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) focused on preventing suicide attempts in&#xD;
      AI youth populations, thus it is unclear whether the results of previous studies are&#xD;
      generalizable. Critically, examining the effect of suicide prevention interventions in AI&#xD;
      primary care settings is vital as the majority of individuals who die by suicide (80%) have&#xD;
      contact with a primary care clinician or Emergency Department (ED) in the year prior to&#xD;
      death. There is promising research on the effectiveness of Zero Suicide (ZS), a&#xD;
      population-based model implemented through a large HMO system in the Midwest. However, ZS has&#xD;
      not been studied with AI populations or in tribally-based Indian Health Service (IHS) primary&#xD;
      care settings. Additionally, ZS does not include culturally-adapted interventions, which have&#xD;
      been found to produce larger effect sizes than un-adapted interventions for minority&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Zero Suicide Model. ZS is a population health-based approach to suicide prevention&#xD;
      underscoring the belief that suicide deaths are preventable and that individuals are often&#xD;
      not recognized in fragmented, busy health care systems.27 Studies of the Perfect Depression&#xD;
      Care program, the precursor to ZS, showed significant findings including an 82% decrease in&#xD;
      suicide deaths between baseline and intervention in a large urban Midwest health System. ZS&#xD;
      has seven essential elements for health care systems, including: (1) Lead- create a&#xD;
      leadership-driven, safety-oriented culture committed to reducing suicide for people under&#xD;
      care; (2) Train- develop a workforce that understands and responds to depression and suicidal&#xD;
      behaviors; (3) Identify- universally screen and assess suicide risk; (4) Engage- ensure every&#xD;
      individual has timely and adequate pathways to care and includes a brief safety plan (5)&#xD;
      Treat- use effective, evidence-based treatment, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Suicide&#xD;
      Prevention (CBT-SP), to target suicidal ideation and behaviors; (6) Transition- provide&#xD;
      continuous contact and support, especially after acute care; and (7) Improve- apply a&#xD;
      data-driven quality improvement approach to inform system change and improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes. The ZS toolkit provides resources on these elements, including training manuals, an&#xD;
      organizational self-study, work plan template, and consumer engagement strategies. The need&#xD;
      for consideration of cultural adaptation is indicated (zerosuicide.sprc.org) but not&#xD;
      specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, data is available on the effectiveness of each of the ZS elements. For instance,&#xD;
      training with booster sessions for healthcare professionals in primary care and ED settings&#xD;
      has been found to improve identification of suicide warning signs and willingness to refer&#xD;
      patients for mental health services, and to reduce suicidal behavior in situations where the&#xD;
      roles of gatekeepers are formalized and access to treatment is readily available. Findings&#xD;
      also support the importance of integrating brief universal screening in primary care settings&#xD;
      to quickly identify at-risk individuals and prompt healthcare professionals to make&#xD;
      referrals. Research found that there was a four-fold increase in the detection of suicidal&#xD;
      ideation by pediatricians when screening tools were used in outpatient clinics. Additionally,&#xD;
      pediatric ED studies show screening for suicide risk can reveal previously undetected&#xD;
      suicidal ideation in youth presenting with medical complaints. Importantly, screening must&#xD;
      confidently rule out patients with no appreciable risk, and balance feasibility with&#xD;
      effectiveness. Finally, research supports the importance of feasible and acceptable treatment&#xD;
      such as CBT-SP for those identified as being at risk for suicidal ideation or behaviors.&#xD;
      CBT-SP has been found to result in a greater reduction of suicidal ideation than treatment as&#xD;
      usual, and consists of a chain analysis of the index suicide attempt, and development of a&#xD;
      safety plan and individualized treatment plan to reduce reattempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of ZS in AI Communities is NOT Enough. Importantly, implementing ZS in tribal&#xD;
      communities requires cultural adaptation. As noted earlier, culturally-adapted interventions&#xD;
      have been found to produce larger effect sizes than un-adapted interventions for minority&#xD;
      populations. In addition, research indicates that substance abuse and exposure to trauma are&#xD;
      significant risk factors impacting suicide in AI youth. Finally, strengthening protective&#xD;
      factors may be more important than reducing risk factors in addressing suicide for AI youth.&#xD;
      ZS does not focus on reducing risk factors and increasing resiliency. The proposed study&#xD;
      incorporates all of these elements into the KICKS component, thereby increasing the&#xD;
      appropriateness and acceptability of ZS for AI populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of Cultural Adaptations to Improve Suicide Outcomes among AI Youth. For ZS to be&#xD;
      adopted, implemented, and sustained in tribal communities, cultural consideration is&#xD;
      critical. Two large studies found that for AI youth strengthening protective factors may be&#xD;
      more important than reducing risk factors in addressing suicide, and mentoring from parents,&#xD;
      extended family, teachers, and friends helps AI youth overcome failure, succeed in school,&#xD;
      and develop resiliency. Engaging youth in teachings on traditional narratives, beliefs and&#xD;
      practices, and intergenerational approaches that focus on communication and awareness across&#xD;
      generations have also been found to increase resiliency. Moreover, research demonstrates that&#xD;
      elders play a critical role in fostering resilience by providing mentoring, teaching, and&#xD;
      social support to AI youth through transmission of valuable cultural beliefs, traditions, and&#xD;
      practices. The proposed study incorporates all of these elements to reduce suicidal ideation&#xD;
      and behaviors and increase resiliency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Katishtya Intergenerational Culture Knowledge Seminars (KICKS) Cultural Adaptation. The&#xD;
      cultural adaptation proposed in this study is the Katishtya Intergenerational Culture&#xD;
      Knowledge Seminars (KICKS), an intergenerational program to promote resiliency and positive&#xD;
      connections between San Felipe youth and elders. Over the past three years, San Felipe&#xD;
      developed and piloted KICKS, where elders share traditional culture, language, lifeways, and&#xD;
      history with San Felipe youth in an eight-week daily seminar. KICKS was developed to improve&#xD;
      resiliency through exposure to intergenerational cultural teachings, and preliminary data&#xD;
      indicates that over 90% of youth felt they acquired substantial knowledge of each of the&#xD;
      traditional activities, indicating that KICKS fostered learning and resiliency. Well received&#xD;
      by tribal members and tribal leadership, KICKS is a perfect cultural module to increase&#xD;
      resiliency and improve acceptability and adoption of ZS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partnership as a Predictor of Behavioral Health Outcomes. Another potential variable is the&#xD;
      quality of stakeholder partnerships. In the last decade, the literature on CBPR has moved&#xD;
      beyond a focus on partnership processes and improved success at recruiting participants, to&#xD;
      recognizing the significant evidence of its impact on health outcomes. Adherence to CBPR&#xD;
      principles and strategies show positive impacts on health behavior, self-efficacies,&#xD;
      perceived social support, empowerment, and improved health status; as well as improved&#xD;
      policies to reduce health inequities. Mental health outcomes in particular have been shown in&#xD;
      the community engagement arm of an extensive RCT. UNM's ten-year study on quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative methods to assess partnering processes and their associations with outcomes will&#xD;
      prove invaluable for measuring the quality and impact of the community partnership in San&#xD;
      Felipe. These assessments will be critical to determine the partnership's impact on the&#xD;
      identified outcomes. They will also support a mutual iterative learning process that will&#xD;
      contribute to ongoing research capacity building within the tribe itself for greater&#xD;
      sustainability of the intervention over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of Transdisciplinary, Multi-Level and Multi-Domain Interventions. Finally, in&#xD;
      perfect alignment with the mission of the Transdisciplinary Research, Equity and Engagement&#xD;
      Center for Behavioral Health (TREE Center), Integrating Intergenerational Cultural Knowledge&#xD;
      Exchange with Zero Suicide is a transdisciplinary, multi-level suicide prevention&#xD;
      intervention study that addresses resiliency and risk factors related to AI youth suicidal&#xD;
      ideation and behaviors. Effective health disparities interventions benefit from&#xD;
      transdisciplinary, multi-level and multi-domain components. The transdisciplinary research&#xD;
      team represents disciplines across the University (e.g., Psychology, Psychiatry, Public&#xD;
      Health, Clinical and Translational Sciences) as well as community partners across&#xD;
      child-serving tribal programs (e.g., Primary Care, Behavioral Health, Education, Social&#xD;
      Services) collaborating on the creation of an innovative AI youth suicide prevention model.&#xD;
      This also study employs a multi-level intervention approach. The first level is the&#xD;
      Individual level (youth who receive universal screens and participate in the ZS or ZS+&#xD;
      intervention). The second is the Group level (KICKS is provided in a group format), and the&#xD;
      third is the Community level (elders who participate in the KICKS module, school impacted by&#xD;
      providing universal screens at the SBCH, and larger community impacted through ZS&#xD;
      implementation in all primary care settings). This multi-level approach enables us to&#xD;
      understand issues of inequities in health and monitor the outcome of the intervention across&#xD;
      levels. This study also aims to reduce behavioral health disparities by simultaneously&#xD;
      addressing the needs and stressors of AI youth across multiple domains including behavioral,&#xD;
      sociocultural and health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary. Because suicide is a low base rate behavior, very large samples are needed to&#xD;
      conduct adequately powered suicide prevention trials. Suicidal ideation and behavior,&#xD;
      however, are often warning signs of completed suicide, making it especially important to&#xD;
      target in intervention studies. Given the research supporting ZS and the fact that Indian&#xD;
      Health Services (IHS) identified &quot;Zero Suicide [as] a call to relentlessly pursue a reduction&#xD;
      in suicide for those who come to us for care,&quot; there is a clear recognition that ZS is a&#xD;
      promising practice for tribal behavioral health. However, resilience-focused approaches, such&#xD;
      as KICKS, must be included, as must reduction of risk factors related to substance abuse and&#xD;
      violence. Thus, the current proposal will examine differences in reducing suicidal ideation&#xD;
      and behaviors, and increasing resiliency for AI youth who participate in ZS vs. ZS+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPROACH Study Overview. The proposed project will manualize the KICKS module and then&#xD;
      conduct a Randomized-Controlled Trial (RCT) of Zero Suicide (ZS) and Zero Suicide plus&#xD;
      Katishtya Intergenerational Culture Knowledge Seminars (ZS+) in AI youth ages 12-24 years old&#xD;
      from the Pueblo of San Felipe. It is transdisciplinary and multi-level collaborative research&#xD;
      project between the University of New Mexico, the Pueblo of San Felipe, IHS clinics; and&#xD;
      community stakeholders (e.g., youth, elders, family members, health care providers, tribal&#xD;
      leadership).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community Advisory Committee. The investigators will form a Community Advisory Committee&#xD;
      (CAC) for this study in San Felipe comprised of tribal program representatives from&#xD;
      Behavioral Health, Primary Care, Social Services, Schools, Recreation, Tribal Leadership, UNM&#xD;
      researchers, other stakeholders. Dr. Altschul (MPI) and Ms. Tenorio (PD) will use a CBPR&#xD;
      approach to co-facilitate the CAC and guide all aspects of the study including, refining data&#xD;
      collection methods, participant recruitment, implementation, data analysis, and&#xD;
      dissemination. One CAC member will also serve on the NM TREE Center Community Scientific&#xD;
      Advisory Council.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Using CBPR, partner with tribal stakeholders and researchers to formally&#xD;
      manualize the KICKS cultural module for Zero Suicide (ZS+). The objective of Specific Aim 1&#xD;
      is to develop a manual for the KICKS cultural module of ZS+ using a CBPR approach. To obtain&#xD;
      this objective the investigators will develop a community-based workgroup, the KICKS Review&#xD;
      Committee, to collaboratively formalize the KICKS module. The rationale for this Aim is that&#xD;
      having a manualized intervention will increase fidelity to the KICKS module, and ensure&#xD;
      delivery that is culturally appropriate, feasible, and effective. When the proposed research&#xD;
      for this Aim has been completed, the investigators expect to have a formalized manual that&#xD;
      will be used to consistently implement KICKS and to test Specific Aim 2 to compare&#xD;
      implementation of ZS+ vs. ZS alone in the San Felipe IHS clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Method. KICKS was developed in 2014 for youth to see that cultural&#xD;
      knowledge is key to resiliency, language is vital to maintain traditions, and Native people&#xD;
      were given many gifts from the Creator, including natural supports and protective factors,&#xD;
      that enabled their survival for centuries. Youth and elders met daily for 8-weeks and&#xD;
      participated in Keres language instruction, traditional storytelling, Pueblo history,&#xD;
      traditional dances, crafts, and visiting traditional and cultural sites. Youth learned about&#xD;
      proper introductions using AI name and clan; the traditional naming process; family&#xD;
      extensions/kinship; types and uses of corn; Pueblo history including emergence, migration and&#xD;
      settlement; traditional prayer; clan responsibilities; traditional crafts (pouches, arrows,&#xD;
      dance regalia); language and item identification; respect, acknowledgement, acts of kindness,&#xD;
      and cultural responsibilities; traditional dances, including regalia&#xD;
      identification/significance; and traditional cooking, sewing, and pottery making. In&#xD;
      exchange, youth taught elders about modern technology, including email access, use of iPads,&#xD;
      etc. This intergenerational knowledge sharing created positive outcomes for both youth and&#xD;
      elders, including increased self-reported resiliency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the KICKS module will occur through the KICKS Review Committee, including the&#xD;
      KICKS Coordinator, elders and youth who participated in the KICKS pilot, university&#xD;
      researchers, and other interested parties. The Committee will meet twice monthly for 8 months&#xD;
      to review agendas from the KICKS pilot, discuss successes and challenges noted during the&#xD;
      pilot, identify core content areas, consider potential additions, and discuss flow of the&#xD;
      curriculum. Although there are agendas for each KICKS session, it is important to manualize&#xD;
      the program so that the module can be followed with fidelity throughout the study. In&#xD;
      addition, certain topics, such as historical trauma and substance abuse, were not explicitly&#xD;
      included but will be added due to their importance as potential risk factors for suicidality.&#xD;
      This process will use CBPR strategies to ensure collaboration with community partners during&#xD;
      all phases of research, including study design, implementation, data collection,&#xD;
      interpretation, and dissemination. UNM data collectors will gather detailed qualitative&#xD;
      meeting minutes to document progress made and identify themes that emerge for inclusion in&#xD;
      the manual. The final manual will be presented to Tribal Leadership and the Tribal Council&#xD;
      for review and approval. This CBPR process recognizes the significance of culture in research&#xD;
      design and implementation to facilitate relevance to the community, ethical conduct, external&#xD;
      validity, and effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine if adding a cultural component to the Zero Suicide model (ZS+)&#xD;
      is more effective at reducing risk factors and increasing resiliency in AI youth than Zero&#xD;
      Suicide alone (ZS). The objective of Specific Aim 2 is to assess the effectiveness of ZS&#xD;
      enhanced with a cultural module (ZS+) compared to ZS alone at reducing suicidal ideation and&#xD;
      behaviors and increasing resiliency. To achieve this objective, the investigators will test&#xD;
      the working hypothesis that ZS+ will be more effective then ZS alone in reducing suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, behaviors and attempts. The rationale for Aim 2 is that successful completion of&#xD;
      the proposed research will contribute a missing, fundamental element to the suicide&#xD;
      prevention knowledge base critical to the development of a youth suicide prevention program&#xD;
      designed and tested with AI youth and found to be culturally appropriate, feasible, and&#xD;
      effective. Achieving these outcomes will collectively inform the suicide prevention field&#xD;
      about the effectiveness and feasibility of implementing ZS and ZS+ in IHS primary care&#xD;
      settings, and provide a greater understanding of the potential mechanisms that reduce&#xD;
      suicidal ideation and behaviors and increase resiliency for AI youth, a much-needed finding&#xD;
      in Indian Country. Achieving these outcomes will also inform the field about the adoption and&#xD;
      acceptability of the ZS model; and whether the quality of the community stakeholder&#xD;
      partnership is a predictor of behavioral health outcomes.&#xD;
