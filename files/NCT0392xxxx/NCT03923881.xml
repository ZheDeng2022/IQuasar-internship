      The presence of lymph node metastasis is an important factor in determining the appropriate&#xD;
      treatment plan in patients with OSCC. However, detection of lymph node metastases by means of&#xD;
      current imaging modalities is limited. 20-30% of patients with a clinically negative neck&#xD;
      (cN0) harbour lymph node metastasis that were not detected during clinical diagnostic workup,&#xD;
      which are referred to as occult lymph node metastasis. Therefore, patients with a risk of&#xD;
      lymph node metastasis higher than 20% undergo a sentinel node procedure (SNP) or elective&#xD;
      neck dissection (END), which means that a substantial part of patients is overtreated. There&#xD;
      is need for an additional non-invasive diagnostic tool that can identify lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis and thereby support the decision making for treatment of the neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate if EGFR-positive cervical lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis can be detected non-invasively with multispectral optoacoustic imaging using&#xD;
      cetuximab-800CW as contrast agent in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

      Background: The presence of lymph node metastasis is an important factor in determining the&#xD;
      appropriate treatment plan in patients with OSCC. However, detection of lymph node metastases&#xD;
      by means of current imaging modalities is limited. 20-30% of patients with a clinically&#xD;
      negative neck (cN0) harbour lymph node metastasis that were not detected during clinical&#xD;
      diagnostic workup, which are referred to as occult lymph node metastasis. Personalized&#xD;
      management of the neck would benefit greatly from staging techniques that increase the&#xD;
      accuracy of the assessment of nodal disease. In addition, visualizing the pattern of&#xD;
      lymphatic spread can possibly lead to more targeted neck dissections and thereby reduce&#xD;
      morbidity. Clearly, there is need for additional diagnostic tools in order to identify lymph&#xD;
      node metastasis and thereby support the decision making for treatment of the neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optoacoustic imaging is a novel imaging method in which an ultrashort laser pulse is used to&#xD;
      irradiate biological tissue. Consequently, optoacoustic or photoacoustic waves are generated&#xD;
      which can be measured by wideband ultrasonic transducers. Optoacoustic imaging has been shown&#xD;
      to address clinically relevant aspects of various cancers by enabling visualization of&#xD;
      targeted tumor-specific biomarkers by detecting optoacoustic waves. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      accumulation of cetuximab-800CW can be detected in lymph node metastasis, enabling better&#xD;
      visualization of regional metastatic disease compared to current imaging modalities. This&#xD;
      approach can improve detection of lymph node metastases and thereby supports decision making&#xD;
      for treatment of the neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The main objective of this study is to evaluate if EGFR-positive cervical lymph&#xD;
      node metastasis can be detected non-invasively using the MSOT Acuity Echo with&#xD;
      cetuximab-800CW as contrast agent in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The current study is a single center, prospective, cross-sectional, proof of&#xD;
      concept study. The study will be carried out by the out at the University Medical Center&#xD;
      Groningen, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Department of Nuclear Medicine&#xD;
      and Molecular Imaging. Further analysis of sections of the lymph node metastasis will be done&#xD;
      at the Department of Pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 20 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma that have been included in&#xD;
      the ICON-study (NCT03134846) and are scheduled for treatment of the neck will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient related study procedures: Prior to tracer administration as part of the ICON study,&#xD;
      optoacoustic imaging is performed. Two-four days later, surgical procedure will take place.&#xD;
      One day prior to surgery, the patient is admitted to the hospital and optoacoustic imaging is&#xD;
      performed with cetuximab-800CW as contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoints: Quantification of the cetuximab-800CW optoacoustic signal and tracer&#xD;
      distribution observed by multispectral optoacoustic imaging using the MSOT Acuity Echo in&#xD;
      vivo in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burden, risks and benefit to participation: Time investment: Patients need to visit the UMCG&#xD;
      2-4 days before their planned surgery according to the ICON-study which will take&#xD;
      approximately 2 hours. For the first imaging session, the imaging procedure will take 20-30&#xD;
      minutes and therefore the visit is prolonged with 20-30 minutes. Usually patients are&#xD;
      admitted one day prior to surgery. Therefore the second imaging on this day will not require&#xD;
      extra time investment, although the imaging procedure takes 20-30 minutes Extra procedures:&#xD;
      Two imaging procedures, prior to tracer administration and on day of admission. Both imaging&#xD;
      procedures will take 20-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several measures described below have been taken to reduce the risk of injuries to an&#xD;
      absolute minimum. The residual risk of MSOT is slight, reversible reddening and temperature&#xD;
      increase of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have no direct benefit from this study.&#xD;
