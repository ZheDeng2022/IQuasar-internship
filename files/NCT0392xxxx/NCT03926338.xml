  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer of Mismatch Repair-deficient (dMMR)/ Microsatellite Instability-high&#xD;
      (MSI-H) accounts for approximately 15% of all colorectal cancer patients, with a higher&#xD;
      proportion in right colon cancer. Previous studies have found that colon cancer patients with&#xD;
      dMMR/MSI-H cannot benefit from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adjuvant chemotherapy. Once patients&#xD;
      have distant metastases, they are not sensitive to traditional palliative chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      the prognosis is significantly worse than that of mismatch repair-proficient&#xD;
      (pMMR)/microsatellite stability (MSS). A phase II clinical study of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy&#xD;
      based on mismatch repair (MMR) status published in 《N Engl J Med》 showed that the objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) of advanced colorectal cancer patients with dMMR received anti-PD-1 is&#xD;
      40%, and a longer response time can be obtained compared to conventional chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-PD-1 neoadjuvant therapy has proven to be safe and feasible in lung cancer, bladder&#xD;
      cancer and malignant melanoma, and can achieve more than 40% of major pathological response.&#xD;
      However, there are no reports of anti-PD-1 neoadjuvant therapy for the dMMR/MSI-H colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. Therefore, the aim of this study was to find the best multidisciplinary treatment for&#xD;
      resectable colorectal cancer patient with the dMMR/MSI-H phenotype and to explore whether&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors combined with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) could&#xD;
      further improve efficacy.&#xD;
