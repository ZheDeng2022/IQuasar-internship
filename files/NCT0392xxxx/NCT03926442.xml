      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize the time course of herbs/spice action on endothelial function as&#xD;
           measured by FMD over 24 h using a challenge meal paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess effects of herbs/spices on metabolic indices (ie., glucose, insulin), and&#xD;
           inflammatory markers such as cytokines (ie., IL-6, TNF-alpha) and vascular adhesion&#xD;
           molecules (ICAM and VCAM).&#xD;

      The proposed study will be conducted in humans according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;
      guidelines. All subjects will review and sign an Informed Consent Form approved by the&#xD;
      Illinois Institute of Technology's Institutional Review Boards (IRB) prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-center clinical trial is a randomized, blinded, 4-arm, placebo-controlled, within&#xD;
      subject cross-over trial, featuring a repeated postprandial sampling paradigm to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of spice/herb intake on endothelial function, inflammation, insulin sensitivity /&#xD;
      glucose handling and vascular function in overweight/obese adults after consuming a&#xD;
      standardized challenge meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned sample size of 24 will be enrolled into the study. This study will require one&#xD;
      initial screening visit and 4 study visits. This study will take approximately 4-5 weeks per&#xD;
      subject to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening visit will provide subject with their site-specific, IRB-approved&#xD;
      informed consent document prior to the start of any study related procedures. Subject&#xD;
      eligibility will be determined through anthropometric measurements, vital signs, fasting&#xD;
      blood glucose test (finger prick), and completion of a survey relate to general eating,&#xD;
      health, mood and exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will follow a limited polyphenolic diet throughout the duration of their&#xD;
      participation, although stricter guidelines will be imposed during the 3 days prior to a&#xD;
      study visit. Shopping lists and meal plans will be provided to subjects, along with&#xD;
      counseling by our study dietitians, to help subjects adhere to the limited polyphenolic diet.&#xD;
      The trial will initiate with a 3-day food diary to assess background (pre-study) dietary&#xD;
      intake followed by counseling to follow a diet relatively low in (poly)phenolic&#xD;
      rich-beverages/foods, which will be maintained for the duration of the experiment. After an&#xD;
      initial 7-day run-in period on the limited polyphenolic diet, subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      1 of 4 treatment sequences. Treatment codes will be maintained by the principal&#xD;
      investigator/study physician. All subjects will receive four treatments, once each on 4&#xD;
      different occasions and separated by at least 4 days. Italian Herb mix, Cinnamon, Pumpkin&#xD;
      Spice or placebo will be provided with a standardized meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each visit will last ~8 hours and subjects will be required to remain at the Clinical Unit&#xD;
      for the duration of the visit. Blood samples will be collected at 0 (fasting) and at 0.5 h, 1&#xD;
      h, 2 h, 4 h, 5.5 h, 7 h and 24 h via a catheter placed on the non-dominant arm by a&#xD;
      registered nurse. FMD or NIRS will be conducted at the CNRC or the HNRCA, respectively at 0&#xD;
      (fasting) and at 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 5.5 h, 7 h and 24 h.&#xD;
