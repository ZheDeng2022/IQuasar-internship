      This study evaluates possible barriers to physical activity/exercise training for patients&#xD;
      with chronic kidney disease in Europe. The study's aim is to investigate structural problems&#xD;
      and attitudes at different levels of care. Both a systemic and individual approach are&#xD;
      applied. Barriers due to health care organisation and reimbursement policies will be&#xD;
      investigated in the health care system and at the renal unit. Perceived benefits of physical&#xD;
      activity and personal attitudes towards a healthy lifestyle will be investigated in&#xD;
      nephrologists and renal nurses. Patients' health related quality of life, attitudes and&#xD;
      perceived availability will be explored.&#xD;

      Exercise training and physical rehabilitation in patients with chronic kidney disease in&#xD;
      Europe - what is the problem? - A European survey study -EUSUREX (EUropean SUrvey on Renal&#xD;
      EXercise)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose Firstly, to identify potential barriers for integrating exercise training into&#xD;
      regular therapy for patients with chronic kidney disease in different European countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, to use this knowledge of the importance of different barriers to promote the use of&#xD;
      exercise training as therapy and to target the respective levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, if there are obvious differences at the level of the health care system, positive&#xD;
      examples from one country could be used as a lever in another country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Lack of physical activity is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)&#xD;
      and is a risk factor for increased mortality (1) as in the general population (2). To date&#xD;
      there is a body of scientific evidence showing that patients with nondialysis dependent CKD,&#xD;
      patients on maintenance dialysis and patients after renal transplantation all benefit from&#xD;
      regular exercise training (3,4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many national societies worldwide recommend that exercise training be incorporated into&#xD;
      treatment of patients with CKD. A number of qualitative and quantitative studies have&#xD;
      highlighted various barriers to exercise training (5-12). The most commonly described&#xD;
      barriers include patient hesitation due to feeling tired, not having time, being in pain or&#xD;
      just being afraid to move. Other common barriers are staff related. Nurses are pressed for&#xD;
      time and do not feel they have knowledge or competence to assist patients. Nephrologists do&#xD;
      not ask patients about their physical activity or just do not think it is important. Some&#xD;
      studies, albeit in general practitioners and cardiologists, have shown an association between&#xD;
      the physicians' own level of physical activity and propensity to recommend physical activity&#xD;
      to their patients. In a pilot study, the investigators found association between both renal&#xD;
      physicians and nurses levels of physical activity and propensity to recommend physical&#xD;
      training to their patients with chronic kidney disease (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study has to date described possible barriers due to the health care system. These could&#xD;
      be caused by the remuneration system, traditions pertaining to employing dedicated and&#xD;
      specially trained physiotherapists or exercise physiologists or other causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is to the investigators' knowledge no study employing a European perspective and&#xD;
      investigating patients', physicians', nursing staff's and hospital administrators' attitudes&#xD;
      and perception of barriers to integrating regular exercise training into routine clinical&#xD;
      care. Nor is there any study examining the whole spectrum of chronic kidney disease, i.e&#xD;
      comprising nondialysis dependent CKD, maintenance dialysis treatment, including both patients&#xD;
      treated with hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, and after renal transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Selection of participating centres with research subjects and patients A list of all&#xD;
      Renal units for each country was sent to professor Carmine Zoccali's group with headquarters&#xD;
      in Reggio di Calabria, where dr Giovanni Tripepi, head biostatistician of the CNR-IFC&#xD;
      Clinical Epidemiology and Pathophysiology of Renal Diseases and Hypertension Unit, randomly&#xD;
      selected one renal unit per 4 million inhabitants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim is to include at least 1000 patients. If the investigators do not&#xD;
      receive a sufficient number of replies from the patients from the centres the investigators&#xD;
      have already contacted (all randomly selected), the investigators will make another random&#xD;
      selection in the various countries and involve (just for the Patient questionnaire) other&#xD;
      centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construction of the questionnaires Step 1. National experts interested in the field of&#xD;
      exercise training in patients with CKD were consulted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2. Current literature, pre-existing questionnaires and general experiences and&#xD;
      suggestions received by various colleagues were collected and formed a basis for constructing&#xD;
      the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3. Five questionnaires were constructed targeting country level organization of physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs as well as clinicians', nurses' and patients' perception about&#xD;
      physical exercise and physical rehabilitation programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Country level questionnaire - general questions about physical rehabilitation&#xD;
           opportunities at country level,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Renal unit level questionnaire - questions about physical rehabilitation programs at the&#xD;
           renal unit level,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nephrologist questionnaire - questions about how the problem is perceived by clinicians&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Nurse questionnaire - questions about how the problem is perceived by nurses&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient questionnaire - the SF-36 was used with added questions about how the problem is&#xD;
           perceived by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4 Questionnaires were validated for clarity and consistency of content in randomly&#xD;
      selected units in EU countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation questions were constructed for each questionnaire. Each participating country has&#xD;
      one or two national leaders responsible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The national leaders sent the questionnaires 2, 3 and 4 together with corresponding&#xD;
      validation questionnaires to the heads of the randomly selected Renal units in their&#xD;
      respective countries for validation by the head of the unit, the physicians and head&#xD;
      nurse(s). Questionnaires 1 and 5 were validated by each country's national leader.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 5 After validation the questionnaires were once again sent to the national leaders for&#xD;
      distribution to each country's randomly selected renal centres for a new evaluation to ensure&#xD;
      that the questionnaires are clear and are consistent with content. Further refinements if&#xD;
      necessary will be performed after which the final step of validation is completed. Finally,&#xD;
      each national leader will translate the appropriate questionnaires as deemed necessary. The&#xD;
      SF-36 is translated and validated in most European languages. The national leader will only&#xD;
      need to translate the additional questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distribution of questionnaires Once the questionnaires have been validated and unanimously&#xD;
      approved, the colleagues at the various centres involved in the validation process (all&#xD;
      randomly selected) will be asked to compile the VALIDATED Country-, Renal Unit-, Clinician-,&#xD;
      Nurse- questionnaires and administer the Patient questionnaire to the whole (consenting)&#xD;
      patient population at their respective centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical evaluation The questionnaires will be sent to CNR-IFC Clinical Epidemiology and&#xD;
      Pathophysiology of Renal Diseases and Hypertension Unit in Reggio di Calabria for statistical&#xD;
      evaluation. Data description and data analysis will be performed with parametric and&#xD;
      non-parametric methods recommended for the analysis of questionnaires (14) by the STATA 15&#xD;
      statistical package.&#xD;
