  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-center study. Bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with&#xD;
      CA-HRE will be compared to those from hospitalized patients with healthcare-associated HRE&#xD;
      (HA-HRE). In addition, community spread of CRE will be determined.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are discharged home from the hospital and meet criteria for possible CA-HRE will&#xD;
      be recruited. These index participants will be interviewed to determine the epidemiologic&#xD;
      network, and will be mailed a monthly BioWipe kit to screen for ongoing HRE intestinal&#xD;
      carriage. Contacts of the index participant will also be approached and mailed a BioWipe kit&#xD;
      to screen for the presence of HRE and/or carbapenemase gene(s) that were present in the index&#xD;
      patient. If this initial sample is negative, the contact is not further interviewed or&#xD;
      tested. If the initial screening is positive for the carbapenemase gene of interest, then the&#xD;
      contact will be asked to answer the same questions as the index patient and will receive a&#xD;
      monthly BioWipe kit. For each positive contact, a second-generation network of contacts will&#xD;
      be constructed, who in turn will be approached for screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional subset of participants, those with CDC-defined HRE isolated during&#xD;
      hospitalization who are not discharged home will also be included. All HRE isolates that are&#xD;
      isolated from the patient as part of routine clinical care will be sub-cultured and shipped&#xD;
      to the central research laboratory. A limited data set will be collected.&#xD;
