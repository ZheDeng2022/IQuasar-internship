  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study of traumatized patients treated in emergency departments of Tours, seeking to optimize&#xD;
      the management of trauma pain in an inpatient setting, with the opportunity to integrate&#xD;
      inhaled methoxyflurane (Penthrox®) into the arsenal analgesics useful in the analgesic&#xD;
      protocol of the Reception and Orientation Nurse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intra-hospital, the prevalence of pain is major; this is variable depending on the studies,&#xD;
      but permanently above 60%. A study conducted in 2015 in Tours Adult Emergencies showed a&#xD;
      prevalence of pain of 66.5% with an average waiting time of 2h28 before receiving an&#xD;
      analgesic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain management protocol at the Tours emergency department includes paracetamol for a&#xD;
      numerical evaluation scale (EN) &lt; 3 and tramadol for an EN between 4 and 6. But these&#xD;
      therapies have a delay of action too long or are given too late. An improvement in the&#xD;
      management of pain in emergency is therefore necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methoxyflurane (Penthrox®) is a volatile fluoridated analgesic; it offers several benefits:&#xD;
      fast over a long period, well tolerated, effective and without interference with other drugs.&#xD;
      Despite a misuse in the 70s, it has been used for more than 20 years in Australia and New&#xD;
      Zealand. It was granted marketing authorization in 2016 and has been marketed in France since&#xD;
      2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that this analgesic treatment is already adopted in several hospitals in&#xD;
      the region and also in the SAMU 37.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar study was conducted in Grenoble but on a different population. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to highlight the interest of Penthrox® in the management of monotraumatic pains in the&#xD;
      Adult Emergencies of Tours with the intention of modifying the antalgic protocol accordingly&#xD;
      to the reception of emergencies.&#xD;
