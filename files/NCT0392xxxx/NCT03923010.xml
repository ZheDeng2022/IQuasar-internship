      The purpose of this study is to estimate the proportion of participants prescribed&#xD;
      itraconazole for Tinea cruris or Tinea corporis who have clinical response after 7 days of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 7 (End of Treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with clinical response will be reported. Assessment of clinical response will be done by using Investigator Global Evaluation tool based on the signs and symptoms and clinical improvement scores. The percentage of clinical improvement will be measured at the score ranging from 1 to 5 where Score 1: Healed (absence of signs and symptoms), Score 2: Markedly improved (greater than [&gt;] 50 percentage [%] clinical improvement), Score 3: Considerable residual lesion (less than [&lt;] 50% clinical improvement), Score 4: No change (same as baseline), and Score 5: Worse (deterioration from baseline). Clinical response will be defined as having Scores 1 or 2 (healed or markedly improved).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Have Mycological Cure</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who have mycological cure will be reported. Mycological cure is defined as both culture and microscopy negative to causative fungi.</description>
