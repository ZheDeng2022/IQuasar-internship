      The lack of data relating to the DDI between ATV and RIF is a major limitation to the use of&#xD;
      ATV in patients who require treatment for TB. The VirTUAL Workpackage 2 will explore the&#xD;
      necessary dose escalation required to overcome this interaction in non-pregnant HIV-infected&#xD;
      adults who are virologically suppressed on bPI-based ART, and who are administered RIF as a&#xD;
      study drug, not as part of a full TB treatment regimen. As the specific objective of WP2 is&#xD;
      to define the dose of ATV, participants taking an alternative bPI will be transitioned to ATV&#xD;
      for the duration of that study. However, to extrapolate the results of this study to special&#xD;
      populations such as pregnant and postpartum women, children and adolescents and those with&#xD;
      other 'special' characteristics such as obesity (BMI &gt;30 Kg/m2) or malnutrition (BMI &lt;18.5&#xD;
      Kg/m2) we propose to undertake sparse sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis from individuals&#xD;
      who require ATV-based ART for their clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sparse PK data will be obtained opportunistically from participants in the 'special&#xD;
      populations' defined above who are receiving ATV as part of their routine clinical care.&#xD;
      Subjects will be identified from clinics including the Joint Clinical Research Center (JCRC)&#xD;
      and Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI), Kampala, and from sites including Groote Schuur&#xD;
      Hospital and Gugulethu Community Health Centre, Cape Town. The ATV/r data from &quot;special&#xD;
      populations&quot; will enable validation and refinement of both the PBPK model (WP1) and the&#xD;
      pop-PK models (WP4) of the VirTUAL consortium.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overview of VirTUAL Consortium Through the VirTUAL Consortium, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      define the optimal use of second-line ART regimens in vulnerable populations with TB&#xD;
      co-infection. The primary objective is to 'to determine the optimal dose of boosted&#xD;
      atazanavir (ATV/r) when used in combination with RIF-based TB treatment in children,&#xD;
      adolescents and pregnant or breastfeeding women.'&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from this protocol (VirTUAL WP5) will be considered in the context of the full&#xD;
      research programme. This can be summarised as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling will be developed to understand bPI&#xD;
      and RIF Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs), identifying potential dosing strategies to overcome&#xD;
      these in adults and special populations (WP1). This data will inform clinical pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      studies exploring the necessary dose escalation of ATV/r, including in the context of&#xD;
      high-dose RIF, performed in Kampala (WP2). Intracellular pharmacokinetics will further&#xD;
      characterise the DDI (WP3). PBPK and population pharmacokinetics (pop-PK) modelling will be&#xD;
      integrated enabling extrapolation to special populations (WP4), and sparse data collection&#xD;
      from such populations receiving different combinations of second-line ART and/or TB treatment&#xD;
      in Kampala and Cape Town will validate and refine these models (WP5). Capacity building&#xD;
      focussing on equipping African scientists with the tools to efficiently define drug dosing in&#xD;
      complex populations (WP6), communication and stakeholder engagement (WP7) will increase the&#xD;
      application of this methodology to other priority research into pharmacokinetics in special&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol describes the sparse pharmacokinetic sampling component which forms Workpackage&#xD;
      5 (WP5) of this research programme. The dose-escalation study (WP2) is an interventional&#xD;
      trial which will be conducted in 28 healthy, virologically suppressed volunteers who are on&#xD;
      ATV-based second-line ART, are aged over 18, have a normal BMI and are not pregnant or&#xD;
      breastfeeding, and which will take place at JCRC, Kampala, Uganda. This study is anticipated&#xD;
      to commence in mid-2019, and will explore in detail the changes in pharmacokinetics of ATV/r&#xD;
      in both plasma and within cells which take place when rifampicin is co-administered, and will&#xD;
      evaluate the necessary dose adjustment which is required to concurrently administer ATV/r&#xD;
      with rifampicin-based TB treatment. WP2 will generate intensive data on these 28 well&#xD;
      characterized individuals who do not have 'special' characteristics. However, there is a&#xD;
      paucity of data on ATV/r disposition in patients who are typically excluded from clinical&#xD;
      trials, and therefore the observational data from WP5 will be collected from individuals who&#xD;
      fall into the listed categories of special populations and who are being treated with ATV/r&#xD;
      for their own health. Data from either WP2 or WP5 alone will be amenable to pharmacometric&#xD;
      analysis and bring value, but the combined modelling approach using both sets of data in a&#xD;
      combined model will allow the most comprehensive evaluation of ATV/r disposition in the wider&#xD;
      population, and will enable projections of dosing recommendations for the special populations&#xD;
      who require concurrent treatment for TB whilst receiving ATV/r-based ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be identified at routine clinic appointments. They (or their guardians) will&#xD;
      be asked to keep a detailed record of dosing times for three to five days prior to their&#xD;
      study appointment at which sampling will be performed. If they take their medication in the&#xD;
      morning, they will be asked to bring the medication to clinic for observation of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat sampling at subsequent appointments will enable assessment of both between and&#xD;
      within-individual variability, for example during periods of rapid childhood growth or during&#xD;
      pregnancy and transition back to non-pregnant physiological state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is aimed to obtain 20 sparse PK profiles in each of the following groups (pregnant, child&#xD;
      &lt;5, child 6-11, adolescent 12-18, obese (BMI &gt;30 Kg/m2), malnourished (BMI &lt;18.5 Kg/m2)),&#xD;
      with each individual contributing 4 samples per PK visit, and possibly followed up&#xD;
      longitudinally during the study (each individual may attend for a maximum of three study&#xD;
      visits). Therefore there will be between 7 (6 participants being sampled on 3 occasions and a&#xD;
      final participant sampled on 2 occasions) and 20 (if each participant was only sampled on a&#xD;
      single occasion) individual participants per group to generate the 20 sampling 'occasions',&#xD;
      with a total number of participants across the six groups included in the study of between 42&#xD;
      and 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will provide an essential clinical dataset to inform the pop-PK modelling approach and&#xD;
      validate the PBPK simulations, describing exposure and pharmacokinetic variability in the&#xD;
      populations of interest. The data from this work package will be pooled with the data from&#xD;
      the study in volunteers and jointly analysed using PK modelling. Differences in the PK&#xD;
      parameters for each of the groups will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There exist no peer-reviewed published data regarding the transfer of ATV/r into breast milk.&#xD;
      Therefore, among women who are enrolled during pregnancy and followed into the postpartum&#xD;
      phase, paired breast milk samples will be obtained at the same time as plasma samples.&#xD;
