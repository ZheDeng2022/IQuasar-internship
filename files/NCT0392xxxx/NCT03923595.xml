    <textblock>
      High rates of HCV infections occur in individuals with Substance Use Disorder (SUD),&#xD;
      particularly in subjects with Alcohol Use Disorder and in People Who Inject Drugs (PWID), but&#xD;
      also in subjects taking psychiatric medications. In our geographic area, HCV prevalence data&#xD;
      are available for PWID only, with &gt;25% of them infected with HCV. The best strategy to&#xD;
      achieve micro-elimination is targeted active screening. In Italy, SERDs assess and manage SUD&#xD;
      individuals, but are not allowed to treat patients. Moreover, they have limited resources to&#xD;
      perform HCV screening and to ensure linkage to care for SUD individuals living in peripheral&#xD;
      areas. Fifteen SERDs are present in Northern Puglia and Molise, a geographical area of about&#xD;
      7500 Km2 usually served by our Hepatology Unit. This geographic area is not very well served&#xD;
      by public transport leading to a logistical barrier to access needed services delivered by&#xD;
      our unit. This issue can negatively affect engagement with clinical services for viral&#xD;
      hepatitis even in the era of DAA. Moreover, during treatment, it is not infrequent for&#xD;
      patients to discontinue therapy due to a chaotic lifestyle, poor income conditions and the&#xD;
      limited access to public transportation which is needed to adhere to on-treatment monitoring.&#xD;
      Primary objective to plan and deliver a program of dedicated transportations and cure for&#xD;
      patients with SUD and hepatitis C who live in peripheral areas of our region. It will&#xD;
      translate in higher rates of screening, successful linkage to care, commencement and&#xD;
      completion of DAA treatments leading to HCV microelimination. We plan to expand our&#xD;
      collaborative work involving up to 15 SERDs form Northen of Puglia. The program consists of&#xD;
      -peer to peer meetings with SERDs physicians and teams, educational campaigns for patients&#xD;
      and screening of SUD individuals and their partners using oral Quick HCV test at each SERD, -&#xD;
      dedicated transportation services, - complete virological and liver disease evaluation at our&#xD;
      Hospital. This organization will guarantee direct connections between Hospital and patients&#xD;
      included in the program. This program will ensure screening of patients with suspected&#xD;
      infection at SERD, linkage to care of newly diagnosed subjects and completion of treatment&#xD;
      for subjects who need to start DAA therapy. The rate of screening and successful linkage to&#xD;
      care for each SUD subgroup will be characterized as well as the cascade to care.&#xD;

      Scientific Rationale: To adhere to the WHO plan of identifying 90% and treat 80% of HCV&#xD;
      infected subjects, in several Countries a number of barriers need to be overcome (1). A&#xD;
      focused effort from physicians and public administrative authorities is required to increase&#xD;
      HCV treatment rates using direct acting antivirals (DAAs). Consequently, methods enhancing&#xD;
      the epidemiological impact of HCV treatment using DAAs are of primary importance in order to&#xD;
      promote what has been defined as micro-elimination (2). Among populations at high risk of&#xD;
      transmission, targeted in the context of developing micro-elimination, people who inject&#xD;
      drugs (PWID) and, in general, subjects with substance use disorders (SUD) are particularly&#xD;
      important to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Italy, individuals with SUD including people who inject drugs and subjects taking&#xD;
      psychiatric medications or alcoholic excess represent the most important target of HCV&#xD;
      micro-elimination. Data provided by the Italian National Institute of Health during 2017,&#xD;
      show a decline in the incidence of acute HCV infection with a peak of 0.3 x 100.000&#xD;
      inhabitants among subjects of 25-34 years as a consequence of: recent or ongoing use of intra&#xD;
      venous (i.v.) substances; and/or sexual transmission (3). Moreover, in the National Cohort&#xD;
      Piter including 9.040 HCV infected subjects, 32% was or is currently using alcohol and about&#xD;
      20% was or is currently using substances (4). Of interest, while alcohol abuse is usually&#xD;
      associated with cirrhosis, drug use is associated with any stage of fibrosis. These&#xD;
      epidemiological data highlight the need to differentiate and personalize the approach to SUD&#xD;
      people. Finally, it is important to mention that a decline in the rate of screening has&#xD;
      recently been registered in Italy among subjects followed by Outpatient Services for&#xD;
      substance use disorders called SERDS (5-6). Current estimates suggest that, in our region,&#xD;
      about 4500 subject using substances are probably HCV infected (6). Although it seems that no&#xD;
      more than 10% of regular SERDS patients have not yet been screened for viral infections the&#xD;
      rate of unscreened people is increasing among young SERDS patients (7). A high rate of&#xD;
      unscreened SUD partners and families has been reported by SERDS specialists in our&#xD;
      geographical area (personal communications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our real life experience only 50% of SUD patients testing HCV RNA positive agree to be&#xD;
      treated due to different reasons including fear of treatment and difficulties in reaching&#xD;
      DAAs treatment prescribing centers (8). Furthermore, in recent real world study leaded by our&#xD;
      center and involving 20 out of 31 of the authorized prescribing centers in Puglia, we&#xD;
      observed a 3% higher rate of treatment discontinuation in this, versus general population&#xD;
      (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid and cost-effective interventional strategies may favor both diagnosis of unknown cases&#xD;
      and access to treatment for eligible patients. In general, training and education for&#xD;
      providers, and an increased awareness of new advanced DAAs therapies among key risk&#xD;
      populations are activities to strengthen within the Health system. However, in given&#xD;
      situations, diversifying services and ensuring geographically and culturally appropriate&#xD;
      services may play a key role in increasing the screening-diagnosis-referral-treatment-follow&#xD;
      up cascade. It is important to establish upfront, within the heath care physicians, what can&#xD;
      be done by different figures: the prescriber gastroenterologist is allowed to prescribe DAA&#xD;
      and able to manage patients with a very advanced disease or patients with multiple&#xD;
      drug-to-drug interactions; and the specialists working at the SERD are not allowed to&#xD;
      prescribe DAA but used to monitor SUD patients and to help them to recover from their&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In Italy, SERDS are spread over the regional areas. According to the geographical&#xD;
      characteristics of Puglia and Molise, the region bordering Puglia to the north, there are&#xD;
      peripheral areas either along the cost or in internal mountains not well served by the public&#xD;
      transportation. This aspect results in the need of relying on a private car to reach the&#xD;
      specialized center where patients can be screened, diagnosed and treated. Fifteen SERDS are&#xD;
      present in Northern Puglia and Molise over an area of 7500 Km2 usually served by our&#xD;
      Hepatology Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that, in addition to the known barriers to care for SUD population, lack of&#xD;
      direct and efficient public transport represents a limitation preventing SUD individuals not&#xD;
      only from being screened, diagnosed and treated, but also adequately informed on the most&#xD;
      recent and highly efficient and safe pan-genotypic regimens with low impact drug to drug&#xD;
      interactions. Moreover, the chaotic lifestyle and the poor income conditions of these&#xD;
      patients prevent treatment completion due to transportation issue, for those who start&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: the primary aim of this project is to explore our hypothesis by evaluating&#xD;
      the impact of intensifying screening, diagnosis, linkage to care and treatment cascade of SUD&#xD;
      patients through a dedicated cure program including &quot;ad hoc&quot; transportation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are: firstly, to increase the awareness on HCV infection and related liver&#xD;
      disease through a peer-to-peer educational campaign performed at SERDs in combination with&#xD;
      our Unit. (Risk and liver disease outcomes, diagnostic and staging tools and the new DAAs&#xD;
      regimens will be explained either to patients or to local healthcare workers and nurses at&#xD;
      each individual SERD). Secondarily, to reduce treatment discontinuation in the subgroup of&#xD;
      PWID patients.&#xD;
