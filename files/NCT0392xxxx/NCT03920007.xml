      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of SAR439483 administered as a&#xD;
      unilateral subretinal injection in patients with Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) caused by&#xD;
      autosomal recessive guanylate cyclase 2D (GUCY2D) mutations (GUCY2D-LCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of ascending doses of SAR439483 administered as a unilateral&#xD;
      subretinal injection in patients with GUCY2D-LCA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study duration per participant is approximately 112 weeks including: an approximately 56-day&#xD;
      screening/baseline period, an approximately 52-week study observation period including 1&#xD;
      treatment day, and an approximately 52-week safety follow-up period. The end of study visit&#xD;
      will be approximately 104 weeks after the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP)&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the main study (DFI14738), participants may have the option to enroll in&#xD;
      a separate long-term follow-up study, in which case they would no longer continue in DFI14738&#xD;
      and their end of study visit would be conducted at Week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is separated into 2 parts including a dose escalation phase (Part A) and a dose&#xD;
      expansion phase (Part B). In Part B participants will be treated at the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) determined from Part A.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female participant with clinical diagnosis of Leber congenital amaurosis&#xD;
             caused by biallelic mutations in the GUCY2D (retinal guanylate cyclase) gene with all&#xD;
             of the following: a) Documented mutations in both alleles of the GUCY2D gene per&#xD;
             testing in a CLIA-approved laboratory, b) For Cohort 1-3, best corrected visual acuity&#xD;
             (BCVA) of 20/200 or worse in the eye to be injected; subsequent cohorts may include&#xD;
             BCVA of 20/80 or worse in the eye to be injected, c) Photoreceptor (outer nuclear)&#xD;
             layer structure identifiable on an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan across the&#xD;
             central retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years for Cohorts 1 through 4, and age ≥ 6 years and &lt;18 years for Cohort 5.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complicating systemic diseases (such as medical conditions causing immunosuppression)&#xD;
             that would preclude the gene transfer, ocular surgery or planned study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing eye conditions in the study eye that would preclude the planned surgery&#xD;
             or interfere with the assessment and interpretation of study endpoints: for example,&#xD;
             glaucoma or optic neuropathy that has resulted in significant visual loss, corneal or&#xD;
             lenticular abnormalities or opacities that would preclude view of the fundus or&#xD;
             performance of the outcome measures, uveitis, retinopathy and maculopathy that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator are causing significant visual loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of significant ocular abnormalities in the study eye that in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator would preclude the planned surgery, effective safety follow-up, or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study endpoints (eg, glaucoma, corneal or&#xD;
             significant lens abnormalities or opacities, pre-existing uveitis, intraocular&#xD;
             infection, choroidal neovascularization).&#xD;
&#xD;

             the use of anaesthesia or allergy to medications planned in the peri-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational medicinal&#xD;
             product (IMP), diagnostic agents used during the study or medications planned for use&#xD;
             in the peri-operative period, particularly corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant (defined as positive beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG)&#xD;
             blood or urine test), lactating or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any ocular procedure, either planned or performed within 6 months of Day 1, which&#xD;
             would interfere with the planned surgery or the interpretation of study endpoints in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Principal Investigator (PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory test abnormalities or abnormalities in electrocardiogram that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the PI would make the participant unsuitable for participation in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant intercurrent illness or infection during the 28 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current substance use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational agent administered within 5 times the elimination half-life&#xD;
             of that investigational agent prior to SAR439483 administration.&#xD;

             relating to GUCY2D-LCA, throughout the duration of the SAR439483 study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of anticoagulation therapy within two weeks prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of immunosuppressive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current, planned during the course of this trial, or past (within 5 times the&#xD;
             elimination half-life of that therapy prior to SAR439483 administration) use of&#xD;
             anti-viral therapy that would inactivate the investigational agent.&#xD;
