  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrobulbar block is used to provide perioperative analgesia and anesthesia for orbital ball&#xD;
      implants after enucleation surgery in the investigator's hospital. Retrobulbar block alone&#xD;
      can provide quicker recovery, decreased time to discharge, opioid sparing, reduced costs.&#xD;
      However, patients undergoing orbital ball implants after enucleation surgery with retrobulbar&#xD;
      block alone suffered more preoperative and intraoperative anxiety，postoperative pain, and&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting. General anesthesia alone is administered to patients&#xD;
      undergoing orbital ball implants after enucleation surgery and opioids are used in adjunct&#xD;
      with general anesthesia to suppress pain and hemodynamic stress associated with surgical&#xD;
      trauma. GA only associated with more systemic opioids, short-term cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      somnolence, and postoperative nausea and vomiting that can increase patient morbidity and&#xD;
      delay discharge. Opioids, however, can result in adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      pruritus, sedation. As a result of this growing demand of efficient and effective anesthesia&#xD;
      management for orbital ball implants after enucleation surgery is becoming increasingly&#xD;
      important. Numerous studies have reported benefits of an retrobulbar block for orbital ball&#xD;
      implants after enucleation surgery, including quicker recovery and decreased time to&#xD;
      discharge, decreased pain scores, opioid sparing, reduced costs, less intraoperative&#xD;
      hemodynamic variability, improved patient satisfaction, and, in some cases, reduced GA-&#xD;
      and/or opioid-related side effects. A recent systematic review examining all modes of&#xD;
      postoperative pain management following orbital ball implants after enucleation surgery&#xD;
      concluded that retrobulbar block are superior to all other forms of postoperative pain&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

      This retrospective review examined postoperative outcomes for orbital ball implants after&#xD;
      enucleation surgery patients who underwent surgery with general anesthesia (GA), single-shot&#xD;
      retrobulbar block, or retrobulbar block combined with GA. The primary outcome included&#xD;
      postoperative pain upon arrival at and discharge from the PACU, analgesic consumption and&#xD;
      rescue analgesia. Secondary outcomes was time to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit&#xD;
      (PACU) as well as GA and opioid-related side effects and retrobulbar block- associated&#xD;
      neurological complications. The investigators speculated that patients who received an&#xD;
      retrobulbar block before GA had less postoperative pain, and reduced analgesic requirements&#xD;
      when compared with patients who received GA Only or retrobulbar block alone.&#xD;
