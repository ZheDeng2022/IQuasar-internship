      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      personalized neoantigen vaccine consisting of personalized neoantigen peptides and Hiltonol®&#xD;
      (NeoVax) plus Montanide® in combination with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab. The study also intends&#xD;
      to define the appropriate dose of investigational Ipilimumab administered subcutaneously&#xD;
      (under the skin) to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the combination is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved personalized neoantigen&#xD;
      peptides, Hiltonol® or Montanide® a as a treatment for any disease. It is an investigational&#xD;
      drug being developed for use in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved Nivolumab (Opdivo®) and Ipilimumab (Yervoy™) as a treatment option for&#xD;
      this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved Ipilimumab administered intravenously as a treatment option for this&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved Ipilimumab administered subcutaneously (under the skin) as a&#xD;
      treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to administer safely a&#xD;
      personalized neoantigen vaccine (NeoVax) + Montanide in combination with Ipilimumab and&#xD;
      Nivolumab against melanoma by using information gained from specific characteristics of&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that melanoma cancers have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are&#xD;
      specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to&#xD;
      produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that&#xD;
      these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the body&#xD;
      fight any tumor cells that could cause the melanoma to come back in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melanoma cells will be obtained either by tumor surgery or tumor biopsy. The genetic material&#xD;
      contained in the melanoma cells will be examined for the presence of tumor-specific&#xD;
      mutations. This information will be used to prepare small protein fragments, which are called&#xD;
      &quot;peptides&quot;. The vaccine will consist of up to 20 of these peptides mixed with two drugs that&#xD;
      activate the immune system called Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol®) and Montanide®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poly-ICLC (also called Hiltonol) binds proteins on the surface of certain immune cells to&#xD;
      make it appear as if a virus is present. When the cells detect the vaccine, they think it is&#xD;
      a virus and turn on the immune system. Poly-ICLC is a compound that has been used to help the&#xD;
      body in its fight against cancer. Poly-ICLC will be mixed with neoantigen peptides to create&#xD;
      the personalized neoantigen vaccine (NeoVax). Poly-ICLC is an investigational drug, meaning&#xD;
      the FDA has not approved it as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montanide® is an activator of immunity that enhances response to vaccination through slow&#xD;
      release of the peptides from the injection site and its ability to create an inflammation and&#xD;
      stimulate the recruitment of specific cells of the participant's immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montanide® will be mixed with the personalized neoantigen vaccine product and administered as&#xD;
      an injection given underneath the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab and Nivolumab are antibodies that prevent cancer cells from suppressing immune&#xD;
      response so that the body can attack and kill the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An antibody is a common type of protein produced by the body that the immune system (a system&#xD;
      that defends the body against potentially harmful particles) uses to find and destroy foreign&#xD;
      molecules (particles not typically found in the body) such as bacteria and viruses.&#xD;
      Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory for use in treating patients. There are now&#xD;
      several approved antibodies for the therapy of cancer and other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking at the effectiveness (how well the drug&#xD;
      works), safety, and tolerability of the Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine plus&#xD;
      Montanide® combined with Ipilimumab and Nivolumab.&#xD;
