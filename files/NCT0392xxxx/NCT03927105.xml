    <description>Overall Response Rate (CR + PR) as determined by LYRIC (LYmphoma Response to Immunomodulatory therapy Criteria), at four months (shown as number of participants with CR or PR at 4 months).&#xD;
LYRIC: An adaptation of the Lugano classification developed because discriminating true progressive disease from pseudoprogression in lymphoma patients receiving immunomodulatory agents is challenging. To address this challenge, the LYRIC criteria incorporated the response category of &quot;indeterminate response&quot; (IR).&#xD;
IR(1): ≥ 50% increase in overall tumor burden (sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters (SPD) of up to 6 target measurable nodes and extranodal sites) occurred in the 1st 12 weeks of therapy and without clinical deterioration&#xD;
IR(2): new lesions or ≥ 50% increase of existing lesion(s) without a ≥ 50% increase of overall tumor burden at any time during treatment.&#xD;
IR(3): increased FDG uptake of 1or more lesions without any increase in size or number of those lesions.</description>

    <intervention_name>Nivolumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody (HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that targets the programmed death-1 (PD-1) cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes.1 Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, programmed death-ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), results in the down-regulation of lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen-specific T-cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-antigens. Nivolumab will be delivered intravenously at a fixed dose of 240 mg on day 1 of 14 day cycles.</description>

          <title>Nivolumab + Cabiralizumab</title>
          <description>Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody (HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that targets the programmed death-1 (PD-1) cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes.1 Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, programmed death-ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), results in the down-regulation of lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen-specific T-cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-antigens. Nivolumab will be delivered intravenously at a fixed dose of 240 mg on day 1 of 14 day cycles.&#xD;
Cabiralizumab is a recombinant, humanized Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to human colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R; c-fms). Cabiralizumab will be delivered intravenously at a dosage of 4 mg/kg on day 1 of 14 day cycles.</description>

Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody (HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that targets the programmed death-1 (PD-1) cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes.1 Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, programmed death-ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), results in the down-regulation of lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen-specific T-cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-antigens.&#xD;
Cabiralizumab is a recombinant, humanized Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to human colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R; c-fms).</description>
