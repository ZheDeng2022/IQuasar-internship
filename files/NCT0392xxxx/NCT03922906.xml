      The study aim to evaluate the performance of Pure-Vu System in cleansing patients' colon with&#xD;
      history of inadequate bowel preparation who are indicated for a colonoscopy procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is planned as a single arm, open trial will include up to 30 patients, aim to&#xD;
      evaluate the performance of Pure-Vu System in cleansing patients' colon with history of&#xD;
      inadequate bowel preparation who are indicated for a colonoscopy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled at up to 3 clinical sites in Israel. Subjects who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be required to follow a standard bowel preparation instruction.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to record and provide their diet and bowel movements in the provided&#xD;
      diary log at time of their scheduled colonoscopy (Diary log is provided in appendix C) and to&#xD;
      complete a satisfaction questionnaire include feedback on the procedure and on specific&#xD;
      aspects related to the preparation regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the procedure a telephone follow-up will be conducted at 48 hours (± 48 hours) post&#xD;
      Pure-Vu procedure to assess patient well-being and capture any adverse events.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The rating of the cleansing quality was evaluated by using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), Segment score of 0-3 given to each of the 3 segments of the colon (Left side, Transverse and right side):&#xD;
Score 0- Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared.&#xD;
Score 1- A portion of the mucosa of the colon segment is seen, but other areas of the colon segment are not seen well due to staining, residual stool, and/or opaque liquid.&#xD;
Score 2- A minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool, and/or opaque liquid are visible, but the mucosa of the colon segment are seen well.&#xD;
Score 3-The entire mucosa of the colon segment is seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool, or opaque liquid.&#xD;
subject consider as having adequate cleaning if BBPS&gt;1 in all colon segments</description>

    <description>The Pure-Vu System enables colon cleansing during standard colonoscopy using a standard colonoscope. The cleansing device, which is attached to the tip of the colonoscope and is connected to an external workstation, generates fluid jets within the colon thus dissolving the feces into small parts. The fecal matter &amp; fluids are drained through the evacuation pipe of the cleansing device into a collecting reservoir.</description>

    <description>Pure-Vu System is intended to connect to standard colonoscopes to help facilitate intra-procedural cleaning of a poorly prepared colon by irrigating and/or cleaning the colon and evacuating the irrigation fluid (saline water), feces and other bodily fluids and matter, e.g. blood.</description>
