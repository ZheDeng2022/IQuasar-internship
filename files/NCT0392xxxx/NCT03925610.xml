  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of morbidly obese patients recovering from general anesthesia&#xD;
      after weight-loss surgery. The investigators aim to assess ventilatory function and how this&#xD;
      is influenced by the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), baseline ventilatory status,&#xD;
      as well as pharyngeal collapsibility of patients who are recovering from anesthesia and&#xD;
      treated for pain with opioids. The investigators hypothesize that patients with OSA, chronic&#xD;
      (baseline) hypoventilation and increased pharyngeal collapsibility, will be more vulnerable&#xD;
      to opioid-induced ventilatory depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases the risk for pulmonary complications in the first 24&#xD;
      hours after surgery, by more than 3-fold, suggesting an enhanced sensitivity to&#xD;
      opioid-induced ventilatory depression (OIVD), in this patient population. Obesity and OSA,&#xD;
      two highly comorbid conditions, are common among victims of postoperative life-threatening or&#xD;
      fatal OIVD and increased somnolence preceding the onset of a critical event, is an almost&#xD;
      ubiquitous clinical finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These clinical observations are in agreement with recent evidence that decreased wakefulness&#xD;
      is an important contributory mechanism of OIVD in OSA patients who receive opioid analgesia&#xD;
      in the postoperative period. Studies that examined the effect of opioids on breathing in&#xD;
      awake, sleeping, or anesthetized patients with OSA, support overall that OSA is not&#xD;
      associated with increased sensitivity to OIVD in awake subjects. In contrast, diminished&#xD;
      wakefulness has been shown to worsen, leave unaffected, or even slightly improve breathing&#xD;
      and oxygenation in patients with OSA, who are treated opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decrease in the tonic activity of the pharyngeal muscles with the progression from&#xD;
      wakefulness to sleep, contributes to increased airway resistance and the predisposition to&#xD;
      airway occlusion. This effect of sleep on the patency of pharyngeal airway seems to be more&#xD;
      pronounced in patients with OSA, who present with increased genioglossus muscle activity&#xD;
      during wakefulness taken as evidence for a neural compensation to maintain adequate airflow&#xD;
      in the presence of anatomical airway narrowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can thus be suggested that during pharmacological suppression of consciousness, like when&#xD;
      recovering from anesthesia, patients with OSA will experience more severe sleep-disordered&#xD;
      breathing and consequently be more vulnerable to OIVD, compared to normal subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To assess opioid-induced ventilatory depression in morbidly obese patients&#xD;
      with OSA, who recover from general anesthesia and are treated for pain with fentanyl. We will&#xD;
      develop a pharmacodynamic model for OIVD to assess the effect of OSA status (i.e.,&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe OSA vs. no or mild OSA) on the probability for TcPCO2 to exceed a&#xD;
      pre-specified threshold during recovery from anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To assess the effect of baseline TcPCO2 on the probability for TcPCO2 to&#xD;
      exceed a pre-specified threshold during recovery from anesthesia, independently of the OSA&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To assess the effect of the minimum positive airway pressure (minPAP) that&#xD;
      prevents obstructive breathing during sleep (estimated during in-lab polysomnography) on the&#xD;
      probability for TcPCO2 to exceed a pre-specified threshold, during recovery from anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with moderate-to-severe OSA will demonstrate a higher probability for exceeding&#xD;
           a pre-specified threshold for TcPCO2, compared to those with mild or no OSA, during&#xD;
           recovery from general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who present with higher TcPCO2 at baseline, will present with a higher&#xD;
           probability to exceed a pre-specified threshold for TcPCO2, independently of their OSA&#xD;
           status, compared to those with normal ventilatory control at baseline, during recovery&#xD;
           from anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with higher therapeutic PAP level (hence more collapsible airway) will be more&#xD;
           sensitive to fentanyl-induced ventilatory depression and will thus demonstrate a higher&#xD;
           probability for exceeding a pre-specified threshold for TcPCO2 during recovery from&#xD;
           anesthesia.&#xD;
