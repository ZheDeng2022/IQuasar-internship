  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiodermatitis (RD), an inflammatory skin reaction, occurs in more than 90 percent of cancer&#xD;
      patients treated with radiotherapy (RT). This is the result of the radiation causing damage&#xD;
      to the epidermal basal skin stem cells. Based on the severity of the skin symptoms, acute RD&#xD;
      can be categorized into four grades ranging from red and dry skin to moist desquamation,&#xD;
      necrosis, and eventually ulceration. Acute RD can be distressing, negatively influencing the&#xD;
      patients' quality of life (QOL). In cases of severe RD, RT might be interrupted, affecting&#xD;
      the treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no generally accepted treatment available for RD. As such, the standard&#xD;
      skincare treatment is hospital dependent. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) can offer a&#xD;
      solution, since the therapeutic use of (infra)red light induces photochemical reactions in&#xD;
      the target cells, stimulating repair and healing processes, and reducing pain and&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies using PBMT to prevent RD showed promising results. However, these beneficial&#xD;
      results need to be validated in a larger breast cancer patient population receiving an&#xD;
      alternative RT regimen. The study hypothesizes that PBMT is a safe and effective strategy to&#xD;
      prevent worsening of acute RD grade two or higher in breast cancer patients undergoing RT.&#xD;
      The primary objective is to measure the degree of acute RD to detect changes during and after&#xD;
      RT. Second, the patients' QOL and pain will be assessed. Finally, the third objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of PBMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this project will support the implementation of PBMT into the standard RD&#xD;
      skincare program.&#xD;
