  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevailing view in telomere epidemiology is that leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is&#xD;
      associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) since it serves as a biomarker&#xD;
      of the cumulative burden of inflammation and oxidative stress during adult life. However, our&#xD;
      recent results indicate that telomere length (TL) is mainly determined before adulthood, by&#xD;
      TL at birth and TL attrition during growth. They also demonstrate that short telomeres&#xD;
      precede the clinical manifestation of atherosclerosis. The investigators therefore&#xD;
      hypothesize that LT is not a simple marker, but a major determinant of arterial aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two mechanistic hypotheses may explain an active role of short telomeres in accelerated&#xD;
      arterial aging and development of ACVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first is that a short TL at the leukocyte level reflects a short TL in endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells (EPC). Cell replicative capacity being TL-dependent, short telomeres in the&#xD;
      EPC would therefore be responsible for diminished replication capacity and vascular repair&#xD;
      potential, thereby increasing the vulnerability for developing age-related arterial diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second hypothesis is that a short LTL reflects short TL in arterial wall cells, leading&#xD;
      to an increase in the number of senescent vascular cells. Senescent cells are known to alter&#xD;
      their secretion pattern, a phenomenon called senescence-associated secretory phenotype&#xD;
      (SASP), and thus contribute to tissue injury by promoting inflammation and tissue remodeling&#xD;
      leading to lesion progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These assumptions cannot be tested by LTL measurements alone. The investigators propose,&#xD;
      therefore, a model that makes it possible to examine different elements of TL dynamics in&#xD;
      different tissues and cell types: leukocytes, circulating EPCs, in situ EPCs and arterial&#xD;
      resident cells (mainly smooth muscle cells) in patients with or without atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our model is based on the following observations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TL is synchronized (equivalent) across somatic tissues/cells of the newborn: an&#xD;
           individual with short telomeres (relative to his pairs) in one tissue should also have&#xD;
           short telomeres (relative to his pairs) in other tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TL in EPCs (both circulating and in situ) determines the cell proliferative ability and&#xD;
           therefore capacity for vessels repair during aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TL in the cells of the arterial wall determines the number of senescent cells that&#xD;
           therefore contribute to tissue injury through their change of phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of the present project is to examine the mechanistic links between arterial&#xD;
      aging and TL in these different cell types.&#xD;
