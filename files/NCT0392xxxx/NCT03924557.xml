  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients often require administration of multiple supportive care pharmacotherapies&#xD;
      while receiving chemotherapy regardless the type of cancer. Supportive care therapies are&#xD;
      commonly prescribed to nearly all cancer patients and could include antiemetics&#xD;
      (ondansetron), pain management (opiates), GI protection (PPIs), antidepressants (select&#xD;
      SSRIs), anticoagulation (warfarin) and antifungal prophylaxis (voriconazole). These are all&#xD;
      are associated with known pharmacogenetic interactions, which in some cases render the drugs&#xD;
      ineffective or toxic. This could result in negative impacts on quality of life in patients&#xD;
      who are already undergoing complicated and costly anticancer regimens. Pharmacogenetic-guided&#xD;
      therapy based on an individual patient's genetic profile could potentially target symptoms&#xD;
      for which an individual is uniquely susceptible, guiding use of medications that are most&#xD;
      likely to be effective, thereby reducing unnecessary physical complications and financial&#xD;
      strain. It is hypothesized that patients in the genotype intervention arm will report lower&#xD;
      scores for overall symptom distress as compared to patients in the delayed genotype&#xD;
      intervention arm following initiation of chemotherapy.&#xD;

      This is a single center, pilot randomized pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) of 500 cancer&#xD;
      patients who are undergoing chemotherapy for newly diagnosed or recurrent cancers. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to genotyping intervention vs delayed genotyping intervention supportive&#xD;
      care. Supportive care regimens may include therapies for antiemesis (ondansetron), pain&#xD;
      management (opiates), GI protection (PPIs), antidepressants (select SSRIs), and antifungal&#xD;
      prophylaxis (voriconazole), and warfarin depending on their chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those randomized to the genotype intervention group, genotype results will be returned in&#xD;
      the EHR pre-emptively and supportive care will be prescribed based on genotype results. For&#xD;
      those randomized to the delayed genotype intervention group, supportive care will be&#xD;
      prescribed based on usual clinical practice. Both groups will be followed for 3 months and&#xD;
      undergo assessments with the MDASI questionnaire four times (pre-chemotherapy, and 2 weeks, 4&#xD;
      weeks and 12 weeks post initiation of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records for patients receiving outpatient care at the UF Health Cancer Center clinic at the&#xD;
      Medical Plaza will be screened based on inclusion / exclusion criteria for participation in&#xD;
      this study. Those that meet criteria will be offered participation. Participation is expected&#xD;
      to last approximately 12 weeks and the study will be open for 30-36 months.&#xD;

    <description>The M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) is a multisymptom patient-reported outcome measure. Participants are asked to recall symptom interference and severity during the past 24 hours and rate the symptom using a numeric rating scale, 0-10. For the symptom interference questions, 10 means interfered completely and 0 is did not interfere. For the symptom severity questions, 10 means as bad as you can imagine and 0 is not present. The MDASI questionnaire will evaluate symptom distress and core symptoms of patients at four separate time points.</description>
