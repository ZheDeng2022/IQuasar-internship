  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA), used&#xD;
      as a first-line diagnostic tool in women with stable chest pain and low risk for Coronary&#xD;
      Artery Disease (CAD), to reduce the number of women requiring more than one diagnostic test&#xD;
      to rule in or rule out CAD. Half of the participants will undergo CCTA as the first test to&#xD;
      investigate stable chest pain, while the other half will undergo any test ordered by their&#xD;
      family physician.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in women globally. Women are more&#xD;
      likely to present with atypical chest pain that may be difficult to diagnose using&#xD;
      traditional testing methods, resulting in over-investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has high negative predictive value for&#xD;
      exclusion of CAD in low to intermediate risk populations. We plan to investigate CCTA as a&#xD;
      first line test to exclude coronary artery disease as a cause of stable chest pain and&#xD;
      whether it is a cost effective strategy that reduces time to diagnosis, wait times to see&#xD;
      cardiologists, emergency department visits, downstream and repeat testing and radiation&#xD;
      exposure as compared to usual care with comparable patient safety and satisfaction level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another intervention being tested in this trial is the Cardiac Link pathway. This is a new&#xD;
      clinical program at Women's College Hospital that aims to expedite cardiology referral for&#xD;
      patients exhibiting clinically significant findings while undergoing CCTAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that with use of CCTA as the first test, the number of women who require only one&#xD;
      test (i.e. CCTA) to sort out whether or not CAD is responsible for their chest pain will&#xD;
      increase, thereby decreasing over-investigation of low risk women.&#xD;
