  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effectiveness of advanced PRF as compared to open flap debridement in treatment&#xD;
      of periodontal intraosseous defects in stage III periodontitis patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The application of platelet concentrates characterized by high concentrations of platelets&#xD;
      and growth factors have been applied and investigated as possible periodontal regenerative&#xD;
      therapy.The application of platelet rich fibrin in management of intraosseous and furcation&#xD;
      defects produce more favorable outcome compared to open flap debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A-PRF represents the latest generation of platelet concentrates that could provide sustained&#xD;
      and increased release of growth factors and could serve as an autologous cost-effective&#xD;
      membrane in periodontal tissue regeneration procedures&#xD;
