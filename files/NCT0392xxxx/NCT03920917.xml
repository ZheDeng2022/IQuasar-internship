  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryoballoon ablation is proven to be effective in pulmonary vein isolation in patients with&#xD;
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and it can reduce the procedure time compared to conventional&#xD;
      radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation. Recently, high-power short-duration RF ablation has&#xD;
      been known to reduce procedure time remarkably, and it can eliminate extra-pulmonary vein&#xD;
      foci, which cannot be treated by Cryoballoon ablation. The aim of this study is to compare&#xD;
      Cryoballoon ablation and high-power short-duration RF ablation in patients with paroxysmal&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation in terms of the efficacy and the safety in a prospective randomized&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

      A. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospective randomization (cryoballoon PV isolation group vs. Radiofrequency Pulmonary&#xD;
           Vein isolation and Additional Right Atrial linear ablation) (Using the Python program, a&#xD;
           random number module is imported with the import random syntax, and the random number&#xD;
           table for the two groups is created.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Target number of subjects: 330 (165 per group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rhythm FU : 2012 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines (Holter monitoring at the baseline, 3,6 month,&#xD;
           and thereafter every 6 months to 24 month, then 1 year; ECG if the patient has any&#xD;
           symptom)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anticoagulant therapy followed by 2014 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All complications in each group will be evaluated including the re-hospitalization rate,&#xD;
           major cardiovascular event, and mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Progress and rhythm/ECG follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To be performed in accordance with the 2012 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines for AF management&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow-up at 1 weeks, 3,6 months, and thereafter every 6-month after procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rhythm control at 3,6 months, and thereafter every 6-month follow-up with Holter&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If the patient complains of symptoms, ECG will be performed at any time, and rhythm&#xD;
           follow-up will be carried out with a Holter or event recorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Follow-up All the patients will be followed-up at 1 weeks, 3, 6 months, and thereafter&#xD;
      every 6 months. If the patient shows any symptom within the clinical study period, patient&#xD;
      will visit the outpatient clinic. ECG will be performed at every outpatient visits, and&#xD;
      24-hour Holter or event recording will be performed 3, 6 months, and thereafter every 6&#xD;
      months for 2 years, and every year after 2 years (2012 Heart Rhythm Society/EHRA/European&#xD;
      Cardiac Arrhythmia Society Expert Consensus Statement guidelines). If atrial fibrillation or&#xD;
      atrial tachycardia lasting more than 30 seconds is observed in 12-lead ECG or Holter, it will&#xD;
      be evaluated as recurrence. Recurrence within 3 months after the procedure will be classified&#xD;
      as early recurrence, and that after 3 months will be classified as clinical recurrence.&#xD;
