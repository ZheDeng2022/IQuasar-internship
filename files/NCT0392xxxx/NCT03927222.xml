      This single-arm phase II study will assess the impact of tetanus pre-conditioning and&#xD;
      adjuvant Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) on overall survival of&#xD;
      patients newly diagnosed with World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV glioblastoma who have&#xD;
      undergone definitive tumor resection, are cytomegalvirus (CMV) positive and unmethylated, and&#xD;
      completed standard temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation treatment. After completion of the&#xD;
      standard of care radiotherapy with concurrent TMZ, patients will receive 1 cycle of&#xD;
      dose-intensified TMZ followed by pp65-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccination beginning on day&#xD;
      23.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 64 patients with resected, newly-diagnosed WHO Grade IV glioma who are CMV&#xD;
      positive and in which the Methylguanine Methyltransferase (MGMT) is not methylated will be&#xD;
      accrued to this study before standard of care radiation therapy (RT) and concurrent TMZ, with&#xD;
      the goal of treating 48 patients with dose-intensified temozolomide and pp65 loaded dendritic&#xD;
      cell vaccine after completion of standard RT and TMZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will undergo a leukapheresis for the generation of DCs. Patients will&#xD;
      then receive approximately 6 weeks of the standard of care radiation therapy (RT) and&#xD;
      concurrent TMZ at a standard targeted dose of 75 mg/m2/day. For patients whose initial&#xD;
      leukapheresis yields less than 3 vaccines, repeat leukapheresis may be obtained. At the&#xD;
      post-RT clinic visit, a single post-RT cycle of dose-intensified TMZ (100 mg/m2/day for 21&#xD;
      days) will be given. On day 23 (± 2 days) of the cycle, patients will receive the first of 3&#xD;
      pp65 DC vaccines. Vaccines #1-3 will be given every two weeks (± 2 days). All patients will&#xD;
      receive up to a total of 10 DC vaccines, with vaccines administered every 35 days (± 7 days)&#xD;
      after the third vaccine, given bilaterally at the groin site unless progression occurs with&#xD;
      no further cycles of TMZ. DC vaccines will be given intradermally (i.d.) and divided equally&#xD;
      to both inguinal regions. Before the first DC vaccination, patients will receive 0.5 mL of Td&#xD;
      (tetanus and diphtheria toxoids adsorbed) intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle to ensure&#xD;
      adequate immunity to the tetanus antigen. Patients will undergo leukapheresis again for&#xD;
      immunologic monitoring with a specific assessment of baseline antigen-specific cellular and&#xD;
      humoral immune responses if needed for further DC generations 14 (± 2) days after vaccine #3.&#xD;
      Prior to pp65 DC vaccination #4,(3±1) weeks after leukapheresis 2, the vaccine site will&#xD;
      receive a pre-conditioning intradermal injection of Td. Up to 16 patients will receive&#xD;
      111-Indium labeled DCs at the 4th vaccine followed by SPECT/CT imaging immediately, and at 1&#xD;
      and 2 days after injections.&#xD;
