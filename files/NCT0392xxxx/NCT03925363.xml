    <textblock>
      A mobile application will be tested in elderly men and women that is randomized to an&#xD;
      application (blind-app) that registers physical activity or an application (feedback-app)&#xD;
      where participants in addition set goals for physical activity and gets feedback from the&#xD;
      application when these goals are achieved. Participants are randomized in permuted blocks of&#xD;
      10 to the blind-app or feedback-app. The primary outcome is increased physical activity.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, death, dementia, cancer, falls&#xD;
      and fractures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled study, it will be tested if a mobile application can increase&#xD;
      physical activity and reduce the risk of later non-communicable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants include individuals that previously have been included in a health survey&#xD;
      (Healthy aging initiative, NCT03312439), with a low registered physical activity. Low&#xD;
      physical is defined according to WHOs definition, i.e. at least 150 minutes of physical&#xD;
      activity per week. Individuals will diabetes will be investigated separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be excluded that cannot walk for exercise, or if they have diseases that&#xD;
      severely affects the ability to exercise. We will also seek participants from the general&#xD;
      population to be included with only two inclusion criteria; having a smart phone and at least&#xD;
      18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants the meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to an application that only&#xD;
      registers physical activity (blind-app) or an application where the participants will set&#xD;
      appropriate goals for physical activity and get proper feedback from the app when these goals&#xD;
      are reached (feedback-app). Both groups will have individualized information about proper&#xD;
      physical activity. Randomization will be made using sealed envelopes in permuted blocks of&#xD;
      10. Randomization will be stratified on year of birth and sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be increased physical activity after 6 months. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include cardiovascular disease, death, dementia, falls and fractures, diabetes, and improved&#xD;
      glucose control in those that already have diabetes. Secondary outcomes also include changes&#xD;
      in cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure, blood lipids and obesity. Interaction&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to investigate if the effects are different in men and women,&#xD;
      based on baseline physical activity and based on age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results from the previous health survey the individuals have participated in, a&#xD;
      power analyses has been conducted. The participants physical activity were registered using&#xD;
      accelerometers. The mean steps taken per week was 48000 with a standard deviation of 22000&#xD;
      steps. With assumption that the feedback-app will increase physical activity by at least 15%,&#xD;
      164 individuals would be needed in each group with an alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 80%.&#xD;
      For secondary outcome of cardiovascular disease or death, estimates were based on incidence&#xD;
      of these outcomes in 3617 individuals that participated in the health survey. During a mean&#xD;
      follow up time of 928 days, 221 participants was diagnosed with cardiovascular disease or&#xD;
      died during follow up, and 128 were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. If assuming that&#xD;
      the mobil-application will result in 15% lower risk of these two outcomes in those randomized&#xD;
      to the feedback-app, 597 and 1371 individuals would be needed in each group, respectively,&#xD;
      with the same follow up time. The effects during follow up will be monitored each year of&#xD;
      follow up through patient registers. Follow up time is scheduled to a maximum of 2 years. We&#xD;
      estimate that we then would need 895 and 2156 individuals in each group due to the shorter&#xD;
      follow up time compared to in the example above.&#xD;
