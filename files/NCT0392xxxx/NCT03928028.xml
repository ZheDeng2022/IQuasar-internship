  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa is a serious life-threatening illness with a typical age of onset in&#xD;
      adolescence; if not effectively treated, it has the potential to significantly impact&#xD;
      adolescent development and quality of life. Research on executive functioning in anorexia&#xD;
      nervosa indicates that it may be a viable target for intervention that could improve outcome.&#xD;
      The current project focuses on determining whether or not the investigators can improve&#xD;
      set-shifting in parents and affected adolescents in the hopes that improvements in&#xD;
      set-shifting will, ultimately, improve outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This application seeks support for a phased project. In the initial (R61) 2-year phase, the&#xD;
      investigators will establish that Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) can increase&#xD;
      set-shifting in parents of and/or adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). The second aim is&#xD;
      to determine the appropriate dose needed to achieve positive change in set-shifting.&#xD;
      Attaining this milestone would trigger support for three additional years (R33) to confirm&#xD;
      target engagement and appropriate dose. The investigators will also evaluate whether or not&#xD;
      adding CRT to Family Based Treatment (FBT) will improve outcome compared to FBT alone.&#xD;
      Set-shifting (a type of executive functioning often referred to as cognitive flexibility)&#xD;
      inefficiencies are hypothesized to be an endophenotype of AN and are, therefore, heritable.&#xD;
      Cognitive flexibility can be impacted negatively by situational factors such as malnutrition,&#xD;
      stress, and anxiety. It is likely that both adolescents (who are malnourished) and parents&#xD;
      (who are under stress) experience significant state-based reduction in their cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility during AN and its treatment. While cognitive flexibility can be increased through&#xD;
      CRT, there is a significant gap in the knowledge about how to apply CRT to the treatment of&#xD;
      adolescent AN, specifically concerning the most appropriate target for CRT: parents or&#xD;
      adolescents? The majority of research on CRT with adolescents with AN are pilot and&#xD;
      feasibility studies and target set-shifting in adolescents, not parents. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that targeting parents may be more impactful for adolescent outcome. First, the&#xD;
      investigators must determine if an increase set-shifting via CRT is possible. In the initial&#xD;
      R61 phase, the investigators propose to recruit and randomly assign 54 families who have a&#xD;
      child with AN to FBT, FBT with parent-focused CRT, or FBT with adolescent-focused CRT. Target&#xD;
      engagement will be assessed via neuro-psychological assessment and self-report of cognitive&#xD;
      and behavioral flexibility. If the investigators meet these proposed milestones in the R61&#xD;
      phase, they will proceed to the R33 phase. It is possible that one (N = 72 families) or both&#xD;
      (N = 93 families) CRT conditions will be examined in the R33 phase. The investigators will&#xD;
      confirm the findings from the R61 phase (target engagement and dose of CRT). The&#xD;
      investigators will also examine adolescent outcome in FBT alone versus FBT+(parent or&#xD;
      adolescent) CRT. They will gather preliminary data on putative moderators and/or mediators&#xD;
      across both phases in order to inform results. This phased R61/R33 application is innovative&#xD;
      in that it is the first to adapt CRT to parents only. Evidence supporting FBT+CRT to increase&#xD;
      set-shifting in parents/adolescents will inform future efforts to leverage understanding of&#xD;
      (heritable) neurobiology of AN in adolescents to improve outcome. Further, if CRT for parents&#xD;
      significantly improves set-shifting, the investigators can focus efforts on how best to&#xD;
      augment current treatments, support parents, and increase positive outcomes for the&#xD;
      adolescent and reduce relapse. Even negative results would inform understanding of&#xD;
      set-shifting inefficiencies as an endophenotype in AN, its measurement, and usefulness as a&#xD;
      target in treatment.&#xD;
