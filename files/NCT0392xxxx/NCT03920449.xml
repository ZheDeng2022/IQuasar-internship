  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that optimization of the dose of the Botulinum toxin injection (BT) and&#xD;
      standardization of the technique of lateral internal sphincterotomy to posterolateral&#xD;
      internal sphincterotomy (PIAS) could, in turn, report a conclusive result which helps to&#xD;
      provide better care to patients with chronic anal fissure. So, we will conduct this trial as&#xD;
      a prospective randomized, controlled, intervention, open-label trial with two parallel&#xD;
      groups, and a primary endpoint of fissure healing during 6 months after the initial&#xD;
      intervention, with the randomization, will be performed by an online software with a 1:1&#xD;
      allocation. Eligible patients will be randomized in equal proportions between BT injection&#xD;
      and PIAS.&#xD;

      2.1 Trial design This trial will be designed as a prospective randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      intervention, open label trial with two parallel groups, and a primary endpoint of fissure&#xD;
      healing during 6 months after initial intervention, with the randomization will be performed&#xD;
      by an online software with a 1:1 allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Pre-enrollment After careful history and clinical examination, the diagnosis of chronic&#xD;
      anal fissure will be considered when a wider and deeper ulcer with keratinous edges, presence&#xD;
      of a sentinel tag at the external apex, hypertrophy of the anal papillae, and exposed&#xD;
      internal anal sphincter (IAS) smooth muscle fibers, will be exist. As a routine in Mansoura&#xD;
      colorectal surgery unit, any patient above 50 years old will be scheduled for colonoscopy to&#xD;
      rule out colorectal cancer, as well as, those associated with bleeding per rectum or other&#xD;
      risk factors. Additionally, patients will be evaluated for constipation by preoperative and&#xD;
      6th-months postoperative Wexner Constipation Score and for their continence status by&#xD;
      preoperative and 6th-months postoperative Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI) and&#xD;
      Anorectal Manometry. Preoperative mechanical bowel preparation will not be indicated,&#xD;
      however, single enema in the day of the procedure will be advised in order to facilitate&#xD;
      examination under anesthesia (EUA) which is a mandatory initial step in all begin anorectal&#xD;
      procedures in our unit. Appropriated thromboembolic prophylaxis will be prescribed based on&#xD;
      the patient risk stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Interventions Eligible patients will be randomized in equal proportions between Botulinum&#xD;
      Toxin (BT) injection and Posterolateral Internal Anal Sphincterotomy (PIAS). All procedures&#xD;
      will be performed under spinal anesthesia with the patient in modified lithotomy position by&#xD;
      senior consultant colorectal surgeons or under their direct supervision. At the time of the&#xD;
      anesthesia induction, 500 mg metronidazole will be administrated. All procedures will be&#xD;
      preceded by gentle anal dilatation, insertion of an anal retractor, and EUA. Subsequently,&#xD;
      the surgeon will proceed to the allocated intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group I (BT injection), 21 U will be injected in 3 divided doses through the internal anal&#xD;
      sphincter at 3,9, and 12 o'clock. In the Egyptian market two commercial forms are available;&#xD;
      botulinum toxin type A (Botox 100 IU/vial; Coolock, Dublin, Ireland), and abobotulinumtoxin A&#xD;
      (Dysport 500 U/vial; Ipsen Biopharm Ltd, Wrexham, UK). In case of Dysport it should be&#xD;
      remembered that dosing is on a ratio of approximately 1 to 3, meaning that 50 IU of Botox&#xD;
      have the same effect as 150 IU of Dysport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group II (PIAS), A 1.5 to 2-cm circumferential skin incision will be placed at 5 o'clock&#xD;
      position outside the anal verge using an electrocautery device. Dissection will be proceeded&#xD;
      through the intersphincteric groove to separate both IAS and external anal sphincter (EAS).&#xD;
      Then, the IAS will be identified by its characteristic white fibers, separated from the anal&#xD;
      mucosa, and assessed under direct vision. Subsequently, about 50 % of the IAS will be divided&#xD;
      at 5 o'clock position and any skin tags or hypertrophied anal papillae will be removed&#xD;
      leaving the skin incision open to allow drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, the procedure will be followed by application of direct pressure for 5&#xD;
      minutes. The fissure will not be curetted or debrided in any way. All patients will be&#xD;
      discharged on the 1st postoperative day with recommendations to use stool softener, bulking&#xD;
      agents, a high-residue diet, and warm sitz baths for three weeks to reduce pain and avoid&#xD;
      constipation and bleeding. On demand analgesics in form oral ketorolac 10 mg will be&#xD;
      permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Patient's follow-up For the end-points of the study, all patients will be followed-up in&#xD;
      the outpatients' department for a period of six months. The follow-up schedule will be as&#xD;
      follow, at every week for the first month, then at the end of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th&#xD;
      months. However, patients will be advised to visit the outpatients' department at any other&#xD;
      time point during the trial if they developed any unfavorable event. At each visit, the ulcer&#xD;
      will be inspected visually with the percent of re-epithelization will be measured&#xD;
      subjectively. The resolution of initial symptoms, anal pain and/or bleeding will be&#xD;
      addressed. The pain will be measured at each visit by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranged&#xD;
      from no pain &quot;0&quot; to worst pain &quot;10&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7 Sample Size Calculation Based on a power analysis and sample size calculation, the&#xD;
      desired sample size for this study will be 25 for each group of intervention. Given an&#xD;
      expected medium effect size of 0.5 and p &lt;0.05, this will lead to the acceptable power of&#xD;
      0.80. In order to compensate for drop-out and losses to follow-up, 30 patients will be&#xD;
      initially included. The sample size will be calculated using an online software&#xD;
      (http://clincalc.com/stats/samplesize.aspx) with the healing rate using BT injection will be&#xD;
      considered 71.4% according to Sahebally et al (6) and the healing rate for PIAS will be&#xD;
      considered 99% according to Alawady et al (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.8 Randomization; sequence, generation, allocation, and implementation All participants who&#xD;
      will give consent for participation and who will fulfil the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either BT injection and PIAS with a 1:1 allocation as per an online&#xD;
      software (https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize2/) generated randomization schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be requested by a staff member who will not take any part in patients'&#xD;
      care, follow-up, data collection/analysis or accessing outcomes of the study. In return, this&#xD;
      staff member will schedule an answer form with a randomization plan which will be formed of 2&#xD;
      sets; each set will contain unique 30 numbers arranged from the smallest to the largest with&#xD;
      the whole 60 numbers ranging from 1 up to 60. Each set labeled with one of group allocation;&#xD;
      BT injection or PIAS. Then, the staff member will be interpreting this form into 60 sealed&#xD;
      envelopes with the patients' number written upon it and the allocated procedure inside and&#xD;
      send these sealed envelopes the department's senior resident. On the day of the procedure,&#xD;
      the sealed envelope will be opened 2.9 Blinding This study will be open label unblinded&#xD;
      clinical trial in which patients and surgeons will be aware of the nature of the procedure,&#xD;
      however, data collectors, those assessing the outcomes, and data analyzer will all be blinded&#xD;
      to the allocation until the end of the trial.&#xD;
