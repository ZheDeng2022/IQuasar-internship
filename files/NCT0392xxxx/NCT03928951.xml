  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary infections are at the origin of many emergency department consultations and&#xD;
      antibiotic prescriptions. Increase of bacteria resistance to antibiotics is promoted by an&#xD;
      inappropriate use of those antibiotics but initial prescription in emergency departments is&#xD;
      complicated by brief clinical examinations, unavailable sampling results and risks of&#xD;
      multi-resistant bacteria. Large diffusion of new recommendations for urinary infection&#xD;
      management should improve the quality of initial antibiotic prescription. However emergency&#xD;
      physicians have no knowledge of the reassessment of antibiotherapy 48 to 72 hours after&#xD;
      initial prescription by general practitioners which is a quality criterion of good antibiotic&#xD;
      use. The main purpose of this study is to estimate the reassessment rate by general&#xD;
      practitioners of the urinary infection antibiotherapies prescribed in emergency departments.&#xD;
      This will allow assessing the quality of initial antibiotic prescription and help to improve&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients will be informed during their consultation in one of Toulon - La Seyne sur Mer&#xD;
      hospital emergency departments. If they don't express opposition to their data collection,&#xD;
      they will be included. A form will then be completed by emergency physicians with initial&#xD;
      prescribed antibiotherapy, patients' general practitioners contact information and if&#xD;
      patients have a shared medical file or not. 4 to 5 days later, patients' general&#xD;
      practitioners will be contacted to know if urinary analysis results were transferred from&#xD;
      emergency department to practitioners, if antibiotherapy was modified and if patients' shared&#xD;
      medical file was consulted.&#xD;
