  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial on primary anterior teeth of 3-5&#xD;
      year-old patients suffering from white spot lesions (ICDAS system II scores 1-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty four teeth will be divided into two groups where Group 1 (n=22 teeth) will receive&#xD;
      Self-Assembling Peptide P11-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (n=22 teeth) will receive Topical Fluoride Varnish Application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment will be done at baseline using the International Caries Detection and Assessment&#xD;
      System II (ICDAS II) scoring system and Light Induced Fluorescence using Soprolife System&#xD;
      (Acteon, La Ciotat, France) and then after 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. The assessment of&#xD;
      the baseline and follow up data will be performed by the main investigator.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients aged 3-5 years with 44 teeth affected by white spot lesions (WSL) on their primary&#xD;
      anterior teeth (ICDAS II scores 1-2) will be selected by simple random sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 1 tooth and a maximum of 12 teeth affected by WSL in each patient can be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects whose parents are willing and able to maintain good oral hygiene for their children&#xD;
      and attend study visits.Subjects not on medication affecting their salivary flow and&#xD;
      medically free (ASA class I).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All participating patients' parents will sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will receive oral information on oral health education on how to maintain a&#xD;
           proper oral hygiene and proper diet consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. They will be given manual tooth brushes and non-fluoridated tooth pastes to use during&#xD;
           the study. The tooth brushes will be replaced every 3 months and the tooth pastes will&#xD;
           be replaced whenever they are empty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) Every patient will receive prophylaxis (polishing) using non-fluoridated prophylaxis paste&#xD;
      prior to the commencement of treatment to avoid possible confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) Then each patient will be assigned to one of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Self Assembling Peptides P11-4 (SAP Curodont Repair, Credentis, Windisch,&#xD;
      Switzerland) 1) Twenty two teeth will receive treatment by self-assembling peptides P11-4 at&#xD;
      baseline and will be followed up at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year using the above-mentioned&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Topical Fluoride Varnish (Duraphat Varnish containing 22,600ppm fluoride,&#xD;
      Colgate-Palmolive, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Twenty two teeth will receive treatment by topical fluoride varnish at Day 0 and will be&#xD;
      followed up after 3 months, 6 months and 1 year using the above-mentioned measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of the baseline and follow up data will be performed by the main investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment will be done at baseline using the ICDAS II and Light Induced Fluorescence using&#xD;
      Soprolife System (Acteon, La Ciotat, France) and then at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.&#xD;

    <description>Self-Assembling Peptide P11-4 promotes subsurface biomimetic remineralization of enamel. It is a small peptide comprising 11 amino acids that when applied to an initial carious lesion diffuses into the body of the lesion, re-assembles itself into fibrils forming larger fibers and hence a 3-dimensional (3-D) matrix is formed. Natural remineralization driven by saliva is promoted through the surface of the P11-4 by increasing the surface area for calcium phosphate deposition. As a result, mineralization of the subsurface lesion occurs possibly due to the formation of de novo hydroxyapatite crystals on the surface of the P11-4 fibers.</description>
