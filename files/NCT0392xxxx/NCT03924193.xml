      Brief Summary: This study will compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (CBT), lisdexamfetamine (LDX), and the combination of CBT and LDX for the treatment of&#xD;
      binge-eating disorder in patients with obesity. This is an acute treatment comparing CBT or&#xD;
      LDX alone or in combination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a heterogeneous problem and research has highlighted the particular significance&#xD;
      of a subgroup with binge-eating disorder (BED), the most prevalent formal eating disorder.&#xD;
      This study examined the effectiveness of two leading but distinct treatments -&#xD;
      lisdexamfetamine (LDX) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) - alone and in combination, for&#xD;
      BED in patients with obesity. LDX is the first and only FDA-approved medication for the&#xD;
      treatment of BED and has demonstrated short-term effectiveness relative to placebo. CBT is&#xD;
      the best-established psychological treatment, has demonstrated short-term effectiveness and&#xD;
      &quot;treatment specificity&quot; (i.e., superiority to a variety of control and active treatments),&#xD;
      has shown longer-term superiority to fluoxetine, and longer-term durability of outcomes.&#xD;
      N=180 participants with BED and obesity will be randomly assigned to one of three&#xD;
      interventions, CBT alone, LDX alone, or CBT combined with LDX. This RCT will provide new&#xD;
      findings regarding the relative effectiveness of LDX, CBT, and combined CBT+LDX for patients&#xD;
      with obesity and BED. No such study has been performed.&#xD;
