  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the Singapore population, being the 2nd most&#xD;
      commonly diagnosed cancer amongst males and 3rd most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst&#xD;
      females. Pulmonologists, oncologists and thoracic surgeons are often consulted for the&#xD;
      evaluation of imaging-identified pulmonary nodules. These may have been identified either&#xD;
      incidentally or through screening. The majority of these are indeterminate and definitive&#xD;
      investigation with biopsy or resection is invasive and not without risk. Hence, current&#xD;
      consensus guidelines adopt a largely expectant strategy in the management of these&#xD;
      indeterminate pulmonary nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is substantial evidence that lung cancer in Asians may be unique with multiple driver&#xD;
      mutations, lower age of presentation and may be independent of tobacco exposure. In addition,&#xD;
      there are guidelines that recommend that the management of lung nodules in Asia should&#xD;
      account for these differences. However, the evidence for alternative recommendations is&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study will be to identify radiological and clinical predictors that can&#xD;
      improve the diagnosis of lung nodules. These predictors may help build a model for lung&#xD;
      nodule evaluation and surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective database of subjects meeting all of the following inclusion criteria to&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the Singapore population, being the 2nd&#xD;
           most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst males and 3rd most commonly diagnosed cancer&#xD;
           amongst females. Pulmonologists, oncologists and thoracic surgeons are often consulted&#xD;
           for the evaluation of imaging-identified pulmonary nodules. These may have been&#xD;
           identified either incidentally or through screening. The majority of these are&#xD;
           indeterminate and definitive investigation with biopsy or resection is invasive and not&#xD;
           without risk. Hence, current consensus guidelines adopt a largely expectant strategy in&#xD;
           the management of these indeterminate pulmonary nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is substantial evidence that lung cancer in Asians may be unique with multiple&#xD;
           driver mutations, lower age of presentation and may be independent of tobacco exposure.&#xD;
           In addition, there are guidelines that recommend that the management of lung nodules in&#xD;
           Asia should account for these differences. However, the evidence for alternative&#xD;
           recommendations is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the study will be to identify radiological and clinical predictors that can&#xD;
           improve the diagnosis of lung nodules. These predictors may help build a model for lung&#xD;
           nodule evaluation and surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. EXPECTED RISKS AND BENEFITS&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are likely to be no benefits to subjects. They will not be subject to any novel&#xD;
           therapy and their clinical/radiological data will only be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risks are minimal because patients are subject to only standard diagnostic work-up and&#xD;
           existing clinical data collected. There will be no new additional interventions,&#xD;
           consultations or hospital visits. They will be asked to complete validated quality of&#xD;
           life surveys that will be included into the clinical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1. List the number and nature of subjects to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will only be enrolled from those who present to Singapore General Hospital,&#xD;
           National Cancer Centre, National Heart Centre, Changi General Hospital and Sengkang&#xD;
           General Hospital (either in an ambulatory or inpatient setting). There is no exclusion&#xD;
           of women or minorities. Children are excluded because lung nodule detection in them is&#xD;
           rare and the pathological processes, as well as clinical considerations are different.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2. Criteria for Recruitment and Recruitment Process&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be recruited if they already have radiographic evidence of a lung nodule.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3. Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subject must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to participate in this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;

                underlying aetiology&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Age &gt; 21 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Ability to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
