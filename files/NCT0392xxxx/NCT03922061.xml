  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polio is a serious disease that can cause paralysis and death. It is caused by a virus and&#xD;
      can be prevented by vaccine. The World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Polio Eradication&#xD;
      Initiative is trying to get rid of all polio disease around the world. Researchers want to&#xD;
      help by testing a new vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many countries, people are vaccinated with oral polio vaccine (OPV) given by mouth during&#xD;
      childhood. OPV is good at giving immunity (protection from polio) in the body and the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Immunity in the GI tract is called mucosal immunity. The&#xD;
      downsides of using OPV are that it can be shed into the environment in people's feces after&#xD;
      vaccination where it can infect people who are not vaccinated, and it can cause paralysis in&#xD;
      2-4 of every one million children vaccinated with OPV. The United States (U.S.) stopped&#xD;
      giving any OPV to people for vaccinations in the 1990's. Since then, a polio vaccine called&#xD;
      inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is given as an injection for routine childhood immunizations&#xD;
      in the U.S. You cannot get polio infection from IPV and it will not be shed into the&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, the WHO started a plan to help other countries gradually get rid of OPV. The&#xD;
      downside of using IPV by itself is that, unlike OPV, it doesn't give enough mucosal immunity&#xD;
      to protect people living in places where there is still polio. There are also supply&#xD;
      shortages of IPV, which is a problem if there are outbreaks of polio. For the supply of IPV&#xD;
      to help more people, it is safe and effective to use a tiny dose of IPV injected under the&#xD;
      top layer of skin (intradermal or ID injection) rather than getting the full dose in the&#xD;
      muscle. This is called a fractional dose of IPV, or fIPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help stop using OPV globally, a better fIPV vaccine is needed. fIPV vaccine needs a&#xD;
      substance to help stimulate a mucosal immune response. dmLT is a substance that has been&#xD;
      shown to stimulate a mucosal immune response. It has been shown to be safe and effective in&#xD;
      both humans and animals, both by itself and when given with other vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test a mixture of fIPV-dmLT given intradermally (under the outer layer of the&#xD;
      skin). This is the first study done in humans to give this combination intradermally. The IPV&#xD;
      vaccine has already been approved by the FDA. The fIPV-dmLT vaccine has not been approved by&#xD;
      the FDA.&#xD;

      This single site study conducted at The University of Vermont will enroll 30 healthy male and&#xD;
      female adult volunteers aged 18-45 years with no history of oral polio vaccination for a&#xD;
      Phase I randomized controlled double-blind trial evaluating the safety, reactogenicity and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a single dose of fIPV-dMLT versus a single dose of fIPV administered&#xD;
      intradermally. Study volunteers will be screened with eligible volunteers enrolled who will&#xD;
      randomized to receive a single dose of fIPV-dmLT or fIPV (2:1) on study day 0. The primary&#xD;
      study objective is to determine the safety and reactogenicity of a single dose of adjuvanted&#xD;
      fIPV-dmLT vaccine in healthy adults, as assessed by the frequency of systemic and local&#xD;
      injection site adverse reactions (ARs) defined as vaccine-related adverse events (AEs),&#xD;
      graded by severity, occurring within 28 days of dosing. Secondary objectives are to determine&#xD;
      the safety of a single dose of adjuvanted fIPV-dmLT vaccine in healthy adults, as assessed by&#xD;
      the percentage of subjects with at least one vaccine-related serious adverse event (SAE)&#xD;
      occurring within 28 days of dosing. In addition, the systemic immune response to a single&#xD;
      dose of vaccine in healthy adults, as assessed by poliovirus-specific serum neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody responses in fIPV-dmLT recipients versus fIPV only recipients will be examined.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult male or female age 18-45 years, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Signed informed consent form prior to initiation of any study activity&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Good general health as determined by review of medical history and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Agrees to complete all study visits and procedures for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Receipt of childhood vaccine series of Inactivated Polio Vaccine with verification of&#xD;
             immunization record. American College of Immunization Practices (AICP) required that&#xD;
             OPV use be discontinued by January 2000. Therefore, polio vaccines given after January&#xD;
             2000 in the U.S. are known to be IPV. If the documentation is unclear of the type of&#xD;
             polio vaccine given between 1998 and 2000, additional confirmation of the type should&#xD;
             be attempted to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Agrees to storage of specimens for future research&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females of child bearing potential only: willing to use effective contraception from&#xD;
             the following reliable methods through the first 28 days of the study: hormonal birth&#xD;
             control, condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, surgical sterilization,&#xD;
             and intrauterine device. All female subjects will be considered as having childbearing&#xD;
             potential except for those who have had a hysterectomy or tubal ligation or have no&#xD;
             internal female organs. Transgender men who have internal female organs will be&#xD;
             considered of childbearing potential and should be willing to use effective&#xD;
             contraception during the trial. Exception: females who have sex with females&#xD;
             (exclusively) and have no intention of conceiving a child during the study will not be&#xD;
             required to use contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of receipt of any oral polio vaccine. Subjects will be required to present&#xD;
             their childhood immunization record during the screening process. Subjects will be&#xD;
             excluded if the immunization record indicates receipt of any dose of oral polio&#xD;
             vaccine or if only 'polio vaccine' is listed on the record without specifying whether&#xD;
             oral or inactivated polio vaccine was administered.&#xD;

             administration of IP&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of antimicrobial treatment in the 2 weeks before administration of IP&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Receipt of a live vaccine within 28 days or a killed vaccine within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             inoculation, or anticipated receipt of any vaccine during the 28 days following&#xD;
             inoculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis&#xD;
