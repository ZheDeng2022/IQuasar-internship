  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human brain is an insulin sensitive organ. Brain insulin action modulates peripheral&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity in young lean men. As a underlying mechanism, the investigators&#xD;
      previously detected suppression of endogenous glucose production and stimulation of glucose&#xD;
      disappearance to peripheral tissue in response to brain insulin delivery by nasal spray.&#xD;
      Whether this holds true in young woman is unknown, since differences in brain insulin&#xD;
      response between sexes have been reported. The investigators will address this question by&#xD;
      combining the delivery of insulin to the brain as nasal spray with hyperinsulinemic&#xD;
      euglycemic clamp experiments in natural cycling women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the planned randomized, placebo controlled cross-over study, female participants will&#xD;
      undergo four hyperinsulinemic euglycemic experiments with tracer dilution, two in the first&#xD;
      phase and two in the second phase of their menstrual cycle. On one of the study days per&#xD;
      menstrual phase, subjects will receive intranasal insulin administration, on the other&#xD;
      placebo spray. The protocol has been successfully applied previously in men. Based on the&#xD;
      results of this trial, the investigators calculated a required sample size of N=10 for the&#xD;
      planned study in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These experiments will help to better understand the role of brain insulin action in a&#xD;
      broader sense. The results can be the basis for larger clinical trials that address the&#xD;
      sex-specific impact of brain insulin resistance for glucose metabolism and diabetes risk.&#xD;
