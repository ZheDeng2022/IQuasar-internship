      Introduction Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (DD) is a clinical entity that remains&#xD;
      poorly understood and identified in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. In general, it is&#xD;
      a syndrome defined by the presence of symptoms of congestive heart failure without sign of&#xD;
      reduced left ventricle systolic dysfunction. Distinguishing diastolic heart failure from&#xD;
      systolic heart failure is important because of differences in treatment and prognosis, even&#xD;
      if often the two entities coexist, and some authors have proposed the hypothesis that&#xD;
      diastolic LV dysfunction is essentially a precursor of systolic failure. At the base on DD&#xD;
      there are multiple causes and multiple disorders. Among these, the impaired relaxation&#xD;
      (common in ischemia and during systemic inflammatory states), an impaired peak left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) filling rate (with inadequate trans-mitral pressure gradient due to raised&#xD;
      LV pressure or inability to generate negative LV pressure), the stiffness of LV (fibrosis and&#xD;
      hypertrophy), and constriction (pericardial or compression from dilated right ventricle).&#xD;
      Diastolic LV dysfunction is common in the ICU but often unrecognized. Its knowledge and&#xD;
      determination of its severity may be useful to optimize circulatory support in critically ill&#xD;
      patients. From this point of view, echocardiography is one of the most powerful diagnostic&#xD;
      and monitoring tools available, providing the means to diagnose cardiac systolic or diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, its underlying cause, and suggest therapeutic interventions. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to describe the presence and the grade of the eventually left diastolic dysfunction&#xD;
      in ARDS patients and its possible correlation with the severity of illness and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions and pathophysiology Diastolic heart failure is defined as a condition caused by&#xD;
      increased resistance to the filling of one or both ventricles; this leads to symptoms of&#xD;
      congestion from the inappropriate upward shift of the diastolic pressure-volume relation.&#xD;
      Although this definition describes the principal pathophysiologic mechanism of diastolic&#xD;
      heart failure, it is not clinically applicable. In a more practical definition diastolic&#xD;
      heart failure is a condition that includes classic congestive heart failure findings with&#xD;
      normal systolic function at rest, but with alteration in diastolic function. During DD the&#xD;
      combination of active relaxation and passive myocardial compliance that normally maintain an&#xD;
      adequate cardiac output are altered and left atrial pressure should be increased to maintain&#xD;
      a satisfactory cardiac output. Different parameters have been used over the past two decades&#xD;
      to describe the DD, so it is difficult to define its real incidence in critically ill&#xD;
      patients. It seems to occur in about 30% of cases, and the majority of the studies tend to&#xD;
      relate it with concomitant syndrome such as sepsis or clinical conditions such as respiratory&#xD;
      weaning failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left Diastolic dysfunction in ICU Most of the literature available investigated left DD in&#xD;
      septic patient, and even if in the majority of these studies the patients were mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated, only few information are available about the role of mechanical ventilation (MV)&#xD;
      or the acute phase of lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With The advent of tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) has simplified echocardiographic estimation&#xD;
      of ventricular relaxation and ventricular filling pressures, and the increasing number of&#xD;
      studies in the field have showed that diastolic dysfunction is common in critically ill&#xD;
      patients. The significance of diastolic dysfunction was recently highlighted by studies that&#xD;
      demonstrated that TDI parameters might be prognostically useful in ICU population. More&#xD;
      recent observations may help to clarify the scenario in these terms. An alteration in the&#xD;
      E/e' ratio has been described in patients with septic shock and, although one study found&#xD;
      that the E/e' ratio is an independent predictor of mortality [20], another investigation&#xD;
      failed to find this association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left diastolic dysfunction in mechanical ventilated and ARDS patients It is well known that&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation can induce hemodynamic compromise and that myocardial dysfunction and&#xD;
      its consequences are not properly reflected by conventional hemodynamic parameters.&#xD;
      Myocardial function can be assessed at the bedside using transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;
      (TTE); however, the 2D echocardiographic measurements have been used to investigate&#xD;
      predominantly the effects on systolic rather than diastolic ventricular function. Recently,&#xD;
      TDI has provided more load-independent parameters to assess cardiac function, but its use is&#xD;
      not widespread in ICU. For these reasons and probably because DD is greatly underestimated,&#xD;
      there are few paper focused on mechanical ventilation and DD, most of them during weaning&#xD;
      period, and almost none during the acute phase. What we know is that positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation can affect preload, afterload and ventricular compliance. The net effect in most&#xD;
      situations is a decrease in cardiac output. However, the effect may be beneficial in the&#xD;
      context of decompensated heart failure, where the decreased preload and afterload result in a&#xD;
      return to a more productive part of the Starling curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More it is known in patients with prolonged weaning time. In this scenario, isolated&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction is present in about 22% up to 39% of patients. The increase in preload&#xD;
      and afterload during MV may impair the LV compliance and determine a pulmonary edema. The&#xD;
      fall in LV pressure during relaxation phase is a key determinant of diastolic function, and&#xD;
      depends on intrinsic (contractility, LV stiffness) and extrinsic (preload, afterload)&#xD;
      factors. Recently, has been suggested how the LV relaxation impairment with increased filling&#xD;
      pressures may be a key mechanism of failed prolonged weaning trials. To summarize all these&#xD;
      evidence, we could state that the elimination of positive ventilation increases LV preload&#xD;
      and afterload and may induce some physiologic changes that can determine tachycardia and&#xD;
      hypertension. Those are coincidentally two major determinants of diastolic dysfunction, as&#xD;
      higher heart frequency reduces diastolic filling time and/or decreases coronary perfusion,&#xD;
      and hypertension can exacerbate heart failure in patients with preserved ejection fraction.&#xD;
      These findings suggest that echocardiography could be an excellent tool to guide the weaning&#xD;
      process, helping to decide the best therapy to accomplish it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Consecutive mechanically ventilated patients will be enrolled within 48 hours after&#xD;
      ICU admission with the diagnosis of ARDS. Demographic characteristics and respiratory&#xD;
      mechanics variables (including esophageal pressure) will be recorded at two levels of&#xD;
      positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP); all patients will be study by a CT analysis at two&#xD;
      levels of PEEP (5-45 cmh20) for the evaluation of recruitment potential, together with the&#xD;
      computation of functional residual capacity (FRC). A well-trained cardiologist will perform a&#xD;
      completed transthoracic echocardiography with the aim to describe the presence and the grade&#xD;
      of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) applying a simplified definition of left DD,&#xD;
      based on septal e', which is considered to be an index of myocardial relaxation, and the&#xD;
      ratio of early diastolic velocity of mitral inflow to mitral annular velocity (E/e'), which&#xD;
      has a strong association with left atrial pressure.&#xD;
