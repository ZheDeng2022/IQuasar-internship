  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore safety, tolerability, including the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose, and antitumor activity of NMS-03592088 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I/II, first-in-human, multi-center clinical study in sequential&#xD;
      cohorts of patients with relapsed or refractory AML or CMML who have exhausted standard&#xD;
      treatment options or for whom standard therapy is considered unsuitable. The study is&#xD;
      designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD) and to explore anticancer activity of NMS-03592088, a FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3),&#xD;
      KIT (v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ) and CSF1R (Colony&#xD;
      stimulating factor-1 receptor) inhibitor. The study drug will be administered orally once&#xD;
      daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days of rest (each cycle is 28 days, schedule A)&#xD;
      or once daily for 28 consecutive days (each cycle is 28 days, schedule B). The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in two parts: a Phase I dose escalation and dose expansion part including patients&#xD;
      with AML and CMML and a single-stage Phase II exploratory study comprising two parallel&#xD;
      cohorts of selected patients that are more likely to respond to the drug: a cohort of AML&#xD;
      FLT3 mutated patients and a second one of patients with CMML. Patients previously treated&#xD;
      with FLT3 inhibitors are allowed to participate.&#xD;

    <measure>Phase I - Number of Participants with drug related first-cycle dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Between the date of the first dose administration in Cycle 1 and the date of the first dose administration in Cycle 2 which is expected to be 28 days or up to 42 days in case of dose delay.</time_frame>
    <description>DLT is defined as any grade ≥3 non-hematologic toxicity occurring in the first cycle of treatment for which the relationship to NMS-03592088 cannot be definitely excluded, with the exception of:&#xD;
alopecia, anorexia, fatigue;&#xD;
grade 3 infection and fever with neutropenia;&#xD;
grade 3 diarrhea or nausea that did not require tube-feeding or total parenteral nutrition, or diarrhea that could be managed to grade 2 or better with standard drugs.&#xD;
Hematological adverse events will not be considered as DLTs. However, prolonged myelosuppresion defined as Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC &lt;500 mm3) after 2-week delay (i.e., 21 days off therapy) in the absence of evidence of active leukemia in the bone marrow or peripheral blood are considered as a DLT. DLTs are classified according to CTCAE version 5.0.</description>

    <description>Safety will be assessed by AEs, which included abnormalities identified during a medical test (e.g. laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, etc.) if the abnormality induces clinical signs or symptoms, needs active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of the study drug or is medically significant. A treatment-emergent AE is defined as abn AE observed after starting administration of the study drug up to 28 days after last dose of study medication intake. AEs will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and graded according to the The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0</description>

Participants who died without report of relapse will be considered non-events and censored at their last relapse-free disease assessment date. Other participants who will not relapse on study will be considered non-events and censored at the last relapse-free assessment date.
