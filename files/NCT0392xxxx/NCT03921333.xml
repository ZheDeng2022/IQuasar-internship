  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an enormous increase in diabetes mellitus worldwide, especially in developed&#xD;
      countries. Ninety percent of diabetes cases worldwide are of Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM)&#xD;
      as a result of greater prevalence of sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet and rise of obesity,&#xD;
      as well as an increasing number of elderly populations. T2DM can be attributed to relative&#xD;
      deficiency of insulin involving insulin resistance, aberrant synthesis of hepatic glucose and&#xD;
      progressive deterioration of pancreatic beta-cell functions resulting in chronic&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia. A growing amount of evidence has emerged in the last several years linking&#xD;
      various nutrients and food sources with a positive management of T2DM. In in vitro studies,&#xD;
      various botanical extracts have been found to significantly inhibit the activity of&#xD;
      alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase. The inhibition of these enzymes' activity is a rational&#xD;
      approach in managing glucose level for borderline and T2DM sufferers as inhibition of both&#xD;
      alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activity can profoundly reduce post-prandial increase in&#xD;
      blood plasma glucose concentration following a mixed carbohydrate intake. Excessive levels of&#xD;
      blood plasma glucose and free fatty acids impose a stressful condition for pancreatic&#xD;
      beta-cells and other insulin sensitive cells resulting in the local secretion of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines causing a continuous low levels of abnormal&#xD;
      inflammation that alter insulin's action. As the body becomes less sensitive to insulin, the&#xD;
      resulting insulin resistance leads to further inflammation, with more inflammation causing&#xD;
      more insulin resistance, causing blood plasma sugar levels to continuously increase,&#xD;
      eventually resulting in T2DM. In in vitro animal models, various compounds of botanical&#xD;
      origin have also been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activities which can be beneficial&#xD;
      in managing T2DM.&#xD;
