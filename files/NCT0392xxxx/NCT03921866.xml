  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer (BC) represents the largest therapeutic subtype&#xD;
      of the disease, accounting for 60 to 65% of all malignant neoplasms of the breast.&#xD;
      Palbociclib (Ibrance®) is a small-molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6&#xD;
      (CDK4/6) which in clinical trial settings has been shown to increase progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) for patients with HR+, human epidermal growth factor 2-negative (HER2-)&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Palbociclib first received a European Union (EU) marketing&#xD;
      authorisation in September 2016, to be commercialised as Ibrance® by Pfizer. Palbociclib was&#xD;
      recommended for use with an aromatase inhibitor in patients with HR+/HER2- locally advanced&#xD;
      and MBC in the National Health Service (NHS) in England by the National Institute for Health&#xD;
      and Care Excellence (NICE) in November 2017 and by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) in&#xD;
      December 2017. In order to provide access to palbociclib in the United Kingdom (UK) during&#xD;
      the NICE/SMC appraisal period, the Ibrance® Patient Program (IPP) was initiated and run by&#xD;
      Pfizer between April 2017 until a positive NICE/SMC appraisal in November 2017 (for England&#xD;
      and Wales) or December 2017 (for Scotland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pfizer are interested in the opportunity to collect data from patients who received&#xD;
      palbociclib as part of the UK IPP, to better understand patients' characteristics in a&#xD;
      routine care setting, treatment persistence and dose management, clinical outcomes, and&#xD;
      healthcare resource utilisation. This study will provide real-world evidence on patients'&#xD;
      clinical progression and experience of treatment with palbociclib in routine clinical&#xD;
      settings in a UK context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the real-world treatment patterns, patients' characteristics, clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      healthcare resource utilisation associated with palbociclib treatment in the 3 years&#xD;
      following initiation in United Kingdom patients with HR+/HER2- MBC treated as part of the&#xD;
      IPP?&#xD;
