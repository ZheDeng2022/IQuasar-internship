  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of GSK525762C (molibresib besylate)&#xD;
      and entinostat in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphomas that have spread to other&#xD;
      parts of the body (advanced) or are not responding to treatment (refractory). GSK525762C and&#xD;
      entinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. This study may help doctors find out if giving the combination of GSK525762C and&#xD;
      entinostat is better or worse than the usual approach for treating solid tumors or lymphomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GSK525762C and entinostat in combination&#xD;
      in patients with advanced and refractory solid tumors and lymphomas based on dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs) of the combination of GSK525762C and entinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the safety profile of GSK525762C and entinostat in advanced and refractory&#xD;
      solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of GSK525762C and entinostat in advanced and&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) of GSK525762C and entinostat in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect of GSK525762C and entinostat therapy on apoptosis, as measured by an&#xD;
      apoptosis multiplex immunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the effect of GSK525762C and entinostat therapy on c-MYC and YAP1 as measured&#xD;
      by ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the effect of GSK525762C and entinostat therapy on tumor burden and gene&#xD;
      expression patterns as measured by whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNASeq)&#xD;
      on circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and molibresib PO once&#xD;
      daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;

          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated&#xD;
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are&#xD;
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of&#xD;
             progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac&#xD;
             function using the New York Heart Association functional classification. To be&#xD;
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to swallow and retain orally administered medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of&#xD;
             starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of entinostat and GSK525762C on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason and because HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) and BET inhibitor (BETi) agents are&#xD;
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and their male partner must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and for 7&#xD;
             months after completion of entinostat and GSK525762C administration. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or&#xD;
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the&#xD;
             study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of&#xD;
             entinostat and GSK525762C administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have tumors determined to be easily accessible for biopsy and must be&#xD;
             willing to have serial biopsies. Tumor biopsies will be performed on the most&#xD;
             accessible biopsiable site of disease. All possible precautions to avoid complications&#xD;
             will be taken, including discussions in multidisciplinary meetings, if needed. If a&#xD;
             biopsy cannot be performed safely (e.g. there is no safely accessible biopsiable tumor&#xD;
             tissue) or biopsy does not yield sufficient tissue for analysis, participation is&#xD;
             still allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on both therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation may participate as long&#xD;
             as they have no history of clinically significant bleeding while on anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had any anti-cancer therapy within 14 days (or 5 half-lives,&#xD;
             whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of the investigational products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received radiation therapy within 21 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             the investigational products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a diagnosis of NK cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;
             Toxicities should have recovered to =&lt; grade 1, excluding alopecia, or should be&#xD;
             stable chronic grade 2 toxicities that do not overlap with presumed toxicities of&#xD;
             entinostat or GSK525762C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known untreated or symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases are&#xD;
             excluded. Patients with previously treated central nervous system (CNS) metastasis may&#xD;
             be included provided that they have stable CNS disease for at least 4 weeks (confirmed&#xD;
             by imaging) without symptoms and are off corticosteroids (above physiologic dose) for&#xD;
             that indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant malabsorption or nausea and vomiting that would interfere&#xD;
             with oral therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bleeding diathesis or clinically significant bleeding within the prior 6&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to entinostat (e.g. medications that have a benzamide structure [tiapride,&#xD;
             remoxipride, clebopride] or GSK525762C [e.g. benzodiazepines]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or strong&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.&#xD;
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled&#xD;
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need&#xD;
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
             herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of clinically significant bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because entinostat is an HDACi and&#xD;
             GSK525762C is a BETi with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with entinostat or GSK525762C, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued throughout the treatment period and for at least 28 days&#xD;
             following the last dose of study treatment if the mother is treated with entinostat or&#xD;
             GSK525762C.&#xD;
