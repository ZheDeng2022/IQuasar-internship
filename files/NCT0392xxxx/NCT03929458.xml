  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is the decline of muscle mass and strength with age. Evidence suggests that&#xD;
      oxidative stress and molecular inflammation play important roles in age-related muscle&#xD;
      atrophy. The two factors may interfere with the balance between protein synthesis and&#xD;
      breakdown, cause mitochondrial dysfunction, and induce apoptosis. Sarcopenia, inflammation&#xD;
      and oxidative stress is highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients and may contribute to&#xD;
      mortality. The copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is affected by oxidative stress in&#xD;
      blood circulation. This study aimed to test whether mtDNA copy number correlates with&#xD;
      oxidative stress and some uremic toxins in nondiabetic hemodialysis(HD) patients. 200&#xD;
      nondiabetic hemodialysis patients and 50 healthy subjects will be enrolled. This study will&#xD;
      be performed to investigate quantitative changes in mtDNA occur in HD patients with and&#xD;
      without sarcopenia. Copy number of mtDNA in leukocyte DNA is determined by real-time&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction in HD patients and 50 age- and sex-matched control subjects. In&#xD;
      addition, correlation of the alterations of albumin redox status, 8-isoprostane, plasma IL-6&#xD;
      ,LBP and TNF-a and as well as various uremic toxins will be performed.&#xD;

      Research design and methods Subjects In this study, we shall recruit 200 patients on&#xD;
      maintenance hemodialysis. In addition, 50 age- and sex-matched subjects act as controls. The&#xD;
      HD patients have been on stable dialysis for at least 3 months HD patients are being treated&#xD;
      three times weekly with standard bicarbonate dialysis (Na 138 mmol/L, HCO3 35 mmol/L, K 1.5&#xD;
      mmol/L, Ca 1.25 mmol/L, Mg 0.75 mmol/L) and by high-flux HD with synthetic membranes&#xD;
      (dialysis filters surface area: 1.7 to 2.1 m2). All HD patients enroll in our study will be&#xD;
      tested with DEXA and handgrip strength. Demographic data will be collected and laboratory&#xD;
      examination are conducted as listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical Determinations Blood samples for laboratory testing were drawn from the venous&#xD;
      end of a vascular access at the beginning of the hemodialysis session and then stored at&#xD;
      -80°C until time of analysis. The high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were&#xD;
      determined by a commercial immunoturbidimetric assay using a Hitachi autoanalyzer (model&#xD;
      7170). The detection limit and interval for CRP was 0.1 mg/L and 0.1-500.0 mg/L,&#xD;
      respectively. The baseline serum albumin was measured by the bromocresol green method on a&#xD;
      Hitachi autoanalyzer (model 7170). Serum levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, and low- and&#xD;
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were determined by standard laboratory methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of relative leucocyte mtDNA copy number The real-time PCR reaction was&#xD;
      performed in triplicate for each reaction. The 10ul PCR reaction contains 1X TaqMan Universal&#xD;
      PCR Master Mix buffer, 500nM of each primer, 200nM of TaqMan probe, and 0.2-2ng of total&#xD;
      genomic DNA extract, PCR conditions are 2 min at 50℃, 10 min at 95℃, followed by 40 cycles of&#xD;
      15 s of denaturation at 95℃ and 60 s of annealing/extension at 60℃. Real-time quantitative&#xD;
      analysis was performed on StepOne Real-Time PCR system(ABI). The primers and probes for&#xD;
      real-time PCR are listed in Table 1. The PCR products that involve mitochondria DNA(MtDNA)&#xD;
      and nuclear DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Curve:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard DNA solutions for the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear 18S rRNA dene (nDNA) were&#xD;
      generated from PCR products cloned in a vector of pCR2.1-TOPO. Serial dilutions were made and&#xD;
      RT-QPCR reactions were performed to construct the standard curve from Ct values and the&#xD;
      number of copies of the standard plasmid DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of mtDNA/nDNA Ratio as a measure of mtDNA Content:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The copy number of the mtDNA and the nDNA is calculated using the threshold cycle number (Ct)&#xD;
      and intrapolating from the standard curve. The ratio of the copy number of mtDNA to the copy&#xD;
      number of nDNA is measurement of mtDNA content.[30] Measurement of the Albumin Redox State&#xD;
      Measurement of the albumin redox state was performed using the high-performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography (HPLC) method reported previously [31]. The HPLC-fluorescence detection&#xD;
      (HPLC-FD) system consisted of an AS-8010 autosampler (injection volume, 2 mL per specimen;&#xD;
      Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and a Model FS-8000 fluorescence detector (excitation wavelength, 280&#xD;
      nm; emission wavelength, 340 nm) with a CCPM double-plunger pump (Tosoh) in conjunction with&#xD;
      a SC-8020 system controller (Tosoh). A Shodex-Asahipak ES-502N 7C column [Showa Denko, Tokyo,&#xD;
      Japan; 10×0.76 cm (inner diameter), dimethylaminoethyl-form for ion-exchange HPLC, column&#xD;
      temperature, 35°C±0.5°C] or in some instances two Asahipak GS-520H columns [Asahi Chemical&#xD;
      Industry; Kawasaki, Japan; 25×0.75 cm (inner diameter) maintained at 32°C] were used. Linear&#xD;
      gradient elution was carried out with an ethanol level increasing from 0% to 5% in 0.05 M&#xD;
      sodium acetate and 0.40 M sodium sulfate buffer (pH 4.85; acetate-sulfate buffer) at a flow&#xD;
      rate of 1.0 mL/min. Deaeration of the buffer solution was performed by helium bubbling. Based&#xD;
      on the HPLC profiles of HSA obtained from these procedures, the values for each fraction were&#xD;
      subjected to numerical curve fitting, and the fractions of HMA, HNA-1, and HNA-2 to total HSA&#xD;
      were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of Liposaccharide-binding protein (LBP) The LBP was determined from serum&#xD;
      samples and controls using standardized enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods, and&#xD;
      serum from normal control subjects was used for interassay variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total of 8-iso-PGF2-alpha Analysis Total 8-iso-PGF2-alpha concentrations in plasma were&#xD;
      measured by a specific enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Mich).&#xD;
      Samples were centrifuged and the supernatants were collected, purified as stated previously&#xD;
      and stored at -80°C until assayed. Samples were assayed at 50 μl after a 1:10 or 1:20&#xD;
      dilution and read at 420 nm in a 96 well microplate reader. The assay has been validated to&#xD;
      obtain a high correlation (0.95) between added known amounts of 8-isoprostane and the&#xD;
      concentration measured by EIA and has been directly validated by gas chromatography/mass&#xD;
      spectrometry. The antiserum used in this assay has a 100%cross reactivity with&#xD;
      8-iso-PGF2-alpha 0.2% each with PGF2-alpha, PGF3, PGE1, PGE2, 0.1% each with&#xD;
      6-keto-PGF1-alpha. The detection limit of the assay is 4 pg/ml and the range of standard&#xD;
      curve was from 3.9 to 500 pg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of Serum total p-cresol and Indoxyl sulfate Plasma concentrations of total&#xD;
      p-cresol sulfate(PCS) and indoxyl sulfate( IS) are analyzed with High-performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography (HPLC). Briefly, for binding competition, 200μl serum to which we added 20μl&#xD;
      0.50mM 1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (internal standard) was vortex-mixed with 250μl 0.24M&#xD;
      sodium octanoate (binding competitor).After incubation at room temperature for 5min, we added&#xD;
      2ml cold acetone to precipitate proteins. Following vortex-mixing and centrifuging at 4 ◦C,&#xD;
      1860×g for 20 min, the supernatant was transferred to 12mm×100mm, GL 14 glass test tubes and&#xD;
      2ml dichloromethane was added. After vortex-mixing and centrifuging at 4 ◦C, 1860×g for&#xD;
      10min, 200μl of the upper layer was transferred to glass autosampler vials, followed by&#xD;
      addition of 20μl 1M HCl and 15μl was injected onto the HPLC. The HPLC analysis was performed&#xD;
      on an Agilent 1100 series LC (Santa Clara, CA), and Agilent ChemStations software were used&#xD;
      for the chromatographic analysis. The separation was carried out on a ZORBAX SB-C18 Solv&#xD;
      Saver Plus HPLC column (5 μm, 3.0 mm×150 mm).at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Mobile phase A is&#xD;
      0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in Milli-Q water and mobile phase B is 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in&#xD;
      acetonitrile. The analytical method consists of an isocratic run with 92% mobile phase A for&#xD;
      23 min.. Each analytical run was followed by a 1.3 min washout gradient to 100% B. Column&#xD;
      temperature was 25 ◦C, and autosampler tray temperature was 6 ◦C. We quantified the analytes&#xD;
      by using the analyte to standard peak area ratio on a Agilent 1100 High Performance&#xD;
      Fluorescence detector G1321A. Detector settings were λex 260 nm/λem288nm for p-cresyl sulfate&#xD;
      and λex 280 nm/λem 390nm for indoxyl sulfate and internal standard. Quantitative results are&#xD;
      obtained and calculated in terms of their concentrations (mg/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handgrip strength Muscle strength is assessed in the dominant hand using a Jamar hand&#xD;
      dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument Company, USA). Patients are ﬁrst familiarized with the&#xD;
      device and were then examined standing with both arms extended sideways from the body with&#xD;
      the dynamometer facing away from the body. Patients were instructed to grip the dynamometer&#xD;
      with the maximum strength in response to a voice command, and the highest value of three&#xD;
      measurements was considered for the study. Handgrip strength (HGS) values under the 30th&#xD;
      percentile (Table 2) from a speciﬁc-population reference value adjusted for age and sex were&#xD;
      considered as reduced [32].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) DEXA is a widely used reference method for body FFM&#xD;
      and FM measurements.10 DEXA was performed using a Lunar Prodigy (GE Medical Systems, Madison,&#xD;
      WI). Whole-body scans were performed according to manufacturer's instructions, and body FM&#xD;
      (FMDEXA), LTM (LTMDEXA) and bone mineral content are analyzed using the manufacturer's&#xD;
      software. The DEXA method uses an X-ray tube with a filter to generate low-energy (40 kV).&#xD;
      and high-energy (70 or 100 kV) photons. When photonsat different energy levels pass through&#xD;
      tissue, their absorptions can be expressed as a ratio of attenuation at lower or higher&#xD;
      energy levels. DEXA estimate of FFM was calculated as a sum of LTM and bone mineral content&#xD;
      estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be examined by the same observer. Overall, AWGS recommends using 2 standard&#xD;
      deviations below the mean muscle mass of young reference group or the lower quintile as the&#xD;
      cutoff value determination. Moreover, AWGS recommends using height-adjusted skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mass instead of weight-adjusted skeletal muscle mass, and the suggested cutoff values were&#xD;
      7.0 kg/m2 in men and 5.4 kg/m2 in women by using DEXA.&#xD;
