      Up to 1 in 5 women in Africa who deliver their baby by cesarean section get a wound&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical site infections (SSIs) are largely preventable, but they represent a considerable&#xD;
      burden for health-care systems, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. The&#xD;
      prevention of these infections is complex and requires the integration of a range of&#xD;
      preventive measures before, during, and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed project is to determine the risk factors of Surgical Site Infection&#xD;
      post-Cesarean Section in women admitted to Princess Christian Maternity Hospital (PCMH) in&#xD;
      Freetown, Sierra Leone. Secondary aims are to determine the incidence of SSI and the&#xD;
      predictors of a negative outcome in women with post-CS SSI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: More than 1 in 10 people who have surgery in low and middle-income countries&#xD;
      (LMICs) get surgical site infection. People's risk of SSI in LMICs is 3 to 5 times higher&#xD;
      than in high-income countries. Up to 1 in 5 women in Africa who deliver their baby by&#xD;
      cesarean section get a wound infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical site infections (SSIs) are largely preventable, but they represent a considerable&#xD;
      burden for health-care systems, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. The&#xD;
      prevention of these infections is complex and requires the integration of a range of&#xD;
      preventive measures before, during, and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of the proposed project is to determine the risk factors of Surgical Site&#xD;
      Infection post-Cesarean Section in women admitted to Princess Christian Maternity Hospital&#xD;
      (PCMH) in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Secondary aims are to determine the incidence of SSI and&#xD;
      the predictors of a negative outcome in women with post-CS SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a prospective case-control (1:3 ratio) study. Study population and&#xD;
      Methods: All women admitted or already hospitalized with suspected or confirmed infection&#xD;
      after C/S will be screened for inclusion in the study as a case. Case confirmation will be&#xD;
      clinically established by an infectious disease expert. For each case, 3 patients undergoing&#xD;
      the C/S on the same day and admitted to the same ward but not presenting SSI, will be&#xD;
      selected as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: No formal sample size calculation is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/primary endpoints: SSI post C/S will be classified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superficial incisional surgical site infection, Deep incisional surgical site infection;&#xD;
      Organ/space surgical site infection Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with&#xD;
      participation, benefit, and group relatedness: Because all proceedings in the method of this&#xD;
      study are based on common clinical practice, there are no serious adverse events (SAEs)&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
