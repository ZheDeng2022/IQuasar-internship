    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint blockade therapies targeting the immunomodulatory effect of cytotoxic&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1/ Programmed death-ligand 1&#xD;
      (PD-1/PD-L1) have recently demonstrated survival benefit and durable response in phase III&#xD;
      trials in several human cancers, especially in tumors that bear high mutation load and/or&#xD;
      tumor-associated neoantigen signatures. The aim of these treatments is to restore effector&#xD;
      T-cell function and antitumor activity, which could be enhanced in the context of high&#xD;
      mutational/neoantigen load. In Isocitrate DeHydrogenase mutated High Grade Gliomas (IDHm&#xD;
      HGGs), acquired resistance to alkylating chemotherapy frequently results from the&#xD;
      inactivation of mismatch-repair (MMR) proteins which in turn leads to the acquisition of a&#xD;
      hypermutator phenotype. These findings suggest that at least in a subset of recurrent IDHm&#xD;
      HGGs immune checkpoint blockade therapies may be particularly effective. IDHm HGGs most&#xD;
      frequently occur in young adults. The first line treatment consists of maximal safe surgical&#xD;
      resection followed by radiotherapy and adjuvant alkylating chemotherapy (Temozolomide or&#xD;
      Procarbazine-CCNU-Vincristine regimen (PCV)). Despite these treatments, most IDHm HGGs&#xD;
      recurred in few years. There is no standard of care at recurrence and the median overall&#xD;
      survival after it is less than 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators make the hypothesis that treatment with the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      Nivolumab will improve 24 weeks progression-free survival in IDHm HGGs that have recurred&#xD;
      after initial treatment with radiotherapy and alkylating chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      IDHm HGGs (High-Grade (grade III or IV) Gliomas that harbor mutations in Isocitrate&#xD;
      Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2)) most frequently occur in young&#xD;
      adults. Favorable prognostic factors include high Karnofsky performance score, young age,&#xD;
      1p/19q codeletion and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation.&#xD;
      Despite primary management, which consists of maximal safe surgical resection followed by&#xD;
      radiotherapy and adjuvant alkylating chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) or Procarbazine,&#xD;
      CCNU, Vincristine (PCV), most IDHm HGGs recur, resulting in death with a median overall&#xD;
      survival of 5 years. At recurrence, there is currently no standard of care. Because of the&#xD;
      lack of clinical trials specifically designed for patients with relapsed IDHm HGGs, most&#xD;
      patients receive alkylating chemotherapy (nitrosourea- or TMZ-containing regimens). However,&#xD;
      these treatments have modest efficacy, as shown in several phase II trials that have reported&#xD;
      response rates of 17-44% and 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6) of 29-51%. The efficacy&#xD;
      of alkylating agents as DNA damaging agents is dependent on a functional MMR pathway. In IDHm&#xD;
      HGGs, acquired resistance to alkylating chemotherapy can arise after the inactivation of MMR&#xD;
      proteins, which in turn leads to the acquisition of a hypermutator phenotype. Paired analyses&#xD;
      of newly diagnosed and recurrent tumors (after treatment with alkylating agents), have&#xD;
      demonstrated that IDHm HGGs that recur after treatment with alkylating chemotherapy often&#xD;
      harbor hypermutator phenotype associated with defects in the MMR pathway. While such MMR&#xD;
      defects are extremely rare in newly diagnosed IDHm HGGs, MMR mutations were reported in&#xD;
      20-50% of patients with recurrent IDHm HGGs giving support that there is selective pressure&#xD;
      to decreased MMR in glial tumors treated with alkylating chemotherapy. These findings suggest&#xD;
      that, at least in a subset of recurrent IDHm HGGs, Nivolumab may be effective. Nivolumab has&#xD;
      demonstrated overall survival (OS) benefit in multiple tumor types and has demonstrated a&#xD;
      manageable safety profile in &gt; 12300 subjects across all clinical trials. For monotherapy,&#xD;
      the safety profile is similar across tumor types. Preliminary data from phase I and phase III&#xD;
      trials in patient with gliomas have indicated that Nivolumab is well tolerated in patients&#xD;
      with primary brain tumors. Yet, these tumors may represent particularly good candidates for&#xD;
      immune checkpoint blockade therapies since they frequently develop a hypermutated phenotype&#xD;
      after alkylating chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II, open label, non-randomized multicentric trial evaluating the efficacy of&#xD;
      Nivolumab in adults' patients with recurrent IDHm HGGs. The main objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of Nivolumab, based on 24 weeks progression-free survival (PFS24w) rate as assessed&#xD;
      by RANO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is administered by a 30 minutes intravenous infusion at dose of 240 mg every 2 (+/-&#xD;
      2 days) weeks for 8 cycles (4 months), followed by a dose of 480 mg administered by a 60&#xD;
      minutes intravenous infusion every 4 weeks (+/-3 days) (beginning at cycle 9) for a total&#xD;
      therapy duration of 1 year (maximum 16 cycles of treatment) or until progression, death,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo efficacy assessments using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 8&#xD;
      weeks (every 4 cycles during 8 first cycles, then every 2 cycles). Patient outcomes measures&#xD;
      will be completed at the time of each imaging study. Toxicity assessments will occur before&#xD;
      the initiation of each cycle. Health related Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BN20)&#xD;
      will be assessed before day 1, every 4 cycles during 8 first cycles, then every 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of discontinuation from study treatment for toxicity or severe adverse events,&#xD;
           subject request or investigator decision :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PFS-24w assessment should be done at W24 +/- 2weeks if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  date of tumor progression according to RANO and iRANO criteria and date of death if&#xD;
                applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of end of treatment duration :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A brain MRI will be performed 4 weeks after the C16&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After the end of the research, patient will be followed every 3 months as usual&#xD;
                care, by phone, to record date of tumor progression according to RANO criteria and&#xD;
                date of death, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events must be notified and documented by investigator for a minimum of 100 days&#xD;
           after last dose of treatment. Drug-related toxicities should continue be followed until&#xD;
           they resolve, return to baseline or are deemed irreversible.&#xD;
