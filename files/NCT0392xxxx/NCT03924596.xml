  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frankincense, or olibanum, is the oleogum resin that is harvested from several different&#xD;
      trees, an aromatic resin obtained from trees of the genus Boswellia. The word frankincense is&#xD;
      derived from the ancient French name &quot;frankincense,&quot; meaning &quot;pure incense.&quot; Frankincense is&#xD;
      also known in Arabic as &quot;luban,&quot;. Luban has been reported to have anti-inflammatory,&#xD;
      sedative, antibacterial, and anti-cancer activities. The aim of the present study is to treat&#xD;
      renal stones with Luban (Boswellia) given as capsules of active oils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical Phase I &amp; II (Safety, Efficacy) double-blind simple-randomized controlled&#xD;
      treatment trial, where 100 participants with renal stones (50 Radiopaque and 50 Radiolucent&#xD;
      stones) will be included in the study and divided between two treatment groups: Standard&#xD;
      treatment (Uralyt-U) and new treatment (Luban). Participants with stone size less than 10 mm&#xD;
      will be include; and participants with renal pathology or comorbidities (DM, CKD, multiple&#xD;
      renal cysts, renal tumors) will be excluded. The outcome measures of the study will be: the&#xD;
      primary end point (effect) is reduction of stone size by 50% or complete disappearance after&#xD;
      1 years of treatment; and the secondary end point (toxicity) is the participants intolerance&#xD;
      of the treatment or development of side effects. If this study proves an effect of Luban on&#xD;
      renal stones it will be an evolution in the management of renal stones by a natural, simple,&#xD;
      harmless easily available method.&#xD;

      Investigator Brochure of Olibanum (Boswellic Acid):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Clinical Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olibanum has been utilized as an important fixative in perfumes, soaps, creams, lotions, and&#xD;
      detergents in the leading products of the perfume and cosmetic industry, as it has an&#xD;
      oriental note in its scent. The interest of pharmaceutical companies created a third market&#xD;
      for olibanum. Since ancient times, it has been used in folk medicine for its antiseptic,&#xD;
      antiarthritic, and anti- inflammatory effects. For this reason, olibanum has gained&#xD;
      increasing attention from scientists in the last 20 years to better define its medical&#xD;
      effects and identify the constituents that are responsible for these effects.4 Animal studies&#xD;
      and pilot clinical trials support the potential of B. serrata gum resin extract (BSE) for the&#xD;
      treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, osteoarthritis and asthma.5 Moreover, in 2002 the European Medicines Agency&#xD;
      classified BSE as an 'orphan drug' for the treatment of peritumoral brain oedema.6 The&#xD;
      pharmacological effects of BSE have been mainly attributed to boswellic acids, especially&#xD;
      11-keto-b-boswellic acid (KBA) and acetyl-11-keto-b-boswellic acid (AKBA), which were&#xD;
      proposed as selective 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitors.7 Thus, instead of 5-LO inhibition by&#xD;
      AKBA, inhibition of cathepsin G (catG) and acid might represent the principal mode of action&#xD;
      of BSE.8 The gum resin is obtained by incision of the stem or branches of B. serrata.&#xD;
      Following air-drying, the gum resin exudate consists of translucent, roundish or irregularly&#xD;
      shaped, variable size pieces of up to 3 cm. The main components are volatile oils (5-15%),&#xD;
      pure resin (55-66%) and mucus (12-23%). The gum resin typically contains 30% boswellic&#xD;
      acids.9 The β-boswellic acid, is considered to be one of the main active components of&#xD;
      frankincense. These are some of the chemical compounds present in frankincense: acid resin&#xD;
      (56 per cent), soluble in alcohol and having the formula C20H32O4; gum (similar to gum&#xD;
      Arabic) 30-36%; 3-acetyl-beta-boswellic acid (Boswellia sacra); alpha-boswellic acid&#xD;
      (Boswellia sacra); 4-O-methyl-glucuronic acid (Boswellia sacra); incensole acetate&#xD;
      phellandrene .The work of Ibn Sina (Avicenna) of the 11th century refers to the use of&#xD;
      frankincense in inflammation and infection of the urinary tract.10 In Kenya it is used for&#xD;
      dressing wounds and, when mixed with sesame oil, is taken to reduce the loss of blood in the&#xD;
      urine from schistosomiasis infestation. The Antimicrobial activity of Boswellia resin have&#xD;
      been suggested by studies.11 The biological activities of essential oils including:&#xD;
      Antioxidant activity; Acetylcholinesterase inhibition; Antimicrobial activity and Antifungal&#xD;
      activity.11 The antibacterial activity of oleo-gum resins of B. sacra, known as Hoojri,&#xD;
      Najdi, Shathari, and Shaabi has been reported.3 All the four oils were effective against both&#xD;
      Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The clinical isolates of Bacillus subtilis,&#xD;
      Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes&#xD;
      were sensitive to all the oils, while those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and&#xD;
      Proteus vulgaris were resistant to the Shathari, Najdi, and Hoojri oils, respectively.3&#xD;
      Anticancer activity: multiple pathways that could be activated by frankincense oil to induce&#xD;
      bladder cancer cell death.12 The anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of Boswellia&#xD;
      serrata, and B. sacra have been reported.13 Recently It has been shown that the aqueous stem&#xD;
      bark extract of Boswellia papyrifera oral administration has a Nephro-curative effects on&#xD;
      acetaminophen-induced kidney damage in rats and that effect was found to be dose- and time-&#xD;
      dependent.14 In addition, Oleo-gum-resin of Boswellia serrata Roxb induced Reno-protective&#xD;
      action against Gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity in Albino rats.15 Also Zingiber officinale&#xD;
      Roscoe (Ginger), Arabic gum (AG), and Boswellia have been found to be beneficial adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy in participants with acute renal failure and CRF to prevent disease progression and&#xD;
      delay the need for renal replacement therapy.16&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Basic Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphological studies of frankincense on kidney stones done at a preclinical setup, results&#xD;
      attached in Appendix I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methodology Problem: Renal stones are common and people prefer non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment approaches&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of study (Question): Can we treat renal stones with a harmless easily available natural&#xD;
      product like Luban (Boswellia) given as capsules of active oils? And can Luban protect the&#xD;
      kidneys from the sequel of inflammation and kidney damage induced by nephrolithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Study Groups (Arms) and interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical Phase I &amp; II (Safety, Efficacy) double-blind simple-randomized controlled&#xD;
      treatment trial involving 100 participants in 4 groups (25 participants each group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 25 participants with radiopaque stones (Calcium Oxalate) treated with Luban&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: 25 participants with radiopaque stones (Calcium Oxalate) treated with Uralyt-U&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: 25 participants with radiolucent stones (Uric acid) treated with Luban&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4: 25 participants with radiolucent stones (Uric acid) treated with Uralyt-U&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Participants with renal stones equal or less than 10mm in size&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with renal pathology (Renal anomalies, multiple renal cysts, renal tumors)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with comorbidities (DM, CKD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Withdrawal criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants under treatment protocol who pass a stone and documented to be the stone&#xD;
           under evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have uncontrolled pain with the need for surgical intervention to&#xD;
           remove the stone&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Endpoints: The primary end point (effect) is reduction of stone size by 50% or&#xD;
           complete disappearance after 1 years of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Endpoints: The secondary end point (toxicity) is the participants intolerance&#xD;
           of the treatment or development of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants factor: Age (18-70 years), Sex, comorbidities, first time or recurrent former of&#xD;
      stone, presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stone factor: size in mm, location, composition (stone analysis if possible), Side of kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Data handling and record keeping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data (participants data collected) will be recorded in the case report form, CRF (data&#xD;
      collection sheet) specified for each participant. The CRF will be kept in a key-protected&#xD;
      file cabinet and a scanned electronic copy in a password-protected computer until analysis is&#xD;
      carried out. Source data verification will be carried out from the source data if any&#xD;
      inconsistencies arise by the means of regular research team meeting and review of the&#xD;
      collected data. Correct and consistent completion of participant initials and study ID number&#xD;
      will be regularly checked by the designated research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. Safety assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator along with the sponsor will ensure the right and safety of the&#xD;
      participants are protected and the study data are accurate and complete and the study is&#xD;
      being conducted in compliance with the protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and&#xD;
      regulatory requirements. The study will have a very strict adverse reaction reporting system&#xD;
      to identify any risks or side effects that may occur and not recognized before. This will be&#xD;
      done by a continuous record of a table of anticipated and unanticipated serious adverse&#xD;
      events grouped by organ system, with number and frequency of such event in each arm of the&#xD;
      clinical trial. The principal investigator will be regularly updated to take decisions about&#xD;
      the actions to be taken in case of a serious risk to patients occurred. All adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) and adverse reactions (AR), wither serious or not and wither suspected or unexpected,&#xD;
      that may have been caused by the study conduct or the investigational medicinal product will&#xD;
      be filled in the specified forms and reported to the sponsor immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Procedures for reporting deviations from the original plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deviations from the protocol and GCP will be monitored and corrected if become apparent.&#xD;
      Every effort will be done to ensure compliance with the protocol and preparation for the&#xD;
      unexpected will be anticipated by a systematic approach of dealing and documenting the&#xD;
      devotions in the participants study file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      J. Quality control and quality assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious breaches that have the potential to affect the safety of participants or integrity of&#xD;
      the study will be monitor closely and if occur will be investigated, reported to the sponsor&#xD;
      and acted upon immediately. The principal investigator will be leading the role in the&#xD;
      resolution of a serious breach and actions will be recorded in the participants study file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each type of stones (radiopaque, radiolucent), the two independent treatment arms (Luban&#xD;
      and conventional) will be compared for the two categorical outcomes of no effect or good&#xD;
      effect, with good effect defined as reduction of stone size by 50% or complete disappearance&#xD;
      after 1 year of treatment. The Chi-squared test will be used to calculate wither the two&#xD;
      treatment groups are the same or different and 95% confidence interval will be calculated.&#xD;
      The significance level will be at p &lt; 0.05. The analysis will be based on intention-to-treat&#xD;
      basis (participants will be analyzed in their original group even if they deviate from the&#xD;
      protocol). An interim analysis of the results will be done at 6 months of follow up to look&#xD;
      for any serious adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who satisfy the study criteria will be recruited over a period of one year&#xD;
      (September 2019 to September 2020). They will be randomly distributed to either the Luban&#xD;
      treatment (AKBA-Incense 2 capsules daily, 30% 3-acetyl-11-keto-ß-boswellic acid, from&#xD;
      ZeinPharma) or the conventional treatment Uralyt-U (Potassium Sodium Hydrogen Citrate, 10g&#xD;
      orally in 3 divided doses with pH target 6.2-6.8 for Calcium Oxalate stones and 7.0-7.2 for&#xD;
      Uric Acid stones) as a positive control, using a computer-generated list of random numbers&#xD;
      with even number for Luban treatment. Before inclusion: blood (Creatinine, Urea, K, Na, Ca,&#xD;
      P) and urine (urine analysis, urine culture) tests, Radiological (x-ray KUB, US abdomen, CT&#xD;
      abdomen) will be carried out. Participants will be followed up every 3 months for 1 year.&#xD;
      Each visit the following will be done: clinical and physical assessment, blood tests, urine&#xD;
      tests and CT abdomen.&#xD;
