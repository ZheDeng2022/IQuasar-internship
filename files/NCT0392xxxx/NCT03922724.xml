      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. Blood cell transplant can cure some people with lymphoma.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if they can limit the complications transplant can cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if a stem cell transplant can cure or control lymphoma. Also to test if new ways of&#xD;
      getting a recipient ready for a transplant may result in fewer problems and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients: People ages 12 and older with peripheral T cell lymphoma that does not respond to&#xD;
      standard treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors: Healthy people ages 18 and older whose relative has lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow biopsy: A needle inserted into the participant s hip bone will remove marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will also be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will also be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lying in scanners that take pictures of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors may donate blood. They will take daily shots for 5 7 days. They will have apheresis: A&#xD;
      machine will take blood from one arm and take out their stem cells. The blood will be&#xD;
      returned into the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will be hospitalized at least 2 weeks before transplant. They will get a catheter:&#xD;
      A plastic tube will be inserted into a vein in the neck or upper chest. They will get&#xD;
      antibody therapy or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will get the transplant through their catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will stay in the hospital several weeks after transplant. They will get blood&#xD;
      transfusions. They will take drugs including chemotherapy for about 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will have visits 6, 12, 18, 24 months after transplant, then once a year for 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mature neoplasms of T and/or natural killer cells, collectively called peripheral T-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas (PTCL), are often poorly responsive to chemotherapy and therefore associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has the potential to cure PTCL but the&#xD;
      optimal approach to HCT for these diseases requires ongoing investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects on the reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC/mRIC) arms, to estimate the&#xD;
      progression-free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects on the immunosuppression-only conditioning (IOC) and ATL/RIC arms, because they&#xD;
      are high risk patients, to preliminarily estimate the proportion who are progression free at&#xD;
      one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients age &gt;= 12 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTCL that is relapsed or refractory to prior therapy and/or PTCL of a risk score where&#xD;
      upfront allo HCT in first remission is reasonable (PIT score of intermediate-low risk or&#xD;
      higher or supported by clinical practice guidelines)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least one potentially suitable 7-8/8 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor (at HLA A, B,&#xD;
      C, and DR), or an HLA-haploidentical related donor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate end-organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be four recipient treatment arms that vary in approach, although all with the same&#xD;
      backbone of conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunosuppression-only conditioning (IOC) arm for high-risk subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) arm for those deemed not high-risk and able to tolerate&#xD;
      RIC and without adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      mRIC arm for patients eligible for the RIC arm, as a modified expansion upon completion of&#xD;
      the RIC arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATL-RIC arm for patients with a diagnosis of ATL&#xD;
&#xD;
      IOC arm: equine anti-thymocyte globulin (e-ATG) 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13,&#xD;
      pentostatin 4 mg/m^2/day IV on days -9 and -5, low-dose cyclophosphamide (5 mg/kg) orally&#xD;
      daily on days -9 through -2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned to the IOC arm if there is significant end-organ dysfunction&#xD;
      present and it is felt that a conditioning regimen that includes busulfan would likely be&#xD;
      associated with intolerable or life-threatening toxicities for the patient. Patients will&#xD;
      also be assigned to the IOC arm if they possess a DNA repair defect, telomere maintenance&#xD;
      defect, or familial cancer predisposition syndrome that necessitates limiting chemotherapy as&#xD;
      much as possible to prevent future cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIC arm: e-ATG 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13, pentostatin 4 mg/m^2/day IV on days -11&#xD;
      and -7, low-dose cyclophosphamide (5 mg/kg) orally daily on days -11 through -4; busulfan IV,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetically dosed, on days -3 and -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mRIC arm: e-ATG 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13, pentostatin 4 mg/m^2/day IV on days -11&#xD;
      and -7, low-dose cyclophosphamide (5 mg/kg) orally daily on days -11 through -4; busulfan IV,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetically dosed, on days -3 and -2, G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous on days -12,&#xD;
      -8, and -4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATL-RIC arm: e-ATG 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13, pentostatin 4 mg/m^2/day IV on days&#xD;
      -11 and -7, low-dose cyclophosphamide (5 mg/kg) orally daily on days -11 through -4; busulfan&#xD;
      IV, pharmacokinetically dosed, on days -3 and -2, G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous on days&#xD;
      -12, -8, and -4, ruxolitinib 45 mg/day from day -12 through day -2, and zidovudine 300 mg&#xD;
      orally three times a day from day -1 through day +50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood stem cells are the preferred graft source, although bone marrow is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
      GVHD prophylaxis: Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) on days +3 and +4 (50&#xD;
      mg/kg/day on RIC arm, mRIC, and ATL-RIC arms and 25 mg/kg/day on the IOC arm, with the option&#xD;
      of 25 mg/kg/day on the RIC arm). Sirolimus on days +5 through +60 (RIC arm, mRIC arm, IOC&#xD;
      arm). Patients with somatic mutations in the Akt/mTOR pathway may receive tacrolimus days +5&#xD;
      through +60 instead of sirolimus on the RIC, mRIC, or IOC arms. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)&#xD;
      on days +5 through +25 on the RIC, IOC, and mRIC arms; MMF will not be given on the ATL-RIC&#xD;
      arm. Patients on the ATL-RIC arm will receive tacrolimus on days +5 through +50 and&#xD;
      ruxolitinib 15 mg/day from days +5 through +35, 10 mg/day from days +36 through +60, and 5&#xD;
      mg/day from days +61 through +70.&#xD;

                       receiving RIC or IOC. Patients who are above these bilirubin, ALT, or AST&#xD;
                       thresholds may be eligible for the RIC or IOC arm if evaluated by a&#xD;
                       hepatologist who deems the liver function test abnormalities to be&#xD;
                       potentially disease related, either because of direct involvement by PTCL,&#xD;
                       due to an associated process such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, or&#xD;
