      The ASCENT Trial is a single arm, multi-center, phase II study. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      determine the rejection-free, severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free survival in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with serious non-malignant hematologic diseases (NMHD) undergoing&#xD;
      unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with abatacept added to&#xD;
      conventional GVHD prophylaxis. The secondary objective is to characterize the impact of&#xD;
      abatacept on infection and the reconstitution of protective immunity to infection.&#xD;
      Transplanted patients will be followed for 3 years. Weight-based peripheral blood samples&#xD;
      will be drawn longitudinally through two years to evaluate immune reconstitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 28 pediatric patients with serious NMHD undergoing URD HSCT. The trial&#xD;
      will include two strata, based on donor matching. Stratum 1 (n=14) will be for patients with&#xD;
      7/8 donors and stratum 2 (n=14) will be for those with 8/8 (matched) donors. All participants&#xD;
      will receive 8 doses of abatacept (10 mg/kg intravenously on days -1, +5, +14, +28, +56, +84,&#xD;
      +112, and +150). Recruitment is expected to last for about 2 years and participants will be&#xD;
      followed for up to 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will test the hypothesis that extended abatacept administration (combined with a&#xD;
      standard regimen of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil) will effectively prevent acute and&#xD;
      chronic GVHD in children and adolescents receiving URD HSCT, without compromising their&#xD;
      engraftment or reconstitution of protective immunity to infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many serious NMHD affecting children, including SAA, FA, sickle cell disease (SCD), and&#xD;
      thalassemia can be cured by allogeneic HSCT. While the best results are achieved with HSCT&#xD;
      from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched siblings, most children lack such donors, and many&#xD;
      children with NMHD are therefore transplanted with grafts from adult URD. Because URD grafts&#xD;
      are less histocompatible, they are more likely to cause GVHD, a process driven by the&#xD;
      reaction of donor T cells against incompatible host tissues. Despite the routine&#xD;
      administration of immune suppression for GVHD prophylaxis, GVHD claims the lives of many and&#xD;
      plagues others with incapacitating chronic illness. For NMHD, the threat of GVHD limits the&#xD;
      use of URD HSCT to only the most severely affected children. In African-Americans and other&#xD;
      ethnic minorities, the situation is compounded by the fact that most of these children lack&#xD;
      fully matched URD and typically receive mismatched and matched grafts, which carry an&#xD;
      increased risk for graft rejection. A more effective form of GVHD prophylaxis that does not&#xD;
      compromise engraftment is urgently needed, both to improve outcomes for those children&#xD;
      undergoing HSCT as well as to allow expansion of this curative therapy to the many children&#xD;
      with NMHD who forego transplantation because of the risk for GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers have investigated the use of the co-stimulation blocking agent CTLA4-Ig&#xD;
      (abatacept) to prevent GVHD. Study results to date indicate that abatacept strongly inhibits&#xD;
      allo-reactive donor T cells and is clinically safe and effective. The clinical experience has&#xD;
      included a variety of recipients: children and adults, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and&#xD;
      bone marrow (BM) grafts, as well as mismatched and matched unrelated and matched related&#xD;
      donors; all have involved the administration of four IV doses of abatacept, on days -1, +5,&#xD;
      +14, and +28, in combination with standard calcineurin inhibitor-based GVHD prophylaxis.&#xD;
      Collectively, the results to date suggest that this combination, including abatacept, very&#xD;
      effectively prevents acute GVHD. However, these results also suggest that protection against&#xD;
      chronic GVHD is more limited. In this current trial, the researchers will attempt to more&#xD;
      effectively prevent chronic GVHD by extending the administration of abatacept, giving eight&#xD;
      doses (additional doses days +56, +84, +112, and +150). This trial will test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that extended abatacept administration (combined with a standard regimen of tacrolimus and&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil) will effectively prevent acute and chronic GVHD in children and&#xD;
      adolescents receiving URD HSCT, without compromising their engraftment or reconstitution of&#xD;
      protective immunity to infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 28 pediatric patients with serious NMHD undergoing URD HSCT. The trial&#xD;
      will include two strata, based on donor matching. Stratum 1 (n=14) will be for patients with&#xD;
      7/8 donors and stratum 2 (n=14) will be for those with 8/8 (matched) donors. Study&#xD;
      participants will be admitted to the hospital ten or eleven days prior to the day of&#xD;
      transplant (day -10 or day -11) to complete a conditioning regimen to prevent the donor cells&#xD;
      from being rejected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive one of three reduced toxicity or intensity conditioning regimens based&#xD;
      upon underlying disease and/or physician preference: (1) anti-thymocyte globulin,&#xD;
      fludarabine, and a low dose of cyclophosphamide (FA patients only); (2) anti-thymocyte&#xD;
      globulin, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and a low dose of total body radiation (SAA and&#xD;
      other bone marrow failure disorders); or (3) alemtuzumab, fludarabine, melphalan, and&#xD;
      thiotepa (hemoglobinopathy and non-SAA bone marrow failure disorders). All participants will&#xD;
      receive 8 doses of abatacept (10 mg/kg intravenously on days -1, +5, +14, +28, +56, +84,&#xD;
      +112, and +150). Recruitment is expected to last for about 2 years and participants will be&#xD;
      followed for up to 3 years.&#xD;
