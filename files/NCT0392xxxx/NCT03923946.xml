  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who have had a stroke are at greater risk of developing distress (e.g. depression&#xD;
      and anxiety). These individuals are also likely to be highly critical of themselves as they&#xD;
      are no longer able to do the things they used to be able to do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compassion Focused Therapy is a form of psychotherapy aimed at reducing an individual's&#xD;
      self-criticism and increasing their self-compassion. CFT has been found to be effective at&#xD;
      reducing distress in the general population and there is emerging evidence in the brain&#xD;
      injury population. However, to date, there has not been a rigorous study to establish the&#xD;
      effectiveness of CFT. Therefore, this feasibility randomised control trial aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establish the feasibility of recruitment, randomisation, and retention of participants;&#xD;
      determine the acceptability and feasibility of a CFT intervention within a stroke population;&#xD;
      determine the suitability of pre and post measures for assessing the impact of the&#xD;
      intervention; Analyse the cost-effectiveness of the study; Establish effect sizes to enable&#xD;
      an accurate estimation of the number of participants needed in a full scale RCT to find a&#xD;
      treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be randomised into either a CFT intervention group, an active control arm&#xD;
      (akin to a befriending type service) or a treatment as usual arm. Participants will receive&#xD;
      up to three one hour sessions of CFT (intervention group) or befriending (active control&#xD;
      group) or will not receive any additional support (treatment as usual group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 36 participants will be recruited, 12 in each arm of the study. Participants will&#xD;
      be recruited from the Early Supported Stroke Discharge Teams within Derbyshire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete well-being, distress and self-criticism measures, pre, post and at&#xD;
      4 months follow-up. A semi-structured interview will also be conducted with a selection of&#xD;
      participants from each arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke Stroke is a type of acquired brain injury (ABI) and is a heterogeneous term used to&#xD;
      describe both ruptures to large blood vessels in the brain causing flooding with blood, and&#xD;
      occlusions of tiny vessels in a part of the brain that is vital for functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability, second only to coronary&#xD;
      heart disease. Approximately 110, 000 strokes occur each year in England with prevalence&#xD;
      rates estimated to be 7.20/1000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strokes can lead to changes in functioning in a variety of areas of life. As a result,&#xD;
      individuals can often experience a range of emotional difficulties. For example, there is a&#xD;
      high prevalence of mental health difficulties in stroke survivors; the most commonly reported&#xD;
      are depression and anxiety disorders. Prevalence rates of distress vary between studies;&#xD;
      however, it is estimated that the prevalence of post-stroke depression is approximately 31%,&#xD;
      and post-stroke anxiety is estimated to be 18%. High levels of depression and anxiety can&#xD;
      augment the functional impairments experienced as a result of a stroke. Depression in&#xD;
      particularly is associated with reduced functioning outcomes and increased mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, studies have found high levels of self-criticism post-stroke as individuals&#xD;
      realise they are no longer able to do things which they used to be able to. Studies have&#xD;
      found higher rates of depression in individuals who continue to pursue what have now become&#xD;
      unachievable life goals. It is postulated that this could be one of the reasons for the high&#xD;
      prevalence rate of depression post-stroke, particularly if individuals do not re-evaluate&#xD;
      their life goals to realign with any changes in cognitive capacity and functional deficits as&#xD;
      a result of the stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidance has suggested that individuals who&#xD;
      have had a stroke should have access to psychological therapy to help with difficulties&#xD;
      adjusting to life post-stroke. One such therapy is Compassion Focussed Therapy (CFT) which&#xD;
      aims to reduce self-criticism by increasing self-compassion. CFT may be particularly&#xD;
      effective in this population due to the specific challenges faced. For example, they have to&#xD;
      adjust to the loss of previous functioning (both cognitively and otherwise) alongside&#xD;
      managing the threat that a stroke may reoccur and the gradual and often frustrating nature of&#xD;
      recovery which may be conditional on clinical input. The picture can then be complicated&#xD;
      further by an individual's self-criticism tendencies which, as described above, can compound&#xD;
      any challenges the individual is already facing. Therefore, CFT, which aims to reduce&#xD;
      self-criticism and foster adjustment through self-compassion, would appear to be a&#xD;
      well-suited intervention in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CFT proposes a bio-psycho-social model of distress centred around three systems; a drive&#xD;
      system, a threat system and a self-soothing system. The model suggests that an individual&#xD;
      becomes distressed when the three systems become unbalanced. One of the ways this imbalance&#xD;
      could happen is via self-criticism. Within this model, self-criticism is described as an&#xD;
      internal threat and leads to an over-active threat-focused system. CFT focuses on reducing&#xD;
      self-criticism by increasing the soothing system and reducing the threat system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is growing evidence to support this model of distress. For example, individuals in the&#xD;
      general population who have high levels of self-criticism are also susceptible to developing&#xD;
      mood related disorders like depression and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, high levels of self-criticism have been found to negatively impact on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of psychological support unless self-criticism is specifically targeted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also increasing evidence to support the effectiveness of CFT at reducing distress&#xD;
      which will be discussed in further detail below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing body of research which is showing promising results for CFT as an&#xD;
      intervention for reducing distress in an ABI population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been a collection of case studies conducted within this population utilising CFT to&#xD;
      reduce symptoms of distress. Two of these studies found clinically meaningful reductions in&#xD;
      distress scores post intervention. However, both of these studies utilised a CBT intervention&#xD;
      in addition to CFT. Whilst reviews of the literature have found inconclusive evidence for the&#xD;
      effectiveness of CBT alone to treat symptoms of distress in an ABI population, it is still&#xD;
      unclear what direct impact the CFT intervention had. Nevertheless, Ashworth, (2015) found a&#xD;
      reduction in symptoms that was approaching significance whilst utilising CFT alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O'Neill and McMillan (2012) utilised a single session compassionate imagery intervention in a&#xD;
      group of individuals with an ABI. However, the authors failed to find a significant effect of&#xD;
      single session compassionate imagery on empathy and self-compassion scores, although changes&#xD;
      in self-compassion scores approached significance. It must be noted that this study only&#xD;
      utilised a single session of compassionate imagery and did not assess the effect of this&#xD;
      intervention on distress. Nonetheless, this study suggests compassionate imagery can be&#xD;
      utilised in an ABI population and authors suggested future studies utilise repeated exposure&#xD;
      to compassionate imagery to aid learning and retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, researchers have conducted a naturalistic study with 12 individuals who received&#xD;
      both group and individual CFT. This study found a significant reduction in depression and&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms post CFT intervention which further suggests support for utilising CFT to&#xD;
      reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in an ABI population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE PURPOSE The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of a&#xD;
      full-scale trial to investigate the clinical and cost effectiveness of a compassion focussed&#xD;
      intervention to manage distress post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the research evidence in support of using CFT to reduce symptoms of distress post ABI&#xD;
      is emerging, to date there has not been a Randomised Control Trial (RCT) conducted in an ABI&#xD;
      or stroke population. The Medical Research Council (MRC) states there are certain stages that&#xD;
      research needs to go through before conducting a definitive RCT, see Figure 2. Currently the&#xD;
      research evidence meets the development stage. Therefore, feasibility/ pilot study is the&#xD;
      next necessary step in the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence to suggest that the greatest risk of developing psychological distress is&#xD;
      in the first few months post-stroke. This risk is then maintained throughout the first-year&#xD;
      post-stroke and has a significant correlation to functional outcome. This review suggested&#xD;
      that early diagnosis and treatment is therefore, vital for optimising recovery. Another more&#xD;
      recent review found evidence that psychological interventions may prevent mood disorders&#xD;
      post-stroke. Therefore, this study will explore CFT early on post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE The primary objective is to establish the feasibility of the study,&#xD;
      including recruitment, randomisation, and retention of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the acceptability and feasibility of a compassionate imagery intervention&#xD;
           within a stroke population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the suitability of pre and post measures for assessing the impact of the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyse the cost-effectiveness of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish effect sizes to enable an accurate estimation of the number of participants&#xD;
           needed in a full scale RCT to find a treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the effectiveness of the intervention OUTCOME MEASURES/ENDPOINTS PRIMARY OUTCOME&#xD;
           MEASURE/ENDPOINT The primary outcome measures will be drop-out rates/ percentage&#xD;
           completion rates and framework analysis from responses to interview questions about&#xD;
           participants' experiences of being involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS/OUTCOMES The secondary outcome measures will include analysis of&#xD;
      responses to psychometrics (including the HADS, WEWBS, EQ-5D, SCS) and service use&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN A three-arm feasibility randomised control trial will be conducted comparing a&#xD;
      compassion focussed intervention to an active control and usual stroke care. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomised at baseline in equal proportions via a computer-generated programme&#xD;
      developed to block randomise participants to an arm in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete standardised measures of distress (HADS), wellbeing&#xD;
      (WEWBS), Quality of Life (EQ-5D) and self-compassion (SCS) at baseline, post-intervention and&#xD;
      4-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to take part in a post-intervention interview; participants will&#xD;
      be selected iteratively using purposive sampling to represent participants from all three&#xD;
      arms and to include a range of severity of distress at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS This study will utilise a mixed-methods approach for addressing feasibility&#xD;
      objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be analysed using SPSS. Descriptive data will be analysed using Chi&#xD;
      square and t-tests. Quantitative analyses will use a mixed linear model comparing distress,&#xD;
      self-compassion and wellbeing scores at baseline versus 6-weeks and 4-month follow-ups,&#xD;
      within and between the three allocation groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be transcribed verbatim this may be completed by an outside company. If the&#xD;
      post-intervention interviews are transcribed by a transcription service external to the&#xD;
      University, a Transcriber Confidentiality Agreement will be completed with the chosen&#xD;
      service. This will ensure that any of the information collected in the interviews will remain&#xD;
      confidential. The chosen transcription service will be required to have a secure system for&#xD;
      data transfer, access, and storage. Participants will be made aware that their interview will&#xD;
      be sent for transcription at the consent stage of recruitment. If the interviews are not&#xD;
      transcribed by an external company they will be transcribed by a member of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be analysed using framework analysis (Ritchie &amp; Spencer, 1994). Framework&#xD;
      analysis allows both inductive and deductive analysis of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SETTING Participants will be identified through NHS community stroke teams, hospital&#xD;
      stroke wards and caseloads of community and acute stroke teams. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from ESSD Teams within Derbyshire Community Healthcare Service NHS Foundation Trust&#xD;
      and Derby Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will continue to receive their usual care alongside the study. The&#xD;
      intervention arm will be delivered by the Primary Investigator and the active control arm&#xD;
      will be delivered by volunteers from the local stroke association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Participants who have had a stroke will be&#xD;
      invited to take part in the study after they have been discharged from the ESSD pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be eligible for the study if they are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Eligible for the early supported discharge pathway this includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmed diagnosis of a new stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over 18 Years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to consent to being in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient and their family/carer agree to rehabilitation process continuing at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The home environment is conducive to the community-based rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Achievable rehabilitation goals can be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document acknowledgement that the patient is sufficiently well enough from a medical&#xD;
           perspective to be managed in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient's language and/or cognitive skills are at a level for them to manage on&#xD;
           their own for periods as is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to ESSD criteria participants must;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a good grasp of the English language&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have been discharged from the ESSD pathway Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be excluded if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have any communication difficulties that would prevent them from engaging in the&#xD;
           intervention (including hearing impairments, visual impairments, inability to understand&#xD;
           English). These will be assessed at researcher's discretion during baseline assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Had a diagnosis of dementia prior to the stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are deemed to lack capacity to give informed consent. This will be judged via a&#xD;
           qualified clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have had previous experience of CFT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Were receiving medical or psychological treatment for a mental illness at the time of&#xD;
           their stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling This target sample-size should be feasible for the current study; the study will&#xD;
      recruit from three ESSD teams in Derbyshire who each support up to 15 patients for 6 weeks.&#xD;
      The Trust predicted that the ESSD teams would support 194 patients within the ESSD pathway&#xD;
      per year. It is anticipated that all patients in the ESSD pathway will meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Size of sample Consistent with the feasibility-testing objectives of the study, sampling is&#xD;
      based upon numbers required to estimate key design parameters. We will aim to recruit 12&#xD;
      participants per arm (36 participants in total), based on calculations demonstrating that&#xD;
      these numbers would be sufficient to estimate relevant parameters with adequate precision&#xD;
      (Julious, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling technique Clinicians in the ESSD team will give all individuals they support&#xD;
      information about the study and will pass the details those who show an interest on to the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT Potential participants for this study will be recruited via the Derbyshire NHS&#xD;
      Stroke Services. Participants will be recruited over a 13-month time-period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be approached by clinicians within Derbyshire NHS Stroke Services about the&#xD;
      study. Clinicians will provide potential participants with information about the study and&#xD;
      pass on the contact details of those who express an interest in participating to the research&#xD;
      team. The research team will then arrange a suitable time to either meet with the participant&#xD;
      or have a phone conversation to talk through the study and ensure they understand what will&#xD;
      be required of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be explained to the potential participant that entry into the trial is entirely&#xD;
      voluntary and that their treatment and care will not be affected by their decision. It will&#xD;
      also be explained that they can withdraw at any time, but attempts will be made to avoid this&#xD;
      occurrence. In the event of their withdrawal it will be explained that their data collected&#xD;
      so far may not be erased in accordance with the University's Research Privacy Notice and&#xD;
      information given in the Participant Information Sheet and we will seek consent to use the&#xD;
      data in the final analyses where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION AND BLINDING Participants will be randomised at baseline (after informed&#xD;
      consent and baseline assessments) in equal proportions to the CFT intervention, active&#xD;
      control, or usual stroke care once the individual has consented to taking part in the study.&#xD;
      A computer-generated programme will be developed to block randomise participants to an arm in&#xD;
      the study. This will be done via an allocation sequence and an email will be sent to the&#xD;
      researcher to inform them which arm the participant is in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not pragmatically possible for the participant or therapist to be blinded to group&#xD;
      allocation due to the active nature of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY REGIMEN Individuals will complete baseline measures before being randomly allocated to&#xD;
      one of three arms. These will either be completed online, face to face, over the phone or via&#xD;
      postal forms, depending on participant preference and communication needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once an individual has been randomly allocated to a treatment arm the researcher will contact&#xD;
      them via a phone call to inform them which arm they have been allocated to. A follow-up&#xD;
      letter will be sent to aid recall. If a participant withdraws from the study after they find&#xD;
      out which arm they have been allocated they will not be replaced in the study as&#xD;
      acceptability of randomisation is one of the outcomes of interest in this feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will also conduct post-intervention interviews at four-months and post-measures&#xD;
      at six-week and four-month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in each arm will also receive care as usual based on the discharge report from&#xD;
      the ESSD team from the neurological outpatient therapy service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm- compassionate imagery Based on previous literature, namely O'Neill and&#xD;
      McMillan (2012), the compassion focussed intervention will be based on compassionate imagery.&#xD;
      As suggested by the researchers in this study, the intervention will be delivered over a&#xD;
      number of sessions to aid learning and retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A researcher will meet with the individual for up to three sessions and deliver a&#xD;
      compassionate imagery intervention. The first session will be face to face with the option of&#xD;
      delivering the other two sessions remotely (either via Skype or phone calls). It is important&#xD;
      to conduct the first session face to face so that the intervention can be adapted as needed&#xD;
      depending on the ability/needs of the participant. The other two sessions may be delivered&#xD;
      remotely depending on the researcher's time constraints and participant preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked if they would like to take a copy of the recording or script home&#xD;
      with them after the first session to practice. This will allow the researcher to troubleshoot&#xD;
      any potential problems during the second and third sessions. The participant will keep the&#xD;
      script/ recording for the duration of the study and will have the option to keep this after&#xD;
      the study is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention, the participant will be asked to create a compassionate image.&#xD;
      Compassionate imagery works on the premise that we can stimulate different systems in our&#xD;
      brain by imagining certain situations/ pictures. For example, if you are hungry and imagine a&#xD;
      nice meal, you will activate the same bodily systems as if the meal were right in front of&#xD;
      you. The same premise works for imagining threatening stimuli; our own self-talk and images&#xD;
      we create in our head can lead to an activation in the threat system. The same can be said&#xD;
      for compassion; if we imagine someone saying kind and reassuring words to us, it can activate&#xD;
      the soothing system within our brain. Compassionate imagery therefore, encourages an&#xD;
      individual to be self-compassionate and kinder to ones-self in order to reduce the threat&#xD;
      system (see Gilbert, 2010 for further description).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be asked to create a compassionate other/ place that is wise, warm,&#xD;
      strong and non-judgemental. Someone or something that wants the best for you, provides&#xD;
      unconditional love and gives encouragement. The aim of this is to stimulate the self-soothing&#xD;
      system and to reduce self-criticism. See Intervention script 181002 for the proposed&#xD;
      intervention script for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is postulated that three sessions will be an effective way to deliver the intervention&#xD;
      based on clinical judgment of psychologists working within the Derbyshire NHS stroke team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will not place restrictions on carers being present during the intervention&#xD;
      sessions. However, the researcher will monitor the carer's influence on the session and&#xD;
      reserves the right to ask the carer to leave if they are adversely affecting the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Service-user involvement; Researchers have held a consultation meeting with a stakeholder&#xD;
      group: to ascertain the feasibility of delivering this intervention and to highlight any&#xD;
      barriers they envisage. The proposed intervention has been refined accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active control arm The details of participant's who have been consented in to the study and&#xD;
      randomised to the control arm will be passed on to volunteers from a local stroke association&#xD;
      group who have agreed to provide a befriending service. These volunteers have a good working&#xD;
      relationship with the Derbyshire NHS Trust and have up to date DBS checks to meet with&#xD;
      patients in their own homes. Volunteers have also attended training programmes as part of the&#xD;
      work they currently do with Derbyshire NHS Trust. The volunteer will then contact&#xD;
      participants to arrange to either meet that participants in a place that is convenient for&#xD;
      them or have a phone conversation at a convenient time for them. If the participant decided&#xD;
      it is more convenient to meet outside of their home, travel and parking expenses will be paid&#xD;
      for the participant and volunteer by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will meet or talk to the volunteer for up to three sessions. These will occur&#xD;
      once a week for up-to one hour-per-week and will be recorded for content via a Dictaphone.&#xD;
      Participants will receive befriending support from the same volunteer throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carers will be asked not to be present for these sessions to reduce burden on the volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is envisaged that participants and volunteers will discuss themes around recovery, loss of&#xD;
      self and role, and re-gaining valued roles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment as usual arm Participants will be contacted by the researcher to inform them that&#xD;
      they have been allocated to the treatment as usual arm and reminded what this entails. They&#xD;
      will also be reminded that they will be contacted again in six weeks and four months to&#xD;
      completed post measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post intervention interviews Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 6-8 participants&#xD;
      (3-4 per arm) to provide a description of the acceptability of the design and procedures of&#xD;
      the trial (see Interview script 181002 for interview scripts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent for interviews will be obtained at the start of the study. Participants will&#xD;
      be selected iteratively using purposive sampling to represent participants from all three&#xD;
      arms and to include a range of severity of distress at baseline. Interviews will be recorded,&#xD;
      and consent confirmed at the start of the interview. Interviews will be conducted by an&#xD;
      external researcher and transcribed by the lead researcher.&#xD;

    <description>Analysing pre-post scores on the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). This scale has 4 sub-scales. Subscale scores are computed by calculating the mean of subscale item responses. To compute a total self-compassion score, reverse score the negative subscale items before calculating subscale means - self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification (i.e., 1 = 5, 2 = 4, 3 = 3. 4 = 2, 5 = 1) - then compute a grand mean of all six subscale means. Researchers can choose to analyze their data either by using individual sub-scale sores or by using a total score. Subscale scores range form 5-25 with higher scores indicating more compassion.</description>
