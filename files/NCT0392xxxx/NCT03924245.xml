      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of olaparib and entinostat and&#xD;
      to see how well they work in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian&#xD;
      tube cancers that have come back or do not respond to platinum-based chemotherapy. Olaparib&#xD;
      and entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of olaparib and entinostat&#xD;
      in the treatment of recurrent, platinum-refractory or resistant high-grade serous carcinoma&#xD;
      of the ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum. (Phase I) II. Determine the objective response&#xD;
      rate in patients with recurrent, platinum-refractory or resistant, homologous repair&#xD;
      proficient (HRP) high-grade carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum treated with&#xD;
      the combination of olaparib and entinostat at the recommended phase 2 dose, as determined in&#xD;
      phase I of this trial. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of olaparib and entinostat in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent, platinum-refractory or resistant high-grade serous carcinoma of the&#xD;
      ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum. (Phase I) II. Further assess the nature and degree of&#xD;
      toxicity of olaparib and entinostat in this cohort of patients. (Phase II) III. Determine the&#xD;
      clinical benefit rate (CBR) (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease&#xD;
      [SD]) as assessed at the time of best response to therapy). (Phase II) IV. Determine the&#xD;
      progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (Phase II) V. Determine the duration of&#xD;
      response (DoR). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the correlation between the Myriad myChoice homologous recombination pathway&#xD;
      deficiency (HRD) score and the response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the degree of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in circulating tumor cells and&#xD;
      tumor biopsies (optional) after cycle 2 and at the end of treatment by phosphorylated (p)HAX2&#xD;
      and PAR and correlate with the response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess baseline cyclin E amplification in ovarian tumors by fluorescence in situ&#xD;
      hybridization (FISH) and correlate with response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the expression of ki67/mib1 as a marker of cell proliferation in circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells and in tumor biopsy specimens (optional) after cycle 2 of therapy and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment and correlate with response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Measure cyclin E1, CDK2, E2F1, and BRD expression by immunohistochemistry in circulating&#xD;
      tumor cells and in tumor biopsy specimens (optional) after cycle 2 of therapy and at the end&#xD;
      of treatment and correlate with response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) 1 week before starting combination therapy (day -7).&#xD;
      Patients then receive entinostat PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and olaparib PO twice daily&#xD;
      (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression and&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
