  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) based on concentric exercise training has become an integral&#xD;
      component in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),&#xD;
      improving functional capacities while diminishing symptoms and improving quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the response to concentric exercise training is heterogeneous from one COPD patient&#xD;
      to another. The inability of some COPD patients to achieve the exercise intensities required&#xD;
      to stress limb muscles due to severe ventilatory limitation could partially explain their&#xD;
      poor response to training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endurance exercise with eccentric muscle contractions could be an interesting alternative to&#xD;
      concentric exercise because it produces greater muscle force through its lower metabolic&#xD;
      cost. Eccentric exercise could allow patients with severe airflow limitation to perform&#xD;
      prolonged exercise sessions with sufficient intensity to improve muscle function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, a recent study performed in healthy young subjects reported that eccentric&#xD;
      exercise induced a more hyperpneic breathing pattern (i.e., lower tidal volume and higher&#xD;
      breathing frequency) that concentric for a given minute ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of CONvEX study is to compare ventilatory adaptation between two&#xD;
      modalities of exercise performed on cycle ergometer (concentric versus eccentric) in severe&#xD;
      COPD patients.&#xD;
