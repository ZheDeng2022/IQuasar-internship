    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of a heterologous 2-dose&#xD;
      regimen utilizing Ad26.ZEBOV (first vaccination; Dose 1) and MVA-BN-Filo (second vaccination;&#xD;
      Dose 2) administered intramuscularly (IM) on Days 1 and 57, respectively (Main Study) and&#xD;
      also to provide the heterologous 2-dose vaccination regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV on Day 1 and&#xD;
      MVABN-Filo on Day 57) to participants in the control arm of the main study (Extension Phase).&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be administered 0.5 mL of Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine (5*10^10 viral particles [vp]) on Day 1 by intramuscular (IM) injection followed by 0.5 mL of MVA-BN-Filo (1*10^8 infectious units [Inf U]) vaccine by IM injection on Day 57. Participants will also receive a dose of MenACWY at the 6-months post-dose-2 visit.
