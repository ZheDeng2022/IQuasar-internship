  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bullous pemphigoid is the most common type of bullous skin disease and is clinically&#xD;
      characterized by clear-tense bullae, which result in post-bullous cutaneous erosions,&#xD;
      altering the skin barrier. The treatment of this pathology consists of the application of&#xD;
      high doses of topical corticosteroids (clobetasol propionate) for a prolonged period of at&#xD;
      least 6 months. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate a change in bone mineral&#xD;
      density at 6 months after initiation of treatment, in subjects with bullous pemphigoid and&#xD;
      treated with topical corticosteroid.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoids have direct effects on bone remodeling by suppressing bone formation&#xD;
      (inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation, inhibition of mature osteoblasts function and&#xD;
      apoptosis of mature osteoblasts) and by increasing bone resorption (decrease in osteoclast&#xD;
      apoptosis and stimulation of osteoclastogenesis). They also have indirect bone effects by&#xD;
      decreasing the intestinal absorption of calcium and increasing its urinary excretion, and by&#xD;
      inhibiting the somatotropic and gonadotropic axis. This pathophysiology results in excessive&#xD;
      bone fragility. Bone loss and increased incidence of fractures occur within 6 months after&#xD;
      the introduction of oral corticosteroid therapy, with a partially reversible phenomenon&#xD;
      within months of discontinuation. The extent of bone loss depends on the dose and duration of&#xD;
      glucocorticoid administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The systemic transition of topical corticosteroids depends on several parameters such as&#xD;
      excipients, anatomical location, cutaneous state, the dose used and the duration of exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clobetasol propionate, used for long-term use in bullous pemphigoid, is a Class IV&#xD;
      dermocorticoid (highly potent). Patients with bullous pemphigoid will benefit from bone&#xD;
      densitometry at the initiation of treatment, at 3 months (theoretical end of the treatment of&#xD;
      attack) and at 6 months (theoretical end of the treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also benefit a blood test of serum calcium, phosphoremia, albumin, 25 OH&#xD;
      vitamin D and cortisol at 8 to highlight possible correlations between changes in bone&#xD;
      mineral density and phosphocalcic parameters and 8 cortisolemia (braking of the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also benefit from standard radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine at the&#xD;
      initiation of treatment and at 6 months. Follow-up is planned over 6 months, with 2 follow-up&#xD;
      visits at 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
