    <textblock>
      This study compares insulin 287 (a possible new medicine) to insulin glargine (a medicine&#xD;
      doctors can already prescribe) in people with type 2 diabetes. Different ways of switching&#xD;
      from the insulin which the participants are already on to insulin 287 are also compared. This&#xD;
      is done to find the best way to switch to insulin 287. The participants will either get&#xD;
      insulin 287 that they will have to inject once a week or insulin glargine that they will have&#xD;
      to inject once a day. Which treatment any participant gets is decided by chance. The study&#xD;
      will last for about 5 months (23 weeks). The participants will have 14 clinic visits and 6&#xD;
      phone calls with the study doctor. At 3 of the clinic visits participants will be asked not&#xD;
      to eat or drink anything (except for water) in the last 8 hours before the visit. During the&#xD;
      study, the doctor will ask the participants to: 1) measure their blood sugar every day with a&#xD;
      blood sugar meter using a finger prick; 2) write down different information in a diary daily&#xD;
      and return this to their study doctor. 3) wear a medical device (sensor) that measures the&#xD;
      participants blood sugar all the time for 18 weeks (about 4 months) during the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>During the last 2 weeks of treatment (week 15 and 16)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of time spent in glycaemic target range was calculated as 100 times the number of recorded measurements in glycaemic target range 3.9-10.0 mmol/L (70-180 mg/dL), both inclusive divided by the total number of recorded measurements. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period, which was the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, excluding any period after initiation of a non-randomised insulin treatment (rescue medication).</description>

    <description>An adverse event(AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject administered or using a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or usage.. A TEAE was defined as an event that had onset date (or increase in severity) during the on-treatment observation period. The on-treatment observation period was the time period from first dose of trial product until the follow-up visit or the last date on trial product + 5 weeks for once daily insulin and +6 weeks for once weekly insulin. Safety analysis set (SAS) included all subjects exposed to at least one dose of trial product.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 34 sites in 5 countries as follows: Canada (10), Italy (5), Czech Republic (4), Germany (5) and the United States (10). In addition, 3 sites in the United states and 1 site in Germany screened, but didn't randomise any subjects.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomised to receive once weekly insulin 287 using any of 2 different switch approaches or once daily insulin glargine; as an add-on to background therapy with basal insulin analogue with metformin, with or without dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) and with or without sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) at stable, pre-trial dose and at same frequency during the entire treatment period unless due to safety concerns related to the background medication.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Insulin 287 (Without Loading Dose)</title>
          <description>Participants were to receive once weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of insulin 287 for 16 weeks, using PDS290 prefilled pen-injector at a starting dose of 7 times the pre-trial basal insulin dose of the respective participants ('unit to unit switch' approach: current daily dose x 7). Participants were to perform once daily pre-breakfast self-monitoring plasma glucose (SMPG). The dose was adjusted based on 3 pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the 2 previous days and the day of the contact. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 4.4 millimoles per litre (mmol/L): dose reduced by 28 U; 4.4-7.2 mmol/L: no adjustment; &gt; 7.2 mmol/L: dose increased by 28 U. If the participant received a twice-daily regimen with any basal insulin analogue or a once-daily regimen with insulin glargine U300 prior to randomisation, the total daily insulin dose prior to randomisation was reduced by 20%.</description>

          <description>Participants were to receive once weekly s.c. injection of insulin 287 for 16 weeks, using PDS290 prefilled pen-injector at a starting dose of 7 times the pre-trial basal insulin dose of the respective participants with additional loading dose ('unit to unit switch with an additional 100% loading dose' approach: current daily dose x 7 x 2). Participants were to perform once daily pre-breakfast SMPG. The dose was adjusted based on 3 pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the 2 previous days and the day of the contact. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 4.4 millimoles per litre (mmol/L): dose reduced by 28 U; 4.4-7.2 mmol/L: no adjustment; &gt; 7.2 mmol/L: insulin dose increased by 28 U.

          <description>Participants were to receive once daily s.c. injection of insulin glargine U100 for 16 weeks, using SoloSTAR prefilled pen-injector at a starting dose same as the pre-trial basal insulin. Participants were to perform once daily pre-breakfast SMPG. The dose was adjusted based on 3 pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the 2 previous days and the day of the contact. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 4.4 millimoles per litre (mmol/L): dose reduced by 4 U; 4.4-7.2 mmol/L: no adjustment; &gt; 7.2 mmol/L: insulin dose increased by 4 U. If the participant received a twice-daily regimen with any basal insulin analogue or a once-daily regimen with insulin glargine U300 prior to randomisation, the total daily insulin dose prior to randomisation was reduced by 20%.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Time in Target Range 3.9-10.0 mmol/L (70-180 Milligrams Per Deciliter (mg/dL)) Measured Using CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring)</title>
        <description>The percentage of time spent in glycaemic target range was calculated as 100 times the number of recorded measurements in glycaemic target range 3.9-10.0 mmol/L (70-180 mg/dL), both inclusive divided by the total number of recorded measurements. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period, which was the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, excluding any period after initiation of a non-randomised insulin treatment (rescue medication).</description>

            <description>Participants were to receive once weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of insulin 287 for 16 weeks, using PDS290 prefilled pen-injector at a starting dose of 7 times the pre-trial basal insulin dose of the respective participants ('unit to unit switch' approach: current daily dose x 7). Participants were to perform once daily pre-breakfast self-monitoring plasma glucose (SMPG). The dose was adjusted based on 3 pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the 2 previous days and the day of the contact. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 4.4 millimoles per litre (mmol/L): dose reduced by 28 U; 4.4-7.2 mmol/L: no adjustment; &gt; 7.2 mmol/L: dose increased by 28 U.

            <description>Participants were to receive once weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of insulin 287 for 16 weeks, using PDS290 prefilled pen-injector at a starting dose of 7 times the pre-trial basal insulin dose of the respective participants ('unit to unit switch' approach: current daily dose x 7). Participants were to perform once daily pre-breakfast self-monitoring plasma glucose (SMPG). The dose was adjusted based on 3 pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the 2 previous days and the day of the contact. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 4.4 millimoles per litre (mmol/L): dose reduced by 28 U; 4.4-7.2 mmol/L: no adjustment; &gt; 7.2 mmol/L: dose increased by 28 U.
