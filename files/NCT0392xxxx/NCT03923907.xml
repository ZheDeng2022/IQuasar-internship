  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Non-dipping hypertension(HT) (as defined by lack of decrease in systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) by 10% during sleep) predicts cardiovascular events and mortality; however,&#xD;
      there is a lack of evidence based treatment for non-dipping HT. While exercise is recommended&#xD;
      to management HT, its effect on dipping status is not known. There is a lack of trials&#xD;
      describing the relationship of exercise and blood pressure in Chinese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This will be a two-arm randomized controlled trial in which Chinese non-dippers (n=&#xD;
      198) will be randomized to an exercise program plus usual care or to usual care by stratified&#xD;
      randomization. The randomization sequence is blinded to the investigators and allocation is&#xD;
      disclosed only after valid consent. The exercise program utilizes various motivational&#xD;
      techniques to enhance exercise maintenance.&#xD;

    <description>patients with Hypertension (HT) will be recruited by a trained nurse when the patient attends the yearly to bi-yearly complication screening program called the risk assessment and management program (RAMP) program. This program is provided to all patients with HT, who are seen in the Government-funded primary care clinics in Hong Kong. The nurse will encourage the patient by motivational interviewing techniques and prescribe exercise. Combined exercise skills will be taught in the 12-week weekly exercise classes by certified physical trainers. Peer support is encouraged during and after the 12-week program. Regular feedback, prompting and problem solving will be provided by the nurse at 3m, 6m, and 12m. Exercise level will be monitored by validated wrist trackers to feedback participants, nurse and physical trainer by mobile apps and website. Resources to exercise will be made known to patients by apps, website and healthcare professionals.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>There is no extra intervention to patients allocated in this arm, except that they receive information and advice on lifestyle changes including benefits from exercise from the nurse at recruitment as stated above. Participants in both arms will have no changes in medication within the first 12-week to determine the BP difference between the two groups. In Hong Kong, patients have unlimited access to emergency department and general outpatient services. All patients with HT receive RAMP program counselling and screening every 1-2 years. These are not limited by the current trial.</description>

             recommendation, which is exercise of moderate intensity less than 150minutes/week OR&#xD;
             exercise of vigorous intensity of less than 75 minutes/week&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Used any mobile apps on their phone (because the intervention involve use of apps to&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diagnosed chronic obstructive lung disease and recent stroke (within&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  diagnosed Obstructive Sleep Apnea&#xD;
