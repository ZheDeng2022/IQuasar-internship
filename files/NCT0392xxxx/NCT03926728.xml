    <textblock>
      The present trial is a phase I, double-blind, parallel, randomised, and placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial of a chlamydia vaccine CTH522. Sixty-six subjects will be randomly assigned into six&#xD;
      cohorts and are to receive four vaccination, in total of 12 trial visits. Cohorts A-D&#xD;
      investigates CTH522-CAF01 administered IM in two doses (85 µg and 15 µg). Cohort E&#xD;
      investigate CTH522-CAF09b also administered IM in one dose (85 µg). Cohort E is the placebo&#xD;
      group. All subjects will receive a TO administration as a boost at Day 140 (4th vaccination).&#xD;
      The TO boost will be non-adjuvanted CTH522 (12µg in each eye) or placebo. Nine subjects in&#xD;
      each of cohorts A-E will receive the active boost (i.e. CTH522), three subjects will receive&#xD;
      the placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is a phase I, double-blind, parallel, randomised, and placebo-controlled trial of&#xD;
      the chlamydia vaccine CTH522 in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to randomly assign 66 subjects into six cohorts. Cohorts A-D investigate&#xD;
      CTH522-CAF01 administered IM in two doses (85 μg and 15 μg). Cohort E investigates&#xD;
      CTH522-CAF09b administered IM in one dose (85 μg). Cohort F is the placebo group. The&#xD;
      enrolled subjects will complete 12 trial visits. All subjects in the active groups (cohort&#xD;
      A-E) will receive three IM injections of the adjuvanted CTH522 and some (cohort B and C) will&#xD;
      receive the non-adjuvanted CTH522 via the TO or ID route (given at the same time as the 2nd&#xD;
      and 3rd IM vaccinations). All active groups will receive TO administration as a boost at Day&#xD;
      140 of either the non-adjuvanted CTH522 (12 μg in each eye) or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A will receive three IM vaccination of 85μg CTH522-CAF01. This cohort is divided&#xD;
           into two groups: A1 will receive ID placebo at Day 28 + Day 112, and TO placebo at Day&#xD;
           140, while A2 will receive TO placebo at Day 28 + Day 112, and non-adjuvanted TO CTH522&#xD;
           boost at Day 140.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B will receive three IM vaccinations of 85 μg CTH522-CAF01. This cohort is&#xD;
           divided into two groups: B1 will receive TO vaccination of the non-adjuvanted CTH522 at&#xD;
           Day 28 and 112 and TO placebo at Day 140, while B2 will receive the same for Day 28 and&#xD;
           112, but non-adjuvanted TO CTH522 boost at Day 140. The two additional TO doses of&#xD;
           CTH522 (12 μg in each eye) are administered in each eye. The rationale for this schedule&#xD;
           is to investigate the impact of simultaneous TO administration of the antigen on the&#xD;
           immunogenicity results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C will receive three IM vaccinations of 85 μg CTH522-CAF01. This cohort is&#xD;
           divided into two groups: C1 will receive ID vaccination of the non-adjuvanted 24 μg&#xD;
           CTH522 at Day 28 and 112 and TO placebo at Day 140, while C2 will receive the same for&#xD;
           Day 28 and 112, but TO 12 μg CTH522 boost in each eye at Day 140. The rationale for this&#xD;
           schedule is to investigate the impact of simultaneous ID administration of the antigen&#xD;
           on the immunogenicity results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort D will receive three IM vaccinations of 15 μg CTH522-CAF01. The rationale for the&#xD;
           A and D cohorts is to investigate the impact of the two IM CTH522 doses on the&#xD;
           immunogenicity results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort E will receive three IM vaccinations of 85 μg CTH522-CAF09b. The rationale for&#xD;
           the A and E cohorts is to investigate the impact of the adjuvant on the immunogenicity&#xD;
           results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort F will receive only placebo in the form of 0.9% NaCl saline (IM, ID and TO).&#xD;

        neurological, psychiatric or clinically significant abnormality of haematological or&#xD;
        biochemical parameters EX4: Has BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 EX5: Is currently participating in another&#xD;

        or plans to receive, any immunisation within 14 days of the start of the trial or during&#xD;

        immunosuppressive agents. Topical steroids are allowed unless applied to the IM or ID&#xD;

        suitable for participation in the trial EX9: Is known or confirmed to have an allergy to&#xD;
        any of the vaccine constituents EX10: Is unable to refrain from the use of contact lenses.&#xD;
        Contact lenses should be avoided two days before TO administration and for seven days later&#xD;

        ophthalmoscopic exam at screening or any medical history of ocular disease that, in the&#xD;
