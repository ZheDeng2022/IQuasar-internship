      The treatment options majorly consist of medical management with at least 6-month long&#xD;
      treatment with antifungal drugs - most significantly the azole groups. Itraconazole is the&#xD;
      preferred azole for the treatment of CPA. The duration of treatment with oral itraconazole&#xD;
      remains uncertain. In a previous study the use of oral itraconazole for 6-months a favorable&#xD;
      overall response was seen in 76% of the subjects. Moreover, about 30%-50% of the subjects&#xD;
      have disease relapse that requires prolonged therapy. It is likely that a longer duration of&#xD;
      itraconazole would have a higher response rate and thus, lower risk of relapse after&#xD;
      discontinuation of therapy. In this randomized controlled trial, we compare the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of six months versus twelve months of itraconazole therapy in treatment naïve&#xD;
      subjects with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspergillus is a saprophytic fungus which is present normally in our surroundings and causes&#xD;
      a large number of pulmonary diseases spreading through inhalational route. The spectrum of&#xD;
      disease caused by aspergillus spp. is wide with the manifestations of the disease being&#xD;
      governed primarily by the status of the underlying host immunity, which then determines the&#xD;
      nature of the host-aspergillus interaction. Patients with an intact immunity have a more&#xD;
      stable and indolent form of disease like aspergilloma whereas with a worsening immune status,&#xD;
      the risk of invasive disease increases. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) and allergic&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) are two of the commonest pulmonary manifestations seen&#xD;
      in non-immunocompromised patients whereas invasive pulmonary aspergillosis being more common&#xD;
      in the immunocompromised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimates suggest that CPA affects around 3 million people across the globe, which may still&#xD;
      be an under estimated number as the disease co exists with other pulmonary co-morbidities&#xD;
      which make accurate diagnosis a pitfall. In India the annual incidence of CPA was estimated&#xD;
      in 2011 and varied between 27,000-0.17 million cases, with different estimates. Based on the&#xD;
      mortality rate for CPA which was estimated to be 15% annually, the 5-year prevalence of CPA&#xD;
      was placed at 290,147 cases with 5-year prevalence rate being 24 per 100,000 in the same&#xD;
      year. The disease confers significant morbidity and mortality, making it a significant burden&#xD;
      for the society as well as the healthcare. Apart from the respiratory symptoms, CPA causes&#xD;
      significant constitutional symptoms as well which adds to the misery of the patient. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of CPA is based on presence of chronic symptoms, consistent radiology and&#xD;
      demonstration of Aspergillus by direct (culture) or indirect (serological) methods. Even&#xD;
      though CPA is more of a disease spectrum but overall it is characterized by slowly&#xD;
      progressive lung cavitation which may or may not show presence of mycetoma /fungal ball in&#xD;
      patients with pre-existing structural lung diseases, even though other patterns have also&#xD;
      been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment options majorly consist of medical management with at least 6-month long&#xD;
      treatment with antifungal drugs - most significantly the azole groups. Itraconazole is the&#xD;
      preferred azole for the treatment of CPA. The duration of treatment with oral itraconazole&#xD;
      remains uncertain. In a previous study the use of oral itraconazole for 6-months a favorable&#xD;
      overall response was seen in 76% of the subjects. Moreover, about 30%-50% of the subjects&#xD;
      have disease relapse that requires prolonged therapy. It is likely that a longer duration of&#xD;
      itraconazole would have a higher response rate and thus, lower risk of relapse after&#xD;
      discontinuation of therapy. In this randomized controlled trial, we compare the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of six months versus twelve months of itraconazole therapy in treatment naïve&#xD;
      subjects with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.&#xD;
