    <textblock>
      This is a proposal for a retrospective observational study of the safety of metformin use in&#xD;
      patients with chronic kidney disease, compared to other commonly used diabetes drugs. It will&#xD;
      be conducted using retrospective data from the New York City CDRN, Medicare administrate&#xD;
      files, and New York State Medicaid administrative files, which will be linked and then&#xD;
      deidentified prior to analysis.&#xD;

      Specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. For patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus(T2DM) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD),&#xD;
      compare metformin to alternative non-insulin diabetes drugs (sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors,&#xD;
      GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT-2 inhibitors)) with respect to the key safety outcome of&#xD;
      severe hypoglycemia. The primary hypothesis is that metformin will be superior to&#xD;
      sulfonylurea in terms of severe hypoglycemia rates, and non-inferior to DPP-4 inhibitors.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include hospitalization for acidosis, hospitalization for&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and heart&#xD;
      failure emergency room visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. For patients with T2DM and CKD, compare metformin to alternative non-insulin diabetes&#xD;
      drugs with respect to HbA1c reduction. The primary hypothesis is that metformin will be&#xD;
      superior to DPP-4 inhibitors and non-inferior to sulfonylureas for HbA1c reduction (i.e.,&#xD;
      improvement in blood sugar). Secondary outcomes will include change in body-mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      and kidney function, non-persistence to treatment, and progression to insulin use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Examine the heterogeneity of treatment effects on hypoglycemia risk and HbA1c response&#xD;
      across patient subgroups. The primary hypothesis is that metformin's advantages will be more&#xD;
      pronounced in more severe CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4 (data completeness): Using the linked Medicare-CDRN dataset, assess completeness of&#xD;
      CDRN data for drugs and hospitalization among Medicare recipients. Specifically, we will use&#xD;
      Medicare data from 2013-2016 as a gold standard and assess the sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of INSIGHT CDRN data&#xD;
      from those years in identifying hospitalizations and prevalent diabetes drug use among&#xD;
      Medicare patients with T2DM (type 2 diabetes mellitus), and develop and validate an algorithm&#xD;
      to identify patients for whom NPV and PPV for hospitalizations and all major diabetes drug&#xD;
      classes exceed 80%. We hypothesize that such an algorithm will identify a population of a&#xD;
      quarter of eligible Medicare patients in the CDRN who meet or exceed these standards for&#xD;
      completeness of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5. Conduct a cohort study to test the hypothesis that poorly controlled baseline HbA1c is&#xD;
      not independently associated with the primary outcome (hospitalization with COVID). Primary&#xD;
      analysis will be restricted to Medicare patients identified by aim 1 as likely to surpass 80%&#xD;
      NPV and PPV for the primary outcome. A finding that HbA1c is not associated with worse&#xD;
      outcomes would support relaxing glycemic targets during the pandemic when this allows&#xD;
      patients to avoid unnecessary risks associated with aggressive treatment, monitoring, and&#xD;
      exposure to the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 6: Conduct a comparative cohort study to test the null hypothesis that metformin, SGLT-2&#xD;
      inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and sulfonylureas do not have&#xD;
      class-specific effects on the primary outcome. Primary analysis will be restricted to&#xD;
      Medicare patients identified by aim 1 as likely to surpass 80% NPV and PPV both for the&#xD;
      primary outcome and exposure to the drug of interest. Two sub-hypotheses would be of special&#xD;
      interest: if SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with increased risk, this would support&#xD;
      suggestions that they be temporarily stopped in high risk patients; if DPP-4 inhibitors are&#xD;
      associated with decreased risk, this would argue for prospective research into this class as&#xD;
      protective agents.&#xD;
