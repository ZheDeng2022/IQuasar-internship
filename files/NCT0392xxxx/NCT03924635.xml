      This is a randomised, active-comparator, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre phase IV&#xD;
      exploratory study to characterise changes in airway inflammation, symptoms, lung function,&#xD;
      and reliever use in asthma patients using SABA (salbutamol) or anti inflammatory reliever&#xD;
      (SYMBICORT®) as reliever medication in addition to SYMBICORT as daily asthma controller.&#xD;
      Eligible patients diagnosed with asthma at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit (Visit&#xD;
      1) and fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      continue into the Run-in Period. At Visit 2, patients will be assessed for randomisation&#xD;
      criteria and, if met, will be randomised to receive either SYMBICORT as maintenance and&#xD;
      reliever treatment or SYMBICORT as maintenance treatment and salbutamol as reliever treatment&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation will be stratified by the patient's ongoing dose of inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids [(ICS) low or medium] or long-acting β2-agonist (ICS/LABA) at study entry.&#xD;

      This is a randomised, active-comparator, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre phase IV&#xD;
      exploratory study to characterise changes in airway inflammation, symptoms, lung function,&#xD;
      and reliever use in asthma patients using SABA (salbutamol) or anti-inflammatory reliever&#xD;
      (SYMBICORT®) as reliever medication in addition to SYMBICORT as daily asthma controller.&#xD;
      Eligible patients diagnosed with asthma at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit (Visit&#xD;
      1) and fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      continue into the Run-in Period. During the run-in period, patients will take their&#xD;
      maintenance medication (ie, SYMBICORT [100/6 or 200/6 μg, × 2 BID]) and reliever salbutamol&#xD;
      [100 μg, PRN]) using the connected inhalers. At Visit 2, patients will be assessed for&#xD;
      randomisation criteria and, if met, will be randomised to receive either SYMBICORT as&#xD;
      maintenance and reliever treatment or SYMBICORT as maintenance treatment and salbutamol as&#xD;
      reliever treatment in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation will be stratified by the patient's ongoing&#xD;
      dose of ICS (low or medium) or long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) at study entry. This study will&#xD;
      include a minimum of 3 site visits. Patients will be requested to come to the study site for&#xD;
      4 additional Event Visits (E1 to E4) at approximately 4-day intervals beginning after the&#xD;
      first visit if they experience any one of the following 3 criteria: a) A severe exacerbation&#xD;
      defined as use of systemic steroids for at least 3 days, emergency room visit, or inpatient&#xD;
      hospitalisation due to asthma, b) Symptom worsening criteria based on CompEx evaluation - an&#xD;
      asthma worsening identified by a combination of deteriorations in at least 2 variables&#xD;
      (decrease in PEF of at least 15% compared with baseline, an increase of reliever medication&#xD;
      of at least 1.5 occasions compared with baseline, or an increase in asthma symptoms of at&#xD;
      least 1 compare with baseline or the absolute max score [=3]) at least 2 consecutive days, or&#xD;
      c) A single day (in 24 hours) with 6 or more occasions of reliever medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of participation in the study will be 26 to 28 weeks (maximum) for each&#xD;
      individual patient, including a 2-week Run-in Period, followed by a 24-week randomised&#xD;
      Treatment Period and an additional follow-up period if the Event Visits fall within the final&#xD;
      2 weeks of the Treatment Period. The study plans to randomise a minimum of 60 patients to a&#xD;
      maximum of 80 patients to achieve at least 54 patients completing the study. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted at no less than 2 sites in the United Kingdom (UK). The estimated study duration&#xD;
      is approximately 30 months.&#xD;

             corticosteroids [or one depot intramuscular injection of a glucocorticosteroid], an&#xD;
             urgent care or emergency room visit that results in systemic corticosteroids, or an&#xD;
             inpatient hospitalisation due to asthma) within 30 days prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca&#xD;
             staff and/or staff at the study site).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Previous randomisation in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. For women only: currently pregnant (confirmed with positive pregnancy test),&#xD;
             breast-feeding or planned pregnancy during the study. Fertile women not using&#xD;
             acceptable contraceptive measures, as judged by the Investigator. Periodic abstinence,&#xD;
             spermicides only, and the lactational amenorrhoea method are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Planned hospitalisation during the study that would interfere with study objectives as&#xD;
             judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
