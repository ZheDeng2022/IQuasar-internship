      This study aims to assess the efficacy of fFN compared to transvaginal ultrasound of cervix&#xD;
      in prediction of successful induction of labor for unfavorable cervix (bishop score 5 or&#xD;
      less).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labor should be undertaken when the benefits of delivery to either mother or&#xD;
      fetus outweigh the risks of pregnancy continuation. Many accepted medical and obstetric&#xD;
      indications for labor induction like Hypertensive disorders, Preeclampsia/ eclampsia,&#xD;
      Gestational hypertension, Maternal medical conditions, Diabetes mellitus, Renal disease,&#xD;
      Chronic pulmonary disease, Chorioamnionitis and Oligohydramnios .Sonographic assessment of&#xD;
      cervical length for predicting the outcome of labor induction has been evaluated in numerous&#xD;
      studies. The role of ultrasound examination as a tool for selecting women likely to have a&#xD;
      successful induction is uncertain . transvaginal sonographic measurements of cervical length&#xD;
      in nulliparous women independently predict the likelihood of progress in nulliparous women&#xD;
      undergoing labor induction. These observations strongly support the notion that in&#xD;
      nulliparous women undergoing labor induction preinduction cervical length plays a key role in&#xD;
      labor progression during the latent phase, but not during the active phase of labor .Entering&#xD;
      the active phase within 24 hr of induction. On the other hand, cervical length appears to&#xD;
      poorly predict the likelihood of cesarean delivery for failure to Bishop's score has the&#xD;
      advantage of being universally known . The cutoff point at which delivery can be induced&#xD;
      without increasing the risk of cesarean delivery is generally 7 or 6, but this varies from&#xD;
      one country to another depending on different local guidelines 6 7 8. However, that point is&#xD;
      rarely reached in reality. What's more, Bishop's score does not include parity, even though&#xD;
      this variable is known for being closely associated with the induction success. Last, several&#xD;
      authors have shown that some components of Bishop's score have a low prognostic value for the&#xD;
      success or the failure of the induction .The Bishop score is a poor predictor for the outcome&#xD;
      of induced labor at term and should not be used to decide whether to induce labor or not&#xD;
      .Fibronectin is large glycoprotein (molecular mass about 420kDa) is normally present in&#xD;
      essentially all tissues and body fluids. Its primary function is its role in cell adhesion&#xD;
      and phagocytosis .Fetal fibronectin, a glycoprotein thought to act as an adherent at the&#xD;
      maternal fetal interface, is uncommonly present in cervicovaginal secretions in the late&#xD;
      second and early third trimesters. Although the risk for preterm birth increases as the level&#xD;
      of fetal fibronectin rises, it has been evaluated only as a qualitative test, with a value of&#xD;
      50ng/dL or greater being called positive. A positive test is believed to indicate disruption&#xD;
      of the maternal-fetal decidual attachment. Asymptomatic women with a positive fetal&#xD;
      fibronectin test have an increased risk for preterm birth before 35 weeks, especially within&#xD;
      2 weeks of a positive result. Although the sensitivity of the fibronectin test at 22 to 24&#xD;
      weeks for all spontaneous births before 35 weeks was only 25%, sensitivity for births before&#xD;
      28 weeks was 65% in one study .fFN has been proposed as a new tool for cervical evaluation&#xD;
      before labor induction. fFN in cervicovaginal secretion of term deliveries yield a high&#xD;
      probability of success of induction women with fibronective negative cervicovaginal secretion&#xD;
      and unfavorable cervix score induction of labour should not be attempted .&#xD;
