  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate residual limb circulation and skin health associated&#xD;
      with the use of a prosthetic vacuum socket. A conventional non-vacuum prosthetic socket will&#xD;
      be compared to a vacuum prosthetic socket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prosthetic suspension plays a pivotal role in an amputee's comfort. It can also&#xD;
      significantly impact an amputee's limb health. If the prosthesis is not held securely to the&#xD;
      amputee's limb, relative movement between the limb and prosthetic interface can cause&#xD;
      bruising, skin irritation and skin breakdown. These poor outcomes are uncomfortable and can&#xD;
      lead to much more serious health conditions. A positive solution to creating secure and&#xD;
      comfortable suspension is the use of a vacuum suspension socket. The vacuum pressure assists&#xD;
      in preventing movement in the socket. The clinical benefits associated with vacuum suspension&#xD;
      include volume retention, increased proprioception, secure suspension, and frequently&#xD;
      reported observations of wound healing. However, the long term effects of vacuum suspension&#xD;
      on circulation remain undetermined or undocumented. This study examines a vacuum suspension&#xD;
      system on the health of the residual limb (amputated limb). A vacuum socket creates a vacuum&#xD;
      between the rigid prosthetic socket and prosthetic liner which is sealed to the socket.&#xD;
      Therefore, vacuum is not directly applied to the skin of the residual limb.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are a total of 3 study visits, (some visits may be broken into separate visits per&#xD;
      preference of subject), including socket fitting visits (which could be 2 separate visits), a&#xD;
      baseline visit, and a final visit. During the socket visit, which may consist of a three&#xD;
      visits plus socket adjustments (as needed by the participant) on separate days (up to 4&#xD;
      weeks), limb shape capture, measurement or tracing, diagnostic static fitting and diagnostic&#xD;
      static fitting, and delivery of a definitive &quot;research&quot; socket will be done. At the baseline&#xD;
      visit, participants will perform seated tasks, standing tasks, and treadmill walking tasks.&#xD;
      Residual limb health measurements will be taken before and after the activity period,&#xD;
      including surface electrical capacitance, Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) measurement,&#xD;
      hyperspectral imaging, Hitachi Aloka ultrasound imaging, Blood Flow, and digital imaging&#xD;
      during the baseline visit as well. The final visit, using the research socket, will consist&#xD;
      of the same tasks and measurements as the baseline visit and questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed. The subject may choose to break up the final visit tasks into 2 different visits&#xD;
      if desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study, participants will be given the choice to keep the research&#xD;
      socket or return to using their original prosthesis as normal. The study prosthetist will be&#xD;
      available to review and adjust the fit of their standard of care prosthesis at this time.&#xD;
      Note: Due to physical change and limb volume fluctuation over the study period, it is&#xD;
      possible that at the end of the study the standard of care prosthesis will not fit your&#xD;
      residual limb as it does at the beginning of the study. At the completion of the study, it is&#xD;
      recommended that the subject follow up with their primary care prosthetist for socket&#xD;
      evaluation and fitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be risks that are not known about at this time. Side effects, risks, and&#xD;
      discomforts may result from study participation .While the goal of this project is to create&#xD;
      a more comfortable prosthesis, it is possible that the subject could experience discomforts&#xD;
      commonly associated with prosthesis use, such as perspiration, dry skin, rash, itching,&#xD;
      blisters, high pressure in the socket, looseness in the socket, and mechanical rubbing that&#xD;
      leads to ulceration which may lead to infection and additional surgery. Subjects with low&#xD;
      levels of arterial blood flow have an additional risk of ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prosthesis placement: While the goal of this project is to create a more comfortable&#xD;
           prosthesis, it is possible that the subject could experience discomforts commonly&#xD;
           associated with prosthesis use, such as perspiration, dry skin, rash, itching, blisters,&#xD;
           high pressure in the socket, looseness in the socket, and mechanical rubbing that leads&#xD;
           to ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treadmill task:There is a risk of falling during the research activities. This risk is&#xD;
           mitigated by the ability of participants to self-select pace for the treadmill task and&#xD;
           observation of treadmill activities by research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcutaneous Oxygen Measurement (TcOM) and skin temperature: The PeriFlux System 5000&#xD;
           uses non-invasive probes that will measure the skin temperature and transcutaneous&#xD;
           Oxygen Measurement and poses minimal risk to the subject. The probe head is affixed to&#xD;
           the residual limb by an adhesive sticker. Removal of the sticker after data acquisition&#xD;
           may cause minor discomfort similar to removing a small band-aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyperspectral Imaging: This non-invasive imaging technique poses minimal risk to the&#xD;
           subject. A small fiduciary marker sticker is placed on the subject's limb to calibrate&#xD;
           camera settings. Removal of the sticker after imaging may cause minor discomfort similar&#xD;
           to removing a small band-aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hitachi Aloka Ultrasound:Ultrasound imaging is a noninvasive technique and is a minimal&#xD;
           risk procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TEWL and Surface Electrical Capacitance Measurements: TEWL and Surface Electrical&#xD;
           Capacitance measurements are noninvasive and propose less than minimal risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be queried on self-reported measures of user comfort and performance. Briefly,&#xD;
      four subjective measures will be completed: VR-36, PEQ, SCS, and measures from the NIH PROMIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHAMP test will be used to assess overall amputee performance and the effect of the&#xD;
      socket suspension intervention over time. The conglomeration of clinical assessment tools&#xD;
      into the CHAMP was specifically done to measure high-level mobility in service members with a&#xD;
      lower limb amputation. CHAMP consists of the Single Leg Stance Test (SLS), the Edgren Side&#xD;
      Step Test (ESST), Illinois Agility Test (IAT), and T Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IU Neuroscience Gait lab will be used to collect kinematic data. The laboratory is equipped&#xD;
      with an instrumented treadmill and infrared camera system. A harness system will be used to&#xD;
      provide support and safety for the amputees while study participants walk on the treadmill&#xD;
      for 6 minutes.&#xD;
