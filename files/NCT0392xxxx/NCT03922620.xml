  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liposomal bupivacaine has gained interest in recent literature for its potential to be an&#xD;
      effective adjunct to other pain control modalities in a multi-modal approach to&#xD;
      post-operative pain control. The goal of this investigation is to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      local administration of liposomal bupivacaine versus the efficacy of a peripheral nerve block&#xD;
      in terms of post-operative pain scores after elective ankle and hindfoot surgery. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that there will not be a significant difference in the pain scores&#xD;
      of these two groups in opioid naïve patients.&#xD;

      Liposomal bupivacaine has gained interest in recent literature for its potential to be an&#xD;
      effective adjunct to other pain control modalities in a multi-modal approach to&#xD;
      post-operative pain control. Liposomal bupivacaine is an analgesic that is suspended in&#xD;
      lipids to allow for gradual release of the analgesic over a 72-hour period (NAMDARI). From&#xD;
      prior literature, the utilization of local analgesics infiltrated into surgical sites have&#xD;
      been shown to reduce pain in the immediate post-operative period in foot and ankle surgery&#xD;
      (GADEK). However, the evaluation of liposomal bupivacaine in foot and ankle surgery is&#xD;
      limited. One prospective study found that the addition to liposomal bupivacaine to a&#xD;
      multi-modal pain management protocol for forefoot surgery resulted in decreased pain scores&#xD;
      during the first four post-operative days as well as fewer refills of opioid pain medication&#xD;
      prescriptions, although both findings were not statically significant (ROBBINS). As the&#xD;
      general medical community and public policy makers continue to focus on decreasing the amount&#xD;
      of opioid pain medications prescribed and available in the community due to the opioid&#xD;
      epidemic, liposomal bupivacaine has the potential to be a useful adjunct in the management of&#xD;
      post-operative pain without reliance on opioid prescriptions. The goal of this investigation&#xD;
      is to compare the efficacy of local administration of liposomal bupivacaine versus the&#xD;
      efficacy of a peripheral nerve block in terms of post-operative pain scores after elective&#xD;
      ankle and hindfoot surgery. The investigators hypothesize that there will not be a&#xD;
      significant difference in the pain scores of these two groups in opioid naïve patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study aims to determine if there are differences in the amount of opioid&#xD;
      medications utilized for post-operative pain control, patient satisfaction scores, functional&#xD;
      outcomes, complications, and unscheduled healthcare contact between the two groups. In order&#xD;
      to accomplish these aims, a randomized, controlled investigation will be conducted.&#xD;
