      The aim of the non-interventional Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) study is to confirm&#xD;
      the established safety and performance of the newly marketed SenSura® Mio Baby device in a&#xD;
      real-life setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to evaluate wear time of SenSura® Mio Baby device and other secondary&#xD;
      endpoints related to performance, and safety of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Median wear time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fulfillment of wear time expectations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of unplanned change episodes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Degree of leakage under the barrier&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other areas of leakage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easiness of removal of barrier with Brava Baby Adhesive Remover&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin friendliness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of adhesive residues on skin after removal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of refeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access for refeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hygienic refeeding procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of pouch change&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feeling of security&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of SenSura® Mio Baby compared to Standard of Care (products used in the&#xD;
           department) on comparative questions of performance (to be evaluated by nurses)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a Post Market Clinical Follow-up Study, which is a descriptive study to confirm&#xD;
      the established safety and performance of new ostomy devices recently device listed at the US&#xD;
      market. Group 1 includes a retrospective data collection with the device used before the date&#xD;
      of the study start. For Groups 2 and 3, data are not obtained for performance comparison to&#xD;
      current ostomy device, but include prospective descriptive evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: subjects having a stoma and using a Standard of Care device. These subjects&#xD;
           will transfer to a SenSura® Mio Baby pouch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: subjects who are newly operated. These subjects will be offered SenSura® Mio&#xD;
           Baby pouch as their first device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: subjects receiving medication such as chemotherapeutic treatment. These&#xD;
           subjects may be newly operated subjects or already using a device. These subjects will&#xD;
           transfer to a SenSura® Mio Baby pouch A total of 30 subjects needs to be enrolled in&#xD;
           Group 1 and 2. A total of 6 subjects can be enrolled in Group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each Investigational site this means:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 10 subjects needs to be enrolled in Group 1 and 2 and additional 2 subjects more&#xD;
      can be enrolled in Group 3. However; the recruitment will be competitive between the 3&#xD;
      Investigational sites until the 30 subjects has been enrolled in Groups 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For details about the statistical analyses performed on this group of subjects, please see&#xD;
      section 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 5 of the enrolled subjects should be in the age range from 30 Gestational Weeks (GW)&#xD;
      up to 36 GW either from Group 1 or 2, in order to be able to confirm wear time and other&#xD;
      performance related claims. In the primary evaluation, the mean median wear time will be&#xD;
      compared to a threshold value of 24 hours which is based on a literature assessment of&#xD;
      Standard of Care wear time performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population The population in this study are (premature) infants over 30 weeks of gestation up&#xD;
      to 6 months of age (cal-culated from term age meaning 40 GW) either with a colo- or, ileo-,&#xD;
      or jejunostomy or a loop stoma, or two stomas placed closely together. Subjects can&#xD;
      participate in the PMCF study if they fulfill the in-/exclusion criteria as listed in the&#xD;
      tables below. However, the per protocol population include minimum 30 subjects from Group 1&#xD;
      or 2 as needed for the comparative performance evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria To be included the subjects must: Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Have a colostomy, ileostomy (jejunostomy), loop stoma, or two stomas placed closely&#xD;
           together&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Have given written informed consent (the legal authorized representative of the subject)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria The subjects are not allowed to participate in case they: Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Are currently suffering from peristomal skin problems i.e. bleeding and/or broken skin&#xD;
      (assessed by the investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational device is SenSura® Mio Baby. SenSura® Mio Baby is a flat 2-piece (2P)&#xD;
      ostomy device with an open bag and a baseplate, intended for premature infants over 30 weeks&#xD;
      of gestation up to 6 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All devices in this study are approved for market release before study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation approval&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-interventional Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) study will be approved by local&#xD;
      or central IRB in the US before study initiation.&#xD;
