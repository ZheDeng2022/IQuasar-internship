  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the role of an automatic polyp detection software&#xD;
      (henceforth referred to as the research software) as a support system during colonoscopy; a&#xD;
      procedure during which a physician uses a colonoscope or scope, to look inside a patient's&#xD;
      rectum and colon. The scope is a flexible tube with a camera-to see the lining of the colon.&#xD;
      The research software is used to aid in the detection of polyps (abnormal tissue growths in&#xD;
      the wall of the colon and adenomas (pre-cancerous growths) during colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research software used in this study was programmed by a company in Shanghai, which&#xD;
      develops artificial intelligence software for computer aided diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research software was developed using a large repository (database or databases) of polyp&#xD;
      images where expert colonoscopists outlined polyps and suspicious lesions. The software was&#xD;
      subsequently developed and validated using several databases of images and video to operate&#xD;
      in near real-time or within minutes of photographing the tissue. It is intended to point out&#xD;
      polyps and suspicious lesions on a separate screen that stands behind the primary monitor&#xD;
      during colonoscopy. It is not expected to change the colonoscopy procedure in any way, and&#xD;
      the physician will make the final determination on whether or not to biopsy or remove any&#xD;
      lesion in the colon wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research software will not record any video data during the colonoscopy procedure. In the&#xD;
      future, this software may help gastroenterologists detect precancerous areas and decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of colon cancer in the United States.&#xD;

      Length of Study - The duration of the study is expected to be 8-12 months. Enrollment of&#xD;
      study patients will cease when approximately 250 patients have been enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design- Design will be a multi-center, prospective, unblinded randomized control trial.&#xD;
      Patients referred for either screening or surveillance colonoscopy will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment: Aside from standard of care scope used, a second computer monitor that will stand&#xD;
      behind the standard monitor used during colonoscopy. Additionally , a computer system unit&#xD;
      with an operating system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Clinical Procedure Typically, intravenous sedation using a combination of&#xD;
      benzodiazepine and narcotic medications (with or without propofol under the supervision of a&#xD;
      trained anesthesiologist) are used for colonoscopy. Continuous pulse oximetry and blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring is used throughout the procedure. Supplemental oxygen is used as needed.&#xD;
      Patients are usually placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the colonoscope is&#xD;
      introduced into the rectum. The colonoscope is advanced under direct visualization until the&#xD;
      cecum and appendiceal orifice is reached. The colonoscope is usually retroflexed within the&#xD;
      rectum. The colonoscopist carefully inspects each segment of colon during advancement and&#xD;
      then again on withdrawal of the colonoscope. Any suspicious lesions encountered during&#xD;
      insertion or withdrawal are inspected by the colonoscopist and a final determination is made&#xD;
      by the clinician on whether or not to remove a given lesion. Any lesion that is deemed&#xD;
      suspicious or polypoid is removed by en-bloc polypectomy, piecemeal polypectomy, or may be&#xD;
      referred for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) at a later date. After the procedure,&#xD;
      patients recover in the post-procedural recovery room. After the procedure, results are&#xD;
      discussed with the patient. The ability of colonoscopy to detect lesions is discussed with&#xD;
      the patient as well as the fact that a small percentage of polyps and other lesions may be&#xD;
      missed during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure Patients will receive a colonoscopy with a gastroenterologist. During the&#xD;
      standard clinical procedural protocol and for the study period, colonoscopists will have the&#xD;
      benefit of a second monitor that will project the polyp detection algorithm in real-time over&#xD;
      the video output of the colonoscopy. The algorithm will detect suspicious, polyp-like lesions&#xD;
      within the lumen of the colon, and during the procedure a research assistant will view the&#xD;
      second monitor at all times and record a time stamp for any potential polyps on an&#xD;
      intra-procedural data collection sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Variables collected and measured will include colonoscopist(s) performing the&#xD;
      procedure, number of adenomas noted per procedure, adenoma detection rate for a given&#xD;
      colonoscopist, number of polyps detected per procedure, polyp detection rate (the proportion&#xD;
      of colonoscopic examinations performed that detect one or more polyps), cecal intubation&#xD;
      rate, time needed to reach the cecum, time needed to withdraw colonoscope both when polyps&#xD;
      are identified (and thus need to be removed) and on normal colonoscopy, level of sedation,&#xD;
      and complications: Acute if within 48 hours of procedure &amp; delayed if within 3-30 days after&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis - Normally distributed continuous variables will be summarized using means and&#xD;
      standard deviations while non-normally distributed continuous variables will be summarized&#xD;
      using medians and ranges.&#xD;

True positives will be defined as lesions that are detected for &gt;2 seconds by the research software and are deemed to be consistent in appearance with a polyp by the endoscopist. False positives will be defined as lesions that are detected for &gt; 2 seconds by the research software but are ultimately deemed by the endoscopist to have a gross appearance not consistent with polyp.
