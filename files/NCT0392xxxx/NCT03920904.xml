      The primary objective of the study is to measure plasma levels of bupivacaine following a&#xD;
      pecto-intercostal fascial plane block (PIFB) in patients undergoing sternotomy for cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart disease such as ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure are the second leading cause&#xD;
      of death and a leading cause of hospitalization in Canada. Approximately 35,000 heart valve&#xD;
      or coronary artery revascularization procedures involving median sternotomy, an important&#xD;
      component in the treatment of these diseases, are performed annually. Median sternotomy is&#xD;
      associated with acute pain that decreases patient satisfaction, increases the risk of&#xD;
      delirium, arrhythmias and respiratory complications. It also contributes to the development&#xD;
      of postoperative chronic pain that can affect up to 31% of patients in the first year after&#xD;
      surgery. Multimodal analgesia, combining drug therapy and regional anesthesia, can help in&#xD;
      preventing acute and perhaps chronic pain in patients undergoing sternotomy for cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pecto-intercostal fascial plane block (PIFB) is a new locoregional anesthesia technique&#xD;
      that has emerged to treat pain following cardiac surgery including sternotomy, breast&#xD;
      surgeries and sternal fractures. It consists of injecting local anesthetics in the space&#xD;
      located between the major pectoralis muscle and the intercostal muscles using ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance, allowing to obtain anesthesia of the territory innervated by the anterior cutaneous&#xD;
      intercostal branches, i.e. the medial aspect of the breast and the sternum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of local anesthetic injected after a PIFB should aim to maximize analgesia while&#xD;
      minimizing the chance of toxic systemic concentrations. Defining the rate of absorption of&#xD;
      local anesthetics into the blood after a PIFB will therefore help anesthesiologists to&#xD;
      determinate optimal analgesic doses, in terms of both safety and effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will determine bupivacaine pharmacokinetics after a PIFB with&#xD;
      bupivacaine, to further define the right dose and duration of surveillance in post-anesthesia&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Anesthesia and cardiac surgery will be initiated as usual. The use of bupivacaine by&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist or surgeon will be prohibited. Following closure of the sternum, while&#xD;
      the patient remains intubated and ventilated under general anesthesia with monitoring,&#xD;
      including invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and ECG, the PIFB will&#xD;
      be done before application of sternal dressing and removal of sterile fields. Using an&#xD;
      ultrasound machine with a high frequency linear probe (Sonosite, HFL50 15-6MHz) placed in the&#xD;
      parasagittal plane, 3cm away from the midline, the fascia between the major pectoralis muscle&#xD;
      and the internal intercostal muscle will be visualized. Subsequently, four injection sites,&#xD;
      defined by the space between the fascia of the pectoral and intercostal muscles at the third&#xD;
      and sixth intercostal spaces on each side of the patient, will be reached with an insulated&#xD;
      hyperechoic needle (50-80 mm, 22 gauge, SonoPlex STIM, Nanoline, Pajunk, Germany) inserted&#xD;
      cephalically and positioned in-plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following negative aspiration, the anesthesiologist will confirm the correct position of the&#xD;
      needle with the fluid spread of 1 mL of 5% dextrose. Then, he will inject bupivacaine 0.25%&#xD;
      with epinephrine 5 mcg/mL in 5 ml aliquots for a total dose of 2mg/kg of ideal body weight&#xD;
      (maximum of 150mg or 60 mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of injection will be considered as T0. Collection of 4.5mL of blood will be performed&#xD;
      at T10min, T20min, T30min, T45min, T60min, T90min, T120min, T180min, and T240min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tubes will be immediately placed on ice to be ultimately sent to the laboratory for&#xD;
      centrifugation and measurement of bupivacaine level using liquid chromatography-tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for each of the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the block, the patient will be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit. At T240min, if&#xD;
      the patient is extubated, the level of the sensory block will be identified by the pinprick&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time between ICU arrival and extubation, as well as the total consumption of opioids and&#xD;
      co-analgesics for the first 24 hours will be recorded for each patient.&#xD;
