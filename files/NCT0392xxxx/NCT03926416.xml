    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      CodaVax-H1N1 influenza vaccine as compared to active and placebo controls when administered&#xD;
      to healthy adults.&#xD;

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled Phase I study is intended to&#xD;
      study the effects of a live-attenuated vaccine against influenza A H1N1. Part 1 of this study&#xD;
      will enroll 75 participants at a single site. Participants will be randomized in a 2:2:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive one dose each of either CodaVax-H1N1, FluZone quadrivalent, or placebo. This&#xD;
      study is conducted during the influenza &quot;off season&quot; in Australia. Part 2 of the study will&#xD;
      enroll an 50 additional participants randomized to receive either CodaVax-H1N1 at a higher&#xD;
      dose or placebo (40:10).&#xD;
