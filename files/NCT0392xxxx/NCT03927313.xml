  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LASER-TBM is a parallel group, randomized, multi-arm phase IIa trial evaluating the safety of&#xD;
      increased dose rifampicin (RIF) plus linezolid (LZD), with or without aspirin (ASA), for the&#xD;
      treatment of HIV-infected adults with tuberculous meningitis (TBM). The study will recruit&#xD;
      100 HIV-infected adults with TBM across four sites in South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the occurrence of solicited treatment-related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include death and disability (including neurocognitive impairment),&#xD;
      radiological outcomes, and the occurrence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&#xD;
      (IRIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nested pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PK of LZD and high dose RIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the relationship between drug exposures, toxicity and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare exposures between intravenous and oral RIF administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigate the impact of high dose RIF on LZD and dolutegravir (DTG).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-1 infected adults with newly-diagnosed TBM (n = 100) will be recruited from four&#xD;
      public-sector hospitals in Cape Town and Port Elizebeth, South Africa. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomised across two experimental (n = 30 each) and one standard of care (n = 40) arms.&#xD;
      Treatment will be provided in all arms for 56 days, after which participants will be referred&#xD;
      back to public sector facilities to complete standard therapy for HIV-associated TBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety of enhanced antimicrobial&#xD;
      therapy including increased dose RIF and LZD with or without adjunctive aspirin added to&#xD;
      standard therapy for TBM in HIV-1 infected adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine cerebrospinal fluid M.tb culture positivity and Gene Xpert® Ultra&#xD;
           positivity at baseline and at 3 and 28 days post treatment by allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of aspirin and enhanced tuberculosis treatment on the incidence&#xD;
           of immune reconstitution syndrome in participants starting antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effect of high dose rifampicin and linezolid, with and without aspirin&#xD;
           on the transcriptional signature derived from whole blood and cerebrospinal fluid RNA&#xD;
           sequencing, as well as the metabolomic and proteomic profiles, in tuberculous&#xD;
           meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the effect of high dose rifampicin and linezolid with and without aspirin on&#xD;
           central nervous system imaging in conjunction with clinical, immunological and&#xD;
           transcriptional profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To store biological samples for future analysis of potential biomarkers of treatment&#xD;
           efficacy and/or novel diagnostic assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine i) whether host genotype, including LTA4H genotype, influences therapeutic&#xD;
           effect of aspirin in HIV-TBM and ii) the pharmacogenetic influence on rifampicin and&#xD;
           linezolid exposures and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive antitubercular chemotherapy and corticosteroids as standard of&#xD;
      care as per national South African guidelines. Participants allocated to experimental arms 2&#xD;
      and 3 will receive additional rifampicin (total oral dose 35 mg/kg/day) plus oral linezolid&#xD;
      1200mg daily for the first 28 days, reduced to 600 mg daily for the next 28 days. Those&#xD;
      randomized to experimental arm 3 will also receive oral aspirin 1000 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consenting LASER-TBM participants in experimental arms (n = 60) will undergo a second&#xD;
      randomisation to receive either oral (35mg/kg) or IV (20mg/kg) rifampicin at the time of&#xD;
      study entry. This sub-study is powered to demonstrate bioequivalence at day 3 of&#xD;
      administration, after which all participants will be continued on oral rifampicin dosed at&#xD;
      35mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial participation will be for 180 days post-randomization: primary safety endpoints and&#xD;
      secondary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated at day 56; additional secondary endpoints will&#xD;
      be evaluated at day 180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are seven scheduled study visits. The first six of thee will occur within the first 56&#xD;
      days, with an additional structured interview at 6 months. All visits will involve a clinical&#xD;
      assessment including specified clinical outcome measures to assess functional and cognitive&#xD;
      disability. Phlebotomy will be performed at study visits within the first 56 days to monitor&#xD;
      for pre-specified parameters of drug safety (haematology, biochemistry) as well as to collect&#xD;
      blood for downstream transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analysis. Lumbar puncture will&#xD;
      take place at day 3 and day 28. Cerebrospinal fluid will be analysed for Mycobacterium&#xD;
      tuberculosis culture and Gene Xpert® Ultra cycle threshold values. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      will be stored for downstream transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analysis. Baseline&#xD;
      and day 56 brain imaging will be performed in all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled participants will undergo sparse plasma PK sampling at the Day 28 and Day 56&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be collected from all participants for determination of&#xD;
      linezolid and rifampicin concentrations on Days 3 and 28. The timing of the Day 3 lumbar&#xD;
      puncture will be randomised to intervals of 1 - 3, 3 - 6, 6 - 10, and 24 hours after observed&#xD;
      antitubercular drug dosing in order to construct a concentration-time profile for the&#xD;
      population. A single sample will be collected at each time interval. A second lumbar puncture&#xD;
      will take place at the Day 28 visit, to coincide with the 4-hour plasma PK sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (n=100) will be offered participation in the intensive sampling component of&#xD;
      the PK sub-study at the time of randomization to the main study. Intensive plasma sampling&#xD;
      will take place at the Day 3 study visit. Serial venous blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      through a peripheral intravenous catheter pre-dose, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 - 10, and 24&#xD;
      hours after witnessed drug intake and an overnight fast. Sparse sampling will be performed at&#xD;
      Day 3 for participants who decline intensive sampling or in whom this fails.&#xD;
