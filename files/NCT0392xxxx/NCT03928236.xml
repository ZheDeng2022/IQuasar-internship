  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B-FREE is a pragmatic, multicentre, cluster crossover trial evaluating whether a policy&#xD;
      limiting the use of intra-operative benzodiazepine reduces post-operative delirium when&#xD;
      compared with a policy of 'ad libitum' administration. The knowledge generated by this study&#xD;
      will provide the basis for cardiac anesthesia practice guidelines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium, an acute state of confusion, occurs in approximately 1 in 5 adults after open heart&#xD;
      surgery. Even though it is a temporary state, patients who experience delirium are at&#xD;
      increased risk of serious problems that last after the delirium has resolved. These problems&#xD;
      include decreases in thinking, mobility, self-care, and the ability to live independently in&#xD;
      a community setting. Patients who experience delirium have longer stays in hospital, are more&#xD;
      likely to be discharged to a nursing home, and are more likely to die. Benzodiazepines are a&#xD;
      sedative and amnestic medication that may be associated with delirium. As such,&#xD;
      benzodiazepines are rarely used for sedation in the intensive care unit after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. However, benzodiazepines continue to be used frequently in the operating room by&#xD;
      anesthesiologists during open heart surgery because of their amnestic effects and limited&#xD;
      impact on blood pressure. Nevertheless, practice is divided among cardiac anesthesiologists,&#xD;
      with some never using benzodiazepines and others using them for nearly all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the best approach (routine benzodiazepines or restricted benzodiazepines) remains&#xD;
      uncertain, we will compare the effect of a hospital policy of intraoperative medication use&#xD;
      that includes benzodiazepines to a policy that uses alternative medications and no&#xD;
      benzodiazepines on the incidence of delirium after open heart surgery. The findings of the&#xD;
      study have the potential to improve the outcomes of tens of thousands of patients around the&#xD;
      world and will provide the basis for cardiac anesthesiology practice guidelines.&#xD;

             least once every 12 hours during the initial 72 hours after cardiac surgery as a part&#xD;
             of routine clinical care using either the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU) or&#xD;
