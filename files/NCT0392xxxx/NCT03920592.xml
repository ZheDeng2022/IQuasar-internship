  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lack of empathy towards victims of bullying is thought to play a main role in this&#xD;
      extended and pernicious peer victimization behaviour. Thus, promoting empathy in school&#xD;
      programs might be a promising approach for bullying prevention. Virtual reality (VR) allows&#xD;
      creating an environment very similar to the real world and has proved to promote empathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, by employing VR, pupils may better understand and feel the experience of being&#xD;
      bullied. As there is no evidence of the efficiency of VR in bullying prevention, the first&#xD;
      step is to validate the content of the environments created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this line, the current study aims to investigate if 360º-videos produce a truthful&#xD;
      experience of being bullied superior than the observed in traditional computer screens. The&#xD;
      effect of all, 360º-videos and 2D computer screens will be assessed through objective&#xD;
      (electrodermal activity -EDA- and heart rate -HR-) and subjective (self-administered tests)&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction and Rationale: Previous research suggests that working on the development of&#xD;
      cognitive-emotional skills, and particularly on empathy toward victims of bullying, may be a&#xD;
      central component for the success of school bullying prevention programs. On the other hand,&#xD;
      virtual reality (VR) technology allows adopting the perspective of the world of others, and&#xD;
      thus has been claimed to be a powerful tool for eliciting empathy in different domains (cf.&#xD;
      Slater &amp; Sánchez-Vives, 2016). Therefore, VR might play a role in bullying prevention&#xD;
      programs, by helping pupils to understand how it feels to be bullied, as a way to increase&#xD;
      empathy towards victims of bullying. However, currently empirical evidence of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of VR in this context is lacking. A key step in the validation of this use of&#xD;
      VR is to understand how the immersive presentation of bullying scenes shot from a&#xD;
      first-person perspective is experienced by children, compared to the same scenes presented in&#xD;
      less immersive displays. In particular, in order to demonstrate the potential of VR&#xD;
      technology in this regard, it is necessary to examine the advantages that VR technology (and,&#xD;
      more specifically in this case, immersive presentation of 360º-video) presents over more&#xD;
      common devices (a computer screen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study goals and Hypotheses: The overall goal of this study is to examine whether 360º-videos&#xD;
      representing situations of bullying from a first-person perspective produce a realistic&#xD;
      experience of being bullied, and that the presentation of such contents in an immersive mode&#xD;
      (using a VR headset) elicit a more realistic and arousing experience than the same contents&#xD;
      in a less immersive format (a traditional computer screen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first step in a wider research project; in subsequent steps, the investigators&#xD;
      will assess the effects of these type of videos on empathy towards victims of bullying and,&#xD;
      eventually, on prevalence of bullying behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypotheses to be tested will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1 (H1): Contents representing situations of bullying from a first person&#xD;
      perspective will elicit on participants realistic feelings of being bullied, compared to&#xD;
      contents representing other high-school daily situations not involving (physical or verbal)&#xD;
      violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2 (H2): Immersive presentation (i.e. 360º-video contents watched in a VR headset)&#xD;
      will elicit higher arousal and higher perceived realism of the scene than the same contents&#xD;
      presented in a less immersive display (a computer screen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test these hypotheses, the investigators will collect measures of&#xD;
      psychophysiological measures of arousal (electrodermal activity -EDA- and heart rate -HR-)&#xD;
      and emotional regulation (heart rate variability -HRV-), self-reported emotional arousal and&#xD;
      valence, as well as three self-reported measures of the realism of the experience of being&#xD;
      bullied, including: (1) participant's perception on to which degree the represented situation&#xD;
      can be considered bullying, (2) participant's feelings of actually being in the represented&#xD;
      scene (&quot;presence&quot;), and (3) participant's feeling of actually being bullied while watching&#xD;
      the content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that, compared to watching videos representing other high-school&#xD;
      daily situations not involving (physical or verbal) violence, watching videos representing&#xD;
      situations of bullying, participants' EDA, HR, HRV, and self-reported arousal will be higher&#xD;
      (H1a, H1b, H1c, and H1d, respectively), self-reported valence will be more negative (H1e),&#xD;
      scores of feelings of being bullying and actually being in the scene will be higher (H1f and&#xD;
      H1g, respectively), and the perception of the scene as bullying will also be enhanced (H1h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also expected that, compared to the videos presented in a screen, while watching the&#xD;
      videos in a VR headset participants' EDA, HR, HRV, and self-reported arousal will be higher&#xD;
      (H2a, H2b, H2c, and H2d, respectively), self-reported valence will be more negative (H2e),&#xD;
      scores of feelings of being bullying and actually being in the scene will be higher (H2f and&#xD;
      H2g, respectively), and the perception of the scene as bullying will also be enhanced (H2h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it will be explored whether the experienced arousal and perception of realism is&#xD;
      associated with personality traits, such as being uncaring, unemotional, and callousness. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that pupils with higher scores on the mentioned traits will experience&#xD;
      less arousal (subjective and psychophysiological) when watching the videos with bullying&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: The study adopts a within-subject design in which each participant will&#xD;
      watch four videos, containing the four possible combinations of two independent variables:&#xD;
      Level of immersion (VR headset / computer screen) and Type of content (Bullying / no-bullying&#xD;
      content).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The materials to be used in the experiment will be eight videos representing different scenes&#xD;
      from the perspective of a girl (to be watched by female participants) and four videos&#xD;
      representing different scenes from the perspective of a boy (to be watched by male&#xD;
      participants). Among each group of eight videos, there are four pairs. The two videos of each&#xD;
      pair involve the same location, point-of-view, and actors, but in one of them there is a&#xD;
      bullying situation and in the other there is a daily situation not involving any form of&#xD;
      violence (e.g. children chatting about the last weekend).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will watch four scenes, two containing bullying scenes and the other&#xD;
      containing daily non-violent scenes. Also, two of them will be presented in a VR headset&#xD;
      while the rest be presented in a computer screen. The level of immersion and type of content&#xD;
      in which each scene is presented will vary among participants following a Latin-square&#xD;
      design, in a way such for the whole sample of participants, all the scenes will be presented&#xD;
      across the two levels of immersion and the two types of content. The order of the&#xD;
      presentation of the four conditions will be randomised for each participant.&#xD;
