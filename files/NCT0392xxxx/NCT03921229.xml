      This is a prospective, multicenter pilot study to test the feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      tele-coaching intervention and its implementation in patients with CF (ages 14-25 years), and&#xD;
      to obtain estimates of treatment effects across a range of key outcome measures (e.g., global&#xD;
      adherence, change in treatment barriers, specific improvement in adherence, etc.)&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>Recruitment and feasibility will be evaluated using the percentage of screen failures which are the number of eligible participants who do not score at least a three on any given treatment component for the CF-CBS amongst all eligible participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in global adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to approximately week 51</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the preliminary effect of intervention on treatment adherence from data collected from vest photo capture and eTrack nebulizers. Vest photo capture will be scored as a ratio of total minutes used to total minutes prescribed in the study period. Medication adherence will be scored as a 'per drug analysis' of adherence with a ratio of competed to total prescribed doses in the study period. A composite score will be determined based on prescribed medications and medication/doses taken.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in treatment barriers</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to approximately week 51</time_frame>
    <description>The CF-CBS (Cystic Fibrosis Care Behaviors Survey) will be used to analyze barriers to treatment. Measure will be based on an overall decrease (difference in means) in barrier specific frequency, specific treatment total barriers and the composite score for barriers from pre-intervention to post-intervention.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory outcome: self-reported adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to approximately week 51</time_frame>
