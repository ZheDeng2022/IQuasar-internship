      Title of the study: Target weight correction and vascular stiffness in hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized clinical trial in the study centre at two locations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applied medical device:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Body Composition Monitor' (BCM, Fresenius) to measure fluid volume overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arteriograph 24 (Tensiomed, Budapest, Hungry) to assess vascular stiffness before,&#xD;
           during and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: A protocolized adjustment of target weight guided by bio-impedance&#xD;
      spectroscopy will improve fluid status, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and reduce the&#xD;
      arterial wall stiffness without increasing the prevalence of intradialytic hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate improvement in fluid status by a target weight correction protocol which&#xD;
           applies BCM measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate that better fluid volume control is associated with a) improvement in&#xD;
           vascular health as assessed by pulse wave velocity and augmentation index and b)&#xD;
           reduction in antihypertensive medications use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To show that this approach does not lead to more episodes with intradialytic&#xD;
           hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients: 70 patients&#xD;

      This study proposal is looking at the application of an accurate assessment of fluid status&#xD;
      in hemodialysis (HD) patients to correct fluid overload. Patients undergoing hemodialysis&#xD;
      suffer from the inability to maintain their normal body fluids and have a high probability to&#xD;
      develop hypertension at initiation of dialysis (1). Long-standing fluid overload is no longer&#xD;
      linked solely to high blood pressure, but also to vascular dysfunction and heart failure (1).&#xD;
      Fluid overload is estimated based on the amount of fluids available outside the cells&#xD;
      (extracellular fluid volume, ECFV). Thus, determination of the right amount of fluid removal&#xD;
      during the dialysis depends on the weight of the patient when the ECFV is normal (referred to&#xD;
      as Target Weight, TW). Essentially, TW is assessed by routine clinical judgment, for example,&#xD;
      leg and hands swelling (edema), elevation in blood pressure and the expansion of the external&#xD;
      jugular vein. Unfortunately, this clinical judgment is not reliable to assess fluid status&#xD;
      (2, 3); hence, overestimation of TW occurs and leads to fluid overload. Current technology&#xD;
      allows assessing fluid overload accurately by using bio-impedance, a non-invasive method that&#xD;
      can be easily used in the HD setting. Despite this, very few studies have been reported where&#xD;
      a systematic approach was followed to use bio-impedance to correct a TW that has been set too&#xD;
      high, with the ultimate goal to correct fluid overload. Therefore, this study aims to provide&#xD;
      better fluid control through an intervention to improve fluid status toward normovolemia by&#xD;
      using bio-impedance assessment of fluid overload rather than clinical judgments. First, the&#xD;
      fluid status will be measured in all study participants by multifrequency bio-impedance using&#xD;
      a 'Body Composition Monitor' (BCM, Fresenius). Second, we will divide the study subjects into&#xD;
      two groups; the control group which will initially receive standard conventional therapy (no&#xD;
      intervention) for 3 months, and the intervention group will undergo by BCM measurements and&#xD;
      integrated TW correction protocol for 3 months. Third, after three months, the control group&#xD;
      will also involve in the same TW correction adjustment. The Primary outcome is improvement in&#xD;
      fluid status towards normovolemia (&lt;1.1 L fluid overload). Secondary outcomes are a)&#xD;
      improvement in vascular health as assessed by pulse wave velocity and augmentation index and&#xD;
      b) a decrease in the use of antihypertensive medications. Altogether, an optimized fluid&#xD;
      status via implemented fluid management plan will provide better control of fluid overload,&#xD;
      blood pressure, and improvement in vascular function.&#xD;
