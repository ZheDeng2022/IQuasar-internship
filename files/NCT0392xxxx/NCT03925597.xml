  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a comprehensive, multiomic study that will integrate longitudinal&#xD;
      data associating changes in specific gut bacteria and host in response to prebiotic fiber&#xD;
      supplementation. These data will guide the development of an integrative biological signature&#xD;
      relating bacterial-derived metabolites with biological outcome in the host. The open sharing&#xD;
      of data generated by the proposed research represents a significant public resource that will&#xD;
      support and accelerate future novel studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phenolics-rich prebiotic fiber has been correlated with a number of positive health outcomes,&#xD;
      however their bioavailability is typically low. A large portion the gut microbiota metabolize&#xD;
      these fibers releasing a range of phenolic acids, which are believed to be principle&#xD;
      bioactive components driving reduction in disease risk. Despite this, little evidence exists&#xD;
      linking specific gut bacteria with the metabolites they produce and the downstream biological&#xD;
      effects that these compounds exert. With this study, the investigators propose to assemble a&#xD;
      cohort of healthy individuals that will receive prebiotic supplementation, during&#xD;
      comprehensive, longitudinal characterization of the microbiota and host changes with clinical&#xD;
      markers and multiple omics assays. These multiomic data will then be integrated, generating&#xD;
      unique biological signatures that define the role that microbial metabolites from specific&#xD;
      bacteria play in host biological activity. To validate the biological function of these&#xD;
      microbial metabolites, gnobiotic mice will be inoculated with the microbial strains&#xD;
      identified. The newly identified metabolites will also be synthesized in vitro to demonstrate&#xD;
      their structure, biological properties and applications. Through this study the investigators&#xD;
      expect to gain a detailed and clear understanding of the physiological changes, at the&#xD;
      mechanistic level, that occur in the microbiome and host in response to dietary&#xD;
      supplementation with prebiotic fiber.&#xD;
