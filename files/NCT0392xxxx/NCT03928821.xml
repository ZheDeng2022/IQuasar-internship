      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      antiviral activity of combinations of monoclonal antibodies PGT121, PGDM1400, 10-1074, and&#xD;
      VRC07-523LS administered via intravenous infusion in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity&#xD;
      of combinations of monoclonal antibodies PGT121, PGDM1400, 10-1074, and VRC07-523LS&#xD;
      administered via intravenous infusion in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will initially be enrolled into one of three groups. At Day 0, Groups 1, 2, and&#xD;
      3 will receive dual combinations of mAbs administered sequentially via IV. Group 1 will&#xD;
      receive a combination of PGT121 and VRC07-523LS, Group 2 will receive PGDM1400 and&#xD;
      VRC07-523LS, and Group 3 will receive 10-1074 and VRC07-523LS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will review study data from Groups 1, 2, and 3 and determine if Group 4 may begin&#xD;
      to enroll. Participants in Group 4 will receive PGDM1400, PGT121, and VRC07-523LS&#xD;
      administered in sequence via IV on Day 0 and at Month 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration will be 12 months for participants in Groups 1, 2, and 3, and 16 months for&#xD;
      participants in Group 4. Participants will attend several study visits, which may include&#xD;
      physical examinations, blood and urine collection, HIV testing and pretest counseling, risk&#xD;
      reduction counseling, and questionnaires.&#xD;

          -  Hypertension:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during&#xD;
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.&#xD;
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less than or equal to&#xD;
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without&#xD;
                  medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must be&#xD;
                  less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg&#xD;
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140&#xD;
                  mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension&#xD;
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than&#xD;
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or&#xD;

             sustained cure, or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the&#xD;
             period of the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if&#xD;
