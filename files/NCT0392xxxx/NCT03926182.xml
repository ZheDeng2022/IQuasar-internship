    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, open label, single dose, two periods crossover study in&#xD;
      healthy male volunteers. The volunteers will be randomly distributed into two groups&#xD;
      (fasted-fed and fed-fasted groups). Any volunteer will be administrated once in each&#xD;
      treatment period, the interval time of two treatment periods is 22 days (the interval time is&#xD;
      no longer than 30 days).&#xD;
