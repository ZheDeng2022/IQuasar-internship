  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate one of the chapters in the new national Norwegian&#xD;
      training manual (MAP). The chapter that is selected to be evaluated is the chapter on&#xD;
      de-escalation. Effective training in this topic should not only lead to changes in the level&#xD;
      of knowledge and attitudes, but also changes in behavior and skills. Experiencing better&#xD;
      preparedness does not necessarily entail a change in behavior. This study wants to test&#xD;
      whether training in de-escalation changes the participants' skills and experience of&#xD;
      self-confidence, security and coping in threatening situations.&#xD;

      The theme is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Evaluation of the training program of de-escalation for third-year nursing students&#xD;
&#xD;
      Underlying research questions will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will the intervention provide increased de-escalation skills?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will training in de-escalation provide increased confidence in coping with patient&#xD;
           aggression?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design used to answer the research questions is a cluster-randomized controlled study&#xD;
      with an intervention group and a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two study groups with nursing students will be exposed to two different scenarios (A and&#xD;
      B) with simulated patient situations. Students will conduct simulation A before the&#xD;
      intervention and simulation B the same day after the intervention. A control group will also&#xD;
      be included which will review scenarios A and B without intervention. The purpose of this is&#xD;
      to see if the scenarios in isolation give any effect on the pre- and post-measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire (Thackreys, 1987) related to&#xD;
      experienced coping security related to aggression management at four different times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scenarios will be recorded on video. Following all video data collection, 2 de-escalation&#xD;
      experts will independently review the video data and quantify it using the EMDABS instrument.&#xD;
      They will be blinded and not aware of whether the video was recorded before or after the&#xD;
      intervention. The data that this generates will then be statistically examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of participants will be made from three classes with third year nursing&#xD;
      students. The classes consist of about 50 students. Participation is voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is uncertain how many will participate, but on the basis of practical limits there is an&#xD;
      upper limit of 15 participants per class for the intervention group (the selection is&#xD;
      recruited from two classes), and 30 participants from the control group (the selection is&#xD;
      recruited from a class). A total of n = 30 is desired in both the intervention group and the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following two outcomes will be analyzed; de-escalating behavior (EMDABS, Mavandadi et&#xD;
      al., 2016) and confidence in coping with patient aggression (Thackrey, 1987).&#xD;
