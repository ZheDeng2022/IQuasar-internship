    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of OBP-301 with pembrolizumab in advanced gastric and&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that has progressed on at least 2 lines of prior&#xD;
      therapy for advanced disease. Pembrolizumab has recently received FDA approval for PD-L1&#xD;
      positive gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma based on the Keynote-059 study. The efficacy of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab monotherapy is modest in PD-L1 positive patients (defined as a combined&#xD;
      positive score, CPS, of &gt; 1), with only a ~15% overall response rate. This study will examine&#xD;
      the addition of the oncolytic virus, OBP-301, administered prior to pembrolizumab in this&#xD;
      patient population. Patients will be enrolled in a two-stage design, with 18 patients in the&#xD;
      first stage. All patients will receive OBP-301 at 2x1012 viral particles (VP)/ tumor&#xD;
      injection administered every two weeks x 4 injections as well as standard dose pembrolizumab&#xD;
      200 mg IV every 3 weeks. The tumor will be injected with OBP-301 four times (d1, d15, d29,&#xD;
      d43). The preference is to inject the primary tumor endoscopically. Metastatic lesions may be&#xD;
      injected on a case-by-case basis after discussion with the PI (Shah). All patients treated&#xD;
      with OBP-301 will be eligible for the safety cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the efficacy of OBP-301 with pembrolizumab in PD-L1 positive advanced gastric&#xD;
           and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in the 3rd or 4th line setting, as assessed&#xD;
           by the RECIST response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the safety of multiple OBP-301 intratumoral injections in combination with&#xD;
           pembrolizumab in advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To examine other measures of efficacy of the combination of OBP-301 with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      advanced gastric and esophageal adenocarcinoma including the disease control rate, duration&#xD;
      of response, overall survival and progression free survival.&#xD;
