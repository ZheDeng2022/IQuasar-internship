    <textblock>
      Fluid administration during and after surgery is an essential part of postoperative care to&#xD;
      maintain the patients' fluid and biochemical balance. Abdominal surgical procedures are&#xD;
      associated with dehydration from preoperative fasting , bowel preparation, and intra- and&#xD;
      postoperative fluid and electrolyte loss(1). So, perioperative fluid management has been a&#xD;
      topic of much debate over years and has intensified especially over the past several years.&#xD;
      The controversies include the type of fluid, the timing of administration and the volume&#xD;
      administrated. Following much discussions and ongoing controversy on colloids versus&#xD;
      crystalloids(2-5) and the ideal composition of the various intravenous solutions(6-8),the&#xD;
      main focus more recently has been on the volume of fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid therapy strategies have been developed and implemented in clinical practice over&#xD;
      several decades. The data suggest that aggressive or liberal intraoperative fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation is harmful during open abdominal operation, whereas a restrictive fluid&#xD;
      protocol has better outcomes, including fewer postoperative complications and a shorter&#xD;
      discharge time. (9-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However , a restrictive fluid regimen has several limitations (12). Overly restricted or&#xD;
      inadequate fluid administration may lead to insufficient intravascular volume, tissue&#xD;
      hypoperfusion, cellular oxygenation impairment and potential organ dysfunction(13), prolonged&#xD;
      recovery of bowel function, and impair tissue oxygenation, which might ultimately impair&#xD;
      wound healing including healing of anastomosis.(14, 15) Recently, The Pleth variability index&#xD;
      (PVI) derived from respiratory variations in peripheral perfusion index (PI) has been&#xD;
      suggested to be an effective dynamic indicator of fluid responsiveness. Different from other&#xD;
      invasive dynamic indices, PVI provides clinicians with a numerical value obtained&#xD;
      noninvasively. (16-18) PVI is calculated as [(PImax - PImin)/PImax] X 100, where PImax and&#xD;
      PImin represent the maximal and the minimal value, respectively, of the plethysmographic&#xD;
      perfusion index (PI) over one respiratory cycle (16, 19). PI is the ratio between pulsatile&#xD;
      and no pulsatile infrared light absorption from the pulse oximeter, and it is physiologically&#xD;
      equivalent to the amplitude of the plethysmographic waveform (20). A PVI value of &gt;13% before&#xD;
      volume expansion discriminated between fluid responders and non-responders with 81%&#xD;
      sensitivity and 100% specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extremely important feature of fluid therapy is ability to modulate inflammatory response&#xD;
      in all its aspects with impact on a rate of neutrophil activation and modulation of cytokine&#xD;
      and adhesive molecules expression. Isotonic sodium chloride solution and Ringer's lactate&#xD;
      solution were shown to have pro-inflammatory properties while so called low volume therapy.&#xD;
      Saline solution seems to be the most pro-inflammatory infusion fluid exerting negative impact&#xD;
      on both macro- and microcirculation (21). Infusions of high volume of sodium chloride result&#xD;
      in elevated serum chloride levels leading to acid-base imbalance and increase of free&#xD;
      hydrogen ions (22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some available literature data show potential impact of Ringer's lactate therapy on induction&#xD;
      of inflammatory response (23) but other reports do not support such phenomenon (24). Acetates&#xD;
      similarly to lactates act as buffers and are easily broken down to bicarbonates. The&#xD;
      difference between them is that lactates are metabolized mainly in the liver while acetates&#xD;
      are metabolized in all body cells. The latter is especially beneficial in liver&#xD;
      insufficiency, lactic acidosis and microcirculation insufficiency leading to organ&#xD;
      hypoperfusion.&#xD;
