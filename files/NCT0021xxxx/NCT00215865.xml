      HRN-003 STUDY SYNOPSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) of PEGIntron plus ribavirin&#xD;
      among patients receiving a fixed dose of PEGIntron versus weighted-adjusted dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN: This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label clinical trial using&#xD;
      PEGIntron weight-adjusted dose by subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin by mouth twice&#xD;
      daily for 48 weeks OR PEGIntron fixed dose by subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin by&#xD;
      mouth twice daily for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: 600 Adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection who have&#xD;
      previously failed to achieve a sustained virologic response following interferon alfa or&#xD;
      interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Eligible participants will be randomized to receive PEGIntron&#xD;
      weight-adjusted dose (1.5 mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg by mouth&#xD;
      twice daily for 48 weeks OR PEGIntron fixed dose (150 mg if weight &gt; than 80 kg or 100 mg if&#xD;
      weight &lt; 80 KG) by subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg by mouth twice daily for&#xD;
      48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFICACY EVALUATIONS: Laboratory analysis, quality of life assessments, and change in study&#xD;
      medication doses will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY EVALUATIONS: Assessment of laboratory evaluations, vital signs, incidence and severity&#xD;
      of adverse experiences and progression of disease, as measured by HCV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a treatment protocol to evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety and tolerability&#xD;
      polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated interferon alfa-2b (PEGIntron) for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C virus infection in patients who have previously failed to achieve a&#xD;
      sustained virologic response following interferon alfa or interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin&#xD;
      therapy. Patients will be stratified according to their response to the previous course of&#xD;
      therapy (i.e. non-reponse or relapse virologic pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label clinical trial that will involve approximately&#xD;
      25 sites with an anticipated enrollment of 600 patients over a six-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to receive PEGIntron weight-adjusted dose (1.5&#xD;
      mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg by mouth twice daily for 48 weeks&#xD;
      OR PEGIntron fixed dose (150 mg if weight &gt; than 80 kg or 100 mg if weight &lt; 80 KG) by&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg by mouth twice daily for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: PEGIntron weight -adjusted dose (1.5 mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection weekly +&#xD;
           ribavirin 400 mg by mouth twice daily for 48 weeks (Total therapy x 48weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: PEGIntron fixed dose (150 mg if weight &gt; than 80 kg or 100 mg if weight &lt; 80&#xD;
           KG) by subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg by mouth twice daily for an&#xD;
           additional 48 weeks (Total therapy x 48 weeks).&#xD;

        during therapy. Persons withdrawn from methadone therapy due to violations within their&#xD;
        methadone program will be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5.2.9 Patients with an alcohol consumption of &gt; 20 gm/day are ineligible for the protocol.&#xD;

        5.2.11 Patients with a history of organ transplantation will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5.2.12 Preexisting psychiatric conditions; especially depression, or a history of severe&#xD;
        psychiatric disorder, such as major psychoses, suicidal ideation and/or suicidal attempt&#xD;
        are excluded. Patients with a history of mild depression may enter the protocol if they&#xD;
        meet the following eligibility criterion and are monitored as outlined in Section 11.2&#xD;
        (Management of Depression During Study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mild depression: to include either situational depression of a limited period or depressive&#xD;
        symptoms, which do not significantly interfere with the patients work or daily functions.&#xD;
        Any patient with a manic element to his/her previous symptom complex will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Detailed follow-up of each patient may be individualized according to his/her need; this&#xD;
        would usually include further predetermined visits. Patients with a history of mild&#xD;
        depression or patients undergoing successful treatment for mild depression will be managed&#xD;
        as outlined in Section 11.2 (Management of Depression During Study).&#xD;
