  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of AXERT when treating&#xD;
      a migraine at the onset of headache pain, as compared to treating a migraine only after the&#xD;
      headache pain has reached at least moderate intensity..&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AXERT has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of migraine headache with or without&#xD;
      aura in adults. Early treatment of a migraine headache, independent of headache pain&#xD;
      intensity symptoms, may provide the optimal therapeutic response. This is a multi-center,&#xD;
      open label study to test the efficacy (effectiveness) and tolerability of AXERT when treating&#xD;
      a migraine at the onset of headache pain versus treating a migraine only after the headache&#xD;
      pain has reached at least moderate intensity. Patients will self-administer 12.5 milligrams&#xD;
      of AXERT for the treatment of 2 migraine headaches. Centers will be randomly assigned to 1 of&#xD;
      2 treatment interventions in which patients will sequentially treat both migraine headaches&#xD;
      with 12.5 milligrams of AXERT using either the early treatment regimen (ET; ie, at the onset&#xD;
      of pain) or conditional treatment regimen (CT; ie, after the headache has reached at least&#xD;
      moderate intensity). Data will be collected regarding treatment response during and after&#xD;
      each migraine headache. For each headache, patients will record study information and data&#xD;
      during 3 telephone calls using Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) technology. It is&#xD;
      expected that patients who take 12.5 milligrams of AXERT at the first sign of pain of any&#xD;
      intensity due to a migraine headache will experience an overall shorter duration of their&#xD;
      migraine than patients who take AXERT 12.5 mg when their migraine pain has reached at least&#xD;
      moderate pain intensity. In addition, it is expected that almotriptan malate (AXERT速) is&#xD;
      generally well-tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AXERT 12.5 milligram tablet orally either at the onset of migraine pain (within 1 hour of the&#xD;
      start of a migraine-ET regimen) or when migraine pain reaches at least moderate intensity (CT&#xD;
      regimen).&#xD;

             year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Average frequency of 1 - 6 migraine headaches per month over the past 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of migraine headaches of at least moderate pain intensity within the past year&#xD;
