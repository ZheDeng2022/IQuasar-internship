  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of RG1068 (Synthetic&#xD;
      Human Secretin) when administered three times weekly to outpatients with obsessive compulsive&#xD;
      disorder (OCD), to determine the impact of multiple subcutaneous injections of RG1068 on the&#xD;
      symptoms of OCD, as measured by changes in clinical scales, and to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      RG1068 on ODC patients' anxiety, quality of life, and depression.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, dose-escalation pilot study. Prospective participants will initially&#xD;
      undergo a blinded placebo challenge to assess his or her ability to self-administer drug. A&#xD;
      total of sixteen subjects, will be enrolled in one of two study arms (eight subjects per&#xD;
      group), depending on whether or not they are receiving concurrent treatment with an SSRI. The&#xD;
      first 8 patients enrolled will receive subcutaneous injections of RG1068 at 10 µg/kg and will&#xD;
      be divided between those receiving SSRI's and those not receiving SSRI's. Those not receiving&#xD;
      SSRI treatment will further be divided between newly diagnosed, SSRI-naïve patients and&#xD;
      patients who received SSRI's in the past but who have discontinued treatment for at least&#xD;
      twelve weeks prior to enrollment. If there are no drug-related serious adverse events, an&#xD;
      additional eight patients will be enrolled and receive RG1068 at 20 µg/kg. This group will&#xD;
      also be divided between those receiving SSRI's and those not receiving SSRI's. Those not&#xD;
      receiving SSRI treatment will be further divided in the same manner as before; newly&#xD;
      diagnosed, SSRI-naïve patients, and patients who received SSRI's in the past but who have&#xD;
      discontinued treatment for at least twelve weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
