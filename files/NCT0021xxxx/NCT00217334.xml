  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Community Hypertension Assessment Trial (CHAT) is an investigation of the effect of&#xD;
      community pharmacy based blood pressure (BP) monitoring sessions led by peer health&#xD;
      educators, with feedback to family physicians, on the monitoring and management of blood&#xD;
      pressure among older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension affects about 22% of Canadian adults and is a modifiable risk factor for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Most countries have increasing older adult populations and&#xD;
      hypertension prevalence increases with age. However, the &quot;rule of halves&quot; still applies in&#xD;
      many primary health care settings: half of the hypertensive patients are undiagnosed, half of&#xD;
      the diagnosed patients are untreated, and half of the treated patients are uncontrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family physicians were randomly selected and approached to participate in CHAT. Paired&#xD;
      cluster randomization was used, with practices as the unit of randomization. Data on blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) readings in the last year, diagnosis of hypertension, diagnosis of diabetes&#xD;
      and/or target organ damage, and a current antihypertensive profile was extracted from the&#xD;
      health records of 55 patients randomly selected in each practice. In practices allocated to&#xD;
      the Intervention group, physicians sent a letter, with assistance from research staff, to&#xD;
      invite all of their eligible patients 65 years and older to attend one or two BP sessions in&#xD;
      nearby pharmacies. Inclusion criteria required that patients be regular patients in the&#xD;
      practice, community-dwelling, and mobile/well enough to attend community sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public health authorities trained older adult volunteer peer health educators to assist&#xD;
      patients at the sessions to accurately measure their BP using a validated automated device,&#xD;
      and record BP readings and cardiovascular risk factors. The volunteers provided education&#xD;
      about hypertension but did not perform a clinical function. A recommendation protocol ensured&#xD;
      that the pharmacist and, if necessary, the physician was notified if patients had a very high&#xD;
      BP or a very low BP accompanied by symptoms. A public health nurse was 'on-call' during the&#xD;
      sessions in case clinical advice was needed. A volunteer coordinator facilitated the transfer&#xD;
      of readings and patient-reported cardiovascular risk factors to physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate BP readings were obtained from the BPM-100 automated BP measuring device.&#xD;
      Questionnaires were used to obtain self-report data on cardiovascular disease risk factors&#xD;
      from patients, knowledge and attitudes about BP control from physicians, and attitudes and&#xD;
      satisfaction with the program from peer health educators, pharmacists, and public health&#xD;
      nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure followed an 'intention to treat' approach. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      was the difference in the change from 12 months pre- to 12 months post-intervention in the&#xD;
      proportion of eligible patients with a BP reading recorded in their health record with mean&#xD;
      systolic &lt;=140 mm Hg or mean diastolic &lt;=90 mmHg; &lt;=130 or &lt;=80 if target organ damage or&#xD;
      diabetes is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a collaboration by the Department of Family Medicine, McMaster University and&#xD;
      the Elisabeth Bruy√®re Research Institute, a University of Ottawa and SCO Service Partnership.&#xD;
