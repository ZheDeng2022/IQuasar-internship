      The purpose of the study is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of rabeprazole in the&#xD;
      treatment of adult patients with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in routine&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An infection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a risk factor for many types of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal diseases and associated with stomach inflammation, ulcer of the stomach or&#xD;
      small intestine. The recommended treatment for the infection is a triple therapy consisted of&#xD;
      one proton pump inhibitor, such as rabeprazole, and two antibiotics administered for 7 days.&#xD;
      This is an open label, nonrandomized study of the safety of rabeprazole in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with H. pylori infection. The study consists of 2 phases: the 2-month main phase and&#xD;
      the 4-month monitoring phase (total duration of 6 months). During the main phase, patients&#xD;
      are treated for 7 days with three drugs (rabeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxycillin), and&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the treatment is assessed 4 weeks later. During the monitoring phase,&#xD;
      patients are interviewed at monthly intervals to assess symptoms and to report any adverse&#xD;
      events. Safety assessments include the incidence of adverse events throughout the treatment&#xD;
      and monitoring phases, and laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) and vital&#xD;
      signs at the start of the study and after 1 month. Assessments of effectiveness include the&#xD;
      eradication of H. pylori infection, assessed by the urea breath test one month after&#xD;
      treatment. The primary study hypothesis is that rabeprazole is well-tolerated long-term in&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection in routine clinical practice. Rabeprazole&#xD;
      tablets (20 milligrams[mg]) taken orally twice daily for 7 days. Clarithromycin (500mg) and&#xD;
      amoxycillin (1 gram) taken twice daily for 7 days.&#xD;
