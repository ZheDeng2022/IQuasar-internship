  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation retinopathy is a disease of the retina. It occurs in people who have received or&#xD;
      been exposed to radiation near the eyes. The blood vessels are abnormal and may grow which&#xD;
      lead to scarring and a loss of central vision. Currently, the treatment for radiation&#xD;
      retinopathy is laser photocoagulation. This treatment has been found to have limited use in&#xD;
      this type of condition. Compassionate use of anecortave acetate injection is being considered&#xD;
      to prevent the growth of the blood vessels under the retina.&#xD;

      Patients will receive an injection of 15 mg of Anecortave acetate behind the eye to be&#xD;
      treated (&quot;study eye&quot;). They will be evaluated every six months to determine if their&#xD;
      condition is stable or worse. Following the injection of study medication, patients will not&#xD;
      be required to come in to see the study physician. The investigator or study staff will call&#xD;
      the patients on the day following injection to make sure there were no adverse effects to the&#xD;
      injection. Patients will then come in for a Month 1 and a Month 3 follow-up visit. At the&#xD;
      Month 3 follow-up visit, if patients are not showing stability or improvement, they may be&#xD;
      offered either thermal laser or Photodynamic Therapy. They will remain in the study and&#xD;
      remain eligible for a repeat injection of Anecortave Acetate at the Month 6 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then been seen at Month 6 for a Re-treatment Evaluation Visit. If their&#xD;
      condition is stable, they will be offered re-injection with the same study medication they&#xD;
      received earlier. If Patients are not showing stability or improvement at the Month 6 visit,&#xD;
      they may be offered thermal laser or Photodynamic Therapy in conjunction with the Anecortave&#xD;
      Acetate injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then come back again for a Month 1 and a Month 3 visit and an Exit Visit, if&#xD;
      necessary. If the patient's condition is worse, patients will be exited from this study and&#xD;
      offered standard treatment.&#xD;
