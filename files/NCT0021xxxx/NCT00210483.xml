  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of almotriptan malate&#xD;
      (AXERT®) in treating acute migraine headaches in adolescents. Amotriptan malate (AXERT®) is&#xD;
      approved for use in the treatment of acute migraine headache with or without aura in adults.&#xD;
      In this study, adolescents will be given a single dose of study medication to treat one&#xD;
      migraine headache.&#xD;

      Amotriptan malate (AXERT®) is approved for use in the treatment of acute migraine headache&#xD;
      with or without aura in adults. Other studies have shown that almotriptan is effective and&#xD;
      well tolerated in adults. Migraines in teenagers/adolescents are very similar to migraines in&#xD;
      adults, except that the duration is usually less in adolescents (they last 1 to 24 hours in&#xD;
      adolescents). This study will evaluate the usefulness of almotriptan malate (AXERT®) in&#xD;
      treating acute migraine headaches in adolescents. This is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      parallel-group, and placebo-controlled study. During a 30-day run-in period, patients will&#xD;
      treat their migraines as they normally would. During this time, the frequency and severity of&#xD;
      headaches will be recorded. At the second visit, patients will be randomized (like with the&#xD;
      toss of a coin) to a treatment group to receive one oral dose of almotriptan malate (AXERT®)&#xD;
      6.25, 12.5, or 25 milligrams or placebo. Approximately the same number of patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to each of the four treatment groups. Patients will take this one-time dose when the&#xD;
      next migraine of at least moderate severity occurs. Patients will record assessments in a&#xD;
      diary for up to 24 hours after the study drug is given to help determine the drug's effect on&#xD;
      headache pain intensity. Patients will return for a third visit within 2 to 14 days from&#xD;
      taking the study medication. A physical examination, electrocardiogram (a painless test of&#xD;
      the heart), and laboratory tests will be performed at the first and third visits. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of 3 dosage&#xD;
      strengths of almotriptan malate (AXERT®) in adolescents with migraine headaches.&#xD;

      Almotriptan oral tablets, 6.25, 12.5, or 25 milligrams, or placebo&#xD;
