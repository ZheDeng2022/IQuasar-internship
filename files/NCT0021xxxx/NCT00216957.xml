  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a well established treatment modality for patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease. For 30 years now CABG operations have been performed with the&#xD;
      help of the heart lung machine (Cardiopulmonary bypass). However, the heart lung machine is&#xD;
      believed to be responsible for many of the side effects and complications seen in patients&#xD;
      following CABG surgery. The organs most commonly affected are the brain, blood constituents,&#xD;
      lungs and kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last few years, stabilising devices have been developed that allow CABG operations to&#xD;
      be performed safely without the use of the heart lung machine. Our hypothesis was that CABG&#xD;
      done without the heart lung machine may be better tolerated by patients resulting in lower&#xD;
      morbidity, increased functional outcome and shorter hospital length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment into the trial was from 1998 to 2003 and included 300 patients. The last patient&#xD;
      was enrolled in June of 2003. The initial results from the study suggest that excellent&#xD;
      results can be obtained with both techniques and contrary to others no advantages could be&#xD;
      demonstrated in in-hospital outcomes of patients performed without cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      (Legare et al. Circulation 2005).&#xD;

      We are now in follow-up to evaluate the medium term and long term outcomes of all 300&#xD;
      patients originally enrolled in above mentioned randomized clinical trial. The follow-up of&#xD;
      patients is approved by the Capital Health Research Ethics Board (CDHA-RS/2004-295).&#xD;
