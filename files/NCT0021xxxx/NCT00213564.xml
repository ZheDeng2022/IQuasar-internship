      The objective of the study is to identify and validate predictive markers of infliximab&#xD;
      responsiveness in RA patients by 2 approaches: i) measuring biochemical, immunological and&#xD;
      bone markers in sera because of their involvement in pathogenic mechanisms; ii) identifying&#xD;
      gene-expression signatures in PBMCs by the transcriptomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with active RA (ACR criteria) were given i.v. 3 mg/kg infliximab associated with&#xD;
      metotrexate at weeks 0, 2, 6, and every 8th week. Infliximab efficacy was evaluated at week&#xD;
      14, using the EULAR response criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Just before the starting of infliximab treatment, the following parameters were measured&#xD;
           in the sera: i) immunological tests: rheumatoid factor (IgA, IgG, IgM), anti-CCP, autoAb&#xD;
           recognizing the 27 C-terminal fragment (ACAST-C27) and domain I (ACAST-DI) of&#xD;
           calpastatin, anti-G6PI, anti a-enolase, anti-keratin and anti-perinuclear factor; ii)&#xD;
           biochemical markers: CRP, MMP-1, MMP-3, TIMP-1, TIMP-2; markers of bone resorption:&#xD;
           pyridinolin, deoxypyridinolin, osteoprotegerin, sRANKL, COMP. The predictive value of&#xD;
           each parameter for a response/non-response to infliximab was analysed using Fischer's&#xD;
           exact, Mann-Whitney and Chi2 tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A blood sample was collected just before the onset of infliximab treatment and total&#xD;
           RNAs were extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The [33P] radiolabeled&#xD;
           mRNAs were hybridized (duplicate or triplicate) over a set of 10.000 human cDNA probes&#xD;
           spotted at a high density on nylon membranes. Data were normalized and filtered to allow&#xD;
           the comparison between RNA samples. Statistical analyses were performed with the R&#xD;
           software and hierarchical clustering was performed with the Cluster and Tree View&#xD;
           softwares.&#xD;
