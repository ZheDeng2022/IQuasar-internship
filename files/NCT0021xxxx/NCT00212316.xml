  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical impact of&#xD;
      15-grams daily of sodium phenylbutyrate (phenylbutyrate) in Huntington's disease and to lay&#xD;
      the groundwork for possible subsequent trials designed to specifically address its ability to&#xD;
      slow or halt the progression of the disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting in selective loss of&#xD;
      neurons in the striatum-an area of the brain that controls movement, balance, and walking-and&#xD;
      other areas of the brain. The disease is characterized by progressive motor and cognitive&#xD;
      decline. There is no cure or even plausible treatment to offset the fatal course of the&#xD;
      disease. Therefore, any treatment that ameliorates the disease would be of enormous&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study-with open-label follow-up-is to&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability of 15-grams daily of oral phenylbutyrate in people with&#xD;
      HD. The study will enroll 60 individuals. Eligible participants will be initially randomized&#xD;
      to receive either phenylbutyrate or the matching placebo for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the placebo-controlled phase, all participants will enter the open-label phase to&#xD;
      receive phenylbutyrate for 12 weeks. Participants will be followed for one month off&#xD;
      phenylbutyrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This combination of a short-term double-blind, placebo-controlled phase followed by a longer&#xD;
      open-label phase will favor the primary goals of detecting toxicity and intolerability while&#xD;
      facilitating recruitment and maximizing number of subjects on study drug.&#xD;
