      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of DBT compared to a standard drug&#xD;
      counseling approach for the treatment of opiate addiction and borderline personality disorder&#xD;
      (BPD). Treatment research has repeatedly shown that retention of BPD and substance addicted&#xD;
      individuals to be the among the most challenging for therapists. DBT has established itself&#xD;
      as one of the most effective treatments for treatment retention of these patients and for&#xD;
      reducing parasuicidal and self-injurious behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is one of two in a multi-site RCT for the treatment of opiate addiction. DBT has&#xD;
      been shown to be efficacious for the treatment of BPD patients and it has been extended in&#xD;
      this study to target addictive behaviors in these patients. The study consists of three&#xD;
      treatment parts: weekly individual and group therapy and suboxone maintenance medication.&#xD;
      Participants are provided therapy on a weekly basis for one year and suboxone for 2 years.&#xD;
      Assessments for tracking outcome are conducted every 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized patients in the DBT condition will show a reduction of substance use,&#xD;
      parasuicidal and other psychological difficulties and these gains will be maintained through&#xD;
      the year of follow-up assessments. In addition, it is predicted that adherence to DBT&#xD;
      treatment protocols will be associated with improved outcomes. Finally, it is predicted that&#xD;
      treatment &quot;dosage&quot; (average hours of therapy/week) will be positively related to clinical&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study design is a two arm randomized clinical trial comparing a one year treatment&#xD;
      program of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) + suboxone for heroin addicted individuals&#xD;
      meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD) to a one year program of standard&#xD;
      drug counseling (I/GDC) + suboxone. Drug counseling will consist of manualized individual&#xD;
      sessions + group therapy. Participants in both conditions will be prescribed psychotropic&#xD;
      medications following a standardized medication protocol developed specifically for BPD&#xD;
      individuals. Each site will enroll 86 clients with both treatment conditions being conducted&#xD;
      at each site. Assessments measuring drug use, suicidal behaviors, retention and other&#xD;
      treatment-related behaviors, general psychopathology and functioning, and increases in&#xD;
      behavioral skills will be given at four month intervals for two years&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are five outcome domains of principal interest in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Drug use: The primary outcome measure here is proportions of urinalysis (UA) coded&#xD;
           positive for opiates;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Suicidal behaviors: The primary outcome measure here is number of suicides + suicide&#xD;
           attempts. The domain of suicidal behaviors also includes (a) the number, medical risk,&#xD;
           risk/rescue score and suicide intent of all parasuicide, (b) the number of suicide&#xD;
           threats and suicide crises, and (c) the level of suicidal ideation and suicide intent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Therapy-interfering behaviors: The primary outcome measure here is maintenance in&#xD;
           therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of life interfering behaviors: The primary outcome measure here is combined&#xD;
           number of days on a psychiatric inpatient unit + days in jail (THI, SHI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Behavioral skills: The primary outcome measure here is the DBT Skills scale score from&#xD;
           the Revised Ways of Coping Checklist (RWCCL);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Risky sexual behavior: the primary outcome measure here is the number of risky sexual&#xD;
           behaviors in the time period [Casual Partners questionnaire revised [CPQ-R] and diary&#xD;
           card].&#xD;
