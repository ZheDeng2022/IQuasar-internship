  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone marrow biopsy is a painful medical procedure often performed with local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was carried out in 330 adult patients&#xD;
      who where referred for bone marrow biopsy and aspiration. 164 were assigned to inhale an&#xD;
      equimolar mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen and 166 to inhale a placebo. Pain measurement&#xD;
      used visual-analogue pain scales, which involve rating the intensity of pain on a horizontal&#xD;
      ruler&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of an inhaled equimolar mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen to prevent&#xD;
      procedural pain during lumbar puncture in children has been demonstrated. In adults the use&#xD;
      of an inhaled equimolar mixture could prevent pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although nitrous oxide was initially considered innocuous, evidence began to be gathered&#xD;
      later that it had potentially side effect. It has been demonstrated that nitrous oxide&#xD;
      inactivates the vitamin B12-dependent enzyme methionine synthetase and impairs DNA synthesis&#xD;
      in bone marrow cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this prospective, multicenter randomized placebo controlled, double-blind trial was&#xD;
      design to determine whether an inhaled equimolar mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen would&#xD;
      significantly reduce pain during bone marrow biopsy with aspiration. In addition we performed&#xD;
      a careful cytological examination of bone marrow samples in order to evaluate the quality of&#xD;
      the picture sample.&#xD;
