  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumors are heterogeneous with varying response to chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that tumors that are sensitive to a particular chemotherapeutic agent have a distinctive&#xD;
      tumor protein profile compared to those that are resistant. We further hypothesize that since&#xD;
      tumor is continuously perfused by serum, serum protein profile can be used as a surrogate&#xD;
      marker of tumor protein profile. The primary objective of this study is to identify a serum&#xD;
      protein profile that predicts gemcitabine/carboplatin sensitivity or resistance in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients with prior exposure to anthracyclines and taxanes. Secondary objectives are&#xD;
      to establish the serum protein profile of breast cancer patients who have had prior exposure&#xD;
      to anthracyclines and taxanes, and to study the pharmacogenetics of gemcitabine toxicity by&#xD;
      correlating germline genotype of transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes with plasma and&#xD;
      intracellular gemcitabine pharmacokinetics.&#xD;

      Metastatic breast cancer patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes will be&#xD;
      treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin every 3 weeks. Serial plasma samples will be&#xD;
      collected for proteomics profiling with SELDI-MS that will be correlated with tumor response&#xD;
      to identify biomarkers that may predict for chemotherapy sensitivity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female, age &gt;= 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of breast carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage IV breast cancer with prior exposure to anthracyclines and taxanes, either in&#xD;
             the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of at least one uni-dimensionally measurable, non-CNS indicator lesion&#xD;
             defined by radiologic study or physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with previous radiotherapy, the indicator lesion(s) must not be within&#xD;
             the previous radiation field. The last dose of radiotherapy should be at least 3 weeks&#xD;
             prior to study entry. The total radiotherapy received should not be more than 30% of&#xD;
             the bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status of 70 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Bone marrow: White blood cells (WBC) &gt;= 3.5 x 109/L Absolute neutrophil (segmented&#xD;
             and bands) count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 x 109/L Platelets &gt;= 100 x 109/L Haemoglobin &gt;= 9g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Hepatic: Bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), ALT or AST &lt;= 2.5x ULN, (or&#xD;
             &lt;5 X with liver metastases) Alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 2.5x ULN.&#xD;

          -  Patients with reproductive potential must use an approved contraceptive method if&#xD;
             appropriate (eg, intrauterine device, birth control pills, or barrier device) during&#xD;

             chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and immunotherapy.&#xD;

             compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
