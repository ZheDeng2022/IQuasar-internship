  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of topiramate&#xD;
      for the prevention of headaches in adults with chronic migraine. Topiramate has been approved&#xD;
      to prevent migraine headaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine headaches can be disabling and can interfere with work and a person's quality of&#xD;
      life. Preventing these headaches before they start is the best option. Topiramate, an&#xD;
      anti-seizure medication, has been shown to help prevent migraine headaches from occurring.&#xD;
      This is an open-label study that is an extension of a previous study (CAPSS-276) of&#xD;
      Topiramate in chronic migraine. It includes patients who completed the previous study or who&#xD;
      stopped the study early after taking study drug for at least 4 weeks of maintenance treatment&#xD;
      due to lack of efficacy. The current study will involve a 4-week Blinded Transition Phase&#xD;
      during which patients will be titrated up to a daily topiramate dose of 100 milligrams (or&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose, whichever is less). Then there will be a 12-week Open-Label&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase during which the topiramate dose may be adjusted according to effectiveness&#xD;
      and tolerance, but not to exceed a daily dose of 400 milligrams. After this period, patients&#xD;
      will be tapered off topiramate (Taper/Exit Phase). The length of the taper/exit phase may&#xD;
      vary based on the dose the patient was taking during the open label maintenance phase. While&#xD;
      on topiramate, patients will record daily entries in their headache records. Patients will&#xD;
      also be asked questions to help assess their quality of life. Both patients and doctors will&#xD;
      be asked questions at the end of the study about their impressions of change with respect to&#xD;
      the patient's migraine headaches. Patients will also have physical and neurological&#xD;
      examinations and laboratory tests performed during the study. The objective of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of topiramate for the prevention of&#xD;
      chronic migraine headaches. Topiramate oral tablets, 25 milligrams per tablet, will be given&#xD;
      in the morning and evening to a dose not to exceed 400 milligrams per day or to the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose, whichever is less&#xD;
