  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide use of Anecortave Acetate Sterile Suspension of 15mg for a series of five patients&#xD;
      with rubeosis iridis. Rubeosis iridis refers to neovascularization of the iris. It is caused&#xD;
      by a number of conditions which include, but are not limited to severe diabetic retinopathy,&#xD;
      central retinal vein occlusion, chronic inflammation, and infection. Anecortave acetate is an&#xD;
      angiostatic, experimental drug that is being tested to prevent the growth of blood vessels&#xD;
      under the retina in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Therefore, it is&#xD;
      logical to apply the usage of Anecortave to patient's with rubeosis iridis in order to reduce&#xD;
      the neovascularization stimulus and cause the regression of the abnormal iris vessels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive an injection of 15 mg of Anecortave acetate behind the eye to be&#xD;
      treated (&quot;study eye&quot;). They will be evaluated every six months to determine if their&#xD;
      condition is stable or worse. Following the injection of study medication, patients will not&#xD;
      be required to come in to see the study physician. The investigator or study staff will call&#xD;
      the patients on the day following injection to make sure there were no adverse effects to the&#xD;
      injection. Patients will then come in for a Week 4 and Month 3 follow-up visit. At the Month&#xD;
      3 follow-up visit, if patients are not showing stability or improvement, they may be offered&#xD;
      either thermal laser or Photodynamic Therapy. They will remain in the study and remain&#xD;
      eligible for a repeat injection of Anecortave Acetate at the Month 6 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then been seen at Month 6 for a Re-treatment Evaluation Visit. If their&#xD;
      condition is stable, they will be offered re-injection with the same study medication they&#xD;
      received earlier. If Patients are not showing stability or improvement at the Month 6 visit,&#xD;
      they may be offered thermal laser or Photodynamic Therapy in conjunction with the Anecortave&#xD;
      Acetate injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is re-injected at the 6 month visit, the schedule of follow-up visits will&#xD;
      repeat as before for the next 18 months. If the patient opts out of the re-injection, they&#xD;
      will be exited from the study.&#xD;
