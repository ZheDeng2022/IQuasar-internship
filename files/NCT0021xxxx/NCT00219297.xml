  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of patupilone with respect to&#xD;
      early progression and response of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastatic&#xD;
      to the brain, who have progressed after chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 (corresponding to&#xD;
             Karnofsky performance status of 50 or better)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with radiologically proven (by gadolinium-enhanced [Gd-] magnetic resonance&#xD;
             imaging [MRI]) parenchymal brain metastases from histologically confirmed non-small&#xD;
             cell lung cancer (the primary disease may be quiescent). Gd-MRI must be performed&#xD;
             within 2 weeks of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have at least one bidimensionally measurable intracranial lesion of a&#xD;
             minimum of 2 cm as defined by Gd-MRI. If the patient has had previous radiation to the&#xD;
             marker lesion(s), there must be evidence of residual disease &gt; 2 cm or the lesion must&#xD;
             have demonstrated progression since the radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those patients progressing on radiotherapy must have a 25% increase in the size of the&#xD;
             previously radiated intracranial lesion based on the Neuro-Oncology Criteria of Tumor&#xD;
             Response for Central Nervous System (CNS) Tumors or appearance of new lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be controlled on medication and neurologically stable: stable on&#xD;
             steroids and anticonvulsants for at least 2 weeks prior to obtaining the baseline&#xD;
             Gd-MRI of the brain, and/or at least 2 weeks prior to beginning study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. (Not&#xD;
             applicable to patients with bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy or to those&#xD;
             patients who are postmenopausal.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective method of&#xD;
             contraception during the study and for three months following termination of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent must be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of leptomeningeal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with extracranial disease in more than 3 organ sites including the primary&#xD;
             tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received any investigational compound within the past 28 days or who&#xD;
             are planning to receive other investigational drugs while participating in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior administration of epothilone(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with unresolved diarrhea within the last 7 days before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving known diarrheogenic agents must stop treatment with these agents&#xD;
             prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy &lt; 3 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior intracranial surgery &lt; 3 weeks prior to study entry; patient must have recovered&#xD;
             from surgery prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy &lt; 3 weeks prior to study entry; &lt; 6 weeks from prior nitrosoureas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe cardiac insufficiency (New York Heart Association [NYHA] III or IV), with&#xD;
             uncontrolled and/or unstable cardiac or coronary artery disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy not permitted while on study. Exception: palliative radiotherapy of&#xD;
             metastasis in extremities is allowed, but such lesions cannot be used as target or&#xD;
             non-target lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving hematopoietic growth factors except for erythropoietin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking Coumadin® or other agents containing warfarin, with the exception of&#xD;
             low dose Coumadin® (1 mg or less daily) administered prophylactically for maintenance&#xD;
             of in-dwelling lines or ports&#xD;
