    <textblock>
      To evaluate a model of shared decision-making for asthma treatment, appropriate to the needs&#xD;
      of African American, Latino, Chinese, and other Asian and low income Caucasian patients to&#xD;
      adherence to asthma controller medications in a two-year randomized clinical trial in 302&#xD;
      minority and low-income adults, 18-70 years of age, with suboptimally controlled, persistent&#xD;
      asthma, paralleling a simultaneous evaluation being conducted in 311 Caucasian and&#xD;
      Asian/Pacific Island adults, (total n=613), and to examine psychological mechanisms mediating&#xD;
      the effects of the intervention on adherence and of adherence on asthma outcomes.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. Despite major advances in&#xD;
      understanding of its pathophysiology and management, asthma outcomes have not shown parallel&#xD;
      improvement. Many patients with asthma are poorly controlled and have sub-optimal health&#xD;
      status. Asthma care management by a trained non-physician health professional has developed&#xD;
      as a means of addressing the problems of patients evidencing poor control and/or poor&#xD;
      adherence to controller medications. Shared decision making (SDM) between clinician and&#xD;
      patient has also been proposed as a means of getting greater patient involvement in their&#xD;
      care, with the idea that this may improve medication adherence and outcomes. However,&#xD;
      significant patient involvement also might result in less adequate regimens than would&#xD;
      management based on guidelines (MBG). Even so, increased adherence to a less adequate regimen&#xD;
      might result in better outcomes than poor adherence to an optimal regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better Outcomes of Asthma Treatment (BOAT) is a randomized controlled trial (a collaborative&#xD;
      study designed to compare the effectiveness of three strategies for managing patients, 18-70&#xD;
      years of age, with suboptimally controlled, persistent asthma. The three treatment strategies&#xD;
      are: usual care (UC); management by guidelines (MG); and a third, shared decision making&#xD;
      (SDM) arm, that seeks to formally involve the patient in the therapeutic decision-making&#xD;
      process. Under the present grant, 302 study participants were recruited from the membership&#xD;
      of the Kaiser Permanente - Northern California Region (KPNC), San Francisco, Oakland, and&#xD;
      Richmond medical centers. In the collaborating grant (No.HL67092-03) 311 patients were&#xD;
      recruited from Kaiser Permanente clinical facilities in Portland, OR, and Honolulu, HI.&#xD;
      Patients were randomized equally to the three treatment arms following baseline assessment of&#xD;
      asthma control, medication use, lung function, and other behavioral and psychological&#xD;
      characteristics. Their health care utilization for asthma and acquisition of asthma&#xD;
      medications is being followed for a total of 24 months post-randomization through health&#xD;
      system records, and they are being reassessed at 12 mos. Those assigned to the care&#xD;
      management conditions received asthma education and objective feedback on their level of&#xD;
      asthma control. Those assigned to the MBG condition were prescribed a regimen appropriate to&#xD;
      the severity of their asthma in accordance with standard guidelines for asthma management.&#xD;
      Those assigned to the SDM condition participated in a process to elicit their goals for their&#xD;
      asthma treatment and their priorities regarding their asthma medications, and then engaged in&#xD;
      a process of shared decision making with the care manager designed to arrive at a prescribed&#xD;
      regimen that satisfied their goals and preferences. Analysis of the data will compare the two&#xD;
      care management approaches with usual care and with each other in terms of the primary&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
