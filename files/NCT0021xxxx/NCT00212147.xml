  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low cobalamin (vitamin B12) levels are frequent in the elderly. Most often they reflect a&#xD;
      mild metabolic abnormality without clinical symptoms (subclinical cobalamin deficiency). It&#xD;
      is unclear if these elderly people require medical intervention, unlike that small minority&#xD;
      with clinical symptoms which can progress and create severe blood or nervous system problems.&#xD;
      The study aims to determine if nitrous oxide (N2O), a common anesthetic agent, worsens&#xD;
      cobalamin status in elderly patients with unrecognized subclinical cobalamin deficiency. The&#xD;
      reason for concern is that N2O inactivates cobalamin and can aggravate the clinical picture&#xD;
      of patients who already have clinical manifestations of cobalamin deficiency. The elderly are&#xD;
      known to have an increased risk of developing mental changes after surgery and it may be that&#xD;
      sometimes these result from aggravation of subclinical cobalamin deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study recruits people over the age of 60 years who are undergoing clinically indicated&#xD;
      elective surgery requiring general anesthesia for more than 1 hour. Patients meeting&#xD;
      exclusion and inclusion criteria are randomized to receive either a standard anesthetic&#xD;
      regimen that includes N2O or a nearly identical one without N2O. Before surgery and 2 weeks&#xD;
      and 4 weeks after surgery, each patient undergoes (1) a broad battery of tests of cognition&#xD;
      and mood and (2) blood tests measuring cobalamin, folate and homocysteine-methionine&#xD;
      metabolism to determine whether they have any subtle biochemical impairment of cobalamin&#xD;
      status. DNA from blood cells is also tested for the presence of common mutations that affect&#xD;
      key enzymes in those metabolic pathways. A brief testing for postoperative delirium is also&#xD;
      done 2 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient subgroups' are analyzed for neuropsychologic changes over time, using the&#xD;
      preoperative test as the baseline for all comparisons, and associations of those changes with&#xD;
      metabolic, genetic, demographic and clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary question is what effect routine N2O exposure has on the latter compared with&#xD;
      non-N2O anesthesia in elderly people who either have or do not have subclinical cobalamin&#xD;
      deficiency. It will help answer whether or not the combination can help explain the increased&#xD;
      risk of cognitive problems after surgery in elderly patients, and by extension whether&#xD;
      preoperative cobalamin testing and treatment may be indicated in the elderly. It will also&#xD;
      test whether genetic predisposition affects the described problems.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double-blind, randomized study of elderly patients scheduled for elective surgery under&#xD;
           general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical, cobalamin-related, and demographic information;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests of cobalamin-related metabolic status and genotyping for 4 relevant&#xD;
           mutations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychoneurologic evaluation before surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization to receive a standard anesthetic regimen with nitrous oxide (N2O) or the&#xD;
           same regimen without N2O;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative and perioperative data are collected;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing for delirium 2-3 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All preoperative studies are repeated after 2 weeks and 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with abnormal cognitive status persisting at 4 weeks receive cobalamin and are&#xD;
           retested at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;60 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anticipated duration of general anesthesia &gt;1 hour;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Good English comprehension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery involving the brain, blood supply to head and neck, or heart;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dementia, psychosis or brain disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraindication to N2O use;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical status other than ASA class 1 or 2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bronchospastic or obstructive pulmonary disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  N2O exposure in past 6 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cobalamin injection in past 6 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RBC mean corpuscular volume &gt;95 fl;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine &gt;1.8 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History or evidence of paresthesias, numbness of feet or hands, gait and balance&#xD;
           problems, memory and thinking problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the preoperative cognitive test produces a suspicious result (two or more unrelated test&#xD;
      results &gt;1.5 x standard deviation below the normal mean), immediate review is done to decide&#xD;
      about exclusion of the patient from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All investigators and testers are blinded to the N2O exposure (except the anesthesiologist)&#xD;
      and cobalamin status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Numbers: Statistical power analysis by our statistician projected the need for 386&#xD;
      subjects to achieve a power of 80% with type I error of 0.05. Based on a possible 15% subject&#xD;
      loss rate, 444 subjects are planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Information questionnaire includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relevant medical history;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cobalamin-related history;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computer-generated numbers system;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Made known just before surgery to the anesthesiologist only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One of two effective, commonly used anesthetic regimens protocols;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard ASA monitors, an oxygen analyzer and carbon dioxide capnograph are applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General anesthesia is induced in both the N2O and non-N2O groups with fentanyl (2-5&#xD;
           µg/kg) and propofol (1-3 mg/kg), which allows for appropriate titration to the desired&#xD;
           end point without adverse reactions. Cisatracurium (0.15 mg/kg) is given for muscle&#xD;
           relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anesthesia is then maintained with either 40% oxygen/60% N2O (N2O study arm) or 40%&#xD;
           oxygen in air (non-N2O arm), with desflurane for both study groups, titrated to depth of&#xD;
           anesthesia. Fentanyl is used in both groups (1 µg/kg/hr) as the primary narcotic until&#xD;
           just before the end of surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following intubation, monitored ventilation maintains normocapnea and adequate&#xD;
           oxygenation. Temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate are maintained by prescribed&#xD;
           standard methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of surgery, desflurane and N2O (or, in the other study arm, desflurane and&#xD;
           O2/room air) are stopped, residual neuromuscular block is pharmacologically antagonized,&#xD;
           dolasetron is given as prophylaxis against nausea and vomiting, and postoperative&#xD;
           analgesia is provided with opioids, as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The protocols allow for clinically indicated modifications at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the above assures that anesthetic management is not compromised, allows the&#xD;
           inclusion of N2O (vs room air) to be the only difference between the two arms, and uses&#xD;
           no agents known to affect cobalamin other than N2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of N2O exposure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doses of all anesthetics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery actually performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen saturation, as monitored continuously;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End-tidal CO2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End-tidal desflurane;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood loss and transfusions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temperature on emergence from anesthesia, and minimal temperature;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Range of perioperative blood pressures;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of emergence delirium;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse postoperative events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications required postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Tests of Cobalamin Status and related tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum cobalamin and folate levels;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Homocysteine by immunoassay of EDTA-anticoagulated plasma separated within 1 hour in the&#xD;
           PI's laboratory;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma metabolites (methionine, glutathione, S-adenosylmethionine,&#xD;
           S-adenosylhomocysteine, cysteine, and cysteinylglycine; see later);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum creatinine, complete blood count, and blood smear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of subclinical cobalamin deficiency is made if BOTH of the following criteria&#xD;
      are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two or more of the following 3 abnormalities: low cobalamin, high homocysteine, or high&#xD;
           MMA levels. All investigators remain blinded to these findings, which require no action.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically apparent cobalamin deficiency is ruled out. This is always known by the&#xD;
           investigators before surgery, permitting immediate exclusion of the patient from the&#xD;
           study if positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assay of Metabolites of Homocysteine and Methionine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma is separated within 15 minutes of venipuncture, kept on ice until centrifugation,&#xD;
           and stored in aliquots at -80C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unthawed aliquots are shipped on dry ice to the University of Arkansas for assay using&#xD;
           HPLC with coulometric detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because some metabolites are affected by renal status, adjustment for creatinine is&#xD;
           made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyses focus on metabolite results in relation to (a) each other; (b) original&#xD;
           cobalamin status; (c) folate levels; (d) N2O exposure, both in relation to original&#xD;
           cobalamin status and gene polymorphisms; (e) presence of gene polymorphisms (including&#xD;
           combinations); and (f) appearance of cognitive dysfunction vs none. Longitudinal&#xD;
           metabolic changes over the entire follow-up period are examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene Polymorphism Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DNA is extracted from preoperative blood samples, and purified DNA is stored at -80C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 677C-T and 1298A-C mutations of MTHFR are determined by standard techniques;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The methionine synthase 2756A-G (D919G) mutation is identified using HaeIII, and the&#xD;
           MTRR 66A-G (I22M) mutation using NdeI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis will consider homozygous mutation states and combined heterozygosity that&#xD;
           produces impaired enzyme activity, combined mutations of the different enzymes, as well&#xD;
           as allele frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study analyses focus on these questions: (a) Does metabolic or clinical N2O effect vary&#xD;
           with genotype? (b) Do the polymorphisms influence the appearance of subclinical&#xD;
           cobalamin deficiency? (c) How are metabolite changes affected by each mutation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Function and Depression Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Done by a trained tester in a quiet office free of distractions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A focused battery of neuropsychological tests that requires 1.5 hours is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tests assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Attention/Concentration: (a) Paced Serial Addition Test, which requires active&#xD;
                attention and rapid information processing; (b) California Computerized Assessment&#xD;
                Package measures perfomance sensitive to attention and decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cognitive flexibility is tested by Letter-Number Sequencing, a subtest from the&#xD;
                Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Memory and learning are tested with the California Verbal Learning Test-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Depression is assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests are scored within 48 hours and reviewed with the neuropsychologist, both of whom&#xD;
      are blinded to the patients' status. All measures are expected to show some &quot;practice&#xD;
      (familiarization) effect&quot; over the 3 administrations, and appropriate adjustments and&#xD;
      analyses are made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If results in any test in two of the four test categories are &gt;1.5 SD below normal mean in&#xD;
      the preoperative assessment, immediate review for possible exclusion from the study is done.&#xD;
      A decline in postoperative test results by the &gt;1.5 x SD of the normal mean from the previous&#xD;
      result in 2 individual tests is also brought to the attention of the PI and the safety&#xD;
      monitor for a decision concerning cobalamin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment for delirium is done 2-3 hours postoperatively with the Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination and the CAM-ICU test. Potential confounders such as drugs, hypoxia, and infection&#xD;
      are taken into account in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up beyond 4 weeks is done in those patients with any cognitive function&#xD;
      (including depression testing) significantly worse at the 4 week test than preoperatively. A&#xD;
      decline in any test equivalent to 1 SD of the normal mean for that test is used as the&#xD;
      decision benchmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary question is whether patients with subclinical deficiency show&#xD;
           neuropsychologic impairment after N2O exposure that is greater than in patients without&#xD;
           deficiency. Analysis of these differences include comparison between deficient and&#xD;
           non-deficient patients assigned to the non-N2O arm. Confounders are addressed by&#xD;
           adjusting for relevant variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The statistician conducts all analyses and consult on an ongoing basis throughout the&#xD;
           study. Before analysis, continuous variables are subjected to logarithmic&#xD;
           transformation. Univariate analyses, followed by selected multivariate analyses, include&#xD;
           duration of anesthetic exposure, level of preoperative and postoperative metabolic&#xD;
           deficits, as well as coexisting disorders. Bonferroni adjustment is used for multiple&#xD;
           comparisons where appropriate. Multiple logitic regression is used to evaluate&#xD;
           significant independent predictors of abnormal results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An interim analysis will be done after 3.5 years, using an alpha of 0.005.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyses of metabolic and genetic findings will be done by univariate analyses, followed&#xD;
           by multivariate analyses to determine the mutations' effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects are undergoing clinically indicated, elective surgery under general&#xD;
           anesthesia. No aspect of their surgical management will be affected by their&#xD;
           participation. The only study-related change in their clinical management will be the&#xD;
           random assignment to omission or inclusion of N2O from near identical, standard&#xD;
           anesthesia regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The only other manipulations are blood sampling and undergoing neuropsychologic testing&#xD;
           several days before surgery and on 3-4 occasions postoperatively (except genetic tests,&#xD;
           which are done only once).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical information collection relevant to the study is subject to confidentiality&#xD;
           protection in all HIPAA-mandated respects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cobalamin/N2O related risks are actually smaller in participants than in&#xD;
           nonparticipants. Several layers of protection against the small risks associated with&#xD;
           the study include the cobalamin-related evaluation that is not otherwise done routinely&#xD;
           before N2O anesthesia to identify patients who are at known risk from N2O; continued&#xD;
           postoperative monitoring for changes in cobalamin status and significant cognitive&#xD;
           decline; intervention with cobalamin therapy in possibly affected patients; institution&#xD;
           of a Data Safety Monitoring plan with an independent safety monitor; and interim&#xD;
           analysis of study findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative discovery of cognitive test dysfunction excludes patients from the study&#xD;
           before any exposure to risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A postoperative decline exceeding the equivalent of 1.5 x SD of the normal mean in two&#xD;
           unrelated measures of cognitive function are brought to the immediate attention of the&#xD;
           PI, the collaborating neuropsychologist, and an independent scientist-clinician who is&#xD;
           not a part of our study.&#xD;
