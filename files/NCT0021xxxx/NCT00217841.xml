  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the addition of Aurograb to standard vancomycin therapy will&#xD;
      improve outcome in MRSA infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Primary Objective will be to determine whether the overall response (clinical and&#xD;
      bacterial) to Aurograb® (1mg/kg i.v. b.d.) plus vancomycin is greater than the overall&#xD;
      response to placebo plus vancomycin, in adult hospitalised patients with severe, deep-seated&#xD;
      staphylococcal infections, particularly MRSA infections, being treated with vancomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To further determine efficacy, comparing Aurograb versus placebo, regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  attributable mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  overall mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  clinical response&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  bacterial response ie eradication or persistence of the infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  rates of clinical resistance to vancomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the safety profile of treatment with Aurograb® (1mg/kg b.d.) plus vancomycin&#xD;
           versus placebo plus vancomycin in adult hospitalised patients with deep-seated&#xD;
           staphylococcal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To extend the data base on pharmacokinetics.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients will have to satisfy the following inclusion criteria to enter the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospitalised adult patients (18 years or over) with severe, deep-seated staphylococcal&#xD;
             infection being treated with vancomycin, this diagnosis being based on clinical signs&#xD;
             and symptoms appropriate to the site of infection (as detailed under subsets, Section&#xD;
             4.6) plus a positive culture or Gram stain showing Gram positive cocci in clusters&#xD;
             (not chains) from one or more of the following clinically significant sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. a blood culture ii. a lower respiratory tract specimen eg sputum or BAL iii.&#xD;
             pleural fluid iv. intra-abdominal fluid or tissue v. urine (in patients with renal&#xD;
             sepsis or complicated urinary tract infections)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study drug must be started while there is clinical evidence of active infection&#xD;
             (usually within 24 hours of starting vancomycin, although longer delays are acceptable&#xD;
             if the patient is still clinically septic and culture positive within 24 hours of&#xD;
             starting study drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recruitment may be initiated on the basis of a Gram stain but, for the patient to be&#xD;
             eligible to continue in the study, staphylococcal sepsis must subsequently be&#xD;
             confirmed by culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The positive specimen must be from a clinically significant specimen taken within 2&#xD;
             days of starting the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be on i.v. vancomycin as the sole systemic antibiotic for the first 3&#xD;
             days of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have sufficient venous access to permit administration of study drug and&#xD;
             monitoring of safety variables&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent must be obtained for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients fulfilling the following criteria will not enter the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior Antibiotic Usage: Patients who have received (within 48 hours of study entry) a&#xD;
             systemic anti-staphylococcal antibiotic other than vancomycin for longer than 24&#xD;
             hours, unless the patient was considered to have failed that regime ie a documented&#xD;
             treatment failure (ie 3 days' treatment and not responding) or the Staphylococcus is&#xD;
             resistant to the antibiotic in vitro (e.g. the patient is initially treated with&#xD;
             flucloxacillin but the isolate subsequently identified as resistant) - in such cases&#xD;
             the antibiotic must be changed to vancomycin to enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant Antibiotics: usage of concomitant antibiotic except as allowed by the&#xD;
             protocol (see Section 5.3)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with devices infected with S. aureus, including implants and catheters, which&#xD;
             cannot be removed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to have AIDS, who have a CD4 cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with staphylococcal endocarditis, mediastinitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis&#xD;
             and/or joint infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asymptomatic carriers of MRSA - such patients must be clinically septic due to the&#xD;
             MRSA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with methicillin-sensitive CNS (MSSE)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with methicillin-resistant CNS (MRSE) unless they are clinically significant&#xD;
             blood culture isolates, as indicated by two blood cultures (taken from two different&#xD;
             sites) growing the same CNS in a clinically septic patient in whom there is no other&#xD;
             significant pathogen responsible for the sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females who have a positive pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a known allergy to any constituent of Aurograb® (i.e.&#xD;
             hypersensitivity to antibody, nickel, urea or arginine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received an unlicensed drug within three months prior to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a concomitant medical condition, in whom, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, participation may create an unacceptable risk for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients considered inappropriate for enrolment in this study by the Investigator for&#xD;
             any other reason.&#xD;
