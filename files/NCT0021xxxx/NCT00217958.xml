      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure increases asthma morbidity in children. Efforts to&#xD;
      reduce exposure have had mixed results. This study is a randomized controlled trial of an&#xD;
      exposure reduction intervention, with objective feedback to parents on the child's exposure&#xD;
      based on urine cotinine measurement, and counseling tailored to the child's specific exposure&#xD;
      sources/locations and parental readiness to take specific actions to reduce exposure from&#xD;
      each source/location. This trial involves 350 SHS-exposed children with persistent asthma,&#xD;
      3-12 years of age, receiving care from the Kaiser Health Care Program in Northern California.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes over the 18 months of follow-up will be asthma acute care utilization and&#xD;
      urine cotinine/creatine ratio. Changes in controller medication adherence will be evaluated&#xD;
      using a pharmacy-based dispensing index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a behaviorally-based,&#xD;
      cotinine-feedback-and-monitoring program designed to reduce SHS exposure in an 18-month&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 350 children with persistent asthma, 3-12 years of&#xD;
      age, in comparison with usual medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: 1) to investigate the behavioral mechanisms that mediate between the&#xD;
      intervention and associated improvements in asthma outcomes, and 2) to determine the&#xD;
      influence of initial caregiver stage of change with regard to smoking practices on response&#xD;
      to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Disease outcomes: A behaviorally-based, individually-tailored intervention that&#xD;
           emphasizes SHS exposure reduction, provides sequential feedback to the parent on the&#xD;
           child's urine cotinine level, and is tailored to the parent's stage of change with&#xD;
           regard to smoking practices will be associated with decreased asthma crisis care&#xD;
           utilization and improvements in secondary disease outcomes over an 18-month follow-up&#xD;
           period when compared with usual medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ETS exposure: The SHS reduction intervention will be associated with lower SHS exposure&#xD;
           at follow-up (assessed by urine cotinine/creatinine ratio), compared with usual medical&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mechanism: Decreases in urine cotinine/creatinine ratio will be instrumental in&#xD;
           intervention-associated improvements in asthma crisis care utilization.&#xD;
