  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Once-daily nucleotide/nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI/NRTI) combinations&#xD;
      form the backbone of many regimens. Although efficacy data exists between tenofovir and the&#xD;
      pyrimidine analogues (i.e. lamivudine and emtricitabine), recent clinical data suggests a&#xD;
      potential interaction between tenofovir and purine analogs (i.e. abacavir and didanosine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the impact of an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate, tenofovir (TDF),&#xD;
      on the intracellular metabolism of a purine nucleoside analog, abacavir (ABC), as a&#xD;
      determinant of the antiviral potency of this nucleotide/nucleoside reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitor (NtRTI/NRTI) combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis #1: ABC and TDF dosed together will have reduced antiviral activity, as&#xD;
           measured by early plasma HIV RNA decay kinetics, than the drugs given alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis #2: ABC dosed with TDF will have reduced intracellular concentrations, as&#xD;
           measured by the ratio of carbovir triphosphate (active metabolite of ABC) to&#xD;
           deoxyguanosine triphosphate (endogenous nucleotide), compared to ABC given alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to compare the virologic potency and pharmacology of&#xD;
      TDF and ABC alone and in combination. Since it is not feasible or ethical to give mono or&#xD;
      dual-therapy with these agents for prolonged intervals, this project was designed to take&#xD;
      advantage of a short term drug exposure. The study performs intensive lab monitoring with a&#xD;
      cross-over design to compare short courses of monotherapy and dual-therapy. This is an&#xD;
      open-labeled study of a dual NRTI/NtRTI combination, ABC + TDF, compared to ABC and TDF&#xD;
      monotherapy administered for 7 days. A screening genotype will be done to confirm that there&#xD;
      are no resistance-associated mutations at baseline. Each subject will then be randomized to a&#xD;
      7-day sequence of monotherapy (ABC or TDF), and four measurements for plasma HIV RNA will be&#xD;
      done to calculate the slope of the phase one viral decay. Prior to initiation of nucleoside&#xD;
      analogues, PBMCs will be collected to measure baseline expression of nucleoside transport&#xD;
      enzymes via RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. On days 7 and 8, serial blood specimens will be&#xD;
      collected for plasma and intracellular levels of TDF and ABC. The monotherapy sequence will&#xD;
      be followed by a 35-day washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the washout (day 42), subjects will initiate the dual NRTI/NtRTI therapy sequence for&#xD;
      an additional 7 days. During dual NRTI/NtRTI therapy, again, four measurements for HIV RNA&#xD;
      will be done to calculate the slope of the phase one viral decay. On day 48 and 49, serial&#xD;
      plasma and intracellular levels of ABC + TDF will be evaluated. On Day 49 a second HIV&#xD;
      genotype will be performed in real time. On day 49, after the second 7-day sequence, all&#xD;
      subjects will receive EFV in addition to the ABC + TDF combination for 14 days. Afterwards, a&#xD;
      second sample of PBMCs will be collected to evaluate for a potential induction or suppression&#xD;
      of nucleoside transport enzymes. Since the long-term efficacy of the TDF + ABC nucleoside&#xD;
      backbone is not yet known, TDF will be discontinued (day 63) and 3TC will be substituted.&#xD;
      Subjects will then continue on the HAART portion of the study for an additional 46 weeks of&#xD;
      EFV + ABC + 3TC.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a comparative, open-labeled study of a dual NRTI regimen, TDF + ABC, compared to ABC and TDF monotherapy administered for 7 days. Each patient will be randomized to a 7-day sequence of either ABC or TDF once-daily followed by a 35-day washout period. After completion of the monotherapy sequence all patients will then receive dual NRTI therapy of TDF + ABC for an additional 7 days. After completion of the dual NRTI sequence patients will enter the HAART treatment stage with the addition of EFV and continue on a once-daily regimen of EFV + ABC + TDF for an additional 14 days. At day 63, TDF will be stopped and 3TC will be substituted. Patients will then continue on a once-daily regimen of EFV + ABC + 3TC for an additional 46 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

All 7 samples from the sparse PK (time 0, 30-min, 1-hr, 2-hr, 3-hr, 6-hr and 24-hr post dose) should be sent overnight to appropriate off-site lab for analysis. Since the patient is on dual therapy and the each drug is measured in separate labs each PBMC samples should be split at each time-point with half of the samples shipped to Gilead and half shipped to USC (two separate shipments). ALL plasma samples should be sent to USC. Since samples have to be split we will need to collect double the blood for the intracellular (PBMC) PK:&#xD;

        <description>At day 49 of Sequence 2 a 24-hour post dose plasma sample should be collected and processed. All 7 samples from the sparse PK (time 0, 30-min, 1-hr, 2-hr, 3-hr, 6-hr and 24-hr post dose) should be sent overnight to appropriate off-site lab for analysis. Since the patient is on dual therapy and the each drug is measured in separate labs each PBMC samples should be split at each time-point with half of the samples shipped to Gilead and half shipped to USC (two separate shipments). ALL plasma samples should be sent to USC. Since samples have to be split we will need to collect double the blood for the intracellular (PBMC) PK:&#xD;

        <title>Determine Total Number of NRTI-associated Mutations After 7 Days of ABC or TDF Monotherapy or After 7 Days of Dual NRTI Therapy With ABC + TDF</title>
        <description>Subjects will be randomized to either TDF or ABC PO route for 7 days, which involves a fixed number of subjects. A sample size of 20 subjects (10 ABC and 10 TDF monotherapy and 20 ABC+TDF dual-therapy in HIV-positive patients). We determined the count of NRTI-associated mutations that emerged after 7 days of ABC or TDF monotherapy or after 7 days of dual NRTI therapy with ABC + TDF.</description>

        <description>Eligible patients will be randomized into two monotherapy arms (TDF and ABC) for a short (one week) viral dynamics and pharmacokinetics evaluation to determine their potency. After a one-month washout period, all patients will start a dual-therapy of ABC+TDF. Viral dynamics and pharmacokinetics of the dual-therapy will be evaluated during the first week of the treatment. EFV will be added to the regimen after one week of the dual-therapy administered. Relative potencies of two monotherapy regimens (TDF alone vs. ABC alone) assessed by the short-term virologic response.

        <description>At day 49 of Sequence 2 a 24-hour post dose intracellular (PBMC) should be collected and processed. All 7 samples from the sparse PK (time 0, 30-min, 1-hr, 2-hr, 3-hr, 6-hr and 24-hr post dose) should be sent overnight to appropriate off-site lab for analysis. Since the patient is on dual therapy and the each drug is measured in separate labs each PBMC samples should be split at each time-point with half of the samples shipped to Gilead and half shipped to USC (two separate shipments). ALL intracellular (PBMC) samples should be sent to USC. Since samples have to be split we will need to collect double the blood for the intracellular (PBMC) PK:&#xD;
