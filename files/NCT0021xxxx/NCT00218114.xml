  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of divalproex sodium (Depakote)&#xD;
      versus placebo in treating disruptive behavior disorder and explosive tempers in adolescents&#xD;
      and adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disruptive behavior disorders among children and adolescents are readily diagnosed; however,&#xD;
      few individuals with such disorders receive drug treatment. Depakote is a mood stabilizing&#xD;
      medication that may be beneficial in treating individuals with disruptive behavior disorders.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of Depakote in reducing temper&#xD;
      outbursts and improving mood in individuals with disruptive behavior disorders. In addition,&#xD;
      this study will determine the safety and effectiveness of Depakote in treating individuals&#xD;
      with substance disorders who also have disruptive behavior disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last 6 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive treatment&#xD;
      with Depakote or placebo. Medication will be given in a single evening dose if tolerated;&#xD;
      otherwise, medication will be given twice per day. Participants will be assigned to a&#xD;
      fixed-flexible dosing schedule and dosages will increase based on weight. All participants&#xD;
      will attend weekly psychotherapy and family counseling sessions throughout the study.&#xD;
      Participants who are substance abusers will also receive substance abuse counseling. Weekly&#xD;
      study visits will include a physical exam, blood collection, and drug tests. Teachers and&#xD;
      guidance counselors will be contacted to assess the participant's behavior from week to week.&#xD;
      Some participants will complete a follow-up study, in which they will take part in phone&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;

    <description>Divalproex sodium (Depakote). This is a parallel groups design lasting a total of six weeks. Participants will be on a fixed-flexible dosing schedule. The dose of depakote will be raised to 750mgs or 1000mgs, depending on weight, in two weeks to achieve blood levels between 50-130 micrograms per milliliter. If a patient does not achieve this blood level on 750mgs or 1000 mgs, the dose may be raised during the second week.</description>
