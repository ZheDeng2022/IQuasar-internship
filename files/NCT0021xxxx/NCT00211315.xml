    <textblock>
      Congenital Telangiectasia or Coat's disease is an uncommon disorder that involves the growth&#xD;
      of blood vessels of the macula. These blood vessels msy extend beneth the retina to produce&#xD;
      an area of sub-retinal neovascularization(growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina&#xD;
      which &quot;leak&quot; fluid, causing reduction in vision). Limited forms of treatment are available in&#xD;
      managing the neovascularization and its consequences. Anecortave Acetate injection will be&#xD;
      considered as an attempt to control the growth of the abnormal blood vessels.&#xD;

      After evaluation, the patient will receive an injection of anecortave acetate (15mg)&#xD;
      juxtascleral with a special cannula in the study eye. the patient will be contacted via phone&#xD;
      on the day following the injection. If problem arises patient has to come back to see the&#xD;
      study doctor. if patient is stable, a 3 month follow-up visit will be st-up.if the patient&#xD;
      does not show improvement, the patient may be offered either thermal laser or PDT. If patient&#xD;
      is stable, on the month 6 visit ,the patient will again receive another injection of&#xD;
      anecortave acetate. The succeding follow-up schedule will be followed for a total of 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
