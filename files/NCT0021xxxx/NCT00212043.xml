                receiving corticosteriod therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria for phase I patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           The exclusion criteria are the same as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The inclusion criteria are the same as above except for the following groups of&#xD;
           patients, which are allowed in the phase I study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with evaluable disease only (with no measurable lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with one (and only one) line of chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, excluding&#xD;
                patients who had received prior platinium and/or gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with indicator lesions in previous radiation field.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurability of indicator lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measurable: The lesion can be measured accurately in at least one dimension&#xD;
                (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;&#xD;
                10mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Non-measurable: All other lesions including small lesions (longest diameter &lt;20 mm&#xD;
                with conventional techniques or &lt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan) and truly&#xD;
                non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered to be truly non-measurable include the&#xD;
                following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/cutis/pulmonis,&#xD;
                abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, and&#xD;
                cystic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Target Lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and&#xD;
                10 lesions in total representative of all involved organs should be identified as&#xD;
                target lesions and be recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be&#xD;
                selected on the basis of their size (lesion with the longest diameter) and their&#xD;
                suitability for accurate measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically).&#xD;
                A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and&#xD;
                reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD is used as the reference by&#xD;
                which to characterize the objective tumor response. If there are &gt; 10 measurable&#xD;
                lesions, those not selected as target lesions will be considered together with&#xD;
                non-measurable disease as non-target lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Non-target Lesions: All non-measurable lesions (or sites of disease) plus any&#xD;
                measurable lesions over and above the 10 listed as target lesions. Measurements are&#xD;
                not required but these lesions should be noted at baseline and should be followed&#xD;
                as &quot;present&quot; or &quot;absent&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any tumour measurement relying solely on physical examination should be verified by&#xD;
                a second physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The same diagnostic imaging method must be used throughout the study to evaluate&#xD;
                the lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. TREATMENT PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Phase I study&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.1 Carboplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
           The starting dose of carboplatin is given at a fixed dose at a target AUC of 5 over 1&#xD;
           hour on day 1 in both arms of the study. Carboplatin will be given before gemcitabine in&#xD;
           all patients. The dose is repeated every 21 days and will be calculated using the&#xD;
           Calvert formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dose of carboplatin (mg) = [calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) + 25] x 5&#xD;
&#xD;
           The GFR will be calculated according to the Cockroft-Gault formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
           GFR (ml/min) = (140 - age) x body weight (in kg) / 0.81 x serum creatinine (micromol/l)&#xD;
&#xD;
           For female, the correction factor is 0.85 (x calculated GFR)&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.2 Infusional gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
           Infusional gemcitabine is given at a constant rate of 10 mg/m2 per minute in all&#xD;
           patients on days 1 and 8, the cycle is repeated every 21 days. Dose escalation is&#xD;
           achieved by increasing the duration of infusion. The total dose of gemcitabine is&#xD;
           re-constituted in 500 ml of normal saline and infused through a peripheral or central&#xD;
           venous line.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2.1 Treatment courses&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior to initiating treatment, eligible patients will be randomised to receive&#xD;
           gemcitabine given either in the standard short 30 minutes infusion, or constant rate&#xD;
           prolonged infusion over the duration determined in the phase I study. All patients in&#xD;
           both arms will receive carboplatin at a dose of AUC of 5 over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standard arm&#xD;
&#xD;
           Carboplatin AUC of 5 over 1 hour, day 1, followed by Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 over 30 min,&#xD;
           day 1 and 8 Cycle is repeated every 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study arm&#xD;
&#xD;
           Carboplatin AUC of 5 over 1 hour, day 1, followed by Gemcitabine 10 mg/m2/min at MTD,&#xD;
           day 1 and 8 Cycle is repeated every 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
           Supportive treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients should receive pre-medications to prevent nausea and vomiting&#xD;
                according to local policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No prophylactic growth factors are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Growth factor is allowed only in the rescue setting, eg. prolonged grade 4&#xD;
                neutropenia for more than 7 days, or for febrile neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2.2 Dosing in cycle 2 and subsequent cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
           The next treatment cycle will begin on schedule providing&#xD;

                escalation for the remainder of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment may be delayed up to day 35 to allow a patient sufficient time for&#xD;
                recovery from treatment related toxicity. Any patient who cannot proceed to the&#xD;
                next cycle by day 35 will be discontinued from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           Any grade 3 or 4 non-haematologic toxicity, except for nausea and vomiting and fatigue&#xD;
           and reversible transaminitis, will render patient off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Non-haematologic toxicity must be less than grade 2 before proceeding to the next cycle.&#xD;
           If they are higher than grade 2, treatment is delayed for 1 week. Treatment may be&#xD;

           Patients will be evaluable for response after 2 cycles of therapy. Clinical tumour&#xD;
           measurements should be performed prior to every cycle of treatment. Radiographic tumour&#xD;
           measurements should be obtained after every 2 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a patient meets the response criteria (see section 7) for CR, PR or SD for the first&#xD;
           time, another clinical and radiographic tumour assessment will be performed 4 or more&#xD;
           weeks later to document that the response has lasted at least 4 weeks.&#xD;

           Clinical tumour assessment will be carried out 2 monthly. Radiographic tumour assessment&#xD;
           will be done every 4 monthly. These will continue until disease progression is&#xD;
           documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who never had a response, and patients with disease progression after a&#xD;
           previously documented response will be followed every 3 monthly for survival data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. TREATMENT COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL&#xD;

      Patients may be withdrawn from the treatment for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse experience, including intercurrent illness or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If attending physician thinks a change of therapy would be in the best interest of the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol violation (including non-compliance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient withdrawal at his/her request, for reasons other than those above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for status of disease and survival until death. 10. QUALITY OF&#xD;
      LIFE (QoL) ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential to explain to the patient that the QoL assessment is an important part of the&#xD;
      trial, and that all sections should be answered even if the patient feels them to be&#xD;
      irrelevant. It should be emphasized that the completion of these forms helps doctors find out&#xD;
      more about the effects of treatment on patients' well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A named contact person other than the responsible clinician managing the patient in the&#xD;
      context of the trial, must be appointed to take responsibility for the administration,&#xD;
      collection and checking of the completed EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 questionnaire. The&#xD;
      questionnaire must be taken before consultation with the clinician, according to the EORTC&#xD;
      guidelines for QoL assessment. They should be checked to ensure that all questions have been&#xD;
      answered; if necessary go back to the patient immediately and ask him or her to fill in any&#xD;
      missing items. If an assessment is missed because of administrative failure, the patient&#xD;
      should be contacted by telephone or letter and an arrangement should be made for the&#xD;
      questionnaire to be taken within a week of the scheduled assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire may be filled in by the patient if he/she is able to read and understand&#xD;
      the language of the questionnaire. Otherwise, the named person for administering the QoL&#xD;
      should read out the questions as written, in the language the patient understands, and record&#xD;
      the response to each question without prejudicing his/her answer. The mode of delivery should&#xD;
      be noted in the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. RANDOMISATION PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomly assigned to receive either gemcitabine given in the&#xD;
      conventional 30 minutes infusion, or protracted infusion, both in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.1 Stratification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratified randomization will be carried out using the minimization method based on the&#xD;
      following factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Centre (National University Hospital, Sydney Cancer Centre, Johns Hopkins-NUH&#xD;
      International Medical Centre) (ii) Karnofsky performance status (90 - 100% vs 70 - 80%) (iii)&#xD;
      Stage of disease (IIIB vs IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2 Registration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be entered into the trial by a telephone call to the National Medical Research&#xD;
      Council (NMRC) Clinical Trials &amp; Epidemiology Research Unit (CTERU), Singapore (+65 220-1292)&#xD;
      between 0830 to 1730 hours Monday to Friday, and 0830 to 1230 hours Saturday (Singapore&#xD;
      time), or by Fax (+65 220-1485), stating that the patient is to be entered into the CTRG L08&#xD;
      or SQLU02 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed written consent for entry into the study should be obtained prior to randomization.&#xD;
      All eligibility criteria and consent form will be checked, and the stratification factors&#xD;
      stated before treatment is allocated. The patient will be randomized to long infusional&#xD;
      gemcitabine (L) or 30- minute short infusion gemcitabine (S), and allocated a trial number.&#xD;
      The design will involve equal allocation of patients to the two treatments. Confirmation fax&#xD;
      will be sent to the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is carried out based on the statistical selection theory&#xD;
      criterion as detailed in Simon et al (62) and Gibbons et al (63). Assuming a 90% probability&#xD;
      of correctly selecting the best treatment, and anticipating a baseline response rate of 40%,&#xD;
      then to detect a 15% superiority of the best treatment over the other, a trial size of 37&#xD;
      patients per treatment arm would be required. The total accrual target would thus be 74&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13. STATISTICAL ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of all study endpoints will be carried out on an intention-to-treat&#xD;
      basis. In the event of lost to follow-up, patients will still be included in the analysis for&#xD;
      the duration that they are observed. The inherent comparability of results in this randomized&#xD;
      phase II design using the statistical selection theory assures that the two treatments can be&#xD;
      reliably ranked when large differences are obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best response will be used in the analysis of objective tumour response. In the case of&#xD;
      adverse event, where multiple events of the same kind has occurred in a patient, only the&#xD;
      maximum grade will be documented for the analysis. The tumour response rates and toxicities&#xD;
      between treatment groups will be compared descriptively using estimates of proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response duration and time to response for responding patients will be assessed using&#xD;
      appropriate descriptive statistics. The evaluation of progression-free and overall survival&#xD;
      will be carried out using the Kaplan-Meier technique at 1-year follow-up. In the case of&#xD;
      progression-free survival, patients whose disease has not progressed will be censored at the&#xD;
      date last known to be alive. Similarly, the analysis of overall survival censors patients who&#xD;
      are lost to follow-up or who remained alive at the date last known to be alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each QoL dimension, changes in scores over time will be compared between treatment arms&#xD;
      by means of appropriate graphical representation or descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analysis is planned for this randomised phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      14.1 IRB/Ethics committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before study initiation, the protocol will be submitted for review and approval by the&#xD;
      hospital and Ministry of Health research and ethics committee or equivalent group. Approval&#xD;
      of the protocol and informed consent must be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14.2 Patient information&#xD;
&#xD;
      The responsible physician will inform the patient about the background and current knowledge&#xD;
      of the treatment under study with special reference to known activity and toxicity. The&#xD;
      patient will be told about the investigative nature of this treatment and in particular, the&#xD;
      randomization process involved in this study. The patient will be told of his or her right to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study at any time without any penalty with regards to the continuation of&#xD;
      care at this institution and by the same physicians as he chooses. Before accrual, all&#xD;
      patients will sign a written, informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14.3 Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent should meet the requirement of the latest revision of the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and any applicable regulations and guidelines such as the Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      (Singapore).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be completely explained to each prospective candidate and the subject must&#xD;
      give consent by signing and dating the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent must be obtained before any protocol-required procedures are performed, including any&#xD;
      procedures not part of normal patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma dFdC and dFdU levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten millilitres of blood will be drawn at 0 hours (baseline), 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 10&#xD;
      minutes before the end of the infusion, and 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours after the end of the&#xD;
      infusion. The blood will be drawn into 10 ml tubes (green topped) containing heparin and 5&#xD;
      micromol tetrahydrouridine. The tubes are then centrifuged at 3300 rpm for 15 minutes and the&#xD;
      supernatant plasma is then transferred to plain tubes (red topped) for immediate storage at&#xD;
      -80oC. Samples will be labeled with the patient's name, ID number, date, exact time of sample&#xD;
      and protocol number. A pharmacokinetic form will accompany the plasma samples to the&#xD;
      Pharmacology laboratory in the Department of Pharmacology, National University of Singapore,&#xD;
      c/o Prof Lee How Sung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DFdC and dFdU levels in plasma will be measured using reverse phase HPLC, as described by&#xD;
      Grunewald (22). Briefly, 20 microl to 50 microl of plasma is injected onto a C18 mBondapak&#xD;
      analytical column (Waters Associates, Inc.). Components will be separated with a mobile phase&#xD;
      consisting of a 30 minute linear gradient starting with 100% solution A (0.5M ammonium&#xD;
      acetate, pH = 6.8) and ending with 60% solution B (50% methanol in deionised water). Flow&#xD;
      rate is at 1.5 ml/min. Detection wavelengths are 275 nm and 262 nm for dFdC and dFdU,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      16.2 Intracellular dFdCTP levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of blood will be collected to assay intracellular dFdCTP. Only 3 samples per patient,&#xD;
      obtained 10 minutes after the start and 10 minutes before the end of the infusion of&#xD;
      gemcitabine, and one in the middle of infusion, will be assayed for dFdCTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma is first separated from the blood by centrifugation at 3300 rpm for 20 minutes.&#xD;
      Mononuclear cells are then isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates are extracted with 0.4 NHClO4, and the acid-insoluble&#xD;
      material is removed by centrifugation. The supernatant is then carefully neutralized to pH 7&#xD;
      with potassium hydroxide, and the precipitated KClO4 is then removed by centrifugation. An&#xD;
      ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography method is then used to separate and&#xD;
      quantitate the dFdCTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      17. STUDY ADMINISTRATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      17.1 Drug accountability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stocks of gemcitabine will be supplied by Eli Lilly for trial purposes, and all these vials&#xD;
      will be accounted for at the site pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      17.2 Maintenance of patients records&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTRG clinical report forms will be used to record data for this study. All patient clinical&#xD;
      report forms will be faxed to the CTRG Office (+65 777-5545). A copy of each patients&#xD;
      eligibility report form, randomization report form (for phase II), study schedule, consent&#xD;
      forms, laboratory and radiological reports, and QoL assessment will be kept in the CTRG&#xD;
      Office. All records will be kept for a period of 6 years following the date of study closure&#xD;
      according to Singapore GCP guidelines&#xD;
