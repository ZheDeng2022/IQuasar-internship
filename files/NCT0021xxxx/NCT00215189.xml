      This pilot study evaluates an individualized health promotion program for people with mental&#xD;
      illness receiving services at a mental health center in Keene, NH. The study will test the&#xD;
      following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Compared to baseline (pre-study) levels, participants in the In SHAPE program&#xD;
      will demonstrate increased physical activity as indicated by self-report and observed&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Compared to baseline (pre-study) levels, participants in the In SHAPE program&#xD;
      will demonstrate improved fitness and health status as indicated by greater capacity on the&#xD;
      6-minute walk test, one mile walk test, weight and body composition, and flexibility indexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary (exploratory) hypotheses will be considered:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to baseline (pre-study) levels, participants in the In SHAPE program will&#xD;
      demonstrate improved subjective health status, quality of life, mood, and self-efficacy. In&#xD;
      addition, participants will demonstrate improved cardiovascular fitness as indicated by lower&#xD;
      pulse rate and blood pressure.&#xD;

      The In SHAPE program aims to improve the physical fitness and health of persons with mental&#xD;
      illness. Participants in the program are assigned a health mentor who assesses individual&#xD;
      lifestyle habits and health status, identifies goals for lifestyle change, and serves as a&#xD;
      motivator and physical trainer. The individualized components of the In SHAPE program are&#xD;
      supplemented with group-level positive reinforcement and motivational incentives. This&#xD;
      evaluation project systematically evaluates the In SHAPE health promotion intervention.&#xD;
