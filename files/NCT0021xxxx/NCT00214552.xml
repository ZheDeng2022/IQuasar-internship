  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis for this study is that potent anti-secretory therapy with high dose PPI&#xD;
      improves asthma control regardless of either asthma severity or the presence of GERD&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with GERD do not experience heartburn symptoms. Barium esophagram, endoscopy&#xD;
      and/or overnight esophageal pH monitoring are commonly relied upon to objectively establish&#xD;
      the diagnosis of GERD. In general, overnight esophageal pH monitoring is the most sensitive&#xD;
      and specific test available to confirm GERD. However, the literature exploring GERD as a&#xD;
      cause of chronic cough suggests that the currently accepted criteria for defining abnormal&#xD;
      overnight esophageal pH may not be adequately sensitive. It is therefore possible that&#xD;
      aggressive GERD therapy may improve asthma control in patients with &quot;normal&quot; overnight&#xD;
      esophageal pH probe results. To our knowledge, there are no published data addressing this&#xD;
      question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective The primary objective is to compare asthma control in asthmatic subjects&#xD;
      treated with high dose PPI with asthmatic subjects taking placebo PPI. The primary outcome&#xD;
      variables will be measurements of asthma symptoms and asthma quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives Secondary objectives include evaluating the effect of this aggressive&#xD;
      anti-secretory therapy on lung function, asthma medication use (including both baseline and&#xD;
      rescue medication), and GERD symptoms. An additional secondary objective will be to evaluate&#xD;
      whether the presence or absence of GERD symptoms at baseline (prior to proton pump inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy) will independently associate with improvement in any of the other outcomes measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will include: Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire (visits 2 and 5), Juniper&#xD;
      Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (visits 2 - 5), GSAS gastroesophageal reflux instrument&#xD;
      (visit 2, visit 5), the occurrence of adverse events, change in FVC, FEF25-75%, MIF50 /&#xD;
      MEF50, peak expiratory flow rate, FEV1 reversibility, and the physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional measurements will include methacholine challenge and eosinophilia in induced&#xD;
      sputum specimens. Induced sputum will be offered to all patients, though it is anticipated&#xD;
      that only approximately 50% will agree to this procedure.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must demonstrate their willingness to participate in the study and comply&#xD;
             with its procedures by signing a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects baseline FEV1 must be greater than or equal to 50% of predicted at both Visit&#xD;
             1 and visit 2, when all bronchodilators medications have been withheld for the&#xD;
             specified intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have physician-diagnosed asthma at visit 1 and report ongoing chronic or&#xD;
             intermittent symptoms that include at least one of the following: wheezing, chest&#xD;
             tightness, dyspnea, or cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects with a baseline FEV1 greater than or equal to 70% predicted must have a&#xD;
             positive methacholine challenge (provocative dose required to reduce FEV1 20% is less&#xD;
             than or equal to 10 mg inhaled methacholine) at either visit 1 or visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects with a baseline FEV1 greater than 50% but less than 70% must demonstrate&#xD;
             at least 12% improvement in FEV1 after a bronchodilator is administered at visit 1 or&#xD;
             visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must report using rescue inhaled beta adrenergic agonist treatment at least&#xD;
             twice weekly for asthma symptoms (e.g. 2 or more nebulized treatments or 4 or more&#xD;
             puffs of inhaled albuterol per week).&#xD;
