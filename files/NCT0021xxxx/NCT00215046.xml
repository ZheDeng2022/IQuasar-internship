      To evaluate the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agents vinblastine and methotrexate in the&#xD;
      treatment of two groups of children with multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis. Group 1 will&#xD;
      contain children with multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis who do not have structural heart&#xD;
      disease, and Group 2 will consist of children with multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis and&#xD;
      concomitant structural heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable for efficacy is patient status one year after the start of&#xD;
      treatment, where status is classified as either failure or success. Failure is defined as&#xD;
      death or evidence of progressive obstruction at any time over the course of treatment as&#xD;
      defined in the protocol. Success constitutes complete or partial response to treatment or&#xD;
      stability of disease. Secondary outcome variables for efficacy are survival, time from&#xD;
      diagnosis of pulmonary vein stenosis until failure, and change in patient classification on a&#xD;
      scale measuring the severity of the obstructive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 To assess the safety of vinblastine and methotrexate in the treatment of multivessel&#xD;
      pulmonary vein stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable for safety is any occurrence of toxicity related to the&#xD;
      administration of the chemotherapeutic agents over the treatment period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      We sought to develop a regimen that might successfully suppress myofibroblastic proliferation&#xD;
      in infants and children with progressive pulmonary vein stenosis. A number of factors need to&#xD;
      be considered when proposing novel treatment options for patients with multivessel pulmonary&#xD;
      vein stenosis. Specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment should be directed against a specific target, in this case excessive&#xD;
           proliferation of myofibroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment should have known activity against the target cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment should be well-tolerated in the patient group. In this case, agents with&#xD;
           minimal hemodynamic side effects would be preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment should not preclude patients from participation in other potentially effective&#xD;
           therapies. Specifically, agents that do not cause significant myelosuppression would&#xD;
           allow listing for transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment should not interfere with normal growth and development, and should have&#xD;
           minimal if any risk for long-term toxicity or second tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After considering these factors, we chose to administer two chemotherapeutic agents,&#xD;
      vinblastine and methotrexate. Vinblastine and methotrexate have over 30 years of usage and&#xD;
      are well-tolerated. The agents used are given in low-dose and do not usually cause nausea or&#xD;
      vomiting, nor do they cause significant immunosuppression which, if present, could lead to a&#xD;
      risk of infection and fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Desmoid tumors, also referred to as infantile fibromatosis, overlap with infantile&#xD;
      myofibromatosis. A combination of standard agents that has been successfully used to treat&#xD;
      desmoid tumors in infants is vinblastine and methotrexate (24). As opposed to&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide-based regimens, this combination has the distinct advantages of few acute&#xD;
      side effects and no known long-term toxicities, such as infertility or second malignancy.&#xD;
      These agents have been used for over 30 years to treat infant and childhood malignancies.&#xD;
      Over the last five years, methotrexate and vinblastine have been used to treat 9 children&#xD;
      with recurrent desmoid tumor, a lesion similar although not identical to the abnormality&#xD;
      present in patients with pulmonary vein stenosis. This regimen had minimal acute toxicity&#xD;
      limited to mild to moderate nausea (which is easily controlled with anti-emetic therapy),&#xD;
      minimal alopecia, mild hepatic inflammation, and mild myelosuppression. An addition advantage&#xD;
      is that these drugs do not interfere with listing for lung transplantation, an important&#xD;
      factor in the overall treatment options for this patient population. Instead of high-dose&#xD;
      administration of chemotherapy (that catches only those cells in cycle at the time of&#xD;
      administration), the low-dose chronic weekly administration continues to catch proliferating&#xD;
      cells as they continually come into cycle. This may explain why the only other trial of&#xD;
      chemotherapy (with high-dose cytoxan) was unsuccessful. Of the 9 children with desmoid&#xD;
      lesions who received vinblastine and methotrexate therapy, four patients were treated for 18&#xD;
      months or longer. At the time of the last report, no patient had progressive disease during&#xD;
      therapy. Two children had radiographically stable disease 1 and 2 years after treatment. Two&#xD;
      children had stable disease for 1 and 2 years after treatment and then had disease&#xD;
      progression. Thus, this drug combination is well-tolerated, has minimal side effects, and has&#xD;
      demonstrated clinical activity against a closely related type of lesion.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis can be based on clinical and radiographic grounds or at the time of biopsy&#xD;
             or prior surgical procedures. The diagnosis must be consistent with multivessel&#xD;
             pulmonary stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There must be evidence of severe pulmonary vein stenosis in at least two pulmonary&#xD;
             veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of myofibroblast neo-proliferation, if biopsies were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Staging must include a complete cardiovascular evaluation including echocardiogram,&#xD;
             and EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Accepted organ function includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x normal for age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  SGPT, Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x normal for age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ANC ³ 1,500/mm3, Hemoglobin ³ 10g/dl, Platelets ³ 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Placement of a permanent central venous line. CVL access is necessary in all patients&#xD;
             as vinblastine is a vesicant and will cause a tissue burn if infiltrated into the&#xD;
             skin. Because a CVL may interfere with proper cardiac assessment in this patient&#xD;
             population, the study physician will be made aware prior to the placement of a line.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may be listed for a lung transplant while enrolled on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have given written informed consent according to institutional&#xD;
             guidelines.&#xD;
