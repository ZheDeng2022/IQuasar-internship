      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bemiparin, a second-generation&#xD;
      LMWH, in the prophylaxis of VTE (using a postoperative regimen, i.e. administering the first&#xD;
      dose 6 hours after finishing the surgical procedure) for 28 days compared to 8 days, in&#xD;
      oncological surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparins(LMWH) in the prophylaxis of&#xD;
      postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) is well established in a large number of studies,&#xD;
      some aspects remain to be determined. The optimal duration of prophylactic treatment has not&#xD;
      been clearly defined yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, surgical prophylaxis of VTE in patients undergoing high-risk orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgery was extended for one or two weeks after the operation. However, the most recent&#xD;
      studies carried out on this field have demonstrated that prolongation of prophylaxis with&#xD;
      LMWH for 4-6 weeks significantly reduces the incidence of VTE (by more than half) in patients&#xD;
      undergoing orthopaedic surgery with a high-risk of VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the contrary, thromboprophylaxis in oncological surgery is generally limited to the period&#xD;
      of hospitalisation, despite the fact that activation of coagulation is greater and more&#xD;
      prolonged in patients undergoing surgery for neoplastic processes than in those patients not&#xD;
      affected by cancer. The only two studies carried out to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      prolongation of thromboprophylaxis for 4 weeks in this type of surgery seem to indicate that&#xD;
      the VTE incidence could be reduced even further that with one-week prophylaxis, though these&#xD;
      do not allow to establish a definitive conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bemiparin, a second-generation&#xD;
      LMWH, in the prophylaxis of VTE (using a postoperative regimen, giving the first dose 6 hours&#xD;
      after finishing the surgical procedure) for 28 days compared to 8 days, in oncological&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, some exploratory analyses will be carried out to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The biological effect of the sc. administration of Bemiparin (3,500 IU/day) on different&#xD;
           biological markers involved in the tumoral development and its metastasis in patients&#xD;
           undergoing an oncological abdominal or pelvic surgical operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The effect of the sc. administration of Bemiparin (3,500 IU/day) on the evolution of the&#xD;
           tumour in patients undergoing an oncological abdominal or pelvic surgical operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The effect of the sc. administration of Bemiparin (3,500 IU/day) on the survival of the&#xD;
           patients at 6 months from the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four Study Committees have been created for this clinical trial in order to guarantee the&#xD;
      safety of the patients as well as the highest quality data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trial Steering Committee&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Committee for the Evaluation of Phlebographies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Committee for Adjudicating Clinical Events.&#xD;
