  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, double-blinded, cross-over trial of 60 HIV-infected women recruited&#xD;
      from general medical clinics, family planning clinics, groups/organizations working with&#xD;
      persons living with AIDS to assess product safety, effect on genital tract HIV shedding, and&#xD;
      product acceptability with vaginal use of Carraguard gel among HIV-infected women. Women had&#xD;
      to be abstinent or in a seroconcordant relationship with only one partner for the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Carraguardâ„¢ (PC-515), the Population Council's lead candidate microbicide, was tested in a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial in Chiang Rai, northern Thailand. Safety of daily product use&#xD;
      determined by symptoms of irritation, effect on vaginal flora, vaginal epithelial disruption&#xD;
      as determined by naked eye inspection (Day 7 and Day 14 of each arm) and colposcopic&#xD;
      inspection on (Day 7), and other adverse effects, which may include UTI or other unforeseen&#xD;
      problems (Day 7 and Day 14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genital tract HIV will be measured using samples collected by CVL (Day 7 and Day 14 of each&#xD;
      arm) and vaginal swab (Day 7 and Day 14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product acceptability will be assessed through an interview-administered questionnaire once&#xD;
      each study arm at the first follow-up visit (Day 7 of each arm), after using the product&#xD;
      daily for 7 days.&#xD;
