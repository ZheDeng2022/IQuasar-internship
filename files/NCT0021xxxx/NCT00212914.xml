  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1998, The Canadian Diabetes Association published guidelines that recommended women&#xD;
      diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM,) should be screened postpartum for Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes using a glucose tolerance test. We determined the rate of screening for Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes at the Ottawa Hospital before and after the publication of this guideline and found&#xD;
      that none of the women in either period had been screened following this recommendation. We&#xD;
      believe a reminder letter outlining the recommended screening test sent to the patient and/or&#xD;
      her family physician would increase screening for Type 2 diabetes in women with previous GDM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In 1998, the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) published guidelines that recommended all&#xD;
      women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) should be screened 6 weeks to 6&#xD;
      months postpartum for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) using a 2-hour 75g oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test. We determined the rate of screening for type 2 DM at the Ottawa Hospital before and&#xD;
      after the publication of this guideline and found that none of the women in either period had&#xD;
      been screened following the CDA guideline recommendations although other screening tests that&#xD;
      had not been recommended had increased in utilization. Since the publication of the CDA&#xD;
      guidelines several studies have been published that demonstrate that identification of&#xD;
      patients with an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test and early treatment prevents the onset&#xD;
      of diabetes. This research and the recommendations need to be communicated to physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test whether a reminder letter outlining the screening recommendations that is sent&#xD;
           both to the patient and her family physician would increase screening postpartum for&#xD;
           type 2 DM in women with previous GDM more than a letter sent only to the physician or&#xD;
           the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the patient and physician barriers that are impeding the adoption of this&#xD;
           recommended screening strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The High Risk Obstetrical Clinics (HRU) at the Ottawa Hospital Civic and General Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women, who attend the HRU and who have been diagnosed with GDM will be considered for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study. Women will be approached for participation in this study by the HRU&#xD;
      health care team. If the patient agrees, then the research team will contact the patient to&#xD;
      describe the study and obtain informed consent. (Appendix 1A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient does not have a Family Physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient's Family Physician already has a patient enrolled in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient already enrolled in the study for a previous pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unable to give informed consent in English or French&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. History of pre-gestational diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Intra-uterine fetal death or still birth&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a 2 X 2 factorial randomized controlled trial stratified by clinic location.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed by the Research Coordinator using a computer generated&#xD;
      randomization number and a variable block size of 4 and 8. The HRU team, the investigators,&#xD;
      and the patient will be blinded to the patient's group allocation. This process will decrease&#xD;
      selection bias. Patients will be randomized postpartum by the research coordinator (to ensure&#xD;
      that the patient does not have any of the exclusion criteria) to one of the following four&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physician and patient reminder&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physician reminder with no patient reminder&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No physician reminder but a patient reminder&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Neither physician nor patient reminder. (Current standard of care)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Intervention Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline demographic data, maternal characteristics that have previously been shown to be&#xD;
      associated with type 2 DM, and obstetric and reproductive history will be collected at the&#xD;
      time of consent or at a maximum of two weeks after consent. The mailing address and telephone&#xD;
      number of the patient and their family physician will also be obtained. A chart abstraction&#xD;
      will be performed approximately 30 days after the expected date of confinement (EDC) to&#xD;
      determine if a live birth occurred and the weight and gender of the baby will be abstracted.&#xD;
      (Appendix 1B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening recommendation strategy will be randomly allocated by the research coordinator&#xD;
      after confirmation of a live birth and ensuring that the mother and her baby have been&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital. In the unlikely event of a death, it was felt that the patient&#xD;
      should be screened by the health care team with follow-up in the HRU postpartum as type 2 DM&#xD;
      may be related to the cause of death. The physician reminder letter will consist of a patient&#xD;
      specific recommendation to screen postpartum for type 2 DM using a 2-hour 75g OGTT and the&#xD;
      evidence supporting this recommendation. The letter will inform the physician if their&#xD;
      patient has or has not been given the requisition for the recommended screening test.&#xD;
      (Appendix 1C) The patient reminder consists of a letter requesting the patient to proceed&#xD;
      with screening, the requisition that is required for the screening test, as well as the&#xD;
      instructions to follow for screening. (Appendix 1D)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Secondary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients screened for type 2 DM using the&#xD;
      recommended test, a 2-hour 75g OGTT. A Mantel-Hanszel chi-squared test statistic for overall&#xD;
      comparison of the proportions in the 2 X 2 design will be used. As well Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      for comparison of specific pair wise group proportions will be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascertainment of the Primary Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who are randomized to the patient letter and requisition, the HRU health care&#xD;
      team will receive the results of the test. For patients who are randomized to the physician&#xD;
      reminder, the reminder will request that on the laboratory requisition that a copy of the&#xD;
      results be forwarded to the HRU health care team. Also, for all patients screening will be&#xD;
      ascertained by the following methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the patient follow-up phone interview, the patient will be asked if they were&#xD;
           screened and what test was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the physician follow-up phone interview, the physician or nurse will be asked if the&#xD;
           patient was screened, what test was used, and what were the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a similar process and similar intensity in the follow-up of the&#xD;
      screening results. We expect with this method of ascertaining the primary outcome we will be&#xD;
      able to determine whether the patient was screened or not. The investigator who is gathering&#xD;
      the information from the physician or patient will be blinded to the patient's group&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proportion of Patients screened with tests other than the recommended test A&#xD;
           Mantel-Hanszel chi-squared test statistic for overall comparison of the proportions in&#xD;
           the 2 X 2 design will be used. As well Fisher's exact test for comparison of specific&#xD;
           pair wise group proportions will be employed depending on whether or not an interaction&#xD;
           effect was found.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characteristics associated with screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A univariate analysis of all continuous and categorical characteristics of the woman&#xD;
           collected at baseline, the characteristics of the baby, birth complications, and&#xD;
           characteristics of the physician will be performed. Any characteristics that are found&#xD;
           to be statistically associated with (p&amp;lt;0.05) the dependent variable (Screen positive)&#xD;
           will be considered for inclusion in a multivariate logistic model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characteristics associated with screening for Type 2 DM or IGT:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A univariate analysis of all continuous and categorical characteristics of the woman&#xD;
           collected at baseline, the characteristics of the baby, birth complications, and&#xD;
           characteristics of the physician will be performed. Any characteristics that are found&#xD;
           to be statistically associated with (p&amp;lt;0.05) the dependent variable (Screen positive)&#xD;
           will be considered for inclusion in a multivariate logistic model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The family physicians and patients will be contacted for a semi-structured interview once the&#xD;
      patient is at least six months postpartum. The investigator who is performing the interview&#xD;
      will be blinded to the patient's group allocation. They will be surveyed to determine their&#xD;
      satisfaction with the screening method and qualitatively review their suggestions to evaluate&#xD;
      barriers to adoption of the screening recommendation and increase adoption in their practice&#xD;
      or experience. (Appendix 1E) For qualitative responses, the responses will be tabulated and a&#xD;
      percentage reported. For responses that are reported as a Likert scale, a mean and a standard&#xD;
      deviation will be calculated. These results will be used to aid in the planning process of&#xD;
      future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a 2x2 factorial design and we will power the study to detect a difference in&#xD;
      proportions between the four groups. If we assume a power of 80% and an alpha error of 5% we&#xD;
      would require 67 patients in each group to detect a difference of proportions of 17%, 20%,&#xD;
      and 35% in the groups that received either intervention or both combined. We assumed that the&#xD;
      combination of patient and physician letter would lead to higher screening rates. A larger&#xD;
      sample size is required when an interaction is suspected to ensure that the study has&#xD;
      sufficient power to detect an interaction.16 The total sample size of the study would be 268&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From our previous study that evaluated the screening rate using a 2 hour 75g OGTT in the year&#xD;
      2000 at the Ottawa Hospital we found that 0% of patients were being screened. Conway et al14&#xD;
      in their population of women diagnosed with GDM were achieved a 17% screening rate when the&#xD;
      the women were given the requisition for screening but no reminder letter outlining the&#xD;
      importance of the screening test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Ottawa Hospital 168 and 149 women who delivered and had GDM in 1997 and 2000&#xD;
      respectively. Averaging over the two years, we would estimate that approximately 160 women&#xD;
      per year delivered at the Ottawa Hospital with GDM. Also, at the General campus of the Ottawa&#xD;
      Hospital, approximately 30 patients per year are followed for GDM at the HRU but deliver at&#xD;
      the Montfort hospital. Therefore, we would estimate that there would be a potential study&#xD;
      population of 190 women at the Ottawa Hospital per year. We would also assume that 10% of&#xD;
      women would decline to participate in the study, further reducing the potential population to&#xD;
      171 women. Therefore we would anticipate the study would take almost two years to complete&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Issues that may affect the success of this study are as follows: the acceptability of the&#xD;
      study to the patient population of interest, whether the consent process itself would&#xD;
      increase the screening rate as compared to the screening rate for the year 2000, and&#xD;
      publication of new guidelines. It is unlikely that the consent process would be enough to&#xD;
      increase screening rates alone as most studies on physician behaviour changes have shown that&#xD;
      multiple interventions are required.11 The Clinical Practice Guideline Group of the CDA have&#xD;
      started to meet to discuss an update of the guideline. Evidence published since the&#xD;
      publication of the guidelines in 1998 lends more support to the recommendation to screen with&#xD;
      a 2 hour OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration This study has received approval by the Ottawa Hospital Research Ethic&#xD;
      Board. All records paper and electronic will be stored within the Hospital under the&#xD;
      jurisdiction of the Cinical Epidemiogy Program of the Ottawa Health Research Institute. All&#xD;
      records are confidential and only the Investigators and the Research Associate will have&#xD;
      access to the records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge Translation and dissemination plans The results of the study will be published in a&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journal. The strategy that led to the highest proportion of patients being&#xD;
      screened will be considered for adoption as part of routine clinical care at the Ottawa&#xD;
      Hospital. The results of the survey will be utilized to improve the strategy if significant&#xD;
      barriers to adoption were identified. The physician members of the team (Dr.'s Clark, Keely,&#xD;
      and Karovitch) will be utilized as opinion leaders to encourage dissemination of the &quot;best&quot;&#xD;
      screening strategy to other hospitals and physician groups involved in the care of patients&#xD;
      with gestational diabetes.&#xD;
