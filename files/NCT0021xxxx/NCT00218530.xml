      Stress is one of the more common reasons cited by addicts for continual drug use and relapse.&#xD;
      Treatment approaches that target both drug-induced and stress-induced relapse may prove to be&#xD;
      more beneficial than targeting drug-induced relapse alone. Lofexidine is a drug that reduces&#xD;
      the physical symptoms of opiate withdrawal and may prove to have stress-reducing capabilites&#xD;
      in drug addicts. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal safe dose of&#xD;
      lofexidine tolerated in naltrexone-treated heroin addicts and to find an optimal lofexidine&#xD;
      induction schedule.&#xD;

      Stress is one of the more common reasons cited by addicts for continual drug use and relapse.&#xD;
      Naltrexone treatment of opiate addicts suffers from high rates of drop-out and relapse. This&#xD;
      may be a result of naltrexone's inability to reduce symptoms of stress during early recovery.&#xD;
      Treatment approaches that target both drug-induced and stress-induced relapse may prove to be&#xD;
      more beneficial than targeting drug-induced relapse alone. Lofexidine is a drug that reduces&#xD;
      the physical symptoms of opiate withdrawal and may prove to have stress-reducing&#xD;
      capabilities. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal safe dose of lofexidine&#xD;
      tolerated in naltrexone-treated opiate addicts and to find an optimal lofexidine induction&#xD;
      schedule. The study will also assess any side effects that occur during a discontinuation&#xD;
      phase of lofexidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will last a total of 8 weeks. Recently detoxified opiate dependent&#xD;
      participants who are eligible for naltrexone treatment will enter a 4-week single-blind dose&#xD;
      tolerability phase, during which participants will receive naltrexone and 1 of 3 twice-daily&#xD;
      lofexidine induction schedules. All participants will be required to remain in the clinic for&#xD;
      2 hours immediately following dosing in order to monitor vital signs and side effects. Study&#xD;
      visits will occur three times each week, at which time naltrexone medication for&#xD;
      self-administration will be handed out and participants will be evaluated in terms of&#xD;
      tolerability to treatment. After the 4 weeks of treatment, a double-blind lofexidine&#xD;
      detoxification phase using a 5-day taper will occur. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of two maintenance-taper schedules. The first group will undergo a 5-day tapering,&#xD;
      followed by a placebo for three weeks, followed by a 5-day tapering during Week 4. Withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms and side effects will be evaluated.&#xD;
