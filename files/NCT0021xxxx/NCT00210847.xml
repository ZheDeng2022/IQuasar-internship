  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the pain-reieiving effects and safety of tramadol&#xD;
      HCl/acetaminophen as compared to placebo in patients experiencing painful diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy. Treatment of neuropathic pain often requires the use of more than one medication.&#xD;
      The pain-relieving potential of tramadol HCl/acetaminophen for the treatment of painful&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathy comes from the multiple mechanisms of action in this combination pain&#xD;
      medication. Patients who experience painful diabetic neuropathy will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that tramadol HCl is effective in painful diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
      The treatment of neuropathic pain often requires the use of more than one medication, working&#xD;
      through different mechanisms of action, to provide the best pain relief. The pain-relieving&#xD;
      potential of tramadol HCl /acetaminophen for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy&#xD;
      comes from the multiple mechanisms of action in this combination pain medication. This is a&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Patients who&#xD;
      experience painful diabetic neuropathy will be enrolled. There will be a period of up to 3&#xD;
      weeks during which patients will stop taking medications not allowed by the study. A 7-day&#xD;
      baseline period will follow, during which time patients will call into an Interactive Voice&#xD;
      Response (IVR) system every night at bedtime to record daily assessments including average&#xD;
      daily pain and sleep interference. Patients who enter the double-blind portion of the study&#xD;
      will be randomized (like with the toss of a coin) to receive either tramadol&#xD;
      HCl/acetaminophen or placebo. The dose of tramadol HCl/acetaminophen or placebo will be&#xD;
      gradually increased until the doctor determines the patient is taking an adequate dose; up to&#xD;
      1 or 2 tablets 4 times per day, but not more than 8 tablets per day. Every night at bedtime&#xD;
      during the double-blind phase, patients will call the IVR system to report assessments of&#xD;
      average daily pain, sleep interference and the number of tablets of study medication taken&#xD;
      that day. At the end of the study, patients will be tapered off their study medication. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to compare the analgesic effectiveness and safety of tramadol&#xD;
      HCl/acetaminophen versus placebo for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 or 2 tramadol HCl (37.5 milligrams)/acetaminophen (325 milligrams) combination tablets or&#xD;
      matching placebo by mouth up to 4 times a day for 66 days&#xD;
