  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the best and safest dose of XL184 administered&#xD;
      orally. XL184 is a new chemical entity that inhibits VEGFR2, MET and RET, kinases implicated&#xD;
      in tumor formation, growth and migration. To determine the highest safe dose, subjects will&#xD;
      receive different amounts of the drug. The first group of subjects will receive the lowest&#xD;
      dose of XL184. As long as no medically unacceptable side effects are noted, the dose will be&#xD;
      increased for the next group. When the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, at least 20&#xD;
      subjects with Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC) will be enrolled to evaluate the effect of XL184&#xD;
      in this population.&#xD;
