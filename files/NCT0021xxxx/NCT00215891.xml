      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary To compare the sustained virologic response (SVR) of PEGIntron plus ribavirin among&#xD;
      patients receiving 48 weeks versus 72 weeks of therapy (defined as undetectable HCV RNA level&#xD;
      24 weeks after discontinuing therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability PEG Intron in combination with ribavirin for&#xD;
           treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) infection in patients co-infected with Human&#xD;
           Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the early virologic response of patients receiving PEGIntron plus ribavirin&#xD;
           at Treatment Week 24&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All qualifying patients will enter the treatment phase and be dosed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peginterferon a-2b 1.5mg/kg by subcutaneous route once weekly plus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ribavirin:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  800 mg (400 mg bid) if body weight &lt; 65 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1000 mg (400 mg a.m. and 600 mg p.m.) if body weight &gt; 65 kg and &lt; 85 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1200 mg (600 mg bid) if body weight &gt; 85 kg and &lt; 105 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1400 mg (600 mg a.m. and 800 mg p.m.) if body weight &gt; 105 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Treatment Week 24, all participants with detectable HCV-RNA will be discontinued from&#xD;
      treatment and followed for a Post Treatment period of 24 weeks. Participants with&#xD;
      undetectable HCV-RNA values at Treatment Week 24 will be randomized to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: an additional 24 weeks of previously assigned Peginterferon a-2b + Ribavirin&#xD;
           therapy, for a total of 48 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: an additional 48 weeks of previously assigned Peginterferon a-2b + Ribavirin&#xD;
           therapy, for a total of 72 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 HIV infected adults with chronic hepatitis C infection who have not been treated&#xD;
      previously with interferon therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage and Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peginterferon a-2b 1.5mg/kg by subcutaneous route once weekly plus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ribavirin:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  800 mg (400 mg bid) if body weight &lt; 65 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1000 mg (400 mg a.m. and 600 mg p.m.) if body weight &gt; 65 kg and &lt; 85 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1200 mg (600 mg bid) if body weight &gt; 85 kg and &lt; 105 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1400 mg (600 mg a.m. and 800 mg p.m.) if body weight &gt; 105 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis, liver biopsies, quality of life assessments, and changes in&#xD;
      Peginterferona-2b and Ribavirin dosages will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of laboratory evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence and severity of adverse experiences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dose adjustments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  premature withdrawal for safety reasons&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  progression of disease as measured by HCV viral load&#xD;
