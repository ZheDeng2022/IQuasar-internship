  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to study whether the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar™) is safe and&#xD;
      effective in protecting children who have had a solid organ transplantation and healthy&#xD;
      children from pneumococcal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that two or more doses of Prevnar™ will result in similar antibody responses among&#xD;
      transplant recipients compared with healthy control subjects, and that children who have&#xD;
      undergone solid organ transplant will have a similar number of serious vaccine-related&#xD;
      adverse events within 7 days after Prevnar™ as the healthy patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Solid organ transplantation (SOT) has emerged as a lifesaving therapy for many patients with&#xD;
      end organ failure. SOT recipients have a lifelong increased risk for infections as a result&#xD;
      of immunosuppression, including those caused by pneumococci. The increased susceptibility to&#xD;
      pneumococcal infections is multi-factorial and is related to underlying immunosuppression as&#xD;
      well as varying degrees of splenic dysfunction as a result of underlying pretransplantation&#xD;
      diseases, among other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The types and severity of invasive pneumococcal disease vary among each transplant&#xD;
      population. However, comparative data are lacking. Lung transplant recipients have the&#xD;
      highest incidence of bacterial pneumonia among solid organ transplant recipients. Pneumonia&#xD;
      secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae occurs in heart transplant patients at a rate 10 times&#xD;
      that found in the general population. It is suggested that besides the intensity of&#xD;
      immunosuppression, ongoing immunosuppression is important as a risk factor for invasive&#xD;
      pneumococcal disease in transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine is one of the vaccines&#xD;
      that receives priority among organ transplant recipients, at the Hospital for Sick Children,&#xD;
      several cases of pneumococcal disease have been seen. The advent of the 7-valent conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine affords the opportunity to possibly reduce the burden of pneumococcal disease in the&#xD;
      patient population by virtue that it may be more immunogenic in transplant patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the antibody titres achieved among transplant recipients who are&#xD;
      immunized with Prevnar™, as well as evaluate the safety and tolerability or Prevnar™&#xD;
      administered as a three-dose regimen to children and adolescents following organ&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
