      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Peginterferon a-2a plus&#xD;
      Ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection in persons co-infected&#xD;
      with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who have failed to achieve a sustained virologic&#xD;
      response following previous interferon therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the virological response to Peginterferon a-2a plus Ribavirin at weeks 12&#xD;
           and 24 as compared to baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the sustained virological response Peginterferon a-2a plus Ribavirin at&#xD;
           post-treatment weeks 4, 12, and 24 as compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the histological effects of long-term Peginterferon a-2a therapy through&#xD;
           comparison of liver biopsy results following 96 weeks of Peginterferon a-2a therapy to&#xD;
           baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term Peginterferon a-2a therapy in&#xD;
           patients who have previously failed to achieve a sustained virologic response following&#xD;
           interferon therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effects of long-term Peginterferon a-2a therapy on clinical outcomes&#xD;
           of HIV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All qualifying patients will enter the treatment phase and be dosed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peginterferon a-2a 180mg by subcutaneous route once weekly plus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ribavirin:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  800 mg (400 mg bid) if body weight &lt; 65 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1000 mg (400 mg a.m. and 600 mg p.m.) if body weight &gt; 65 kg and &lt; 85 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1200 mg (600 mg bid) if body weight &gt; 85 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with undetectable levels of HCV-RNA at Treatment Week 24 will continue on previously&#xD;
      assigned Peginterferon a-2a plus Ribavirin combo-therapy for an additional 24 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      with detectable levels of HCV-RNA will be randomized to Peginterferon a-2a mono-therapy or no&#xD;
      treatment for 72 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Peginterferon a-2a 90mg mono-therapy for 72 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: No CHC therapy for 72 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients entering the study are required to have a baseline liver biopsy (within 18&#xD;
      months of study entry). Patients entering the 72-week randomized arm of the trial will have a&#xD;
      post-study liver biopsy upon completion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 HIV infected adults with chronic hepatitis C infection who have failed to achieve a&#xD;
      sustained virologic response following previous interferon therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage and Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combo-therapy: Peginterferon a-2a 180mg by subcutaneous route once weekly plus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ribavirin:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  800 mg (400 mg bid) if body weight &lt; 65 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1000 mg (400 mg a.m. and 600 mg p.m.) if body weight &gt; 65 kg and &lt; 85 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1200 mg (600 mg bid) if body weight &gt; 85 kg Mono-therapy: Peginterferon a-2a 90mg in 1mL&#xD;
           solution administered subcutaneously once weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis, liver biopsies, quality of life assessments, and changes in&#xD;
      Peginterferona-2a and Ribavirin dosages will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of laboratory evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence and severity of adverse experiences&#xD;
