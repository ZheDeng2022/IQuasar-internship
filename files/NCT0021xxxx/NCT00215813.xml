      An Open-Label Study of Poly I: Poly C12U (Ampligen®) in Patients with Severely Debilitating&#xD;
      Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME). The FDA approved the study for&#xD;
      cost recovery. Patients enrolled in the study are responsible for costs related to the&#xD;
      therapy, e.g., drug cost, infusion cost, cost of supplies, diagnostic and other laboratory&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (&gt;= 12 months) as defined by the 1988 Centers&#xD;
             for Disease Control and Prevention CDC case definition for CFS or as defined only by&#xD;
             the 1994 CDC case definition of CFS (Fukuda et al., Ann Intern Med. 1994; 121:953-959)&#xD;
             (other clinical conditions which could present with similar symptoms must be&#xD;
             excluded.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age Range: &gt;= 18 years old, &lt;= 70 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females: Females must be of non-child bearing&#xD;
             potential (either post-menopausal for two years or surgically sterile including tubal&#xD;
             ligation) or using an effective means of contraception (birth control pills,&#xD;
             intrauterine device, diaphragm). Alternatively, female patients with a male partner&#xD;
             having a successful vasectomy (considered successful if a volunteer reports that a&#xD;
             male partner has either documentation of azoospermia by microscopy or a vasectomy more&#xD;
             than 2 years ago with no resultant pregnancy despite sexual activity&#xD;
             post-vasectomy).Females who are less than two (2) years post-menopausal, those with&#xD;
             tubal ligations and those using contraception must have a negative serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test at baseline within the four (4) weeks prior to the first study medication&#xD;
             infusion. Every four weeks, and at study termination a pregnancy test should be&#xD;
             performed, either serum or urine stick test. However, if the urine result is positive,&#xD;
             a serum pregnancy test will be performed. Females of child bearing potential agree to&#xD;
             use an effective means of contraception from four (4) weeks prior to the baseline&#xD;
             pregnancy test until four (4) weeks after the last study medication infusion. All male&#xD;
             patients agree not to be a sperm donor and to use an effective means of contraception&#xD;
             while on study medication and until 90 days after the last study medication infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A reduced quality of life as determined by a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) of &gt;=&#xD;
             20 and &lt;= 60. The KPS must be rounded in increments of ten (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to provide written informed consent indicating awareness of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Documentation (during baseline or historically following the onset of CFS) of a&#xD;
             negative ANA or a negative anti-ds (double-stranded) DNA, a negative Rheumatoid&#xD;
             Factor, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Documentation during baseline of&#xD;
             a normal T4 (or other laboratory evidence that subject is euthyroid) is also required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Laboratory confirmed negative SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection by a government approved&#xD;
             test / kit within 2 weeks prior to starting study drug dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with post-COVID-19 chronic fatigue (PCCF) must meet the 1988 or 1994 CFS CDC&#xD;
             Definition for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome except for the duration of the fatiguing&#xD;
             illness which must have continued for at least 3 months and must not have preceded the&#xD;
             onset of the COVID-19 symptoms. The patient must also have at least one of the&#xD;
             following &quot;Long Hauler&quot; symptoms which must have persisted or recurred during 3 or&#xD;
             more consecutive months of illness and must not have preceded the onset of the&#xD;
             COVID-19 symptoms (fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty&#xD;
             breathing, new loss of taste or smell or chest pain). Since many patients with mild or&#xD;
             no COVID-19 symptoms were not tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, many patients&#xD;
             with post-COVID-19 chronic fatigue (PCCF) also called &quot;Long Haulers&quot;, will not have a&#xD;
             history of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. A positive serum antibody test for&#xD;
             SARS-CoV-2 will be sufficient in these cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Inability to return for scheduled treatment and assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Chronic or intercurrent acute medical disorder or disease making implementation or&#xD;
             interpretation of the protocol or results difficult or unsafe.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant or lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Therapy with interferons, interleukins, or other cytokines or investigational drugs&#xD;
             within 6 weeks of beginning study medication. Subjects must give written informed&#xD;
             consent prior to discontinuation of investigational drugs.&#xD;
