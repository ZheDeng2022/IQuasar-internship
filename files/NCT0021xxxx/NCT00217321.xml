  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Parkinson's disease Registry is to develop a national and international&#xD;
      database of persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). The Registry will be used to facilitate&#xD;
      the development of new therapies and healthcare services to improve the quality of life for&#xD;
      people with PD. It will also be a means for investigators in the field of PD to quickly&#xD;
      identify and notify subjects about other research studies for which they are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess current treatment approaches and develop best-practice guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Track the functional abilities, access to healthcare and cost of illness of people with&#xD;
           PD over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drive the development of innovative research projects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accelerate the process of informing patients of research projects for which they may be&#xD;
           eligible&#xD;

      What do you need to know?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any individual diagnosed with PD is eligible to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in the registry is voluntary, confidential and free of charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be notified about opportunities to participate in clinical&#xD;
           trials, though they are under no obligation to enter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will need to complete an updated questionnaire every six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may also be asked to complete additional surveys for PD research projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any data provided will be used in scientific publications in summary form only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant names will not be released to anyone outside the Parkinson's disease&#xD;
           Registry management team without written authorization, nor will names be sold for&#xD;
           advertising or fund-raising purposes.&#xD;
