  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical efficacy of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has now been demonstrated in the&#xD;
      management of acute-on-chronic respiratory failure (ACRF) of various etiologies. Endotracheal&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (ETMV) can lead to numerous complications and weaning difficulties&#xD;
      increasing the risk of prolonged ETMV, morbidity and mortality as well as excess cost of&#xD;
      intensive care. Therefore, it could be interesting to use NIV for delivering effective&#xD;
      ventilatory support and reduce the length of ETMV in ACRF patients still not capable to&#xD;
      maintain spontaneous breathing. From the interesting but discordant results of two recent&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial, a working group from the Société de Réanimation de Langue&#xD;
      Française (SRLF) decided to perform a new prospective randomised controlled and multicenter&#xD;
      trial. The aim of the study is to assess the usefulness of NIV as an extubation and weaning&#xD;
      technique in ventilated ACRF patients. The methodology used compares three weaning strategies&#xD;
      in parallel in ACRF patients considered difficult to wean : invasive conventional weaning&#xD;
      (group A), extubation relayed by nasal oxygentherapy (group B), and extubation relayed by NIV&#xD;
      (group C). Based on the main end-point defined as the weaning success/failure rate, 208&#xD;
      patients from17 investigator centers are planned to be included. Results of the study will&#xD;
      also allow to assess the respective impact of the three weaning strategies on the length of&#xD;
      ETMV and weaning, the mechanical ventilation-related morbidity, the patients lengths of stay&#xD;
      and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the VENISE trial should permit to improve the management of the difficult to wean&#xD;
      ACRF patients and thus to contribute to more define the place of NIV among the weaning and&#xD;
      prevention of re-intubation strategies in these patients.&#xD;
