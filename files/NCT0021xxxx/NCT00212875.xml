      The primary objective of this study is to compare the change in hemoglobin (Hb) from study&#xD;
      start to the end of the study between the every 2 week and the every 4 week dosing regimens&#xD;
      in patients with anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) initiated on PROCRIT (epoetin alfa).&#xD;
      Protocol Addendum: The primary objective of the open-label extension portion of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate if epoetin alfa 40,000 Units given under the skin every six weeks, can maintain&#xD;
      hemoglobin within the range of 11-12 g/dL in patients with anemia of CKD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develop anemia due to reduced erythropoietin&#xD;
      production by the kidney. Correction of anemia has been shown to improve exercise capacity,&#xD;
      cognition, quality of life and may slow disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the change in hemoglobin (Hb) that occurs&#xD;
      from study start to the end of the study in pre-dialysis patients with anemia of chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD) who are receiving PROCRIT (epoetin alfa) once every two weeks (Q2W) and&#xD;
      once every four weeks (Q4W). This study will enroll 259 patients who will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned (assigned to a treatment group by chance) to receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously&#xD;
      (SC, under the skin) at one of four doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have a Screening Phase of up to one week when patients will be evaluated for&#xD;
      study eligibility followed by an open-label Treatment Phase of 16 weeks when patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive epoetin alfa administered under the skin at one of four dosing&#xD;
      regimens. Patients will then complete a Post-Treatment Follow-Up Phase of 1 week (Week 17).&#xD;
      Hemoglobin will be measured weekly. There will be no dose adjustments during the initial 4&#xD;
      weeks of the study, however, the dose may be withheld during this time if necessary. Further&#xD;
      dose increases may occur at 4-week intervals and dose reductions may occur as frequently as&#xD;
      the dosing interval assigned at randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible for epoetin alfa dose adjustments starting at the Week 5 visit if&#xD;
      Hb is &gt; 12 g/dL or Hb increases too rapidly (e.g., &gt;1.0 g/dL in the last one or two&#xD;
      consecutive weeks). The last dose of epoetin alfa administered for any treatment group will&#xD;
      coincide with the dosing frequency assigned to that group. Epoetin alfa will not be&#xD;
      administered later than Week 16 for any treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematology, serum chemistry, and iron status will be assessed at intervals throughout the&#xD;
      study. The number of units of blood transfused, pre-transfusion Hb level, and the reasons for&#xD;
      transfusion will be collected. Clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and the incidence&#xD;
      and severity of adverse events will be assessed and monitored during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Addendum: An Open-Label Extension of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) Maintenance Therapy&#xD;
      Administered Every Six Weeks (Q6W) for the Treatment of Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease&#xD;
      (CKD). The Main Protocol, as described above, was designed to evaluate whether patients with&#xD;
      anemia of CKD could be started on epoetin alfa therapy at one of four dosing regimens: 10,000&#xD;
      U once every week, 20,000 U every two weeks, 20,000 U every 4 weeks, or 40,000 U every four&#xD;
      weeks. As an addendum to the Main Protocol, up to sixty (60) patients completing the original&#xD;
      protocol with a hemoglobin (Hb) between 11 and 12 g/dL will be given an opportunity to enroll&#xD;
      in an open-label extension study that will begin at the end of the Main Protocol timeline&#xD;
      (Week 17). The primary objective of this open-label extension is to evaluate if epoetin alfa&#xD;
      40,000 U given SC every six weeks (Q6W), can maintain Hb within the range of 11-12 g/dL in&#xD;
      patients with anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label extension will have a Screening Phase of up to one week (during Week 17) when&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated for eligibility, an Open-Label Treatment Phase of 12 weeks&#xD;
      duration (Weeks 18-Week 30), and a Post-Treatment Follow-Up Phase of 6 weeks (ending at Week&#xD;
      36 or 6 weeks from the date of the last dose of epoetin alfa). All patients will receive a&#xD;
      first dose of epoetin alfa 40,000 U SC every 6 weeks beginning with Week 18, a second dose at&#xD;
      Week 24, and a third and final dose at Week 30. During the Treatment Phase, Hb will be&#xD;
      measured weekly. Dosing will not be increased during the open-label extension. A six-week&#xD;
      follow-up period is required after administration of the Week 30 dose for those patients&#xD;
      receiving all 3 doses. If Hb falls below 10 g/dL at any time or if the patient requires a red&#xD;
      blood cell (RBC) transfusion, the patient will be withdrawn from the open-label extension,&#xD;
      and the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Phase will occur 6 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematology, serum chemistry, and iron status will be assessed at intervals throughout the&#xD;
      study. The number of units of blood transfused, pre-transfusion Hb level, and the reasons for&#xD;
      transfusion will be collected. Clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and the incidence&#xD;
      and severity of adverse events will be assessed and monitored during the study. Patients will&#xD;
      receive epoetin alfa under the skin (SC) at a dose of 10,000 units (U) every week, 20,000 U&#xD;
      every 2 weeks, 20,000 U every 4 weeks or 40,000 U every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. Protocol&#xD;
      Addendum: Patients will receive epoetin alfa 40,000 U every 6 weeks over 12 weeks.&#xD;
