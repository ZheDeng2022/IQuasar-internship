  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term working hypothesis is that if 3-D radiation is combined with the effect of&#xD;
      capecitabine one hopes to see improved and durable tumor response and survival with&#xD;
      acceptable toxicity. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      capecitabine used along with 3-D conformal radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine will be taken by mouth each day of radiation. The total daily dose should be&#xD;
      taken as two divided doses approximately 12 hours apart, within 30 minutes after eating,&#xD;
      ideally after breakfast and the evening meal. The overall total number of patients expected&#xD;
      to participate in this study could be as high as 30 depending on how the treatment is&#xD;
      tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group (3-6 patients) on the study will receive the drug (Xeloda®) at 600mg/m²&#xD;
      (level 1) and radiation. If the first group does well, the second group of patients on the&#xD;
      study (3-6 patients) will receive 825 mg/m² (level 2) and radiation. If the second group does&#xD;
      well, the third group will receive 1,000 mg/m² (level 3) and radiation. If the first dose&#xD;
      level of 600mg/m² is NOT tolerated, we will reduce the dose to 500mg/m² and enroll another&#xD;
      3-6 patients at the lower dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the highest tolerated dose is identified, 12 additional patients will be treated at&#xD;
      that dose to further test the safety of the treatment and better understand the effects of&#xD;
      the treatment on disease with more patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures are part of regular medical treatment (standard care) for&#xD;
      the disease and are also required for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood tests including pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG (heart tracing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan of the abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits are done 1 month after radiation, then 3 months later, then every 3 months&#xD;
      for 2 years.&#xD;
