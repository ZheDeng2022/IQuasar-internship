      The purpose of this study is to investigate if a home-based walking program is an acceptable&#xD;
      alternative for those who choose not to attend formal cardiac rehabilitation programs and if&#xD;
      such a program has an effect on coronary risk or physical fitness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most important cause of life years lost in Northern&#xD;
      Ireland (NI). A recently updated Cochrane review (Joliffe et al, 2003) confirmed the findings&#xD;
      of earlier meta-analyses (O'Connor et al, 1989; Oldridge et al, 1988) which indicated that&#xD;
      participation in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) reduces mortality after MI. The earlier work&#xD;
      demonstrated a reduction of 20-25% in all-cause and cardiac mortality. The recent work&#xD;
      allowed analysis of an increased number of patients (8440 in 32 trials) and reported a&#xD;
      reduction in total cardiac mortality of up to 31%. Participation in CR after MI also improves&#xD;
      well-being and reduces disability (NHS, 1998). However, informal reports suggest that only&#xD;
      approximately 50% of patients actually attend a hospital based program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested is that for those who chose not to attend formal CR, a home-based&#xD;
      walking program is an acceptable alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This programme of work entails two separate study designs. To evaluate the home-based walking&#xD;
      program, we plan a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Randomisation of subjects to study&#xD;
      groups will follow determination of eligibility to participate. Participants randomised to&#xD;
      the experimental group will be asked to walk for up to 30 minutes, 5-days per week. They will&#xD;
      be requested to record aspects of their walking in a diary, including time, intensity and&#xD;
      number of steps taken (recorded using a pedometer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative methodology using semi-structured interviews will be used to explore the&#xD;
      experiences of those allocated to the intervention group. The attitudes and experiences of&#xD;
      other non-attenders of CR who declined to participate in the trial will be explored in focus&#xD;
      groups. Three focus groups each containing 8 participants are planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group transcripts will be analysed independently by two observers using a computer&#xD;
      program (NUDIST) to identify themes and develop questions for the semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
      Analysis of the semi-structured interviews will be descriptive, responses being categorised&#xD;
      into themes as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT results will be analysed by intention to treat.&#xD;
