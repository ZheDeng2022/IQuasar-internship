  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether knowledge of post-session hydromorphone&#xD;
      (HYD) availability reduces drug seeking behavior in heroin dependent individuals.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug dependence is often characterized by severe drug seeking behavior. Learning to&#xD;
      understand, predict, and control this maladaptive choice behavior may lead to improved&#xD;
      prevention and treatment strategies. HYD is a drug that is currently used as a cough&#xD;
      suppressant and to relieve pain. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to&#xD;
      which opioid drug seeking behavior by heroin dependent individuals can be reduced by&#xD;
      environmental factors, including supplemental opioid drug availability, drug price, and&#xD;
      alternative non-drug reinforcers. Specifically, this study will determine whether knowledge&#xD;
      of post-session HYD availability influences drug seeking behavior in heroin dependent&#xD;
      individuals, who are maintained on buprenorphine during their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this observational study will take part in multiple trials in which they have&#xD;
      the opportunity to choose either HYD or money. On the first two experimental days, prior to&#xD;
      choice sessions, participants will receive a sample of the drug doses that can be chosen.&#xD;
      During test sessions, participants will have 12 opportunities to choose either drug or money.&#xD;
      Participants will use a computer to earn choices. Respiration rate, oxygen saturation, heart&#xD;
      rate, and blood pressure will be monitored throughout choice trials. Supplemental HYD will be&#xD;
      made available following some choice sessions. Self-report questionnaires will be completed&#xD;
      at different times during the study. Participants will be maintained on buprenorphine&#xD;
      throughout the study, with a minimum 2-week lead before the experiment, and a fixed 3-week&#xD;
      detoxification after study completion.&#xD;
