  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chest pain is a common clinical complaint. About 30% patients with chest pain will have a&#xD;
      normal coronary angiogram and are described as having noncardiac chest pain (NCCP). It is&#xD;
      estimated that 25% of the population complain of chest pain at some time in their lifetime.&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of NCCP is unknown. Esophageal hypersensitivity as a result of inflammation&#xD;
      is considered to be an important mechanism in the development of this pain sensation. Little&#xD;
      is currently known about the interaction between inflammatory mediators and peripheral&#xD;
      afferent nerve terminals in the esophagus. The mast cell is one of the most enriched&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Activation of the mucosal mast cell&#xD;
      releases a variety of mediators into adjacent tissues. We hypothesize that mediators released&#xD;
      by mast cells sensitize esophageal nociceptors and induce pain sensation.&#xD;

      1. Key Objectives: To determine the density and activation of esophageal mast cells in&#xD;
           non-cardiac chest pain patients. We expect to find mast cell activation, as measured by&#xD;
           mast cell count or degranluation, tryptase staining, and histamine release, will be&#xD;
           greater in NCCP patients compared to controls, and the increased mast cell activation&#xD;
           will correlate with the severity of NCCP. These results will expand our understanding of&#xD;
           the pathogenesis of esophageal originated NCCP, and allow the development of new&#xD;
           diagnostic and treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Population: (i) NCCP (ii) Reflux esophagitis (iii) Control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Summary of Procedures: (i) symptom assessment by chest pain questionnaire; (ii)&#xD;
           esophageal reflux evaluation by review of records of 24-hour pH monitoring; (iii)&#xD;
           evidence of esophagitis by endoscopy; (iv) esophageal biopsy by endoscopy; (v) mast cell&#xD;
           activation study in biopsy specimen by mast cell count, tryptase and Transient receptor&#xD;
           potential vanniloid-1 (TRPV1) staining, and histamine release assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Major Risks &amp; Discomforts: There are no major risks &amp; discomforts other than involved in&#xD;
           standard upper GI endoscopy.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NCCP - presence of a history of chest pain with a negative cardiac evaluation, no&#xD;
             evidence of gross esophagitis on endoscopy, and lack of any exclusion criteria; Reflux&#xD;
             esophagitis - presence of chest pain or heartburn, negative cardiac evaluation, lack&#xD;
             of exclusion criteria and presence of esophagitis on endoscopy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Controls - lack of history of chest pain, lack of exclusion criteria and lack of&#xD;
             esophagitis on endoscopy. It is anticipated that patients being evaluated for heme&#xD;
             positive stool or GI bleeding would be included as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - History of ischemic heart disease, history of asthma, significant food allergies, celiac&#xD;
        disease, chronic inflammatory conditions (SLE, rheumatoid arthritis), atopic skin disease,&#xD;
        varices, coagulopathy, recent drug treatment with steroids.&#xD;
