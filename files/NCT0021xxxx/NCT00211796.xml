      12-week open label treatment trial of divalproex sodium extended release (Depakote ER) in 10&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of autism. Our objective is to determine how well these patients&#xD;
      can tolerate the prescribed doses and what added benefits can be attributed to divalproex&#xD;
      sodium ER.&#xD;

      Based on positive research with divalproex in children/adolescents with autism, we would like&#xD;
      to extend this research to autistic adults with high levels of aggression, irritability,&#xD;
      affective instability, or agitation. We aim to have 10 adult autistic patients enrolled in&#xD;
      our study of the treatment of aggression/irritability with divalproex sodium ER. This will be&#xD;
      an open treatment for adult patients to determine if the tolerability of divalproex sodium is&#xD;
      better with the extended release. We propose this open label design because previous&#xD;
      double-blinded studies of divalproex sodium were only done in children, not adults. These&#xD;
      results will serve as pilot data for a future blinded study for autistic adults with the&#xD;
      extended release formulation. This naturalistic design will allow for prior stable (3 months)&#xD;
      use of concomitant medications. Our objective is to determine how well these patients can&#xD;
      tolerate the prescribed doses and what added benefits can be attributed to divalproex sodium&#xD;
      ER.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Meet DSM-IV, ADI, or ADOS criteria for autism spectrum disorder.&#xD;

&#xD;

             participation by an approved surrogate on the autistic individual's behalf&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Sexually active females of childbearing potential must use an acceptable method of&#xD;
             birth control and have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Score at least 4 (moderately ill) on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale for&#xD;
             Autistic Disorder (CGI-AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject meets the following criteria at pre-study diagnostic assessment and baseline&#xD;
             assessment: OAS-M 6 (raw scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects on a stable dose of their current psychotropic medication for at least 3&#xD;
             months before entering the study, with the understanding that they must remain on a&#xD;
             stable dose throughout the trial. If a subject chooses to taper off their current&#xD;
             medications, they will be closely monitored by the study psychiatrist and must be&#xD;
             medication free for 2 weeks prior to beginning the study. Additionally, if a subject&#xD;
             is currently taking a medication with a known drug interaction with Divalproex Sodium,&#xD;
             he/she will be tapered off of that medication under the supervision of the study&#xD;
             psychiatrist before undergoing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
