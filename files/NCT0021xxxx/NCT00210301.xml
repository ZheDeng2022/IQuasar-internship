  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MS has been associated with fatigue, attention problems, and a number of cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties. There is no treatment approved yet to treat these problems. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      the addition of Provigil to an existing immunomodulatory agent (Avonex) will lead to improved&#xD;
      fatigue, attention, and overall cognition in MS patients with attention problems.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      MS has been associated with fatigue, attention problems, and a number of cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties. There is no treatment approved yet to treat these problems. Although certain&#xD;
      immunomodulatory treatments may slow the progression of cogntiive difficulties, they are not&#xD;
      therapy for the progression of or new onset of such problems. Therefore, in order to treat&#xD;
      such problems, it is likely that adjunctive medications focused on fatigue and cognition are&#xD;
      needed. We hypothesize that the addition of Provigil to an existing immunomodulatory agent&#xD;
      (Avonex) will lead to improved fatigue, attention, and overall cognition in MS patients with&#xD;
      attention problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period: 6 to 12-month competitive enrollment period, two groups (Avonex and Avonex&#xD;
      +Provigil 200 mg QD ) undergo baseline (prior to starting Provigil), 2-month, and 4-month&#xD;
      neuropsychological evaluations. Total length of study, once initiated, (including 2 month&#xD;
      preparation period, 6 to 12-month competitive enrollment period through final four-month&#xD;
      visit) is 12 to 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To investigate whether Provigil in combination with Avonex is safe, and&#xD;
      tolerable in patients with RRMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether Provigil (modafinil) in combination with Avonex(interferon Î²-1a) is&#xD;
           useful in treating deficits in attention, as measured by objective neuropsychological&#xD;
           tests, in patients with RR-MS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether combination therapy (Avonex +Provigil) favorably impacts other&#xD;
           domains of cognition that are reliant on attention (e.g., memory, psychomotor&#xD;
           functioning), as measured by objective neuropsychological tests, in patients with RR-MS&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether improvement in fatigue (related to treatment) predicts improvements&#xD;
           in attention and cognitive performance in MS patients&#xD;
