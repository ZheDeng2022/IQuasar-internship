      Past research has demonstrated that cocaine dependent women experience less severe responses&#xD;
      to cocaine during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen and progesterone&#xD;
      concentrations are high. The purpose of this study is to determine whether administered&#xD;
      progesterone reduces subjective and physiological responses to cocaine in cocaine dependent&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Changes in ovarian hormones across the menstrual cycle impact responses to cocaine in women.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that cocaine's effects are dampened during the luteal phase of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle, when estrogen and progesterone concentrations are high, relative to the&#xD;
      other phases of the cycle, when concentrations of these hormones are relatively low. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine whether progesterone reduces subjective and&#xD;
      physiological responses to cocaine in cocaine dependent individuals. In addition, this study&#xD;
      will help to advance the possibility of hormonal progesterone and pharmacologically-related&#xD;
      drugs as potential treatment components for cocaine abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo two 4-day inpatient periods, totaling 8 days of treatment. For&#xD;
      women, the inpatient periods will occur during two consecutive menstrual cycles; for men,&#xD;
      these will occur during two consecutive months. On Day 1, participants will receive a first&#xD;
      dose of either progesterone or placebo. On Day 2, participants will receive a second and&#xD;
      third dose of study medication. Participants will also participate in an adaptation session,&#xD;
      which will familiarize the participant with the smoking equipment that will be used the&#xD;
      following day. On Day 3, participants will receive a fourth dose of medication 2 hours prior&#xD;
      to a smoking lab session. Prior to beginning the smoking lab session, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to rate their current cocaine craving, anxiety level, appetite, and premenstrual&#xD;
      symptoms. Participants will then be given a sample of the cocaine dose for the given day.&#xD;
      During the smoking lab session, participants will be asked additional cocaine craving&#xD;
      questions at pre-determined intervals and will be given the option to trade in previously&#xD;
      earned tokens for either money or a dose of cocaine. Following completion of the smoking lab&#xD;
      session, participants will receive their fifth dose of medication.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized to receive either progesterone or placebo during month 1, then crossover in month 2.&#xD;
During each month, participants will be randomized to receive either an active or inactive dose of cocaine during a 4-day in-hospital testing visit for a total of 4 testing days with self-administered cocaine.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Decision to Self-Administer Cocaine</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days</time_frame>
    <description>During 1 inpatient testing day, participants were given the opportunity to spend 5 earned tokens on either an active dose of cocaine or to keep the tokens for a $5 reward for each token. Decisions were solicited every 30 minutes. Outcome measure is reported as the percent of 5 decisions for which the participant chose to self-administer cocaine. 0% indicates that all 5 tokens were retained and traded for monetary reward. 100% indicates that the participant spent all 5 tokens on cocaine for self-administration.&#xD;
On another inpatient day, participants were offered the same 5 choices but with a inactive dose of cocaine (amount of cocaine insufficient for psychoactive effect) or a $5 monetary reward. 0% indicates that all 5 tokens were retained and traded for monetary reward. 100% indicates that the participant spent all 5 tokens on inactive doses of cocaine for self-administration.&#xD;
The order of days (active or inactive cocaine dosage) was random.</description>

    <description>During 1 inpatient testing day, participants were given the opportunity to spend 5 tokens on either an active dose of cocaine or to keep the tokens for a $5 reward each. Decisions were solicited every 30 minutes. There was a total of 5 decisions solicited. On another inpatient day, participants were offered the same 5 choices but with a inactive dose of cocaine or a monetary reward. The order of days (active or inactive cocaine dosage) was random. These 2 testing days were completed during a 4-day in-hospital testing session under the progesterone condition and placebo condition. Order of progesterone and placebo conditions were randomized.&#xD;
Heart rate was taken 2.5 minutes following administration of cocaine (active or inactive dosage). Up to 5 HR measurements were recorded based on participant decision to self-administer cocaine or not. Mean across up to 5 measures was calculated. Outcome is reported as the mean of mean measures during each of 4 study conditions.</description>

        <title>Decision to Self-Administer Cocaine</title>
        <description>During 1 inpatient testing day, participants were given the opportunity to spend 5 earned tokens on either an active dose of cocaine or to keep the tokens for a $5 reward for each token. Decisions were solicited every 30 minutes. Outcome measure is reported as the percent of 5 decisions for which the participant chose to self-administer cocaine. 0% indicates that all 5 tokens were retained and traded for monetary reward. 100% indicates that the participant spent all 5 tokens on cocaine for self-administration.&#xD;
On another inpatient day, participants were offered the same 5 choices but with a inactive dose of cocaine (amount of cocaine insufficient for psychoactive effect) or a $5 monetary reward. 0% indicates that all 5 tokens were retained and traded for monetary reward. 100% indicates that the participant spent all 5 tokens on inactive doses of cocaine for self-administration.&#xD;

On another inpatient day, participants were offered the same 5 choices but with a inactive dose of cocaine or a monetary reward. The order of days (active or inactive cocaine dosage) was random. These 2 testing days were completed during a 4-day in-hospital testing session under the progesterone condition and placebo condition. Order of progesterone and placebo conditions were randomized.&#xD;
Heart rate was taken 2.5 minutes following administration of cocaine (active or inactive dosage). Up to 5 HR measurements were recorded based on participant decision to self-administer cocaine or not. Mean across up to 5 measures was calculated. Outcome is reported as the mean of mean measures during each of 4 study conditions.</description>

        <title>Cocaine Craving</title>
        <description>During 1 inpatient testing day, participants were given the opportunity to spend 5 tokens on either an active dose of cocaine or to keep the tokens for a $5 reward each. Decisions were solicited every 30 minutes. There was a total of 5 decisions solicited. On another inpatient day, participants were offered the same 5 choices but with a inactive dose of cocaine or a monetary reward. The order of days (active or inactive cocaine dosage) was random. These 2 testing days were completed during a 5-day in-hospital testing session under the progesterone condition and placebo condition. Progesterone and placebo conditions were randomized.&#xD;
Participants were asked to rate cocaine craving on a scale of 0-5 prior to administration of cocaine (active or inactive dose). Lower scores indicate less cocaine craving.</description>
