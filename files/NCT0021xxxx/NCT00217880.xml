    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify biological markers of disease in patients with acute&#xD;
      lung injury (ALI) that are predictive of either disease susceptibility or prognosis, or that&#xD;
      identify novel targets of therapeutic intervention.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory failure due to ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a major&#xD;
      health problem despite significant progress in intensive care unit (ICU) care and ventilator&#xD;
      management. It is also characterized by an unacceptably high mortality rate despite enormous&#xD;
      expenditure of health care resources. Survivors of respiratory failure face long-term&#xD;
      consequences concerning their quality of life. New therapies are needed to improve early&#xD;
      survival and to decrease long-term sequelae of this syndrome. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      identify biological markers of disease in patients with ALI that are predictive of either&#xD;
      disease susceptibility or prognosis, or that identify novel targets of therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as possible after case identification, informed consent will be obtained from the&#xD;
      patient or next of kin. Physiologic measurements and specimen collection will begin at the&#xD;
      time of entry into the study. The inclusion criteria for this study allow entry of patients&#xD;
      who have fulfilled criteria for ALI/ARDS for up to 48 hours. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)&#xD;
      fluid and blood will be collected at various times after the onset of ALI/ARDS in order to&#xD;
      measure levels of a predetermined set of biological markers. In addition, DNA will be&#xD;
      collected from patients and analysed for the presence of specific genetic polymorphisms that&#xD;
      might alter either disease susceptibility or clinical expression of disease. The levels of&#xD;
      these markers or the presence of specific genetic polymorphisms will be correlated with&#xD;
      measure of pulmonary inflammation and extent of lung injury, as defined by: 1) PaO2/FiO2&#xD;
      ratios; 2) lung compliance; 3) plateau pressures; and 4) calculation of the Murray Lung&#xD;
      Injury Score (obtained at entry and Days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7,10, 14, and 21). Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures to be directly correlated with biomarker expression will include indicators of&#xD;
      maladaptive responses to ALI (including the development of multiple organ dysfunction&#xD;
      syndrome [MODS]), fibroproliferation, and nosocomial pneumonia (events which greatly impact&#xD;
      the clinical course of patients with ALI/ARDS). Thus, the secondary outcome measures include:&#xD;
      1) the development of organ failure (using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA]&#xD;
      score); 2) time on ventilator; 3) ventilator-free days; 4) ICU and hospital length of stay;&#xD;
      5) hospital mortality; 6) development of pneumonia; 7) development of lung fibrosis (as&#xD;
      determined by high-resolution computed tomography [HRCT] and pulmonary function testing); and&#xD;
      8) health related and lung-specific quality of life (as assessed with the Medical Outcome&#xD;
      Studies 36-Item Short form Health Survey Standard Form [SF-36] and St. George's Respiratory&#xD;
      Questionnaire).&#xD;
