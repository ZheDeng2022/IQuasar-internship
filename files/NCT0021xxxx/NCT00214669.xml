  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People from ethnic minority groups suffer worse ill-health from asthma than those from&#xD;
      majority groups. No studies have reduced emergency care for people from minority groups. We&#xD;
      have developed an education programme to address barriers to improved care for south Asian&#xD;
      people with asthma. The study is set in Tower Hamlets and Newham - the UK's most deprived and&#xD;
      ethnically diverse boroughs. We will invite all the local GP practices to take part, and&#xD;
      using a computer programme, randomised them (like tossing a coin) into two groups - a group&#xD;
      receiving usual care and a group receiving our educational programme. This comprises:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Education for specialist nurse and GPs and practice nurses, using our adaptation of an&#xD;
           American education course, designed to improve shared-decision making, goal-setting and&#xD;
           patient-clinician partnership.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lay-led 'expert-patient' education in small groups for patients, using an adaptation of&#xD;
           another American course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved follow-up in primary care through appointment-booking by the specialist&#xD;
           nurse.We will invite south Asians aged 3-65 years with asthma after A&amp;E attendance or&#xD;
           hospital admission to take part. Those registered with practices receiving the&#xD;
           educational programme will see the trial specialist nurse in a nurse-run clinic, where&#xD;
           the nurse:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. provides self-management advice and a treatment plan,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. makes a follow-up appointment in primary care&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. makes an appointment for lay-led 'expert-patient' sessions.Patients registered with&#xD;
                'usual care' practices receive usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will decide if our education programme works by comparing the number of emergency visits&#xD;
      to GPs and hospital between the two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health inequalities between ethnic minority and majority groups exist for all chronic&#xD;
      diseases and are a government priority for action. For asthma, poorer outcomes for people&#xD;
      from minority groups are a universal finding. No randomised trials have reduced emergency&#xD;
      asthma care for ethnic minority groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed an intervention to address barriers to improved asthma care for south Asian&#xD;
      people with asthma. This cluster randomised controlled trial tests whether education for&#xD;
      south Asians with asthma and their clinicians can reduce unscheduled care. The trial is set&#xD;
      in Tower Hamlets and Newham - boroughs with UK's 1st and 3rd highest ethnic minority&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will invite all 94 general practices in these boroughs to take part. Practices will be&#xD;
      randomised with stratification to intervention and control groups. The intervention&#xD;
      comprises:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Education for intervention specialist nurse and GPs and practice nurses from&#xD;
           intervention practices, using our adaptation of Clarke's self-regulation education&#xD;
           programme, designed to improve shared-decision making, goal-setting and&#xD;
           patient-clinician partnership.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lay-led 'expert-patient' education in small groups for patients, using an adaptation of&#xD;
           Lorig's chronic disease self-management programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved follow-up in primary care through appointment-booking by the specialist nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit south Asians aged 3-65 years with asthma after A&amp;E attendance or hospital&#xD;
      admission. Participants registered with intervention practices will see the trial specialist&#xD;
      nurse in a nurse-run hospital clinic, where the nurse:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. provides self-management advice and a treatment plan,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. makes a follow-up appointment for the patient in primary care&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. makes an appointment for lay-led 'expert-patient' sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants registered with control practices receive usual care. Primary outcomes are time&#xD;
      to first unscheduled contact with acute asthma, and proportion of participants with&#xD;
      unscheduled care, assessed from patient records 12 months after recruitment. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are generic (EQ5D) and disease specific quality of life (AQ20 and North of England&#xD;
      scales), prescribing and costs. The trial is powered to detect a 20% reduction in patients&#xD;
      attending with unscheduled care (80% power 5% significance). Outcomes will be gathered by&#xD;
      blinded researchers. Analysis will be carried out blind to allocation. Cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      will be assessed using standard incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.&#xD;
