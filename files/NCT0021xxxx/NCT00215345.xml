  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out the safety and effectiveness as well as&#xD;
      patient's quality of life on the combination of Taxotere and celecoxib on patients with&#xD;
      hormone refractory prostate cancer. Celecoxib (Celebrex) is an FDA approved drug to treat&#xD;
      arthritis. Taxotere (Docetaxel) is an FDA approved chemotherapy drug to treat certain forms&#xD;
      of cancer. Both drugs have demonstrated evidences of tumor blood vessel suppression and&#xD;
      combination of these two drugs could possibly arrest further tumor growth or make the tumor&#xD;
      decrease in size.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The standard hormone therapy for patients with metastases is androgen deprivation. This&#xD;
      treatment leads to response in 75-80% of the patients, with median duration of response of&#xD;
      only 14-18 months. Once the patient becomes hormone resistant, there is no effective therapy&#xD;
      to prolong life. For patients with HRPC, the median life expectancy is 17 months.2 Thus&#xD;
      palliative care remains the standard therapy for HRPC. The most widely used chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens are combinations of mitoxantrone with prednisone and taxanes with estramustine&#xD;
      phosphate.3,4,5 Taxotere has also demonstrated activity in prostate cancer cell lines.6&#xD;
      Several clinical studies have demonstrated its activity in patients with metastatic prostate&#xD;
      cancer as a single agent or in combination.4, 5 Taxotere may exert its effects in part&#xD;
      through anti-angiogenic effects.7 Recent work in animal models has provided additional&#xD;
      evidence for the beneficial role of angiostatic agents in the treatment of malignant&#xD;
      diseases. This is the first study of the two drugs used together in prostate cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have evidence of progressive metastatic disease (e.g., bone, pelvic mass,&#xD;
             lymph node, liver or lung metastases) within 6 weeks prior to participation in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have evaluable but not measurable disease must not have an elevated PSA&#xD;
             level as the only evidence of disease. While castrated, the patients should have&#xD;
             rising PSA on two consecutive measurements at least 1 week apart. The confirmatory PSA&#xD;
             must be obtained within 1 week prior to study registration and should be &gt;10ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bone metastases only (i.e., lacking soft-tissue disease) must have a PSA&#xD;
             level of &gt; 10 ng/ml. Patients with soft tissue metastases and /or visceral disease&#xD;
             must have either measurable disease or a PSA level of &gt; 10 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiological evidence of hydronephrosis will not by itself constitute evidence of&#xD;
             metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had prior treatment with bilateral orchiectomy or other primary&#xD;
             hormonal therapy (e.g., estrogen therapy, LHRH analog + flutamide, etc.) with evidence&#xD;
             of treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: patients who have not undergone bilateral orchiectomy must continue LHRH agonist&#xD;
        therapy (e.g., depot leuprolide or goserelin) while receiving this protocol therapy. For&#xD;
        these patients the testosterone level should be preferably checked before enrollment and&#xD;
        should be &lt; 50 ng/dl.&#xD;
