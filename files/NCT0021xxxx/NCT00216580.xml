      The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of long-acting injectable&#xD;
      risperidone in the treatment of patients in the early stage of psychosis&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although many schizophrenia patients currently take oral antipsychotic medications, it is&#xD;
      estimated that up to 75% of them have difficulty adhering to the daily oral regimen.&#xD;
      Long-acting injectable formulations may eliminate the need for daily medication and enhance&#xD;
      patient compliance with the treatment regimen. This study is a pilot project to demonstrate&#xD;
      that long-acting risperidone can be used safely and effectively in treating patients in the&#xD;
      early stage of psychosis. It is an open-label, single-arm study in patients with recent onset&#xD;
      of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. There are 3 phases:&#xD;
      Wash-out Phase of 7 days, during which current psychotropic medications are discontinued;&#xD;
      Oral Treatment Phase, beginning 1 week before the first injection and continuing 3 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter, during which risperidone tablets are taken; and Long-Acting Injectable Treatment&#xD;
      Phase, during which injections are given every 2 weeks for 24 months. Assessments of&#xD;
      effectiveness include Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), a scale for the&#xD;
      measurement of symptoms of schizophrenia; time from initiation of treatment to relapse;&#xD;
      Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), which assesses symptoms of major&#xD;
      depressive disorder in patients with schizophrenia; and Clinical Global Impression (CGI)&#xD;
      scales. Safety assessments include the incidence of adverse events and Extrapyramidal Symptom&#xD;
      Rating Scale (ESRS) scores throughout the study; clinical laboratory tests (hematology and&#xD;
      chemistry) and vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature) at stated intervals.&#xD;
      Risperidone oral tablets once daily (1 milligram[mg], 2mg, or 3mg [maximum]) from 1 week&#xD;
      before first injection through 3 wks after. Risperidone injections (25mg, 37.5mg, or 50mg&#xD;
      [max]) every 2 weeks for 24 months. Doses may be increased or decreased at investigator's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
