    <textblock>
      Prospective, single center, descriptive study in 14 infants/children with multivessel&#xD;
      pulmonary vein stenosis stratified for patients with or without underlying cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Patients without additional structural heart disease and multivessel pulmonary vein&#xD;
      stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Patients with additional structural heart disease and multivessel pulmonary vein&#xD;
      stenosis.&#xD;

      Patients identified at the time of presentation to their cardiologist will be asked to&#xD;
      provide a urine sample for analysis. If blood is being drawn for other clinical tests, an&#xD;
      extra vial of blood will be collected for measurement of bFGF, VEGF, angiopoietin 1&amp;2 and&#xD;
      ephrin. At the time of blood draws, approximately 4 cc's of heparin blood will be obtained&#xD;
      and processed as detailed below. Blood and/or urine samples will be coordinated through the&#xD;
      data manager and will be performed only when blood is being obtained for other reasons.&#xD;
      Initially, blood samples will be sent to Lab Control, spun down, and the plasma isolated.&#xD;
      Plasma will be coded, then frozen at -200C in the research lab. Urine samples will be&#xD;
      aliquoted into vials and stored at -20 until further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient information will be kept confidential. Individual results will not be provided to&#xD;
      patients. Identifiers to patient information will be maintained. No identifying patient&#xD;
      information will be used in publications that might result from these studies. Information to&#xD;
      be collected by the data manager will include age, sex, date of diagnosis and interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim is to assess angiogenic growth factor concentrations in urine and blood from&#xD;
      patients with both congenital and acquired multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis can be based on clinical and radiographic grounds or at the time of biopsy&#xD;
             or prior surgical procedures. The diagnosis must be consistent with multivessel&#xD;
             pulmonary stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There must be evidence of severe pulmonary vein stenosis in at least two pulmonary&#xD;
             veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must give written informed consent according to institutional guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mechanism of pulmonary venous obstruction due to obvious anatomic cause, such as&#xD;
             extrinsic compression&#xD;
