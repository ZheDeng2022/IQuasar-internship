  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary effectiveness of the&#xD;
      novel compound RWJ-333369 in patients with partial onset seizures who are currently being&#xD;
      treated with 1 or 2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs.&#xD;

      333369EPY2002 is the open-label extension study that follows the double-blind study&#xD;
      333369EPY2001. In an open label study such as 333369EPY2002, both the physician and the&#xD;
      patient know the name of the assigned study medication. In a double blind study such as&#xD;
      333369EPY2001, neither the physician nor the patient knows the name of the assigned study&#xD;
      medication. Patients who complete the double-blind treatment phase of study 333369EPY2001&#xD;
      will be eligible to enter the open-label extension study during which patients will&#xD;
      transition through a blinded period to an open-label period with carisbamate (also referred&#xD;
      to as RWJ-333369). RWJ-333369 is a new chemical compound with anticonvulsant activity that is&#xD;
      currently under investigation as a treatment for epilepsy. Patients electing to enter the&#xD;
      open-label extension phase will be supplied with both open-label carisbamate (RWJ-333369) and&#xD;
      blinded study medication for the transition phase. During this transition phase (up to 21&#xD;
      days in length), the patient's dose of double-blind study drug will be gradually reduced and&#xD;
      stopped and treatment with open-label RWJ-333369 will be started. Throughout the remainder of&#xD;
      the open label extension phase, investigators will be allowed to make further adjustments of&#xD;
      the dosage and schedule of carisbamate, including independent adjustment of the morning and&#xD;
      evening doses, but a dosage of 1,200 mg/day may not be exceeded and increases in dosage must&#xD;
      be in increments of no more than 200 mg/day. Patients who, in the judgment of the&#xD;
      investigator, continue to benefit from treatment with RWJ-333369 may continue to receive the&#xD;
      drug with follow up clinic visits every 3 months until RWJ 333369 is available by&#xD;
      prescription or the program is terminated by the sponsor. Initial dose RWJ-333369 is 1&#xD;
      capsule (250 milligram (mg) taken twice daily. Dosage may be changed at weekly intervals. The&#xD;
      maximum permitted dose will be 4 capsules (1000 mg), twice daily during dose titration.&#xD;
      Double blind-treatment duration is up to 71 days with the option to continue treatment in an&#xD;
      open-label study. Maximum dose in open-label study is 1200 mg/day&#xD;
