      The purpose of the research is to determine the best automated external defibrillator (AED)&#xD;
      training approach for high-risk patients and their family members with regard to AED skills&#xD;
      retention and psychological adjustment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the past 3 decades, advances in the understanding of the resuscitation of cardiac arrest&#xD;
      have provided opportunities to strengthen the links in the chain of survival. Despite the&#xD;
      apparent progress, however, survival has remained poor. Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of&#xD;
      mortality in the US, accounting for up to 450,000 deaths annually. Eighty percent of all&#xD;
      cardiac arrest events are caused by the arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation. Prompt&#xD;
      electrical defibrillation is the only effective therapy. The time interval from collapse to&#xD;
      attempted defibrillation is the most important determinant of outcome. The chance of survival&#xD;
      decreases on average by approximately 10-15% for every minute that elapses prior to attempted&#xD;
      defibrillation. Thus, methods to decrease the time interval between collapse and electrical&#xD;
      defibrillation represent a true opportunity to improve survival from cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even in communities where emergency medical systems are best situated to treat cardiac&#xD;
      arrest, response intervals are on average greater than 6 minutes. The development of the&#xD;
      automated external defibrillator (AED) provides the possibility to decrease the interval from&#xD;
      collapse to defibrillation by enabling persons outside the traditional emergency medical&#xD;
      services response system who are typically not trained in rhythm recognition to deliver&#xD;
      life-saving therapy. The AED is a device that can be applied in case of cardiac arrest and&#xD;
      will assess the heart rhythm and instruct the bystander whether to provide a shock. In&#xD;
      addition, approximately 75% of cardiac arrests occur in the home and are witnessed or found&#xD;
      by a family member. Thus, a family responder AED program, where family members of persons at&#xD;
      relatively high risk of cardiac arrest are equipped and trained with AEDs, may in part,&#xD;
      decrease the interval from collapse to shock in cardiac arrest and improve outcome. Persons&#xD;
      who have recently been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome are known to be at&#xD;
      elevated risk for cardiac arrest. Indeed, the provision of an AED for home use is already in&#xD;
      practice. However, it is not clear what method should be used to train family members in this&#xD;
      potentially lifesaving set of skills. The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate 4&#xD;
      different AED training methods to determine if the training approaches differentially affect&#xD;
      AED skill retention or psychological status. Although the programs span the spectrum from&#xD;
      streamlined to personalized and intensive, each approach constitutes a potential real-world,&#xD;
      generalizable AED training method.&#xD;
