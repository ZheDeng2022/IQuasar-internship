  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain an estimate of catheter survival in the setting of&#xD;
      upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) in patients treated with dalteparin and&#xD;
      warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation with dalteparin and warfarin in patients with UEDVT secondary to central&#xD;
      venous catheters in patients with an active malignancy is an effective therapy as quantified&#xD;
      by the success of catheter preservation. A prolonged line salvage rate without a recurrence&#xD;
      of UEDVT will improve the management of cancer patients who develop upper extremity deep&#xD;
      venous thrombosis in the setting of a central venous (CV) catheter.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a serious disorder with an annual incidence of approximately&#xD;
      0.1% and increasing with age to 1% in the elderly. Deep venous thrombosis of the upper&#xD;
      extremity (UEDVT) is estimated to constitute 1-5% of all cases of DVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapy of UEDVT has not been standardized.Therapeutic options include anticoagulation&#xD;
      with unfractionated heparin followed by warfarin, treatment with a thrombolytic agent, or a&#xD;
      thrombectomy. Recently, treatment with low molecular weight heparin has been shown to be a&#xD;
      safe and effective treatment for patients with verified UEDVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with cancer, treatment of UEDVT associated with central venous catheters is even&#xD;
      less standardized. Some groups advocate removal of the catheter as the sole treatment for the&#xD;
      DVT, others remove the catheter and treat the DVT. A major disadvantage to removing the line&#xD;
      is that often re-insertion in the opposite limb is then required to avoid disruption of&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic treatment. This reinsertion again puts the patient at risk for thrombosis&#xD;
      and pulmonary embolism. Another therapy is treatment only with systemic thrombolytic therapy.&#xD;
      The disadvantage of thrombolytic therapy in persons with cancer is that there is a high risk&#xD;
      for major bleeding at the doses used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A treatment regimen that has been adopted by the London Health Sciences Centre, and others&#xD;
      across Canada, is to leave the catheter in place and treat the DVT with low molecular weight&#xD;
      heparin and warfarin. This regimen is believed to halt the progression of thrombi, prevent&#xD;
      embolism and allow natural thrombolytic mechanisms to work effectively. By leaving the&#xD;
      central line in situ and appropriately treating the thrombosis there is no disruption in the&#xD;
      delivery of life-prolonging or life-saving treatment in the form of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data has been collected over the past 24 months at the London Health Sciences&#xD;
      Centre; the results suggest that this approach to treatment will prove to be beneficial to&#xD;
      the patient. Thirteen (13) patients with cancer and an UEDVT associated with a central venous&#xD;
      catheter were treated with dalteparin and warfarin with an intention to leave the central&#xD;
      line in situ. Of the 13, 1 patient had the line removed after 3 days at a peripheral hospital&#xD;
      against recommendation. The UEDVT was treated successfully and without the need for line&#xD;
      removal in 9 (75%) of the remaining 12 patients. Two (2) of the 12 had lines removed at 1&#xD;
      week and 1 had the line removed at 4 weeks due to worsening symptoms of UEDVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, UEDVT is a more common and less benign disease than previously reported and&#xD;
      generally arises in the presence of recognizable risk factors such as central venous&#xD;
      catheters and cancer. Treatment of the UEDVT with dalteparin and warfarin will treat the&#xD;
      thrombosis while preserving the central venous access for continued use. Hence, the need for&#xD;
      additional catheters and subsequent risk of bilateral UEDVT will be minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Result of the CLOT (Clot in Cancer) Trial have shown the superiority of treatment with&#xD;
      dalteparin for 6 months as compared to the conventional treatment with short-term dalteparin&#xD;
      and extended warfarin for cancer patients with acute symptomatic DVT or PE. Extended&#xD;
      anticoagulant therapy may be beneficial in patients with UEDVT as well, however, there are&#xD;
      currently no estimates of clinical outcomes for either conventional (dalteparin followed by&#xD;
      warfarin) or extended therapy with dalteparin in this patient population.&#xD;
