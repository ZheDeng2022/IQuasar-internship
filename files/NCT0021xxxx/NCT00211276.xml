  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if the study drug, ONTAK (denileukin&#xD;
      diftitox), can shrink or slow the growth of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in patients&#xD;
      whose disease has not responded to prior treatments, or has relapsed after an initial&#xD;
      response to prior treatments. The safety of treatment with ONTAK will also be studied. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL and mild to moderate&#xD;
      myelosuppression treated with ONTAK at a new dosing regimen will respond sufficiently to&#xD;
      warrant further study.&#xD;
