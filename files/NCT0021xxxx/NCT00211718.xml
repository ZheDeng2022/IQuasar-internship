  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intra-articular botulinum toxin type A is&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of chronic joint pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic shoulder pain unresponsive to oral medications and intra-articular corticosteroids is&#xD;
      an important treatment problem, especially for the young, very old and those with complex&#xD;
      medical problems that preclude joint reconstructive surgery. We hypothesized that&#xD;
      intra-articular botulinum toxin could provide important joint pain relief in these patients.&#xD;
      This is a prospective, double blined, placebo controlled 6month trial with an open label&#xD;
      extension phase when pain returns to baseline levels (re-injection with 100units of botulinum&#xD;
      toxin and 6 months followup thereafter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: Intra-articular injection of botulinum toxin type a will be compared to&#xD;
      intra-articular injection of placebo ( lidocaine then saline).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients who were considered not to be candidates for Shoulder joint replacement&#xD;
                  because of young age, abnormalities in periarticular tissues or because of&#xD;

&#xD;
