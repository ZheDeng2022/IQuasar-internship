  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of past research on marijuana treatment has specifically targeted the&#xD;
      alleviation of withdrawal symptoms. Minimal focus has been placed on how altering craving&#xD;
      effects may play a role in treating marijuana addiction. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the effects of marijuana-related cues versus non marijuana-related cues in&#xD;
      individuals both addicted and not addicted to marijuana. In turn, this may help establish a&#xD;
      better understanding of the effects of marijuana cravings and may lead to improved treatments&#xD;
      for marijuana dependence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Marijuana is the most commonly used illegal drug in the United States; more than 2 million&#xD;
      Americans either abuse or are dependent on the drug. The development of a medication to&#xD;
      reduce marijuana use and prevent drug relapse by lessening withdrawal symptoms has been a&#xD;
      primary focus of research. However, there has been little emphasis on evaluating the efficacy&#xD;
      of a treatment that specifically reduces marijuana cravings. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      subjective and physiological responses to marijuana-related cues versus non marijuana-related&#xD;
      cues in order to better understand the effects of marijuana cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into two groups. Group 1 will consist of 20 individuals&#xD;
      diagnosed with marijuana dependence; Group 2 will consist of individuals matched by age&#xD;
      range, gender and race to Group 1, and who are healthy volunteers and do not use marijuana or&#xD;
      who report limited marijuana exposure. Participants in Group 1 will spend one night at the&#xD;
      Psychiatric and Addiction Research Center at Detroit Receiving Hospital to control for&#xD;
      alcohol and drug use for 12 hours preceding the next day's 2-hour study session. Participants&#xD;
      in Group 2 are not required to spend the night, but are tested for drugs and alcohol prior to&#xD;
      the session. During the study session, both groups will be shown a nature video and will be&#xD;
      asked to handle and smell various items; these will act as the neutral, non marijuana-related&#xD;
      cues. Next, the participants will watch a video of individuals smoking marijuana and will be&#xD;
      asked to handle and smell marijuana-related items; these will act as the marijuana-related&#xD;
      cues. Heart rate and skin temperature will be monitored continuously throughout the cue&#xD;
      sessions with the use of electrodes and a skin thermometer. Prior to and after the cue&#xD;
      sessions, blood pressure will be measured and questionnaires will be administered to assess&#xD;
      drug cravings as well as related mood states. Prior to leaving the laboratory, the&#xD;
      participants' vital signs will be evaluated to ensure that any cue-related physiological&#xD;
      changes have returned to normal. Participants will have the option of talking to a clinician&#xD;
      experienced in dealing with drug cravings following the end of the study session.&#xD;
