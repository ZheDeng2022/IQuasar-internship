  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a medical problem whose importance is increasing in&#xD;
      recognition and awareness. The National Commission on Sleep Disorders estimates that 15&#xD;
      million Americans have OSA, many of whom remain undiagnosed (24). OSA is associated with the&#xD;
      development of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases (1,2). Patients with OSA, like&#xD;
      those with congestive heart failure, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, exhibit&#xD;
      impaired EDV (25-32). OSA is also associated with impairments in endothelium-dependent&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow responses, which may be a risk factor for stroke (33). Impaired EDV is a&#xD;
      result of reduced production or inadequate action of nitric oxide. Since EDV worsens with&#xD;
      disease progression and improves with disease treatment, it serves as a prognostic marker of&#xD;
      vascular function (34-37). In OSA, hypoxia and neurohumoral disturbances increase generation&#xD;
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that neutralize nitric oxide and impair&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent responses (9,10,38). One source of ROS in endothelial cells is the&#xD;
      enzyme xanthine oxidase (38). XO is an enzyme present in the vascular endothelium that&#xD;
      significantly contributes to generation of ROS in congestive heart failure,&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia and diabetes (13-17). Inhibition of XO improves endothelium-dependent&#xD;
      resistance vessel responses in these populations (13-17), but it is unknown if XO&#xD;
      significantly contributes to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in OSA. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis of this application is that inhibition of XO with allopurinol will reduce&#xD;
      oxidative stress and generation of ROS, thereby improving nitric oxide bioavailability and&#xD;
      EDV in OSA. Our hypothesis has been formulated on the basis that patients with OSA experience&#xD;
      repeated hypoxemia that increases activity of XO and other enzymes, thus increasing the&#xD;
      generation of ROS that negatively impact EDV. Hypoxia is detrimental to vascular homeostasis&#xD;
      since it increases generation of ROS through direct mechanisms and via activation of XO.&#xD;
