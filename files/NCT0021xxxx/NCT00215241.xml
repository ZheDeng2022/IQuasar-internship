  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to (1) compare the response of civilians with Posttraumatic&#xD;
      Stress Disorder(PTSD) currently receiving sertraline without an optimal response to&#xD;
      risperidone augmentation vs. placebo, and (2) to evaluate the tolerability of risperidone&#xD;
      augmentation, and (3) to identifiy predictors of response to risperidone augmentation. the&#xD;
      hypothesis is that risperidone augmentation of sertraline treatment of PTSD is safe and&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, two-phase study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone&#xD;
      augmentation to sertraline treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In the first&#xD;
      phase, all patients will be assigned to take open label sertraline for 8 weeks (up to 200&#xD;
      mg/d). Those who have not achieved a significant decrease in their PTSD symptoms by week 8&#xD;
      will be entered into the second phase. In the second phase, patients will continue with the&#xD;
      sertraline, but will then be randomly given either risperidone (up to 3 mg/d) or matching&#xD;
      placebo in double-blind fashion.&#xD;
