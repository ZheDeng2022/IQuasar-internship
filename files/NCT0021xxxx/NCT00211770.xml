  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism, originally described by Kanner (1943), is among the most severe of neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      disorders. It is a pervasive developmental disorder affecting social, communicative, and&#xD;
      compulsive/repetitive behaviors characterized by stereotypic complex hand and body movements,&#xD;
      craving for sameness, and narrow repetitive interests. Individuals with autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorders (ASD) are characteristically heterogeneous and show marked variability in their&#xD;
      response to interventions. Studies of behavioral and psychopharmacological interventions&#xD;
      document approximately 1/3 of ASD participants fail to respond to targeted treatments.&#xD;
      Efforts to evaluate the specificity of treatment effects are important to inform&#xD;
      conceptualizations about the disorder, identify behavioral phenotypes, and to aide clinical&#xD;
      decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of clinical behavioral pharmacology methods,&#xD;
      functional behavioral assessments (FBA), in assessing the treatment effects of pediatric&#xD;
      medications in children with ASD. The present study of FBA procedures in pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment will be conducted as a separate, but parallel study within IRB approved, federally&#xD;
      funded, double-masked, placebo controlled medication trials of citalopram (GCO # 01-1295&#xD;
      PS*), an SSRI hypothesized to reduce stereotyped and repetitive behaviors in ASD and&#xD;
      divalproex sodium (GCO # 01-0294), a medication recently found to reduce repetitive behaviors&#xD;
      in ASD (Hollander et al., in press). This study will focus on the use of FBAs in&#xD;
      distinguishing responders vs. nonresponders on the basis of behavior function, in evaluating&#xD;
      functional patterns for stereotypy, aggression, and impulsivity, and in using descriptive&#xD;
      FBAs as outcome measures in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FBAs are behavioral assessment methods used to hypothesize about the function of maladaptive&#xD;
      behaviors. FBAs are conducted either through experimental manipulations known as functional&#xD;
      analyses or through descriptive analyses procedures, which involve structured observations&#xD;
      and parent/caregiver interviews. Descriptive analyses will be conducted with all participants&#xD;
      (n=24). The more rigorous, functional analyses will be conducted with a sub-set of the sample&#xD;
      (n=6) to corroborate the findings of the descriptive analyses. Data from the FBAs will be&#xD;
      collected using videotaped recordings of behavior and coded by trained raters for both the&#xD;
      descriptive and experimental analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our pilot data and other published data suggest that certain medications such as citalopram&#xD;
      (celexa) and divalproex sodium (Depakote) may improve global functioning in autistic patients&#xD;
      and repetitive/compulsive behaviors and social deficits. The addition of FBA methods to&#xD;
      evaluate outcome are an important step in extending the research and knowledge of the&#xD;
      conditions associated with good and poor treatment response to pediatric medications in&#xD;
      children with autism.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Research geared towards increasing knowledge of the variables contributing to treatment&#xD;
      response is critical to advancing intervention studies in ASD. Literature in the growing&#xD;
      field of clinical behavioral pharmacology suggests functional behavioral assessments (FBA),&#xD;
      when integrated into clinical trials of medication, can be important tools in elucidating the&#xD;
      specificity of treatment effects (Mace &amp; Mauk, 1995, Northup &amp; Gully, 2001). The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the use of clinical behavioral pharmacology methods, primarily&#xD;
      descriptive functional behavioral assessments (FBA), in a double-masked, placebo controlled&#xD;
      trial of medications used to treat children with autism. These medications are hypothesized&#xD;
      to reduce the stereotyped and repetitive behaviors in ASD. This study will focus on the use&#xD;
      of descriptive FBAs in distinguishing responders vs. non-responders on the basis of behavior&#xD;
      function, in evaluating functional patterns for stereotypy, and in using descriptive FBAs as&#xD;
      outcome measures in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is accordance with CAN research priorities in its focus on improving&#xD;
      methodological approaches in clinical trials (Hollander, et al., 2004). This study is also&#xD;
      consistent with recent NIMH recommendations for clinical research. The recommendations&#xD;
      identify the integration of behavioral research methods with traditional methods of clinical&#xD;
      research (i.e. group designs) as important aims for ASD treatment research (CPEA/STAART&#xD;
      working group, 2004). As such, this study fills significant gaps in two research areas:&#xD;
      treatments for repetitive behaviors and research methodology in treatment trials for&#xD;
      individuals with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bio-behavioral methods proposed for use in this evaluation have been previously used to&#xD;
      stratify and match treatments for self-injurious behavior in adults with developmental&#xD;
      disabilities (Mace &amp; Mauk, 1995), identify specific treatment effects of methylphenidate in&#xD;
      children with ADHD (Northup &amp; Gully, 2001), and more recently in evaluating the specificity&#xD;
      of risperidone's effects on destructive behaviors in individuals with autism (Crosland, et&#xD;
      al, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite that stereotyped and repetitive behaviors are a core symptom domain of ASD,&#xD;
      behavioral pharmacology approaches to date have only evaluated the correlated symptoms of&#xD;
      aggression, self-injurious, and destructive behaviors in ASD. Repetitive behaviors in ASD&#xD;
      include stereotypic movements, repetition of routine behaviors, repetitive play,&#xD;
      perseverative speech, and over-focus on restricted interests. These repetitive movements may&#xD;
      be associated with emotional distress, tension, or dysphoria and have significant impacts on&#xD;
      daily life. It is believed that the methods used to elucidate and specify treatment effects&#xD;
      in other medications and disorders will also be valuable to the understanding of SSRI effects&#xD;
      in autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both behavioral and pharmacological treatments have been used to treat repetitive and&#xD;
      stereotyped behaviors in autism. Behavioral treatments include the use of noncontingent&#xD;
      reinforcement (Britton, et al., 2002) and alternative response training to maintain&#xD;
      homeostasis (Johnson, Laarhoven, &amp; Repp, 2002). Psychopharmacological approaches include the&#xD;
      use of SSRIs given the similarity between repetitive behaviors in autism and OCD (McDougle,&#xD;
      1995) and evidence for serotonin dysfunction in ASD (Hollander, 2000). To date, there are few&#xD;
      controlled studies with any of the SSRIs in pediatric populations with ASD. Hollander &amp;&#xD;
      colleagues (Hollander, et al., in press) at Mt. Sinai recently completed a study suggesting&#xD;
      the efficacy of low-dose liquid fluoxetine on reducing repetitive behaviors in a&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study of 45 children with ASD. This proposed FBA&#xD;
      evaluation would occur within another SSRI trial at Mt. Sinai, which aims to extend previous&#xD;
      findings in a large scale, multisite investigation of the safety and efficacy of liquid&#xD;
      citalopram in children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral pharmacology methods Functional behavioral assessments (FBA) are the cornerstone&#xD;
      of clinical behavioral pharmacology approaches. The goals of FBAs are to hypothesize and&#xD;
      experimentally test the functions of maladaptive behaviors. Within the field of behavior&#xD;
      analysis, determining the function of the maladaptive behavior is primary to developing&#xD;
      effective interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FBAs involve both experimental and descriptive assessments of behavior functions.&#xD;
      Experimental methods, also known as functional analyses (Iwata, et al., 1982/1994), have the&#xD;
      advantage of using experimental manipulations and direct, continuous observations of&#xD;
      behavior. The procedures outlined by Iwata, et al. (1982/1994) are considered the&#xD;
      gold-standard for functional analyses. The procedure involves the use of multi-element,&#xD;
      single-subject experimental design. During the functional analysis, consequences presented&#xD;
      for a maladaptive behavior are varied. The experimental conditions outlined by Iwata, et al.&#xD;
      (1982/1994) are labeled by the presumed function tested in a condition and include:&#xD;
      escape/avoidance, attention, automatic reinforcement/self-stimulation, and control (i.e.&#xD;
      preferred toys + social attention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental methods provide valuable and reliable data on behavior functions, but involve&#xD;
      significant time and expense for patients and experimenters. In contrast, descriptive methods&#xD;
      are based on parent/caregiver-report, direct behavioral observations, and provide information&#xD;
      on both consequent and antecedent predictors of behavior. Descriptive methods are strongly&#xD;
      correlated with experimental analyses and have advantages because of the information provided&#xD;
      on antecedent functions and in their relative cost-effectiveness (Horner, et al., 1997). This&#xD;
      study will pilot the use of descriptive assessment methods as an outcome measure and use&#xD;
      experimental FBAs to corroborate the results of the descriptive analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methods and outcome of this investigation will be used to design an independent clinical&#xD;
      trial using a multi-method approach, including descriptive and experimental FBAs as outcome&#xD;
      measures, in medication studies of repetitive behaviors in ASD. Given this research has&#xD;
      limited funding options outside of CAN, funding this project may be a critical, preliminary&#xD;
      step in improving our treatment-specificity research and clinical research methods in ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the usability of functional behavioral&#xD;
      assessment (FBA) procedures in predicting and measuring treatment response within a clinical&#xD;
      trial of citalopram, an SSRI hypothesized to reduce repetitive behaviors in ASD. The specific&#xD;
      aims of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To predict treatment response through results from descriptive FBAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate functional patterns for stereotypy/repetitive behaviors in ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the use of descriptive FBAs as outcome measures in SSRI trials in ASD and to&#xD;
           correlate results from descriptive FBAs with standard global rating measures such as the&#xD;
           Child Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS) and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist&#xD;
           (ABC) for repetitive behaviors and stereotypy.&#xD;
