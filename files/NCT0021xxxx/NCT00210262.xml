  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) imposes a significant burden of early mortality and decreased quality&#xD;
      of life on the 6% of Canadians affected by it. There is a growing body of research evidence&#xD;
      showing that the use of certain medications (ACE inhibitors, blood pressure medications and&#xD;
      cholesterol lowering agents) can reduce the major complications of diabetes such as heart,&#xD;
      blood vessel and kidney disease and amputations. Unfortunately this research knowledge does&#xD;
      not appear to be routinely translated into clinical practice. The proposed study examines the&#xD;
      effect of simple mailed interventions to patients or physicians on improving the use of these&#xD;
      therapies. The strategies to be tested are direct patient education with an emphasis on blood&#xD;
      pressure and lipid control rather than use of particular drugs and, for physicians, the&#xD;
      provision of confidential prescribing feedback together with targeted educational bulletins.&#xD;
      With patient and physician consent, health care administrative data will be used to examine&#xD;
      the impact of the interventions. If successful, the study will identify low cost reproducible&#xD;
      interventions to promote the use of proven preventive therapies in clinical practice.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preventing major complications is a cornerstone in the outpatient management of diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (DM). While glycaemic control remains important, recent evidence supports the role&#xD;
      of blood pressure and lipids and the use of ACE inhibitors in reducing complications.&#xD;
      Effective interventions are required to ensure implementation of these findings. Since&#xD;
      optimal DM management involves the participation of both patients and providers, strategies&#xD;
      to improve care can reasonably be directed toward either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study explores the impact of simple mailed interventions directed toward&#xD;
      patients or providers on the rates of use of ACE inhibitors, Blood pressure lowering drugs&#xD;
      and Cholesterol lowering therapies - the ABCs - by older patients with DM. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that: 1) mailed interventions including prescriber feedback can increase the ABCs relative to&#xD;
      controls; 2) that interventions directed toward patients and providers are equally effective&#xD;
      in promoting the ABCs among patients selected to receive the intervention and 3) that&#xD;
      interventions directed towards clusters of patients within a physician's practice will also&#xD;
      change the care provided by those physicians to their other patients, in the absence of any&#xD;
      direct intervention to the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practices of 300 randomly selected primary care physicians in Ontario and, through their&#xD;
      physicians, 10 patients over age 65 with known DM in each practice will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate. Practices (physicians and their index patients) will be randomized to one of 3&#xD;
      arms: 1) physician intervention, 2) patient intervention or 3) control. In arm 1,&#xD;
      participating physicians will receive confidential prescribing feedback on the ABCs and, as a&#xD;
      masking intervention, patients will receive educational materials regarding DM eye care. In&#xD;
      arm 2, patients will receive a mailed educational intervention regarding blood pressure and&#xD;
      lipid control while physicians will receive education and feedback regarding eye care as a&#xD;
      masking intervention. In arm 3, no educational intervention regarding hypertension and lipids&#xD;
      will be provided and both patients and physicians will receive the eye care intervention.&#xD;
      Data sources will be claims data from the Ontario Drug Benefit Program and the Ontario Health&#xD;
      Insurance Plan and the Ontario Diabetes Database (a validated, linkable administrative data&#xD;
      diabetes registry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes will be the proportion of patients receiving ACE inhibitors, the&#xD;
      proportion receiving 2 or more antihypertensive drugs and the proportion receiving lipid&#xD;
      lowering drugs. All prescriptions received by the patient will be included whether or not&#xD;
      written by the study physician. The unit of analysis will be the physician. Data will be&#xD;
      analyzed in a multilevel logistic model with covariates measured at the physician level and&#xD;
      outcomes measured at the patient level. The primary analysis will include only the data on&#xD;
      index patients in each of the three arms. A secondary analysis will include all patients with&#xD;
      diabetes over age 65 within the practices of the participating physicians. This project will&#xD;
      further elucidate the role of prescribing feedback in guideline implementation and will&#xD;
      explore a novel patient-based approach to improving the quality of diabetes care. The&#xD;
      relative simplicity and the central administration of the proposed strategy suggest that, if&#xD;
      effective, it could readily be widely implemented.&#xD;
