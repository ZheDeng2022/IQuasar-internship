  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topiramate&#xD;
      compared with placebo in the prevention of migraine attacks in children (12 to 17 years of&#xD;
      age).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of 2 dosages of topiramate (50 and 100 milligrams/day) compared with placebo in&#xD;
      the prevention of migraine attacks in children 12 to 17 years of age. The study is composed&#xD;
      of 3 phases: pretreatment, double-blind treatment for 4 months (16 weeks), and posttreatment.&#xD;
      During the study, patients will maintain headache and medication records to document the&#xD;
      following: occurrence and duration of headaches; severity of headache pain; whether or not&#xD;
      the headache is pulsating or aggravated by physical activity; associated symptoms, such as&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, abdominal pain; and medication taken to relieve&#xD;
      headache pain or symptoms. Assessment of efficacy include the percent reduction in the&#xD;
      frequency of monthly migraine attacks over the last 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment&#xD;
      phase compared with prospective BL period. In addition, the percent reduction in (a) average&#xD;
      monthly migraine days, (b) average monthly headache days, and (c) monthly migraine rate, over&#xD;
      the last 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment phase compared with the pretreatment phase&#xD;
      will be assessed. Safety assessments include the incidence of adverse events, measurement of&#xD;
      vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, oral temperature), results of pregnancy tests, physical&#xD;
      and neurologic examinations, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, and&#xD;
      urinalysis), and monitoring for visual or ocular disturbances, heat intolerance, renal or&#xD;
      urinary disturbance, depression and rash. The study hypothesis is that the percent reduction&#xD;
      in frequency of monthly (28-day) migraine attacks (using the 48-hour rule) from the&#xD;
      prospective baseline period (pretreatment phase) to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind&#xD;
      phase will be significantly better for the topiramate groups than for the placebo group.&#xD;
      Topiramate tablets (25 milligrams) or placebo, beginning at 25mg once daily (Week 1),&#xD;
      increasing to twice daily total of 50mg or 100mg (Week 4). Maximum dosage of topiramate (or&#xD;
      placebo) continues for next 12 weeks. Dosage may be reduced once at investigator's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
