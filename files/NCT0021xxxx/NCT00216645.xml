  <brief_title>Phase II Clinical Study of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Injection as 2nd-line or Later Therapy in Patients With Mullerian Carcinoma (Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma, Primary Carcinoma of Fallopian Tube, Peritoneal Carcinoma) Having Prior Platinum-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of pegylated liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin hydrochloride injection in Japanese patients with Mullerian carcinoma. This&#xD;
      clinical study is a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label study in Japanese patients with&#xD;
      Mullerian carcinoma (including epithelial ovarian carcinoma, primary carcinoma of fallopian&#xD;
      tube, peritoneal carcinoma) with a prior history of platinum-based chemotherapy. Eighty&#xD;
      patients will be administered intravenously at least two cycles of 50 mg/m2 of pegylated&#xD;
      liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride every 4 weeks to investigate the effectiveness and safety&#xD;
      of the treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pegylated liposomal Doxorubicin hydrochloride is intended to change the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      conventional doxorubicin in the blood and to improve the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      drug. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride has been approved in many countries&#xD;
      including US and EU, becoming a standard drug for 2nd-line therapy in ovarian cancer and&#xD;
      AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma. This clinical study was planned to assess effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety for Japanese patients with Müllerian carcinoma (including epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      carcinoma, primary carcinoma of fallopian tube, peritoneal carcinoma), who had a prior&#xD;
      history of receiving platinum-based chemotherapy such as Cisplatin (which is considered to be&#xD;
      the standard chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma). In this study, at least two cycles of&#xD;
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride 50 mg/m2 will be intravenously administered to&#xD;
      80 patients every 4 weeks. These patients include twenty 2nd-line &quot;platinum-sensitive&quot; and&#xD;
      sixty &quot;platinum-resistant&quot; 2nd-line or 3rd-line patients. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride 50 mg/m2 will be given by intravenous drip infusion on day 1. After this, a&#xD;
      27-day drug-free period will be followed as one cycle. At least two cycles will be given as&#xD;
      long as the patient does not meet the discontinuation criteria.&#xD;
