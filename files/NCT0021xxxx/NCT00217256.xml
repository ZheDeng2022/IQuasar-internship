      To demonstrate the equivalency in in-segment late lumen loss at 8 months between the Endeavor&#xD;
      Drug Eluting Coronary Stent System coated with ABT-578 (10 micrograms/mm) and the Cypher&#xD;

      The ENDEAVOR III Trial is a prospective, multi-center, single-blind, randomized trial that&#xD;
      enrolled 436 patients at 29 sites in the US. The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the&#xD;
      equivalency of in-segment late lumen loss at 8 months between the Endeavor stent and the&#xD;
      Cypher stent for the treatment of single de novo lesions in native coronary arteries 2.5-3.5&#xD;
      mm in diameter. Patients were randomized to receive the Endeavor stent or the Cypher&#xD;
      Sirolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System. Enrollment was completed in September 2004.&#xD;

          1. The patient is at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient must have clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease, stable or unstable&#xD;
             angina, silent ischemia, or a positive functional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient is an acceptable candidate for percutaneous transluminal coronary&#xD;
             angioplasty (PTCA), stenting, and emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within&#xD;
             seven (7) days before the procedure.&#xD;

             creatine kinase myocardial-band isoenzyme (CK-MB) elevated above the Institution's&#xD;
             upper limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. During the index procedure, the target lesion requires treatment with a device other&#xD;
             than PTCA prior to stent placement (such as, but not limited to, cutting balloon,&#xD;
             directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser, rotational atherectomy, thrombectomy,&#xD;
             etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack within the prior 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within the prior 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any previous or planned treatment of the target vessel with anti-restenotic therapies&#xD;
             including, but not limited to brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that has&#xD;
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current&#xD;
             study endpoints; or requires coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or&#xD;
