  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed primarily to establish efficacy and estimate resource utilization. The&#xD;
      short-term hypothesis is that the dose of capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice/day 5 days per week)&#xD;
      during the course of radiation therapy is efficacious in locally advanced, non-metastatic&#xD;
      rectosigmoid carcinoma and will improve resectability. The long-term working hypothesis is&#xD;
      that if 3-D CRT is combined with the potentiating and additive effect of capecitabine one&#xD;
      hopes to see improved and durable tumor response and survival with acceptable toxicity. In&#xD;
      addition, it is expected that the simplicity of using an oral agent (capecitabine) will be&#xD;
      associated with reduced cost and resource utilization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will all receive the combined treatment of 3-D external radiation therapy plus&#xD;
      Xeloda®. External Radiation Therapy to the pelvis, lower abdomen and rectal area will be&#xD;
      given once a day, five days a week, Monday through Friday, for about five to six weeks using&#xD;
      three dimensional techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xeloda® (oral chemotherapy) is a pill taken by mouth. This medication will be taken during&#xD;
      the course of radiation therapy on days that radiation treatments are given. Xeloda pills&#xD;
      will be taken twice daily beginning with the first day of radiation therapy treatments and&#xD;
      ending on the last day of radiation therapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures are part of regular medical treatment (standard care) for&#xD;
      the disease and are also required for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical examinations, sometimes including a digital rectal exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood tests including a (blood) pregnancy test will be done before starting treatment if&#xD;
           the patient is a woman able to have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG (heart tracing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ultrasound, which produces pictures of the rectal area using sound waves· CT scan of the&#xD;
           pelvis and abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people may need surgery, others may require more chemotherapy, and others may require no&#xD;
      additional treatment depending on how their tumor responded to the Xeloda® and radiation&#xD;
      therapy treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked to complete two questionnaires about their fatigue, general&#xD;
      quality of life, and bowel functioning.&#xD;
