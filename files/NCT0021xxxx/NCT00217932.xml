      Depakote has been used to treat seizures in children for more than 20 years. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the effectiveness of divalproex sodium (Depakote) in treating&#xD;
      children with temper outbursts and severe mood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last 12 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 250&#xD;
      mg Depakote or placebo. The dose of medication will increase at the end of Week 1 to 500 mg&#xD;
      of either depakote or placebo; participants will remain on this dose through Week 5. At Week&#xD;
      6, participants will cross-over and receive the other treatment (either depakote or placebo),&#xD;
      which they will take through Week 12. Study visits will occur weekly and will include a&#xD;
      physical exam, blood and urine tests, and self-reports of adverse events. In addition,&#xD;
      caregivers will complete reports about mood swings throughout the study.&#xD;
