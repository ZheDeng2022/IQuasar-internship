    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Perifoveal telangiectasia is a poorly understood disorder that involves the growth&#xD;
      of blood vessels around the center of the macula(perifoveal region). These blood vessels may&#xD;
      extrend beneath the retina to produce an area of sub-retinal neosvascularization(growth of&#xD;
      abnormal blood vessels under the retina which &quot;leak&quot; fluid, causing reduction in vision.&#xD;
      Limited forms of treatment are available in managing the neovascularization and its&#xD;
      consequences. Anecortave Acetate injection is considered as an attempt to control the growth&#xD;
      of the abnormal blood vessels.&#xD;

      In this open-label pilot study, an initial patient, which presented with IPT and SRN, was&#xD;
      treated with promising success and five additional patients were then recruited. So this is a&#xD;
      report on six eyes of the first six patients with this disease who presented in our practice.&#xD;
      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted our site permission to enroll these patients.&#xD;
      While anecortave acetate has not yet been approved by the FDA, it has been used in phase 2/3&#xD;
      trials for the treatment of AMD. An informed consent was obtained from each patient. IRB&#xD;
      approval was obtained from Manhattan Eye, Ear, and Throat Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients received a posterior juxtascleral injection of 15 mg of anecortave acetate delivered&#xD;
      adjacent to the macula using the specially designed curved cannula by Alcon, Inc. Visual&#xD;
      acuity (VA) and intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured on each study visit. Fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography was used to complement the standard clinical biomicroscopic examination of the&#xD;
      macula at baseline and at 3 months intervals. On the first day post-injection, patients had&#xD;
      an additional ophthalmic examination including VA testing, biomicroscopy, and IOP&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 6-month retreatment interval was established for this study based on laboratory data&#xD;
      demonstrating that anecortave acetate administered as a slow-release depot adjacent to the&#xD;
      posterior scleral surface provided therapeutic drug levels in the adjacent choroid and retina&#xD;
      for up to 6 months (9). If patients were clinically unstable or unimproved six months after&#xD;
      enrollment, they were offered thermal laser treatment or photodynamic therapy (PDT) in&#xD;
      conjunction with the anecortave acetate injection. Patients who were unstable as early as 3&#xD;
      months after enrollment were offered the option to be treated with either thermal laser or&#xD;
      PDT. This did not disqualify them from being eligible for the repeat anecortave acetate&#xD;
      injection at month 6.&#xD;
