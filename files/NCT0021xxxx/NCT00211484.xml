  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A compassionate method of treatment is offered to patients where lesions do not meet&#xD;
      acceptable criteria for standard therapy. Visudyne (Photodynamic Therapy) and laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation treatment (a treatment using heat from a fine point laser beam) have not&#xD;
      been found to be effective in treating the lesions these patients have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anecortave acetate is an experimental drug that is being tested to prevent the growth of&#xD;
      blood vessels under the retina in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).&#xD;

      Patients will receive a sub-Tenon injection of 15mg of Anecortave acetate in their study eye&#xD;
      with the use of a counter pressure device. Patients will then be followed for up to 24&#xD;
      months. The patients will have the option of extending their participation in the study for&#xD;
      an additional 24 months. Statistical analysis will include comparison of patient follow-up&#xD;
      visual acuity and angiographic data.&#xD;
