  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This hypertension project is evaluating strategies developed to target problems underlying&#xD;
      lack of blood pressure control among treated but uncontrolled hypertensive patients in East&#xD;
      and Central Harlem.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypertension project will tailor improvement strategies to the problems identified as&#xD;
      underlying underuse among treated but uncontrolled hypertensive patients in East and Central&#xD;
      Harlem, New York City. Along with the communities' 6 major health providers, we will first&#xD;
      combine qualitative and quantitative methods to identify specific patient, provider, and&#xD;
      system problems, and customize interventions to address them. In a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial, we will then randomly assign 480 patients among 4 arms: nurse management, blood&#xD;
      pressure monitors alone, usual care, and peer led chronic disease self-management course.&#xD;
      During the 18-month trial, patients self-monitor their blood pressure or attend a&#xD;
      self-management course, or nurse managers will assess patients' needs, counsel them, address&#xD;
      any access barriers, and follow up with regular telephone contacts; convey information,&#xD;
      including blood pressures from patients' self-monitoring, between patients and physicians to&#xD;
      inform possible medication changes; and ameliorate any systems problems. We will assess&#xD;
      differences in blood pressure reductions among the 4 arms as the primary outcome, and in&#xD;
      quality of life, patient satisfaction, costs, and cost-effectiveness as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      The findings will provide new knowledge about the relationship between these changes and&#xD;
      patient and clinician knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. The educational course is designed&#xD;
      to teach patients tools for managing their chronic illness which will empower them to improve&#xD;
      their overall health and is specifically tailored for patients living with asymptomatic&#xD;
      chronic illnesses and will emphasize communication with health care providers. In partnership&#xD;
      with community organizations and the policymakers, we will disseminate successful findings&#xD;
      within these communities and throughout the state and the nation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male and female, English or Spanish speaking African American and/or Hispanic patients with&#xD;
        uncontrolled hypertension who have been seen in either the Cardiology clinic, Internal&#xD;
        Medicine Associates (IMA) or Geriatric clinic at least twice in a given year at least 18&#xD;
        years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study is about hypertension control among African Americans and Hispanics, these are&#xD;
        the ethnic groups with disparities in CVD that we want to improve so other races are&#xD;
        excluded. The study is for adults with hypertension; therefore, we are excluding anyone who&#xD;
        is under 18 years of age.&#xD;
