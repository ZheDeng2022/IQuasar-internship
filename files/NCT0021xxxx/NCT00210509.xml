      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of almotriptan malate&#xD;
      (AXERT®) 12.5 milligram tablets compared with placebo for the acute treatment of migraine&#xD;
      headache at the earliest onset of headache pain. Almotriptan malate (AXERT®) is approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of migraine headache, with or without aura, in adults. Patients in this study&#xD;
      will take either almotriptan or placebo oral tablets for 3 consecutive migraine headaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almotriptan malate (AXERT®) is approved for the treatment of migraine headache, with or&#xD;
      without aura, in adults. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group study of adult patients with a diagnosis of migraine headache, with or without&#xD;
      aura. Patients will be randomized (like with the toss of a coin) to receive almotriptan&#xD;
      malate (AXERT®) or placebo for the treatment of 3 consecutive qualifying migraine headaches.&#xD;
      After screening, patients will leave the study center with blinded study medication and an&#xD;
      electronic subject diary (Personal Digital Assistant [PDA]). Patients will self-dose with&#xD;
      study medication as soon as headache pain of any intensity begins (that resembles their usual&#xD;
      migraine), but no later than 1 hour after headache pain begins. Patients will use their PDAs&#xD;
      to record assessments such as pain intensity, symptom severity and ability to function as&#xD;
      related to the headaches. The primary hypothesis of this study is that the percentage of&#xD;
      patients who are pain free two hours after taking study drug at the earliest onset of&#xD;
      headache pain is greater in the almotriptan malate (AXERT®) 12.5mg group than in the placebo&#xD;
      group and almotriptan malate (AXERT®) is generally well-tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almotriptan malate (AXERT®) 12.5 milligrams or placebo tablets, one by mouth at the beginning&#xD;
      of migraine pain (within 1 hour) for 3 consecutive migraine headaches&#xD;
