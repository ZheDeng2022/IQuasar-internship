      The purpose of this study is to examine inflammatory processes in the airway of moderate to&#xD;
      severe persistent asthmatics who have persistent bronchial hyperreactivity despite chronic&#xD;
      administration of inhaled glucocorticoids.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Inhaled Glucocorticoid Withdrawal Protocol will investigate abnormalities in the&#xD;
      asthmatic airway that occur in the setting of a &quot;natural&quot; endogenous exacerbation. It is&#xD;
      known that chronic treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids causes a nearly complete&#xD;
      disappearance of inflammatory cells from the airway and improvement in bronchial&#xD;
      hyperreactivity, yet such patients have persistent bronchial hyperreactivity. Withdrawal of&#xD;
      inhaled glucocorticoids causes a worsening of bronchial hyperreactivity. These observations&#xD;
      suggest that a chronic derangement in the asthmatic airway might exist, which is unmasked by&#xD;
      withdrawal of inhaled glucocorticoids and which reinitiates the inflammatory process. These&#xD;
      &quot;persistent&quot; abnormalities in the asthmatic airway may be seen during quiescent stages of&#xD;
      chronic asthma even when airway inflammatory changes are not evident. The abnormalities may&#xD;
      be seen during the period of treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids or they may appear as one&#xD;
      of the first signs after the withdrawal of inhaled glucocorticoids, thereby initiating the&#xD;
      recurrence of asthma and promoting inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine inflammatory processes in the airway of moderate to&#xD;
      severe persistent asthmatics who have persistent bronchial hyperreactivity despite chronic&#xD;
      administration of inhaled glucocorticoids. Each participant will undergo bronchoscopic&#xD;
      procedures and have assessment of bronchial hyperreactivity at the following two time points:&#xD;
      1) during treatment with inhaled fluticasone; and 2) after acute withdrawal of inhaled&#xD;
      fluticasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the change in CD3 positive T cells in the airway&#xD;
      submucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key secondary outcomes are as follows: 1) other inflammatory cell markers in the airway&#xD;
      (e.g., CD4, CD8, CD68, CD45, EG2/MBP, tryptase, and neutrophil elastase); 2) RANTES&#xD;
      (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted) expression in airway; 3) FEV1 peak&#xD;
      expiratory flows; 4) methacholine PC20; and 5) asthma symptom score.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptoms of asthma as defined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) definition. This&#xD;
             includes the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. history of episodic shortness of breath (with or without associated wheezing) in&#xD;
                  association with reversible obstructive airways disease with at least a 20%&#xD;
                  decrement in FEV1 and FVC (from predicted values) that is documented at some time&#xD;
                  point by pulmonary function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. an improvement in expiratory flow rates of at least 15% of predicted values after&#xD;
                  inhalation of a beta-2 selective bronchodilator medication or other previous&#xD;
                  treatment (e.g. corticosteroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis may also be confirmed by an abnormal bronchospastic response to&#xD;
             methacholine or exercise as described by Cherniak&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FEV1 greater than or equal to 70% of predicted value at time of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular use of inhaled corticosteroids at time of study entry (at least 400 mcg of&#xD;
             Beclomethasone or equivalent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of severe asthma requiring intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any cardiopulmonary or neurologic abnormality with which the risk of performing the&#xD;

             test within 2 weeks or are practicing adequate contraception)&#xD;
