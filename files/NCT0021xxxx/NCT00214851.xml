      An open labelled trial of Kineret (anakinra) induction therapy (100mg./day) in over a four&#xD;
      week period in the treatment of Familial Cold Urticaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familial Cold Urticaria (FCU) is a rare autosomal dominant condition manifesting symptoms&#xD;
      triggered by exposure to cold and variable in expression. Currently there is no standard&#xD;
      reliable agent available for the treatment of patients with FCU.This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of Kineret (anakinra), an interleukin 1 receptor antagonist in induction and&#xD;
      maintenance therapy in patients with FCU.&#xD;

      Product: Kineret (anakinra) Protocol title: The Use of Kineret (anakinra) in the Treatment of&#xD;
      Familial Cold Urticaria (FCU) Target Disease: Familial Cold Urticaria Patients: 8 patients&#xD;
      all previously diagnosed with FCU and living close to Moncton, N.B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of Kineret (anakinra) 100mg. given subcutaneously daily in&#xD;
           subjects with FCU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate the use of CRP and SAA as objective laboratory markers of the&#xD;
           effectiveness of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect of Kineret (anakinra)on the quality of life of patients with&#xD;
           FCU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: An open-labelled trial of Kineret (anakinra) induction therapy (100mg./day)&#xD;
      over a four week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimens: After initial clinical and laboratory assessment, the patients will&#xD;
      receive Kineret (anakinra) 100mg. daily for four weeks. They will be observed for two further&#xD;
      weeks without the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Route of administration: Subcutaneous injection Interval between first and last dose of&#xD;
      active study agent: 4 weeks Duration of study participation: 8 weeks Number of subjects: 8&#xD;
      Number of sites: 1 Interim analysis: Daily patient diary; weekly follow-up phone calls; CRP&#xD;
      reports&#xD;
