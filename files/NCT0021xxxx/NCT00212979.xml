  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for permanent kidney failure. Following&#xD;
      transplantation, the kidney function must be followed closely to detect problems so that&#xD;
      investigations and appropriate treatment can be started early. Currently, function is&#xD;
      monitored with the use of serum creatinine. In clinical trials involving kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients, markers of kidney function, such as serum creatinine, are increasingly being used&#xD;
      as outcomes to evaluate new treatments. However, serum creatinine is not very accurate or&#xD;
      sensitive at detecting change in kidney transplant function. Newer methods of evaluating&#xD;
      kidney function, such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation and&#xD;
      cystatin C, are known to be accurate markers of function in patients with non-transplant&#xD;
      kidney disease. This study will compare the MDRD estimate and cystatin C estimate of kidney&#xD;
      function with an accepted method (radioisotope clearance study) of measuring true kidney&#xD;
      function in 250 renal transplant patients. Each patient will have 2 measurements made at&#xD;
      least 3 months apart to determine the accuracy and responsiveness to change over time for the&#xD;
      MDRD equation and cystatin C. If the results demonstrate that these new methods are accurate&#xD;
      then clinical care and research studies involving transplant patients will be greatly&#xD;
      enhanced. Patients and physicians would have a simple test that could detect problems earlier&#xD;
      and more precisely monitor response to treatment leading to improved outcomes for renal&#xD;
      transplant recipients.&#xD;

      Background and Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term outcomes in renal transplantation, such as the acute rejection rate, have improved&#xD;
      dramatically over the past decade. Unfortunately, this success has made it more difficult to&#xD;
      evaluate new therapies in kidney transplantation. Markers of kidney function, such as serum&#xD;
      creatinine and creatinine clearance, are now being used to evaluate kidney transplant&#xD;
      function. However, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance have many limitations and&#xD;
      correlate poorly with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The Modification of Diet in Renal&#xD;
      Disease (MDRD) formula has been shown to be very accurate at predicting GFR in patients with&#xD;
      kidney disease who don't have renal transplants. Cystatin C, a novel marker of renal&#xD;
      function, has also been shown to be accurate in transplant and non-transplant patients.&#xD;
      However, the MDRD formula and cystatin C have not been properly validated in a large sample&#xD;
      of renal transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if the MDRD formula accurately predicts&#xD;
      GFR in renal transplant recipients. Secondary objectives of the study will determine whether:&#xD;
      the MDRD formula is responsive to change in GFR over time, cystatin C accurately predicts&#xD;
      GFR, or the MDRD formula is more accurate than other estimating equations in renal transplant&#xD;
      recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective cohort design will be used. Eligible adult renal transplant recipients at least&#xD;
      3 months post-transplantation will have serum creatinine, albumin, urea, cystatin C, 24-hour&#xD;
      urine excretion of urea, 24-hour urine excretion of creatinine, 24-hour urine excretion of&#xD;
      protein and GFR measured at study entry and at least 3 months later. GFR will be measured&#xD;
      using 99Tc-DTPA. Estimates of the GFR will be made with the MDRD equation and other&#xD;
      estimating equations. Renal function will also be assessed by measuring the urinary&#xD;
      creatinine clearance and the combined urea and creatinine clearance. The primary analysis&#xD;
      will determine the accuracy (proportion of GFR estimates that lie within 30% of measured GFR)&#xD;
      of the MDRD equation. Secondary analyses will be performed to determine the bias (mean&#xD;
      difference between the measured GFR and estimated GFR) and precision (standard deviation of&#xD;
      the difference between the measured and estimated GFR) of the MDRD equation as well as the&#xD;
      bias and precision of the change in GFR over twelve months. Similar analyses will be&#xD;
      performed for cystatin C and other estimating equations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods to accurately measure GFR are needed for both clinical care and research studies&#xD;
      involving renal transplant recipients. As new therapies and immunosuppressive strategies&#xD;
      become available, a simple and accurate means (such as the MDRD equation) to assess response&#xD;
      to therapy will be invaluable. Markers of kidney function (serum creatinine, predicted GFR)&#xD;
      are already being used in clinical trials involving renal transplant recipients without&#xD;
      appropriate evaluation. The proper validation of equations to predict GFR in transplant&#xD;
      recipients must be carried before they can be widely accepted in practice or for use in&#xD;
      research protocols. If this study shows that the MDRD equation (or other marker of kidney&#xD;
      function) is accurate in transplant patients then we can confidently move forward and use&#xD;
      these validated measures of GFR in patient care and future research studies.&#xD;
