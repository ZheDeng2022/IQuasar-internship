  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women typically have a more difficult time quitting smoking than men. Little research has&#xD;
      been done to understand the differences between men and women that may cause this&#xD;
      distinction. This study will assess whether the reduced effectiveness of nicotine replacement&#xD;
      therapy in women is caused by gender differences in the withdrawal suppression induced by&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy.&#xD;

      Smoking can cause a variety of cancers, cardiovascular disorders, and other health problems.&#xD;
      Quitting smoking greatly decreases one's risk for these problems. Studies have shown,&#xD;
      however, that quitting smoking is more difficult for women than men. Despite that knowledge,&#xD;
      little research has been done to try to understand the mechanistic differences between men&#xD;
      and women that may cause this distinction. This study will assess whether the reduced&#xD;
      effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy in women is caused by physical and&#xD;
      psychological gender differences in the withdrawal suppression induced by nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this double-blind study will attend 4 treatment sessions, each approximately&#xD;
      6.5 hours long and each corresponding to one of four transdermal nicotine replacement patch&#xD;
      doses (0, 7, 21, or 42 mg). Sessions will be separated by at least 48 hours to avoid&#xD;
      carryover effects. Immediately following arrival at each session, participants' expired air&#xD;
      carbon monoxide (CO) levels will be measured to verify that the participant has not smoked&#xD;
      for at least 8 hours prior to the visit. If the CO level meets the necessary criteria to&#xD;
      proceed, a baseline blood sample will be obtained, followed by additional blood samples every&#xD;
      30 minutes. Baseline nicotine withdrawal levels will be assessed using questionnaires.&#xD;
      Computerized recordings of physiological responses will also commence and will continue&#xD;
      throughout the session. These response measures will include heart rate, percent oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, skin temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure. Upon completion of baseline measures, participants will receive a randomly assigned&#xD;
      dose of nicotine replacement therapy, in the form of three patches placed on the&#xD;
      participants' back. The patches will be removed after 6 hours and the participant will be&#xD;
      assessed for any residual effects from the medication.&#xD;
