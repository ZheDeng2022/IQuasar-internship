      The purpose of this study is to determine the smallest dose of Sprinkles, a single-serving&#xD;
      package of iron and other micronutrients, to treat infants with iron deficiency anemia in&#xD;
      India. Results have implications for programs using Sprinkles worldwide because lower doses&#xD;
      of iron may have fewer side effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anemia affects two thirds of children in most developing nations, and even&#xD;
      mild anemia can have serious implications for child development. In India, government&#xD;
      programs within India have been ineffective in controlling this public health problem due to&#xD;
      the lack of effective iron supplements reaching children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research group developed 'Sprinkles', an inexpensive micronutrient supplement which is a&#xD;
      single-serve sachet of tasteless powder that contain encapsulated iron and other&#xD;
      micronutrients. Parents can be easily instructed to mix the contents of one sachet into a&#xD;
      bowl of any complementary food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of a partnership and capacity development between interdisciplinary&#xD;
      research groups at The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Canada and the King&#xD;
      Edward Memorial Hospital in India, aimed at developing a long-term program of research that&#xD;
      will address iron deficiency anemia among infants and young children in India. For Sprinkles&#xD;
      to be implemented into national programs in India, a comprehensive strategy is needed which&#xD;
      includes a single, safe and effective iron dose for the Indian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This specific study is to conduct a community-based, randomized clinical trial in India to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate dose of supplementation required for the target age group.&#xD;
