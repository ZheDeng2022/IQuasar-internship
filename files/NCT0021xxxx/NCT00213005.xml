    <textblock>
      The study objectives were to assess the mucosal safety of Carraguard® gel when applied&#xD;
      vaginally once per day for 14 days by sexually abstinent and sexually active, HIV-positive&#xD;
      women; to evaluate the effect of Carraguard® gel on the vaginal flora in these women; to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of Carraguard® gel on shedding of HIV-1 in the genital tract of these&#xD;
      women; to evaluate the safety of Carraguard® gel when applied directly to the penis once per&#xD;
      day for 7 days by sexually abstinent, HIV-positive men; to assess whether symptoms reported&#xD;
      by female and male participants during the study may be related to the use of Carraguard®&#xD;
      gel; and to examine dimensions of the acceptability of, and compliance with, the study and&#xD;
      placebo products.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We proposed a safety study of the Council's lead candidate microbicide, Carraguard® in three&#xD;
      cohorts in Durban, South Africa: sexually abstinent HIV-positive women, sexually abstinent&#xD;
      HIV-positive men, and sexually active HIV-positive women. Sexually active women must be in an&#xD;
      HIV-positive seroconcordant relationship (confirmed by HIV testing of the woman and her male&#xD;
      partner) and written informed consent was obtained from the male partners. Women and men in&#xD;
      each cohort were randomized to one of three study groups: Carraguard® gel, its matching&#xD;
      placebo methyl-cellulose gel, or no product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study were to investigate changes in the vulvar, vaginal, and&#xD;
      cervical epithelia, the vaginal flora, and HIV-1 shedding in the genital tract of female&#xD;
      participants, and changes of the penile skin and epithelia of male participants. We also&#xD;
      evaluated symptoms reported by participants, and several dimensions of the acceptability of&#xD;
      and compliance with the study or placebo gel. Reactions to a non-contraceptive microbicide&#xD;
      were assessed, as well as reasons for voluntary discontinuation and non-use of Carraguard® or&#xD;
      the placebo (determined by review of daily diary) was recorded. Exit focus group discussions&#xD;
      were held with male and female participants to discuss aspects of acceptability and&#xD;
      compliance. Self-reported symptoms were also investigated by clinical examination as needed&#xD;
      and study endpoints included genital itching or burning, frequent urination, burning while&#xD;
      urinating, genital pain, pain during sex, and abnormal vaginal or penile discharge.&#xD;
