  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Bipolar Disorder Center for Pennsylvanians aims to reduce significant differences in&#xD;
      treatment results among Pennsylvanians with bipolar disorder, especially among youth, the&#xD;
      elderly, rural residents, and African Americans who are less likely to receive adequate&#xD;
      treatment, less likely to remain in treatment once identified, and less likely to have&#xD;
      positive results if they remain in treatment. Half of the subjects receive either Guideline&#xD;
      Intervention (GI) or Enhanced Clinical Intervention (ECI). ECI is a combination of&#xD;
      information and support, such as education about bipolar disorder, the medications used to&#xD;
      treat it, information about sleep practices and habits that affect quality of sleep, review&#xD;
      of symptoms, medication side effects, and coping with side effects. It is predicted that&#xD;
      Enhanced Clinical Intervention will be more effective in reducing the differences in results&#xD;
      between those most at risk compared to mid-life Caucasians. The treatment study occurs at&#xD;
      three sites across Pennsylvania and has emphasized the recruitment of African Americans,&#xD;
      youth (ages 12 through 18), and adults over age 65.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is one of the world's most disabling conditions, robbing sufferers of years&#xD;
      of healthy functioning. The presence of bipolar disorder is not limited to any nation, race,&#xD;
      age, gender, or socioeconomic status, and has a lifetime prevalence of 1% across all&#xD;
      populations. While there do not appear to be disparities in who is at risk for bipolar&#xD;
      disorder, there are marked disparities in who is likely to be diagnosed and treated. The&#xD;
      average person with bipolar disorder waits ten years before receiving the correct diagnosis&#xD;
      (National Depression and Manic-Depression Association, 2000). Once a diagnosis of bipolar&#xD;
      disorder is made, there are equally marked disparities in treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also known as manic-depressive illness, bipolar disorder is a recurrent and chronic mental&#xD;
      condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The stigma associated with&#xD;
      open recognition of this disorder decreases the likelihood of accurate diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment. Considering the impact of this disorder on the most vulnerable populations (youth,&#xD;
      elderly, rural populations, and minorities), the challenge is to understand and reverse the&#xD;
      current public health crisis. This crisis has created an enormous financial burden on the&#xD;
      health, welfare, and disability systems. At the same time, it reduces the likelihood of&#xD;
      economic and social productivity that can be achieved by potentially productive individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to test an intervention to reduce health disparities&#xD;
      related to bipolar disorder, a vastly more destructive and difficult to treat condition than&#xD;
      previously realized. The outcomes of interest include accurate and timely diagnosis, adequacy&#xD;
      of prescribed treatment, retention in treatment, suicidality, and a range of treatment&#xD;
      benefits including health-related quality of life, employment, treatment satisfaction,&#xD;
      medication adherence, utilization of lower levels of intervention (e.g., outpatients versus&#xD;
      partial or inpatient care), and reduction of substance use, medical morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Particular attention has been paid to the collection of service utilization data to track key&#xD;
      health care and social services. Costs for medical and psychiatric treatment, medications,&#xD;
      inpatient, rehabilitation, and emergency room services are being ascertained for cost&#xD;
      assessment, and patients' mood functioning is being tracked to assess the overall&#xD;
      effectiveness of the interventions. The study is also using state-of-the-art assessments of&#xD;
      phenotypic clinical variables to develop clinically meaningful predictors of treatment&#xD;
      response across the age spectrum and across diverse racial groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize more precisely the phenotypic complexity of this disorder, we have developed&#xD;
      a spectrum model of psychiatric illness using a broader conceptualization of mood disorders&#xD;
      and an integrated view of common comorbidities, anchored in the Mood and Anxiety Spectrum&#xD;
      Assessments (Cassano et al. 1997; Cassano et al in press). This refined description of&#xD;
      patient variability (or phenotypes) should lead to improved understanding of the variability&#xD;
      in treatment outcomes among patients suffering from bipolar disorder and eventually to&#xD;
      creating appropriate first-line treatments for patients who present with specific clinical&#xD;
      phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Careful consideration of biological phenotypes, as represented in population&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, turns a second line of attack on the problem of tailoring treatments to&#xD;
      patients' specific needs. A key correlate of treatment response that has never been examined&#xD;
      in bipolar disorder is consistent and adequate medication exposure. Essential to&#xD;
      understanding variability in treatment response is being able to distinguish true&#xD;
      non-responders from those who never received adequate exposure to drug. Consistency of drug&#xD;
      exposure can be determined using a combination of electronic monitoring of drug-taking and&#xD;
      population pharmacokinetic analysis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to give basic informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meets DSM-IV Criteria for Bipolar I, Bipolar II (if in the investigator's judgment&#xD;
             long term treatment with a mood stabilizer is indicated), Bipolar NOS, or&#xD;
             Schizoaffective Bipolar subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because many adolescents have shorter periods of mania or hypomania than those&#xD;
             required by the DSM-IV (at least 4 days for hypomania and 7 days for mania)&#xD;
             adolescents are included who have a current episode of MDD and a history of episodes&#xD;
             mania/hypomania that lasted for at least 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements (e.g., complete study forms,&#xD;
             attend scheduled evaluations).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not competent to provide informed consent in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mental retardation (IQ less than 70). Subjects suspected of mental retardation (e.g.,&#xD;
             chronic academic failure, multiple developmental delays) are evaluated using the&#xD;
             Verbal Subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of schizophrenia, schizoaffective pervasive developmental disorder, current&#xD;
             substance or alcohol dependence, and organic mental disorder. Substance dependence in&#xD;
             early remission is not an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable medical illness or other medical contraindication to treatment with mood&#xD;
             stabilizers, antidepressants or antipsychotic medications.&#xD;
