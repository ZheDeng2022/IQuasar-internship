  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the influence of celecoxib on relapse-free survival in&#xD;
      completely resected patients with poor prognosis indicated by metastatic involvement of&#xD;
      intrapulmonary/hilar (pN1) or ipsilateral mediastinal (pN2) lymph nodes. Celecoxib, a&#xD;
      selective oral COX-2 inhibitor, was found to exert significant anti-proliferative activity&#xD;
      against a variety of tumor cell lines in vitro, including NSCLC. COX-2 is frequently&#xD;
      up-regulated in NSCLC cell lines and archival tumor samples. Its high expression was also&#xD;
      correlated with poor prognosis of the patients. A clinical trial addressing the role of&#xD;
      celecoxib as adjuvant treatment in radically operated patients with high risk of relapse is&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;

      1. Rationale and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           To assess the influence of celecoxib on relapse-free survival in completely resected&#xD;
           patients with poor prognosis indicated by metastatic involvement of intrapulmonary/hilar&#xD;
           (pN1) or ipsilateral mediastinal (pN2) lymph nodes. Celecoxib, a selective oral COX-2&#xD;
           inhibitor, was found to exert significant anti-proliferative activity against a variety&#xD;
           of tumor cell lines in vitro, including NSCLC. COX-2 is frequently up-regulated in NSCLC&#xD;
           cell lines and archival tumor samples. Its high expression was also correlated with poor&#xD;
           prognosis of the patients. Proposed mechanisms of action of selective COX-2 inhibitors&#xD;
           include inhibition of angiogenesis, inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression&#xD;
           and induction of apoptosis. A clinical trial addressing the role of celecoxib as&#xD;
           adjuvant treatment in radically operated patients with high risk of relapse is&#xD;
           warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           A multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled phase III&#xD;
           clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary endpoint will be relapse-free survival (time to local or distant relapse)&#xD;
           during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Other endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary end-points will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  overall survival (time to death of any cause)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the safety of the long-term administration of celecoxib&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective, i.e. relapse-free survival (RFS), will be recorded as time from&#xD;
           randomization to date of local or distant relapse (date of radiological imaging&#xD;
           demonstrating relapse or date of histological confirmation of relapse or date of relapse&#xD;
           on clinical examination, if above data are not available) or death of any cause,&#xD;
           whichever occurs first. Patients alive without relapse at the end of their follow-up&#xD;
           will be considered censored observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study aims at the verification of the null hypothesis Ho : RFS in the control group&#xD;
           = RFS in the treated group vs. the alternative HA : RFS in the control group ≠RFS in the&#xD;
           treated group Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be performed using&#xD;
           intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The distribution of RFS and OS in the compared treatment arms will be summarized&#xD;
           graphically using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. The result&#xD;
           of the test will be assessed using the 5% significance level (two-sided).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The effect of the treatment on the distribution of RFS and OS will be evaluated by the&#xD;
           score test based on the Cox proportional hazards model, which will include&#xD;
           stratification and other relevant clinical factors as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proportion of patients experiencing any AE, any serious AE, and specific types of&#xD;
           AEs and proportion of withdrawals will be compared between the treatment arms using the&#xD;
           chi-square test at the 5% significance level (two-sided).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Translational research A research project evaluating immunohistochemical expression of&#xD;
           COX-2, VEGF and CD34 as a marker of vascular density will be performed. These parameters&#xD;
           will be analyzed in a central laboratory by two independent pathologists involved in&#xD;
           angiogenesis research. Immunohistochemical methods will be carefully validated before&#xD;
           commencement of translational research part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study centers will be requested to provide post-operative tissue samples&#xD;
           (paraffin-embedded blocks or 5 unstained slides) from the primary tumor.&#xD;
