  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the pain-relieving effects and safety of Tramadol&#xD;
      HCl/acetaminophen as compared to placebo in patients experiencing acute low back pain.&#xD;
      Tramadol HCl/acetaminophen is approved for short-term management of acute pain. The&#xD;
      combination of tramadol HCl/acetaminophen has been shown to be effective for the treatment of&#xD;
      acute musculoskeletal pain. Patients who experienced at least moderate acute low back pain&#xD;
      for 2 to 10 days before study entry will be randomized to receive either tramadol&#xD;
      HCl/acetaminophen or placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tramadol HCl/acetaminophen is approved for short-term (five days or less) management of acute&#xD;
      pain. The combination of tramadol HCl/acetaminophen has been shown to be effective for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute musculoskeletal pain. The current study is a multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Patients with acute low back pain for&#xD;
      2 to 10 days before study entry will be enrolled. At the screening visit, patients will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires about their level of pain and disability. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      (like the toss of a coin) to receive either tramadol HCl/acetaminophen or placebo. Patients&#xD;
      will take 2 tablets of study medication every 4 to 6 hours as needed for low back pain, but&#xD;
      not more than 8 tablets per 24-hour period. Patients will call the Interactive Voice Response&#xD;
      (IVR) system to complete a pain assessment prior to taking the first dose of study&#xD;
      medication. Also starting on Day 1, patients will call the IVR system every night at bedtime&#xD;
      for the remainder of the study, to complete assessments related to the following: low back&#xD;
      pain and pain relief in the last 24 hours, current pain, pain interference with sleep and the&#xD;
      number of study medication tablets and doses taken that day. The objective of this study is&#xD;
      to compare the effectiveness and safety of tramadol HCl/acetaminophen versus placebo for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 tramadol/acetaminophen 37.5/325 milligram oral tablets or 2 placebo tablets every 4 to 6&#xD;
      hours as needed for low back pain, but no more than 8 tablets per day, for 5 days, or until&#xD;
      there is no further need for pain medication&#xD;
