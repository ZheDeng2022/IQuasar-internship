  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate that dapoxetine can prolong intravaginal&#xD;
      ejaculatory latency time (IELT) compared with placebo in men with premature ejaculation (PE).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One form of male sexual dysfunction is premature ejaculation (PE), which is also referred to&#xD;
      as rapid ejaculation (RE). An objective measurement of PE in clinical studies is the&#xD;
      intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT). This is a randomized, double-blind study in men&#xD;
      with PE. The study consists of 2 phases: pre-randomization phase (a screening visit and a&#xD;
      2-week baseline period); 12-week double-blind treatment phase during which patients will&#xD;
      receive dapoxetine at one of two dosages, or placebo, for use on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis. The&#xD;
      total duration of the study is approximately 14 weeks. Patients and their partners are&#xD;
      expected to attempt sexual intercourse at least 4 times during the baseline period and at&#xD;
      least 6 times each month during the treatment phase. Assessments of effectiveness include the&#xD;
      average Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency time (IELT), as measured by stopwatch, during sexual&#xD;
      intercourse for the treatment period (12 weeks); control over ejaculation, satisfaction with&#xD;
      sexual intercourse, and severity of symptoms, based on questions asked at monthly intervals&#xD;
      through the treatment phase. Safety assessments include the incidence, severity, and type of&#xD;
      adverse events throughout treatment (12 weeks), vital sign measurements (pulse and blood&#xD;
      pressure) and laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis) at monthly intervals. The&#xD;
      study hypothesis is that treatment for 12 weeks with dapoxetine prolongs intravaginal&#xD;
      ejaculatory latency time, compared with placebo, in men with PE. Oral tablets of dapoxetine&#xD;
      (30 milligrams[mg] or 60mg) taken as needed during 12 weeks of treatment. No more than one&#xD;
      dose within a 24-hour period.&#xD;
