      Use an electrical-inhibition (EI)/uterine pacemaker device similar to an electrical heart&#xD;
      pacemaker to deliver a weak electrical current to the human uterus that will rapidly and&#xD;
      safely inhibit the unwanted premature uterine contractions of preterm birth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The preterm birth rate in the United states has been stubbornly stuck at 10.5% or higher&#xD;
      since the 1950's. The 2011 rate, 11.72%, is the most recent level available. That comes to&#xD;
      about a half a million preterm births per year in the United States alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature birth and the attendant complications are among the greatest health problems in the&#xD;
      world today and contribute to about 85% of all neonatal deaths, that is, deaths of infants&#xD;
      from the time of birth until1 month old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past ten years, there has been developed a novel method to effectively and&#xD;
      objectively inhibit uterine contractility during the birthing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method is nonpharmaceutical, and thus, avoids systemic side effects and has the potential&#xD;
      to be noninvasive and easy to master.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method uses an electrical intervention (EI)/uterine pacemaker device that will allow for&#xD;
      rapid and reversible inhibition of preterm uterine contractions and preterm birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is a brief account of the electrical properties of the myometrium and why these&#xD;
      properties may be affected by electrical intervention (EI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contractile activity of the uterus is a direct consequence of the underlying electrical&#xD;
      activity in the myometrial cells. The sequence of contraction and relaxation of the&#xD;
      myometrium results from the cyclic depolarization and repolarization of the membranes of the&#xD;
      muscle cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uterus at term has been shown to be myogenic just like the heart. The uterus will&#xD;
      contract spontaneously without neuronal control, like the heart, and form gap junctions&#xD;
      interconnecting the cells just like the syncytium of the heart. Also, both are excitable&#xD;
      tissues with similar current flows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical Intervention (EI) has successfully inhibited myometrial or uterine contractions in&#xD;
      many different species e.g. sheep, rabbit, rat, and human (in vitro). The EI was effective in&#xD;
      live animals when used on the uterus either directly attached or transvaginally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electrical pacemaker (Inch Inc., Brooklyn, NY) used in this work is a self-contained&#xD;
      portable device with integrated circuits, housed in a box about eight inches on all sides. EI&#xD;
      is delivered as 10-second bursts of bipolar, constant-current, square-wave pulses in 20% duty&#xD;
      cycles. A 20% duty cycle consists of a pulse of current at the given amperage lasting 20% of&#xD;
      the cycle, followed by a period without current for the remaining 80% of the cycle. The&#xD;
      number of cycles per second defines the frequency in Hertz (Hz). Because the duty cycle is&#xD;
      constant at 20%, a 10-second burst always delivers current for a total of 2 seconds, with the&#xD;
      frequency determining the length and number of individual pulses, in milliseconds (msec),&#xD;
      during the burst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were enrolled beginning in February 2005. IRB approval was in place at New York&#xD;
      Downtown Hospital, Manhattan, NY, from inception until March 2013, when it ceased to be a&#xD;
      study site. During the study period at Downtown Hospital, 3 participants overall were&#xD;
      enrolled and studied. St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center, Manhattan, NY, became a study&#xD;
      site when it received IRB approval in January 2010 and at present is the only study site, and&#xD;
      has continuing IRB approval. While under IRB approval, 5 patients have been enrolled and&#xD;
      studied at St. Luke's and Roosevelt. Each participant has given written informed consent. To&#xD;
      date, 53 women have been recruited overall, and 8 have given informed consent and been&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those studied are females 18 years old or older, between 24-34 weeks gestation, have a&#xD;
      reassuring fetal heart rate (FHR) tracing, and in preterm labor as defined by the American&#xD;
      College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG). The participants must have persistent uterine&#xD;
      contractions, with 4 every 20 minutes or 8 every 60 minutes, and any one or more of the&#xD;
      following: documented cervical change, &gt; 1 cm cervical dilation, or &gt; 80% cervical&#xD;
      effacement. The exclusion criteria are the same as for most tocolytic therapy; most&#xD;
      importantly, premature rupture of the membranes (PROM), and additionally, severe&#xD;
      preeclampsia, severe abruption placenta, chorioamnionitis, fetal death, fetal anomaly&#xD;
      incompatible with life, severe fetal growth restriction or estimated fetal weight (EFW) &lt;5%,&#xD;
      mature fetal lung studies, maternal cardiac arrhythmias, a permanent cardiac pacemaker, a&#xD;
      fetal cardiac arrhythmia, or any other contraindication for tocolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women have a pacemaker electrode placed vaginally. A 5 (1.67mm) or 6 (2.00mm) French&#xD;
      electrode catheter with distal 4x2mm platinum alloy rings 5mm apart (C. R. Bard, Inc.,&#xD;
      Lowell, MA, USA) is manually placed into the posterior vaginal fornix next to the external&#xD;
      cervical os. The catheter's proximal end is taped to the patient's thigh and its connecting&#xD;
      cable attached to the pacemaker, which can generate a weak bipolar electrical current (0-20&#xD;
      mA, 0-50 msec/pulse, 50 Hz). In the study, the EI current is increased slowly, as needed, up&#xD;
      to a maximum of 17 mA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human study begins immediately after placing the catheter and lasts 60 minutes; FHR,&#xD;
      uterine contraction timing, and subjective contraction amplitude are monitored during the&#xD;
      entire study. The first 20 minutes are the control contraction period (C1). The second 20&#xD;
      minutes are the EI period, with a 10-second burst of current administered just prior to each&#xD;
      expected contraction; expected contractions are determined by the timing of the C1&#xD;
      contractions and/or by the rise of the subjective tocodynamometer tracing above baseline&#xD;
      levels. The third 20 minutes is the post-intervention control contraction period (C2). The&#xD;
      contraction intervals, the times between contraction peaks (P-P), were measured in minutes&#xD;
      for C1, EI, and C2. All statistical analyses for the human study have been performed using&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) Version 9.2.&#xD;
      For each period, C1, E1, and C2, the mean minutes between contractions are estimated, using&#xD;
      the mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) to account for both within-subject and&#xD;
      between-subject variability. Pairwise differences between mixed-model ANOVA means and&#xD;
      corresponding p-values testing for difference from zero were estimated. All hypothesis&#xD;
      testing is performed at the 0.05 level of significance.&#xD;
