      To evaluate the therapeutic effects of the serotonergic agent, citalopram, on hostility and&#xD;
      other behavioral risk factors, and biological markers of disease risk (serum lipids, insulin&#xD;
      and glucose; autonomic balance and stress-related cardiovascular reactivity; platelet&#xD;
      activation).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hostility, a broad personality dimension comprised of behavioral tendencies, cognitive biases&#xD;
      and emotional or motivational characteristics appears to play an important role in the&#xD;
      development of coronary heart disease (CHD). Furthermore, hostility apparently is important,&#xD;
      not only as a function of its direct relationship to disease development, by virtue of its&#xD;
      well documented link to a wide range of other risk factors, including life style factors&#xD;
      (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use, imprudent diet), cardiovascular reactivity to stressful&#xD;
      circumstances, and physiological indices (e.g., reactivity to acute stress, lipid levels,&#xD;
      platelet activity, glucose regulation). It has been hypothesized that a common pathway&#xD;
      underlying each of these factors is described by the serotonin system and by (dys) regulation&#xD;
      of central serotonin pathways. Indeed, studies 1 and 2 of this program project application&#xD;
      are devoted to an elaboration of this pathway as underlying behavioral, psychological,&#xD;
      physiological and metabolic contributors to the development of CHD. The focus of this project&#xD;
      is on the impact of short treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) on&#xD;
      hostility and the wide range of associated risk factors for CHD. Should this study prove&#xD;
      successful, it will have the potential of significantly impacting treatment approaches that&#xD;
      are aimed at reducing risk for the development and progression of CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is one of four subprojects within a Program Project Grant entitled &quot;Biobehavioral&#xD;
      Studies of Cardiovascular Disease&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of a select population, with the core&#xD;
      questions revolving around the impact of brief (11 week) treatment with citalopram, a&#xD;
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) on hostility as measured a number of ways.&#xD;
      Healthy individuals who score above the median on standard measures of hostility will be&#xD;
      identified. While questionnaire measures will be used to screen and select individuals, a&#xD;
      host of measures of hostility will be employed to more fully capture the wide ranging aspects&#xD;
      of this &quot;personality&quot; dimension, and thereby better ascertain the impact of the active agent.&#xD;
      In addition to the measurement of the central personality dimension of interest, a wide range&#xD;
      of other factors are to be measured. Life style risk factors measured include (e.g., the use&#xD;
      of salivary cotinine to assess the validity of participants' self-report regarding tobacco&#xD;
      use, the use of unannounced 24 hour dietary recalls, the use of pedometer to assess physical&#xD;
      activity), autonomic activity (e.g., the wide range of indices available through the use of&#xD;
      impedance cardiography, the use of heart rate variability, baroreceptor sensitivity), and&#xD;
      platelet activity.&#xD;
