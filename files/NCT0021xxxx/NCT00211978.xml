  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if calcium acetate (PhosLo) can control serum&#xD;
      phosphorus in pre-dialysis patients with moderate to severe impairment of kidney function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with impaired kidney function, dietary phosphorus can not be completely excreted,&#xD;
      which leads to elevated levels of serum phosphorus. Elevated serum phosphorus leads to&#xD;
      increased levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), and is associated with bone disease and other&#xD;
      adverse consequences such as soft-tissue and vascular calcification, and increased morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. It is therefore important to prevent hyperphosphatemia and maintain serum&#xD;
      phosphorus levels within the range recommended by K/DOQI. In patients on dialysis, phosphate&#xD;
      binders are routinely used to control serum phosphorus by absorbing dietary phosphate during&#xD;
      the transit through the intestine. However, the use of phosphate binders for non-dialyzed&#xD;
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not an FDA approved indication, although some&#xD;
      physicians treat patients prior to dialysis based on clinical judgment. The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to demonstrate the efficacy of calcium acetate (PhosLo) in controlling serum&#xD;
      phosphorus in patients with moderate to severe decrease in kidney function.&#xD;
