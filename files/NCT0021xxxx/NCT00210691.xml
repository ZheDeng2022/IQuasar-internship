  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document the long-term safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      risperidone, formulated as a long-acting injectable, in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; in addition, to evaluate the long-term&#xD;
      effectiveness of long-acting risperidone and its effect on quality of life&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although many schizophrenia patients currently take oral antipsychotic medications, it is&#xD;
      estimated that up to 75% of them have difficulty adhering to the daily oral regimen.&#xD;
      Long-acting injectable formulations may eliminate the need for daily medication and enhance&#xD;
      patient compliance with the treatment regimen. This safety study is an extension of a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel group study that investigates effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of risperidone injected intramuscularly in patients with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder. The present open-label study evaluates 3 different doses of a&#xD;
      formulation of risperidone injected into the muscle at 2 week intervals for at least 1 year&#xD;
      in patients with these conditions. Assessments of effectiveness include the Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression (CGI) overall severity of illness scale. Quality of life will be assessed by the&#xD;
      SF-36 Health Survey. Safety evaluations include incidence of adverse events, physical&#xD;
      examinations, and evaluations of the injection site, clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale assessing&#xD;
      muscle tone, gain, and abnormal movements. Injections every 2 weeks for at least 1 year,&#xD;
      beginning at 25milligrams[mg] and increasing to 50mg or 75mg (maximum dose). Dosages may be&#xD;
      increased or decreased at investigator's discretion. During the first 3 weeks, risperidone&#xD;
      tablets (2mg) once daily to supplement injectable risperidone.&#xD;
