  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out the effectiveness of the experimental&#xD;
      combination of Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and radiation therapy administered prior to the surgical&#xD;
      removal of your esophageal cancer.&#xD;

      This study seeks to determine the safety and efficacy (the latter based on pathologic&#xD;
      response rate, three- and five-year survival rates) of a three-phase multi-modality approach&#xD;
      to adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction. This study also aims&#xD;
      retrospectively to determine if a specific tumor gene array profile would predict for&#xD;
      pathologic complete response. Study schema is as follows. Patients are first staged, next&#xD;
      they receive induction Docetaxel and Cisplatin on days 1 and 22, patients are then restaged,&#xD;
      next they will undergo radiation therapy combined with Cisplatin and Docetaxel for&#xD;
      approximately days 42 thorough 84, patients are again restaged, and finally surgery at&#xD;
      approximately days 100 to 150.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histological or cytological confirmed esophageal adenocarcinoma or&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (this diagnosis will be rendered by&#xD;
             the gastroenterology endoscopist, and refers to tumors at the junction of the&#xD;
             esophagus and the stomach, where &gt;50% of the tumor mass is above the diaphragm).&#xD;
             Tumors must not have greater than 2cm extension into the the cardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage T2N0M0, T3N0M0, T1-3N1M0, T1-3N0-1M1a as determined by imaging studies and&#xD;
             endoscopic ultrasound staging. M1a disease (celiac nodal metastasis) is permitted if&#xD;
             other eligibility criteria are met. Any lesion suspicious for metastasis should&#xD;
             biopsied (either by tru cut or fine needle aspiration) to prove eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has been deemed an appropriate surgical candidate by one of the surgical&#xD;
             subinvestigators (ie. Not T4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No medical comorbidity making the patient not a surgical candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must understand the consent and be willing to give written and informed&#xD;
             consent to participate in this investigational protocol, and for a tumor biopsy to be&#xD;
             performed for research purposes at the time of their staging endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
             (clinically required for their care), and for a portion of their resection specimen be&#xD;
             subjected to experimental laboratory analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &lt;1 (Karnofsky &gt;80%; see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have adequate caloric intake, as determined by a nutrition evaluation by&#xD;
             a registered dietician. Nutrition intake may be enteral, hyperalimentation by enteral&#xD;
             feeding tube, or by parenteral nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined as: leukocytes&#xD;
             &gt;3,000/mcL; absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL; platelets &gt;100,000/mcL; hemoglobin &gt;&#xD;
             8 g/dl; Creatinine clearance (estimated by Cockroft-Gault equation) &gt;50-mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
             for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;

             be less than 2.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiation of&#xD;
             therapy (female patients of childbearing potential).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events version 3 (CTCAEv3) greater than grade 1&#xD;
             peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements. Clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g. congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias not well&#xD;
             controlled with medication) or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study. Women / men of childbearing&#xD;
             potential not using a reliable and appropriate contraceptive method. Woman of&#xD;
             childbearing potential with either a positive or no pregnancy test at baseline.&#xD;
             (Postmenopausal woman must have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be&#xD;
             considered of non-childbearing potential). Patients will agree to continue&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, cisplatin,&#xD;
             or drugs formulated with polysorbate (Tween) 80.&#xD;

             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with cisplatin and docetaxel or other agents administered&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment, without complete&#xD;
