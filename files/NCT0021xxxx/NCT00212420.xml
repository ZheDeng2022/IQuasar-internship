      Enterocutaneous fistulae are abnormal connections between bowel and skin through which bowel&#xD;
      contents pass. Their management present a considerable medical and surgical challenge. Since&#xD;
      the 1970s the mainstray of treatment has been supportive with initiation of a &quot;nil by mouth&quot;&#xD;
      regimen and intravenous (parenteral) nutrition with the aim of stabilising the patient and&#xD;
      inducing gastrointestinal tract rest. There seems to have been an unquestioned benefit&#xD;
      attributed to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in the 1970s and 1980s which has carried&#xD;
      through to the current day. This rigid approach to the management of enterocutaneous fistulae&#xD;
      is almost universal and yet an extensive literature search suggests both mixed results from&#xD;
      clinical trials and mixed opinions from experts in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large study published in the late 1970s (Souters et al. 1979) demonstrated that there was a&#xD;
      44% mortality in patients with an enterocutaneous fistula from 1946 to 1959 which fell to 15%&#xD;
      between 1960 and 1970 with the introduction of improved parasurgical care; after 1970 no&#xD;
      further decrease in mortality rate was observed despite the introduction of parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition. It could therefore be argued that parenteral nutrition offers no real additional&#xD;
      benefit to these patients. Surprisingly there is no information in the literature comparing&#xD;
      enteral nutrition with parenteral nutrition in patients with an enterocutaneous fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enter nutrition is more physiological, is associated with fewer complications and is cheaper&#xD;
      when compared to parenteral nutrition. If parenteral nutrition were shown to offer no benefit&#xD;
      with regards to fistula closure in patients with enterocutaneous fistula then enteral feeding&#xD;
      would be the nutritional modality of choice. This would constitute a major shift in the&#xD;
      current management of such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research has shown that the supply of nutrients to the lining of the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract can have a significant effect on the growth of the cells lining the gut and on the&#xD;
      motility as a whole. Many of these effects are mediated by intestinal growth factors such and&#xD;
      glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and gut hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK) and peptide YY&#xD;
      (YYY. Although no studies have been performed looking at the levels of growth factors and gut&#xD;
      hormones in patients with enterocutaneous fistulae, it seems theoretically likely that the&#xD;
      route of nutrition in these patients will have an effect on the levels of these intestinal&#xD;
      growth factors and gut hormones. This in turn may have effect on fistula healing and fistula&#xD;
      output. Modulation of the levels of these growth factors and gut hormones may provide new&#xD;
      therapeutic options in the future management of enterocutaneous fistulae.&#xD;
