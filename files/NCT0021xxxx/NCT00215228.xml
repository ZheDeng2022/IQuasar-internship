  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low heart rate variability is a marker of increased risk of cardiac mortality, and is&#xD;
      observed in depressed coronary artery disease patients. Some antidepressants may themselves,&#xD;
      however, decrease heart rate variability. We will test the hypothesis that greater reduction&#xD;
      in heart rate variability will be associated with duloxetine (which has noradrenergic&#xD;
      activity) than escitalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). We will also test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that changes in heart rate variability are related to the magnitude of&#xD;
      norepinephrine transporter occupancy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Evaluation of heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown to be a valuable tool for measuring&#xD;
      autonomic dysfunction associated with depression and with cardiac disease. Low HRV is a&#xD;
      marker of increased risk of cardiac mortality, and is observed in depressed coronary artery&#xD;
      disease patients and in anxious patients post-MI. Treatment with sympathomimetic&#xD;
      antidepressants, such as MAO inhibitors and tricyclics, reduce HRV further, and have been&#xD;
      associated with elevated heart rate, orthostatic hypotension, and with adverse cardiac&#xD;
      events. Although there is increasing evidence that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor&#xD;
      (SSRI) class of antidepressants have minimal effects on the cardiovascular system, the case&#xD;
      is less clear with the SNRI antidepressants which block the reuptake of both serotonin and&#xD;
      norepinephrine. It is possible that measures of the extent of norepinephrine transporter&#xD;
      blockade or inhibition may relate to the HRV reduction seen with noradrenergic drugs. Given&#xD;
      these considerations, we propose a study to compare the cardiovascular profile of the SSRI&#xD;
      escitalopram (Lexapro), with the most recently available SNRI, duloxetine, in outpatients&#xD;
      with depression. Using HRV methodology, we will test the hypothesis that greater reduction in&#xD;
      HRV will be associated with duloxetine than escitalopram. In addition, we will measure the&#xD;
      magnitude of serotonin and norepinephrine transporter occupancy produced by each drug. This&#xD;
      will allow us to examine the relationship between changes in HRV to the magnitude of&#xD;
      transporter inhibiting effects of each drug.&#xD;
