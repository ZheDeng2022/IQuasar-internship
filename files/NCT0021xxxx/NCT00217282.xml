  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine has proven activity in advanced non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Due to its favorable toxicity profile, this combination is optimal for&#xD;
      adding new agents. Bevacizumab is an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody that has also shown&#xD;
      favorable results in advanced NSCLC. This study will add bevacizumab to oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      gemcitabine as first line treatment in patients with Stage IIIB and IV NSCLC.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the overall time to progression of the combination regimen of Gemcitabine,&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin and Bevacizumab as first-line treatment in patients with Stage IIIB and IV&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the overall response rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the toxicity of Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin given in combination with&#xD;
           Bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
           EXCEPT squamous cell carcinoma. Mixed tumors will be categorized by the predominant cell&#xD;
           type unless small cell elements are present in which case the patient is ineligible.&#xD;
           Cytologic or histologic elements can be established on metastatic tumor aspirates or&#xD;
           biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients must have advanced NSCLC (Stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion or Stage&#xD;
           IV or recurrent disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients must have measurable disease (as defined in Section 13.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ECOG performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients must not have known CNS metastases. Brain imaging is required within 4 weeks&#xD;
           prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. No prior systemic treatment for advanced NSCLC is permitted. Prior treatment for&#xD;
           early-stage disease (adjuvant) or for locally-advanced Stage III disease is allowed if&#xD;
           completed at least 12 months prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Required laboratory values (obtained 2 weeks prior to registration):&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.1 ANC &gt; 1500/mm³. 7.2 Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm³. 7.3 Total Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl. 7.4&#xD;
           Transaminases &lt; 5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patients must have adequate renal function as determined by the following tests within 2&#xD;
           weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1 Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), AND&#xD;
           Urinalysis &lt; 1+ protein*&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Patients discovered to have &gt;1+ proteinuria at baseline must undergo a 24-hour urine&#xD;
           collection. This must be an adequate collection and must demonstrate &lt;1g of protein/24&#xD;
           hr to allow participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Patients must be 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from the study because the agents used in this&#xD;
           study may be teratogenic to a fetus and there is no information on the excretion of the&#xD;
           agents or their metabolites into breast milk. A negative urine or serum pregnancy test&#xD;
           required for women of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must agree to use an accepted&#xD;
           and effective method of contraception (hormonal or barrier methods, abstinence) prior to&#xD;
           study entry and for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Patients treated with radiation therapy must have adverse events from therapy resolved&#xD;
           to grade 2 or less following completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Patients must not have ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;
           failure, cerebrovascular accident within 12 months, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
           arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
           study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Patients must have no deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus within one year of&#xD;
           registration and no ongoing need for full-dose oral or parenteral anticoagulation. Low&#xD;
           dose coumadin (1mg) for maintenance of catheter patency or daily prophylactic aspirin is&#xD;
           allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Patients with history of hypertension must be well-controlled (defined as a blood&#xD;
           pressure of &gt;160 mmHg systolic and/or &gt; 110 mmHg diastolic) on a stable regimen of&#xD;
           anti-hypertensive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. Patients must not have serious non-healing wound ulcer, or bone fracture, or major&#xD;
           surgical procedure within 3 weeks prior to starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. Patients with a history of gross hemoptysis (defined as bright red blood of a ½ teaspoon&#xD;
           or more) will be excluded from this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell&#xD;
           skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been&#xD;
           disease-free for five years&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PLAN Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes, on days 1 and 8 followed by&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV over 90*&#xD;
      minutes, on day 1 Cycles q 3 weeks x 4 cycles One cycle equals 3 weeks. Patients will be&#xD;
      re-evaluated every 2 cycles. If CR, PR or SD, patients will continue treatment up to four&#xD;
      cycles or until progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients achieving CR, PR, or SD after 4 cycles will continue Bevacizumab maintenance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV q 3 weeks until relapse/progression&#xD;
