  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of two treatment&#xD;
      regimens, topiramate as compared to phenytoin, in preventing seizures in patients with&#xD;
      new-onset epilepsy who require rapid initiation of antiepileptic drug therapy. Reasons for&#xD;
      requiring rapid initiation of treatment, rather than slowly increasing an antiepileptic drug&#xD;
      to an effective dose, may include severe or frequent seizures, or high risk to the patient of&#xD;
      recurrent seizures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who have recently been diagnosed with epilepsy and who require rapid&#xD;
      initiation of treatment will be randomized to receive either phenytoin or topiramate.&#xD;
      Patients have an equal chance of receiving either medication. Phenytoin and topiramate have&#xD;
      been approved by the FDA for treatment of epilepsy. The first phase of this study (lasting 28&#xD;
      days) is double-blind, meaning that neither the patient or the physician know which&#xD;
      medication the patient is receiving. Phenytoin will be used according to the dosing&#xD;
      recommendation in the package insert. Patients randomized into the phenytoin arm of this&#xD;
      study, will receive a dose on day 1 of 1000mg phenytoin (given in 3 divided doses), an&#xD;
      initiation dose recommended in the product labeling. This will be followed by 300mg of&#xD;
      phenytoin on each subsequent day. Patients randomized into the topiramate arm of this study&#xD;
      will receive 100mg of topiramate on day 1 and then continue to receive 100mg on each&#xD;
      subsequent day. This is a relatively rapid initiation schedule of topiramate, but it is&#xD;
      anticipated that it will be well tolerated and represents an appropriate regimen for&#xD;
      comparison to patients in the phenytoin arm of the study. Patients will be carefully&#xD;
      monitored for primary generalized tonic clonic seizures or complex partial onset seizures&#xD;
      (two distinct epileptic seizure types) during the 28-day double-blind evaluation period of&#xD;
      the trial. If a patient experiences a seizure during this 28 day period, they will either be&#xD;
      taken out of the study, or be offered the option to receive a higher dose of topiramate in an&#xD;
      open-label fashion. Open-label means that the patient and the physician will know what&#xD;
      medication and what dose of the medication the patient is taking. All patients who do not&#xD;
      experience a seizure during the 28 day period will be offered to receive open-label&#xD;
      topiramate for an additional 12 weeks. The study hypothesis is that the proportion of&#xD;
      patients who do not have a seizure within the 28 day double blind phase of the study will not&#xD;
      differ between the 2 treatment groups. Topiramate 100 milligrams a day by mouth for 4 weeks;&#xD;
      phenytoin 1000 milligrams to start, decreased to 300 milligrams a day by mouth for 4 weeks.&#xD;
