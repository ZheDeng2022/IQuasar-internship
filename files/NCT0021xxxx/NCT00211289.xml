      The emphasis of this grant is to investigate ways to educate patients, not only to improve&#xD;
      their knowledge about medications and diet that are important for better outcomes in heart&#xD;
      failure, but also to try to understand how patients' beliefs about medication and diet affect&#xD;
      their behaviour and to what extent the investigators can help patients change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Heart failure patients who receive an enhanced educational intervention from&#xD;
      their community pharmacist will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. have an absolute risk reduction in the number of events of 20%,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. be more compliant,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. demonstrate less health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment as measured by&#xD;
           disease-specific and generic HRQoL instruments and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. have lower costs/quality adjusted life years due to fewer total events per patient.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION: Heart Failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization in Canada.&#xD;
      While great advances have been made in the treatment of this disease, factors limiting the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment include: poor compliance to dietary guidelines and medications,&#xD;
      patients' lack of understanding about the impact of their disease, a lack of understanding of&#xD;
      the impact of their lifestyle habits on their disease and the lack of systematic monitoring&#xD;
      of patients following hospitalization. The objective of this trial of education and&#xD;
      compliance in heart failure patients (TEACH) is to measure in patients with heart failure who&#xD;
      are hospitalized and then discharged into the community, the impact of a comprehensive&#xD;
      outpatient educational intervention on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a composite endpoint of mortality, readmissions and visits to the emergency room for all&#xD;
           causes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the impact of the intervention on health-related quality of life,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the impact of the intervention on compliance to medication and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the economic impact of providing such an intervention to patients. A unique component of&#xD;
           this study is the participation of community pharmacists as part of a seamless care&#xD;
           model and the economic and qualitative evaluation of the educational interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial in patients who&#xD;
      are admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of heart failure. Patients are stratified by&#xD;
      reason for admission to the hospital. Stratum 1 includes patients whose primary reason for&#xD;
      admission is HF and stratum 2 includes patients whose primary reason for hospital admission&#xD;
      is not HF. The randomization will follow a cluster randomization design such that the&#xD;
      community pharmacies will be randomized to deliver either an intervention (INTERVENTION) or&#xD;
      usual care (CONTROL). Patients will be assigned to one of the two arms contingent upon which&#xD;
      pharmacy they obtain most of their medications from. All patients receive standardized&#xD;
      in-hospital education that has been previously validated (Eur J of HF, in press 2003). This&#xD;
      education consists of educational booklets and videos on HF, health promotion and dietary&#xD;
      information as well as relevant intervention from their community pharmacist that is aimed at&#xD;
      helping the patients become more compliant with their medication and provide a framework of&#xD;
      understanding that helps persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: HF patients who receive an enhanced educational intervention from their community&#xD;
      pharmacist will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. have an absolute risk reduction in the number of events of 20%,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. be more compliant,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. demonstrate less health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment as measured by&#xD;
           disease-specific and generic HRQoL instruments and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. lower costs/quality adjusted life years (QALY) due to fewer total events per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES: Outcomes are collected every 3 months from baseline to end of one year. Events are&#xD;
      tracked using a comprehensive database that we have developed and validated. Further&#xD;
      utilization data will be provided by ICES data linkage facilities and patient interviews at&#xD;
      the time of outcome assessment. In order to measure compliance we will continue to use&#xD;
      electronic measures known as Track Caps (MEMS). The other indirect measure is pharmacy refill&#xD;
      data that is provided to us from all community pharmacies the patient uses. This data will be&#xD;
      interpreted using a validated formula developed by Steiner et al. (1996). Resource use and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes are also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPORTANCE: Medication used to treat HF and other chronic diseases can only work, if used. We&#xD;
      are providing a validated education intervention to patients through an existing community&#xD;
      infrastructure with an aim to reduce morbidity and mortality and have a positive impact on&#xD;
      HRQoL within a cost-effective framework.&#xD;
