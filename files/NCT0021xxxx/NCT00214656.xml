      Aims and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised placebo controlled study will test the hypothesis that Recombinant Activated&#xD;
      Factor VII (rVIIa) will improve haemostasis after an inadequate response to conventional&#xD;
      therapy in complex cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major bleeding is still of concern in complex cardiac surgery. It has been shown to be&#xD;
      associated with poorer patient outcome and results in the consumption of resources (hospital&#xD;
      costs, manpower and blood bank reserves). This study has the potential to provide evidence&#xD;
      that rVIIa can reduce transfusion requirements and improve patient outcome in a problematic&#xD;
      aspect of complicated cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to conduct a multi-centre randomised placebo controlled study that has been&#xD;
      designed to scientifically evaluate the treatment of post bypass coagulopathy in the&#xD;
      association with complex cardiac surgery. The trial design is based on clinical practice that&#xD;
      has evolved over 2 years at the Austin Hospital during which 38 patients have received open&#xD;
      label administration of rVIIa. There is currently no published RCT in this area and there is&#xD;
      no TGA approval for the use of rVIIa for this indication.&#xD;

      11. 3 Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synopsis of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicentred randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of activated recombinant factor VII (rVIIa) in complex cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will be conducted at Austin Hospital, Alfred Hospital and Warringal Private Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Those who have inadequate haemostasis after initial standardised administration of&#xD;
           coagulation factors and receive rVIIa. (Active arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Those who have inadequate haemostasis after initial standardised administration of&#xD;
           coagulation factors and receive placebo. (Placebo arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
           We anticipate from our preliminary series that 50% of enrolled subjects will achieve&#xD;
           haemostasis after the initial standardised dose of coagulation factors and therefore&#xD;
           don't receive trial medication. Identical data will be collected and will form an&#xD;
           observational subgroup for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The protocol allows for open label administration of rVIIa if adequate haemostasis is&#xD;
           not achieved after two standardised administrations of coagulation factors and the trial&#xD;
           medication. This would be within 2 hours of the completion of the first administration&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary endpoint will be &quot;adequate haemostasis to enable chest closure&quot; after&#xD;
           administration of trial medication without the need for further intervention to improve&#xD;
           coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Endpoints, percentage of cases that haemostasis after first administration of&#xD;
           coagulation factors alone Assessment of surgical field after administration of trial&#xD;
           medication Time to closure of chest after administration of trial medication Transfusion&#xD;
           requirements in post bypass period in theatre Transfusion requirements in ICU first 12&#xD;
           hours Mediastinal drainage in ICU first 12 hours Coagulation study results at various&#xD;
           sample times Requirement for chest re-exploration Ventilation duration in ICU Duration&#xD;
           of stay in ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with scheduled cardiac surgery undergoing the following procedures Double valve&#xD;
           replacements or repair. Major thoracic aortic surgery including hypothermic circulatory&#xD;
           arrest or descending aortic reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Valve repair or replacement in the setting of endocarditis Complex procedures requiring&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary bypass duration anticipated to exceed 180 minutes in patients aged ³70&#xD;
           years&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient unable to give informed consent Patient refusal Allergy to rVIIa Allergy to&#xD;
           aprotinin or prior exposure within 6 months Pre-existing congenital coagulopathy&#xD;
           Pre-existing hypercoagulable state Patients in inclusion criteria whose actual bypass&#xD;
           time does not exceed 180 minutes Unresolved surgical bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
           Withdrawal from Trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the discretion of treating physicians if the proposed transfusion protocol post CPB&#xD;
           is inadequate to keep up with blood loss a patient can be withdrawn from the trial.&#xD;
           Transfusion therapy according to current medical practice at the discretion of treating&#xD;
           physicians will follow. rVIIa as per current hospital guidelines will be available. Data&#xD;
           will still be collected in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization Pharmacy will randomise patient after notified of entry into study.&#xD;
           Blinded packaged trial medication will be sent to theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Surgical management Surgical technique will be at the discretion of treating surgeon but&#xD;
           techniques that may affect haemostasis (eg. Use of biologic glues etc) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anaesthetic management Choice of anaesthetic agents will be at the discretion of&#xD;
           treating anaesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will receive aprotinin 2 x 106 IV over 1 hour after test dose of 10,000&#xD;
           units over 5 minutes and 2 x 106 IV in the CPB circuit prime. 0.75 x 106 IV to infusion&#xD;
           per hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be haemofiltered on bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Core temperature monitoring on all patients. Standard technique to preserve patient&#xD;
           temperature. Topical head cooling will be used if hypothermic circulatory arrest is&#xD;
           needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cardiopulmonary bypass management&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standardised CPB prime and circuits Cell saver for all patients Cardiotomy return for&#xD;
           all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           Haemoglobin maintained between 6-8gm/dL during bypass. Aim for haemoglobin of 10gm/dL at&#xD;
           time of weaning from bypass. Units of packed cells transfused on bypass will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adequate rewarming core temp &gt; 35° for 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Alpha stat pH management. Acid-base pH 7.3-7.5, BE +/- 3 prior to weaning from bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post bypass period&#xD;
&#xD;
           Transfusion and trial medication administration guidelines are found on Flow Chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Red Cell Transfusion Trigger Aim for haemoglobin concentration between 80 and 100&#xD;
           grams/litre using either banked or washed red cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The planned &quot;conventional therapy &quot; of aprotinin and an initial administration&#xD;
           predominately platelets (10 units), cryoprecipitate 3 mls/kg (high concentration of&#xD;
           fibrinogen) and a moderate dose of fresh frozen plasma 5ml/kg is appropriate based on&#xD;
           both our clinical experience and advice from the Australian Red Cross.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If at anytime adherence to protocol at the discretion of treating medical staff is&#xD;
           considered to place the patient at risk of inadequate transfusion, the patient can be&#xD;
           withdrawn and transfusion commenced as determined by medical staff. Data will still be&#xD;
           collected for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The duration of protocol during transfusion is two hours. Either adequate haemostasis&#xD;
           will have been achieved by the interventions as indicated in the protocol or the&#xD;
           scenario of inadequate haemostasis despite two administrations of standardising&#xD;
           coagulation factor and trial medications followed by open label administration of rVIIa&#xD;
           will have evolved. If this is the case, ongoing transfusion, surgical and medical&#xD;
           management will be at the discretion of medical staff. Administration of rVIIa can be&#xD;
           considered after discussion with trial investigators. Data will still be collected for&#xD;
           such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ICU Management Blood loss measurement in the closed drainage system must be documented&#xD;
           at least once hourly, or more frequently if blood loss is excessive. The patient should&#xD;
           be sat up in bed on arrival in ICU (this will allow CXR to be taken), before starting to&#xD;
           measure drainage. On arrival to ICU coagulation studies should be performed and repeated&#xD;
           4 hours and 12 hours post arrival. .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Postoperative transfusion according to established ICU protocol Blood loss &gt; 250mL/hr&#xD;
           NOTIFY SURGEON (CONSIDER RETURN TO THEATRE)&#xD;
&#xD;
           CONSISTANT WITH CURRENT PRACTICE: - NO ADMINISTRATION OF rVIIa IN ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
           Re-exploration for bleeding Any patient returning to theatre will be treated at the&#xD;
           discretion of medical staff involved. The administration of rVIIa can be considered&#xD;
           according to current guidelines. Administration of coagulation products at discretion of&#xD;
           treating doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomisation will be co-ordinated and supervised by the Trial Pharmacy at the Austin&#xD;
           Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Due to the expense of the drug, instability in solution and the lack of availability of&#xD;
           a similarly packaged placebo, the mechanism to &quot;blind&quot; medical staff in theatre will&#xD;
           involve an independent registered nurse preparing the drug in an opaque syringe&#xD;
           according to a sealed envelope indicating placebo or trial drug. Randomisation will be&#xD;
           site specific for both the Austin Hospital and Warringal Private Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pharmacy will be notified when consent is obtained for a patient. Two doses or rVIIa&#xD;
           will need to be sent to theatre. This will be stored in the blood fridge. Any unused&#xD;
           drug will be returned to Pharmacy with full documentation of drug handling. Nursing&#xD;
           staff involved in trial medication preparation will be educated regarding the necessity&#xD;
           of not revealing whether actual drug or placebo was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
           Power Analysis Based on our pilot data we anticipate 80% or more of the group receiving&#xD;
           rVIIa will achieve haemostasis adequate for chest closure without any further&#xD;
           intervention to improve coagulation. (Our primary endpoint) We conservatively estimate&#xD;
           that only 30% or less of placebo group will achieve haemostasis adequate for chest&#xD;
           closure without any further intervention to improve coagulation. Assuming a p value of &lt;&#xD;
           0.5 and power of 0.8 analysis indicates that to show a 50% difference between groups 34&#xD;
           subjects are needed (17 in each arm). To allow for any withdrawals we plan to enrol 40&#xD;
           patients in the study. Based on current drug usage, the recruitment will take 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Results Analysis Primary endpoints will be assessed by chi-squared analysis. Secondary&#xD;
           endpoints parametric and non-parametric analysis as appropriate. No interim analysis is&#xD;
           planned. Subgroup analysis according to procedure and surgeon will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bias Because of the small number of subjects in this trial, bias may be a problem.&#xD;
           Unequal distribution of each of the four procedures may occur and influence results. The&#xD;
           trial drug is thought to treat coagulopathic bleeding. Any superimposed surgical&#xD;
           bleeding may cause bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse Events Patients undergoing cardiac surgery represent a population at relatively&#xD;
           high risk of a range of perioperative complications inherent to their underlying&#xD;
           disease, co-morbidities and the nature of the surgery being undertaken. In the pilot&#xD;
           study the mortality rate was 25 %. It is not intended to report the occurrence all of&#xD;
           these events to the Human Research and Ethics Committee. Any adverse events that do&#xD;
           arise specifically in relation to the conduct of the proposed study will be reported to&#xD;
           the Committee&#xD;
&#xD;
           Feasibility Our pilot series of 40 cases from 2 centres was collected over a 24-month&#xD;
           period. Assuming similar workloads and the addition of another centre ( Alfred Hospital)&#xD;
           recruitment should be completed in 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           HREC approval has been granted by Austin Health for the Austin site. The same HREC is&#xD;
           considering approval for the Warringal Private Hospital site, and the Alfred hospital&#xD;
           will be seeking similar approval from its own HREC.&#xD;
