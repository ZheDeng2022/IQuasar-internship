  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of topiramate&#xD;
      for the prevention of migraine headaches in adults. Topiramate has been approved to prevent&#xD;
      migraine headaches in adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine headaches can be disabling and can interfere with work and a person's quality of&#xD;
      life. Preventing these headaches before they start is the best option. Topiramate, an&#xD;
      anti-seizure medication, has been shown to help prevent migraine headaches from occurring.&#xD;
      This is an open-label study that is an extension of a previous study (CAPSS-277) comparing&#xD;
      topiramate and amitriptyline in migraine prevention. It includes patients who completed the&#xD;
      previous study and elected to enter open label treatment with topiramate. The study will&#xD;
      involve a 4-week Blinded Transition Phase during which patients will be titrated up to a&#xD;
      daily topiramate dose of 100 milligrams (or the maximum tolerated dose, whichever is less).&#xD;
      Then there will be a 12-week Open-Label Maintenance Phase during which the topiramate dose&#xD;
      may be adjusted according to effectiveness and tolerance, but not to exceed a daily dose of&#xD;
      400 milligrams. While on topiramate, patients will record daily entries in their headache&#xD;
      records. Patients will be asked questions to help assess their quality of life. Patients will&#xD;
      also have physical examinations and laboratory tests performed during the study. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of topiramate&#xD;
      for the prevention of migraine headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topiramate oral tablets, 25 milligrams per tablet, will be given in the morning and evening&#xD;
      to a dose not to exceed 400 milligrams per day or to the maximum tolerated dose, whichever is&#xD;
      less&#xD;
