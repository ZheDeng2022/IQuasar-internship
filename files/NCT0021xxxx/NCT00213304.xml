  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study sought to determine the safety of the varicella vaccine pre- and&#xD;
      post-transplantation when given to pediatric patients listed for solid organ transplantation.&#xD;
      The study assessed the antibody response to a two-dose vaccine regimen and determined the&#xD;
      durability of that antibody response at several intervals in the post-transplant period. As a&#xD;
      secondary objective, the relationship between antibody titers and different variables were&#xD;
      explored&#xD;
