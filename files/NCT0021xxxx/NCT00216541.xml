      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of early treatment with epoetin alfa in&#xD;
      addition to best standard of care on hemoglobin levels and the need for red blood cell&#xD;
      transfusions in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy as compared to patients receiving&#xD;
      standard epoetin alfa treatment and best standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients often experience anemia due to the disease itself, chemotherapy, or both.&#xD;
      Quality of life is also affected, due in part to the tiredness associated with anemia.&#xD;
      Previous studies with epoetin alfa have suggested that early intervention with epoetin alfa&#xD;
      results in higher hemoglobin levels and lower incidence of red blood cell transfusions than&#xD;
      are achieved with delayed intervention. This is a randomized, open-label, explorative,&#xD;
      sequential study that evaluates the effects of early treatment with epoetin alfa to determine&#xD;
      its impact on hemoglobin values and the need for red blood cell transfusions as well as the&#xD;
      safety of epoetin alfa when used in the prevention of anemia during chemotherapy in adult&#xD;
      patients with cancer. During their current course of chemotherapy, patients will receive&#xD;
      either early treatment with epoetin alfa or standard treatment with epoetin alfa (epoetin&#xD;
      alfa administered when hemoglobin is &lt;=10 g/dL), in addition to best standard care. Best&#xD;
      standard care during chemotherapy may include red blood cell transfusions, white cell growth&#xD;
      factors, folic acid, and iron supplementation, as needed. Effectiveness will be determined by&#xD;
      the number of patients who receive an allogenic blood transfusion during the study and the&#xD;
      change in hemoglobin at 3 or 4 weeks, 8 or 9 weeks, and 12 weeks, and at the end of the&#xD;
      treatment period. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, abnormal clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, and vital signs) will be performed throughout the study. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that cancer patients receiving chemotherapy who receive early treatment with&#xD;
      epoetin alfa will have higher hemoglobin levels and fewer red blood cell transfusions than&#xD;
      cancer patients receiving chemotherapy who receive standard treatment with epoetin alfa. This&#xD;
      study will be conducted in the Netherlands and will only enroll European patients and will be&#xD;
      generally well-tolerated. Epoetin alfa injections (40,000 units) under skin once a week&#xD;
      either within 7 days after start of first chemotherapy cycle or from day hemoglobin is &lt;=10&#xD;
      g/dL. Patients will receive epoetin alfa during the current course of chemotherapy or up to&#xD;
      24 weeks. Dose may be adjusted.&#xD;
