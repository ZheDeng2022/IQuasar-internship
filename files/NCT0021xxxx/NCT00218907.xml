      This study compared the educational effectiveness of a ten-minute pre-test counseling video&#xD;
      with the usual practice of a session with an HIV counselor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV is increasingly affecting urban populations, making the inner city ED a prime venue for&#xD;
      C&amp;T because of their unique opportunity to identify HIV positive patients. These underserved&#xD;
      communities often use the ED for their regular health care specifically because it provides&#xD;
      services outside of the usual weekday working hours. However, there are significant barriers&#xD;
      to HIV C&amp;T in the ED, such as the lack of resources to provide prevention oriented messages,&#xD;
      cost issues, and the feasibility of providing the required manpower for testing. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine whether an educational video, with the required&#xD;
      pre-test counseling elements, conveys the necessary information for inner city ED patients to&#xD;
      consent to a standard Elisa HIV test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to address the HIV testing needs of the patient population presenting to the ED,&#xD;
      innovative methods must be developed to provide HIV C&amp;T, while simultaneously removing the&#xD;
      barriers to testing. Video technology may provide an opportunity to make HIV counseling&#xD;
      feasible when counselors are not available.&#xD;
