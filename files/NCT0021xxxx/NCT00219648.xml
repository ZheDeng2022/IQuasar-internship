  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PEP03 is a new chemical entity developed as a highly selective, potent, and orally active&#xD;
      5-LO inhibitor. PEP03 exerts its action by blocking the generation of both cysteinyl LTs and&#xD;
      LTB4. These LTs have been associated with the inflammatory response in the lung and with the&#xD;
      clinical sequelae, including bronchospasm. Preclinical pharmacological in- vitro, ex-vivo and&#xD;
      in-vivo testing indicates that PEP03 has multiple beneficial actions including prevention of&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction, and reduction of vascular leakage, cellular infiltration, and bronchial&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies in asthmatic patients indicate that PEP03 improved FEV1 and other secondary&#xD;
      endpoints, such as morning and evening peak flow, daytime and nighttime symptoms score,&#xD;
      beta-agonist use, physician's and patient's global impression of change. Since leukotrienes&#xD;
      have been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of COPD, this study is designed to&#xD;
      explore the clinical utility of PEP03 for the treatment of moderate COPD.6; 7; 8; 9&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Subjects have to be &gt; 40 years of age. 2. Subjects must have baseline 40% ≦&#xD;
             FEV1(pre-bronchodilator) ≦ 70% of predicted value, and FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% at Visits 1 and&#xD;
             2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Subjects must have at least one episode of COPD-related symptoms (e.g. cough,&#xD;
             sputum production, shortness of breath) within 2 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Subjects must have a &lt; 12% increase in FEV1 after a fixed dose of bronchodilator&#xD;

&#xD;
             5. Subjects have a history of &gt; 10 pack years of smoking (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes&#xD;

             must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Subjects have to be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Subjects must have the ability to use peak flow meter correctly and record patient&#xD;
             diary cards 9. Subjects must provide signed, written informed consent prior to&#xD;
             participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Subjects have asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy as main component of their&#xD;
             obstructive airway disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects are being treated with long term oxygen therapy, requiring supplemental&#xD;
             oxygen more often than on an occasional/as need basis or requiring nocturnal positive&#xD;
             pressure for sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Subjects have a history of severe right sided heart failure or cor pulmonale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Subjects have had a serious infection (e.g. hepatitis, pneumonia or pyelonephritis)&#xD;
             within the previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Subjects have airway obstruction due to diseases with known etiology or specific&#xD;
             pathology, such as cystic fibrosis, or bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Subjects with lung cancer, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or lung fibrosis. 7. Subjects&#xD;
