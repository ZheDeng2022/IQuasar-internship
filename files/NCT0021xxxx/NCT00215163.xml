  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both pharmacotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions have domenstrated efficacy for PTSD.&#xD;
      However, although these interventions can be helpful, many patients remain symptomatic&#xD;
      despite initial treatment. In this study, we will examine the relative efficacy of the&#xD;
      addition of paroxetine-CR compared to placebo for patients remaining symptomatic despite a&#xD;
      brief and intensive course of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).&#xD;

      This is a systematic controlled study examining the use of augmentation with pharmaotherapy&#xD;
      for PTSD patients remaining symptomatic despite CBT (exposure therapy). The aims of the study&#xD;
      include examination of: (1) the efficacy of paroxetine-CR compared to placebo as additions to&#xD;
      ongoing exposure therapy in patients who failed to respond to brief, intensive CBT; (2) the&#xD;
      tolerability of paroxetine-CR compared to placebo as additions to ongoing exposure therapy in&#xD;
      patients who failed to respond to brief, intensive CBT; (3) the outcome of patients at 6&#xD;
      months follow-up to randomized treatment. Patients will initially have intensive (8 sessions&#xD;
      over 4 weeks) prolonged exposure therapy. Patients who remain symptomatic will be randomzied&#xD;
      to receive either flexibly-dosed paroxetine-CR (12.5 mg/d - 62.5 mg/d) or placebo in&#xD;
      conjunction with additional 5 sessions of prolonged exposure over 10 weeks.&#xD;
