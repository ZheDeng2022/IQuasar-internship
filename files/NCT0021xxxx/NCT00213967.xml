      This study will determine whether decreasing pain associated with intramuscular injection by&#xD;
      decreasing needle temperature could be an inexpensive, simple way to decrease injection fear&#xD;
      and increase immunization rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza virus infection causes significant morbidity and mortality each season. More than&#xD;
      90 million doses of influenza vaccine are administered in most seasons. All of these vaccine&#xD;
      doses, except about two million, are administered by intramuscular injection. Surprisingly&#xD;
      little research has been done to evaluate appropriate intramuscular injection technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small proportion of the population for which annual influenza immunization is indicated may&#xD;
      self-defer because of the pain associated with the administration of the vaccine. Injection&#xD;
      is a procedure that causes minor pain. Ice packs are often used for local anesthesia.&#xD;
      Decreasing pain associated with intramuscular injection by decreasing needle temperature&#xD;
      could be an inexpensive, simple way to decrease injection fear and increase immunization&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test our hypothesis, we will use a double blind controlled study design. Study&#xD;
      participants will receive two injections. One injection will contain 0.5ml of next season's&#xD;
      influenza vaccine. The other injection will contain 0.5ml normal saline. Each study&#xD;
      participant will be randomly assigned to order of injection and to frozen or room temperature&#xD;
      needle. (Figure 1) We include two injections to increase the amount of information that we&#xD;
      can obtain from the study. In addition to determining if frozen needles decrease discomfort&#xD;
      associated with injection of influenza vaccine, we may be able to make our study more&#xD;
      generalizable if frozen needles also decrease the pain associated with a normal saline&#xD;
      intramuscular injection. Further rationale for the study design covers that we are unable to&#xD;
      administer the same injection at two sites to the same person during the same visit varying&#xD;
      only the temperature of the needle. To minimize variability, both injections will be&#xD;
      administered by the same immunizer who will be blind to the study group assignment. We will&#xD;
      maintain blinding of the immunizer by having the person preparing the injections hand the&#xD;
      filled syringes to the immunizer uncapped since the immunizer would likely be able to feel&#xD;
      the cold of the frozen needles during the needle uncapping. A 1 inch 23 gauge needle (safety&#xD;
      injection device; Eclipse by BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) will be used for all participants under&#xD;
      90kg. A 1 Â½ inch needle will be used for all larger participants. We will ask each individual&#xD;
      to rate the pain of each injection using a standard 10 point pain scale.1 Each participant&#xD;
      will be asked which injection was less painful and if he/she can tell us if a frozen needle&#xD;
      was used for either or both injection. Members from the research team will call or email&#xD;
      subjects 2-4 days after the administration of the injection. During this phone call, subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to rate their current pain at both injection sites. They will also be asked if&#xD;
      they notice any redness around the injection site. This additional phone call will help to&#xD;
      determine if needle temperature affects delayed injection site reactions (minor soreness&#xD;
      and/or redness around the injection site lasting 1-3 days after the injection) in addition to&#xD;
      immediate effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if there is an effect on influenza vaccine if administered with cold needles, we&#xD;
      will measure antibody response to influenza vaccine. Blood will be drawn immediately&#xD;
      following the administration of the intramuscular injections and pain scoring from a subset&#xD;
      of study participants. Sub-study participants will return in 2-4 weeks for a second blood&#xD;
      draw to measure post-immunization antibody concentrations.&#xD;
