      The study was designed to test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In obese patients with OSAS, the benefit of the combination of exercise training + continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) will be higher than CPAP alone in term of functional&#xD;
      capacity, metabolic, inflammatory, cardiovascular and sleep parameters and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In obese patients with OSAS, the benefit of training using ventilatory assistance (NIV)&#xD;
      during cycloergometer [cycloergometer with NIV] or respiratory muscles training (spirotiger)&#xD;
      in addition to cycloergometer [cycloergometer + spirotiger] will be higher than&#xD;
      cycloergometer training alone [cycloergometer] in term of functional and exercise capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspnea during walking test and respiratory muscle strength at baseline could influence the&#xD;
      response to combined exercise training such as [cycloergometer + NIV] or [cycloergometer +&#xD;
      spirotiger]&#xD;

      Background: Obesity and sleep apnea syndrome lead to metabolic troubles and increasing&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, both diseases are associated with reduced exercise&#xD;
      tolerance. We hypothesized that exercise training could be complementary to nocturnal&#xD;
      ventilatory treatment in restoring metabolic disturbances, exercise tolerance and sleep&#xD;
      parameters in obese patients with SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the effect of training on exercise tolerance (walking distance and&#xD;
      dyspnea during walk)(main objective), systemic inflammation, vascular endothelial function,&#xD;
      insulin resistance, quality of sleep and quality of life in obese patients treated by CPAP&#xD;
      for OSAS (secondary objectives)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We proposed to conduct a controlled, randomized clinical trial comparing the&#xD;
      efficacy of 3 different modalities of training in obese patients with SAS. After a 6-week&#xD;
      control pre-inclusion period, patients are included in either [cycloergometer] vs.&#xD;
      [cycloergometer with ventilatory assistance] vs. [cycloergometer + respiratory muscle&#xD;
      exercises]. Before and after the control period, and both immediately and 9 month after&#xD;
      training, patients perform walking test, maximal incremental test on cycloergometer, blood&#xD;
      sampling and cardiovascular function, body composition, muscle function, quality of sleep and&#xD;
      quality of life assessments as well as spontaneous physical activity measurement. During the&#xD;
      5 years following inclusion in the training program, the number of cardiovascular event is&#xD;
      recorded every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be carried out when 30 will have completed the third evaluation&#xD;
      session (after the training program). The Peto's method will be used to correct the p-values.&#xD;
