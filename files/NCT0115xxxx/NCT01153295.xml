      The study aims to investigate how to give the diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators compare two parallel groups of primary care patients, in the age of 18-50&#xD;
      years with gastrointestinal complaints where the GP suspects IBS. All included patients&#xD;
      fulfil international diagnostic criteria (ROME III) and have no danger signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: The diagnosis is based on the diagnostic criteria and few blod tests Group 2: The&#xD;
      diagnosis is a diagnosis of exclusion after investigations with extended blod tests,&#xD;
      examination for milk- and gluten intolerance, stoll for ova and parasites and scopy of the&#xD;
      intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the diagnosis of Irritable bowel syndrome all patients are informed about the&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators follow the patients for 1 year. The investigators hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      two investigation programmes (group 1 and 2)are equal with respect to the patients´ quality&#xD;
      of life, symptoms and satisfaction and also with respect to finding of organic diseases.&#xD;

      Background: Two opposing approaches can be distinguished in establishing the diagnosis of&#xD;
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): IBS as a &quot;diagnosis of exclusion&quot; versus IBS as a syndromic&#xD;
      condition on its own. In Denmark we have no consensus on how to establish the diagnosis, but&#xD;
      must often GPs approach IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion. Guidelines from the United Kingdom&#xD;
      and the United States recommend the second approach, where the diagnosis is given as a&#xD;
      positive diagnosis based on symptom-based IBS criteria. We lack research on this area carried&#xD;
      out under controlled circumstances and in primary care in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate two investigation programmes for diagnosing IBS in primary care patients in&#xD;
      Denmark. We want to compare the two programmes in relation to the effect on the patients´&#xD;
      symptoms, quality of life and satisfaction, and also the cost and safety when using the&#xD;
      different programmes. Also we want to see how the GP´s understanding of IBS correlate with&#xD;
      the IBS criteria (ROM I, II and III)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomised, non-blinded, controlled intervention study of two parallel groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target group comprises people aged 18-50 years, who consult their GP with&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complaints, where the GP suspects IBS and refers the patient to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be included in the study the patients have to fulfil the ROM III criteria and they may not&#xD;
      have any alarm signals. Included patients are randomised to one of two different&#xD;
      investigation programmes, where the diagnosis is given as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A positive diagnosis, the diagnosis is based on the ROM III criteria and a few blood&#xD;
           tests (FBC, CRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A diagnosis of exclusion, the diagnosis is given after normal investigation (extended&#xD;
           blood tests, screening for celiac sprue and lactose intolerance, endoscopy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are followed by means of monthly letters, with questions about current GI&#xD;
      symptoms, sick-leave days, visits at GPs, use of medication etc., and validated&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline, after 4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
