  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety of RAD001 in Chinese&#xD;
      patients with metastatic renal cell cancer who are intolerant of or have progressed despite&#xD;
      treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapies. All patients&#xD;
      will be treated with RAD001 10 mg daily until tumor progression (determined according to the&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death&#xD;
      or discontinuation from the study for any other reason. At least 60 patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study. Screening and baseline evaluations will be performed within 28 days of the date&#xD;
      when the patient signs the informed consent form. Baseline evaluations will be performed&#xD;
      within two weeks of the first dose of RAD001. Screening and baseline evaluations will be&#xD;
      performed to determine if patient meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria. All eligible&#xD;
      patients should be enrolled in the study and will receive the first dose of RAD001 (10 mg&#xD;
      daily) on Day 1, Cycle 1. Subsequently, patients will be asked to come to the clinic every&#xD;
      month to complete the protocol-specified evaluations. A treatment Cycle consists of 28 days.&#xD;
      After discontinuation of treatment with RAD001, patients will have a safety follow-up&#xD;
      performed 28 days after the last dose of RAD001. Patients must continue with survival&#xD;
      assessments which will be performed every 3 months from the last dose of RAD001 until up to 2&#xD;
      years after the last patient's first visit date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis focusing on safety data and a final analysis of all data are planned. All&#xD;
      patients still receiving the study drug at the time of the final analysis will be given the&#xD;
      option to continue treatment with RAD001 until the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
