    <textblock>
      Reactive platelet hyperactivity following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) might lead&#xD;
      to thrombotic complications and major ischemic cardiac events. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the changes in platelet reactivity following CABG and to clarify a potentially&#xD;
      beneficial effect of dual antiplatelet therapy in the group of patients with documented&#xD;
      aspirin resistance following CABG. Platelet function will be assessed by multiple electrode&#xD;
      aggregometry. Aortocoronary vein graft disease is comprised of three distinct but&#xD;
      interrelated pathological processes: thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis.&#xD;
      Early vein thrombosis is a major cause of vein graft attrition during the first month after&#xD;
      CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bypass patency can be improved with antiplatelet therapy which is the mainstay of treatment&#xD;
      for patients after CABG. A beneficial effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on vein graft&#xD;
      patency has been previously shown. Some patients experience thrombotic events despite&#xD;
      continuous aspirin administration after CABG. The investigators hypothesized that low&#xD;
      responsiveness to aspirin might be a precipitating factor for adverse thrombotic events&#xD;
      following CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low responsiveness to ASA, as assessed by platelet function tests, varies widely among&#xD;
      patients. The etiology of postoperative platelet hyperactivity remains to be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study a new point-of-care assay named multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) using a&#xD;
      device called Multiplate analyzer (Dynabyte, Munich, Germany) has been utilized. It allows&#xD;
      for rapid and standardized assessment of platelet function parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized trial. The aim of the study is to document whether&#xD;
      introduction of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with ASA resistance will lead to a&#xD;
      lower incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at a six month follow up. The&#xD;
      composite endpoint will include death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiac&#xD;
      rehospitalization. All patients will receive 300 mg of ASA starting 6 hours after surgery,&#xD;
      provided that the chest tube output is minimal. On postoperative day 4 their platelet&#xD;
      function will be assessed using the above mentioned MEA. The patients found to be aspirin&#xD;
      resistant will then undergo the process of randomization. The first arm will include patients&#xD;
      with ASA resistance in whom no additional antiaggregation will be administered. In the second&#xD;
      arm the investigators will include patients who were randomized to receive 75 mg of&#xD;
      clopidogrel in addition to the standard antiplatelet regimen of 300 mg of ASA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet function monitoring allows for individual tailoring of the antiplatelet therapy. The&#xD;
      goal of this study is to define whether this strategy will lead to improved patient outcomes.&#xD;
      Both major and minor bleeding complications will be strictly monitored and reported.&#xD;
