  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the worldwide leading cause of cancer death. In France, with 28,000 new cases&#xD;
      per year, lung cancer is the 4th in terms of incidence but remains the leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death. The 5-year survival of lung cancer, all stages and all types, is very low,&#xD;
      estimated at 12% among men and 16% among women in France. In advanced unresectable non small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer, standard treatment relies on platinum-based induction chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients responding or stabilized after 4&#xD;
      chemotherapy cycles ranges from 2 to 2.8 months. Gustave Roussy and Curie institutes have&#xD;
      developed an immunotherapy involving metronomic cyclophosphamide (mCTX) followed by&#xD;
      vaccinations with tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cell-derived exosomes (Dex). mCTX inhibits&#xD;
      Treg functions restoring T and NK cell effector functions and Dex are able to activate the&#xD;
      innate and adaptive immunity. Phase I trials showed the safety and feasibility of Dex&#xD;
      vaccines but no induction of T cells could be monitored in patients. Since 2007, we validated&#xD;
      a new process for isolation of second generation Dex with improved immune stimulatory&#xD;
      capacities. We propose a maintenance immunotherapy in 47 advanced unresectable NSCLC patients&#xD;
      responding or stabilized after induction chemotherapy with Dex-based treatment to improve PFS&#xD;
      rate at 4 months in these patients.&#xD;
