  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The eye movements of vergence allow binocular vision whatever the viewing distance or the&#xD;
      body movements are and the perception of depth. Vergence dysfunction can lead to erroneous&#xD;
      visual sensation of movements. In our daily life using screens (computer, game boys..) is&#xD;
      increasing and this approach heavily the ocular vergence and can lead to symptoms if&#xD;
      oculomotor and accommodative systems are dysfunctioning (Ped. Neurology 2000). Not knowing&#xD;
      this pathology lead to inappropriate and expensive prescription CT scan or NMR. To evaluate&#xD;
      the vergence performances just evaluation in static condition is currently available in&#xD;
      ophthalmology departments. The CNRS laboratory (IRIS, FRE 3154) adapted a technic of eye&#xD;
      movement recording to study ocular vergence in dynamic condition.&#xD;

      The goals of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to compare the coordination of binocular eye movements, postural stability on a&#xD;
           force-plate during visual tasks (looking at a target or reading) and dynamic visual&#xD;
           acuity between two groups of children and teenagers: one group with oculomotor vergence&#xD;
           disorders and vertigo and one group with normal eye movements. Children will undergo&#xD;
           complete vestibular testing (by Dr WIENER-VACHER) to eliminate a vestibular origin for&#xD;
           vertigo. Normal children will be volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. in order to evaluate objectively the effect of rehabilitation, a second oculomotor&#xD;
           evaluation (identical to the initial one) will be done in children with vertigo after an&#xD;
           orthoptic rehabilitation focused on ocular vergence. We hypothesize that functional&#xD;
           oculomotor disorders can be rehabilitated because of the plasticity of the oculomotor&#xD;
           system (proved by several studies for many years) provided that the spatial temporal&#xD;
           parameters of the training are precisely tailored to patient malfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish normative data of the binocular eye movements and posturography, and validate&#xD;
           a protocol for complete static and dynamic oculomotor evaluation for clinical use. To a&#xD;
           longer term modification of the rehabilitation protocols of eye movements will be&#xD;
           designed to fit each patient problems in function of the abnormalities revealed by the&#xD;
           static and dynamic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study calendar :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the children referred for vertigo with vergence abnormalities and normal vestibular&#xD;
      functional evaluation will be proposed for participate to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the study will perform an oculomotor complete evaluation (static and&#xD;
      dynamic and accommodation), posturography test and a visual dynamic acuity test. These tests&#xD;
      will last for 60 minutes, including breaks to avoid fatigue of the children. Then, the&#xD;
      children will follow orthoptic rehabilitation :12 sessions (2 sessions per week). These&#xD;
      sessions will be done by an orthoptist installed close to home, in contact with the research&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of a series of 12 sessions of orthoptic, the child will be examined and will again&#xD;
      perform a static and dynamic oculomotor evaluation and control of postural balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to highlight the prolonged effects of rehabilitation a third oculomotor evaluation&#xD;
      and control of postural balance will be made six months after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy children (control group) will be recruited at Robert Debré hospital. A poster&#xD;
      campaign in the corridors of the hospital, as well as general information (mailing) for the&#xD;
      Hospital staff will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire prior to a half-hour will confirm the normal vestibular children. After&#xD;
      completing the questionnaire, a test Postural oculomotor (one hour) and a test orthoptics&#xD;
      (half hour) will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of Research: We will study with a multidisciplinary approach children with vergence&#xD;
      abnormalities and vertigo and/or headache. Healthy children will also be examined for&#xD;
      baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be conducted at the Unite de Recherche Clinique Paris Nord, Robert&#xD;
      Debré Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative data will be described in terms of frequency and percentages, quantitative&#xD;
      data as mean (SD) if the distribution follows a normal distribution, as median (quartiles)&#xD;
      otherwise. The influence of sex adjusted for age will be tested by parametric methods after&#xD;
      normalization of distributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The establishment of standards will be conducted according to the method described by EM&#xD;
      Wright et P. ROYSTON (Simplified estimation of age-specific reference intervals for skewed&#xD;
      data, Statistics in Medicine 1997, vol 16, 2785-2803). The method is to produce smoothed&#xD;
      percentile curves by time (age) using parametric methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of sick children will be purely descriptive. She will describe the differences for&#xD;
      different standard deviation scores of variables described in the previous paragraph between&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis and after 12 weeks of rehabilitation and orthoptic vergence.&#xD;
