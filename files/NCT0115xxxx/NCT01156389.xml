  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pyronaridine/ artesunate (Pyramax) is an antimalarial therapy which has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      be a safe and effective treatment in patients with Plasmodium falciparum and vivax malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This drug interaction study is intended to investigate if there is any interaction between&#xD;
      Pyramax and the protease inhibitor ritonavir in healthy subjects using ritonavir as a probe&#xD;
      substrate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase I, randomized, study to determine any drug interaction between&#xD;
      Pyramax (pyronaridine/artesunate) and the protease inhibitor ritonavir in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      A total of 34 healthy volunteers (17 per treatment arm) will be enrolled in the study to have&#xD;
      at least 30 (15 per treatment arm) completed, and they will be randomly assigned in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive either ritonavir (100 mg bid) for 17 days from Day 1-17 plus&#xD;
      pyronaridine/artesunate (180:60 mg) once daily for 3 days from Day 8-10 in arm A or&#xD;
      pyronaridine/artesunate (180:60 mg) alone once daily for 3 days from Day 1-3 in arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will come to the clinic the evening before first dosing of Pyramax / ritonavir. If&#xD;
      enrolled, and according to the treatment arm subjects will stay in the clinic and attend&#xD;
      subsequent visits as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatient day -1 (evening) to day 17&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ambulatory clinic visit once daily (morning) on day 22, 29, 36, 43 and 50 (end of study&#xD;
           visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatient day -1 (evening) to day 4 (morning),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ambulatory clinic visit once daily (morning) on Day 5, 6, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43.(end&#xD;
           of study visit) The subjects will be evaluated for pharmacokinetic parameters and&#xD;
           safety/tolerability.&#xD;
