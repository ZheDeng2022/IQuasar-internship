      The aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of electronic reminder letters versus&#xD;
      postal reminder letters on general practices adherence to clinical quality guidelines&#xD;
      regarding Point Of Care Testing (POCT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Point-of-care testing (POCT) is increasingly being used in general practice to&#xD;
      assist GPs in their management of patients with diseases. An accredited external quality&#xD;
      assessment (EQA) program and internal quality control system is recommended. In the&#xD;
      Copenhagen area external as well as internal quality control has been enforced by annual&#xD;
      outreach consultant visits and by split sample EQA procedures, where POCT results have been&#xD;
      compared with central laboratory results. However, the adherence to quality guidelines has&#xD;
      been seen to be less than anticipated among GPs in the Copenhagen municipality and in the&#xD;
      former county of Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of guidelines alone rarely brings about improvements in clinical practice and&#xD;
      even an multifaceted implementation of guidelines may not change clinical practice. Multiple&#xD;
      strategies for implementing guidelines appear to be more effective than single ones 5;6.&#xD;
      However, well-designed empirical research looking into various implementation strategies is&#xD;
      still needed in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-mails have successfully been used in several studies to promote health behaviour change in&#xD;
      risk populations and our hypothesis is that electronic reminder letters (send to the GPs&#xD;
      electronic patient records) is an efficient and inexpensive way to influence the behaviour of&#xD;
      GP's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the low adherence, the Copenhagen General Practitioners' Laboratory (CGPL) plans to&#xD;
      introduce electronic reminder letters (alongside the standard implementation procedures)&#xD;
      during 2010 in order to increase adherence to the quality guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of electronic reminder letters versus postal reminder letters on&#xD;
      general practices adherence to clinical quality guidelines regarding POCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants All practices conducting POCT INR (Approximately 240 practices). Practices are&#xD;
      allocated to usual CGPL quality guideline activities and postal reminder letters (postal&#xD;
      reminder group) and usual CGPL implementation activities in addition to electronic reminder&#xD;
      letters (electronic reminder group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data on performed split test EQA procedures is retrieved from CGPL database.&#xD;
      These data do not contain any patient related data because all split test EQA are conducted&#xD;
      by a constructed identification code. Process indicators (sent reminder letters) are also&#xD;
      obtained from CGPL. The Capital Region databases provide information on the participating&#xD;
      practices and corresponding GPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from The Capital Region Information regarding: Sex, age, year of graduation from&#xD;
      university, working address, type of practice, patient listed to practice and use the&#xD;
      following tests: Hemoglobin, glucose, INR; CRP, HbA1C were retrospectively collected 4 months&#xD;
      before the start of the trial (tentative in order to establish a baseline). Every month in&#xD;
      the rest of the study period the investigators receive data from the Capital Region regarding&#xD;
      practices in the study areas and identify practices having used Hemoglobin or blood glucose&#xD;
      as a POCT. These data will be compared with the CGPL database every month and those practices&#xD;
      that have not done a split sample EQA will receive electronic reminder letters during the&#xD;
      following 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practices are stratified by area and type of organization by means of SAS (Proc PLAN) by an&#xD;
      independent organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total number of split tests performed in study period (three periods).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proportion of practices with a high quality of tests defined as 75% of the performed&#xD;
           split tests for INR within the accepted interval according to the CGPL quality&#xD;
           guidelines1 in study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Proportion of practices conducting split tests in study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators use a 50% adherence estimate based on CGPL data from 2007 in order to&#xD;
      ascertain the power of the study. Given a MEREDIF at 25% and a power of 90% it is estimated&#xD;
      that 160 practices are to be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in the outcomes between allocation groups at baseline, intervention and outcome&#xD;
      period are tested by means of chi-square tests (outcomes 2 and 3) and t-tests (outcome 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate the development of adherence relative to the intervention the&#xD;
      investigators will for the three periods use logistic (outcome 2 and 3) and linear (outcome&#xD;
      1) regression where the investigators use GEE methods to account for the repeated&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify predictors for adhering to guidelines adjusted odds ratios for the practice&#xD;
      characteristics are estimated in multivariate logistic (outcomes 2 and 3) and linear (outcome&#xD;
      1) regression analysis on the outcomes at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses are performed using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Standard implementation The standard implementation of EQA consists of invited&#xD;
      meetings and an annual facilitator visit in each practice. As part of the planned&#xD;
      implementation strategy GPs were invited to meetings, received written material from the&#xD;
      CGPL. At start each practice received written information from KPLL emphasizing the need of&#xD;
      adhering to the EQA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postal reminder letters&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this group, postal reminder letters are sent to practices not adhering to the guideline&#xD;
      recommendations of split testing within 30 days; i.e. a reminder letter is send when the CGPL&#xD;
      database registers that the last split test or last reminder letter was 31 days ago. Thus,&#xD;
      practices may receive up to four postal reminder letters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic reminder letters&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this group, electronic reminder letters are sent to practices not adhering to the&#xD;
      guideline recommendations of split testing within 30 days; i.e. a reminder letter is send&#xD;
      when the CGPL database registers that the last split test or last reminder letter was 31 days&#xD;
      ago. Thus, practices may receive up to four electronic reminder letters:&#xD;
