  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent short-lasting&#xD;
      attacks (15 to 180 minutes) of excruciating unilateral periorbital pain accompanied by&#xD;
      ipsilateral cranial autonomic signs. The 1-year prevalence of CH is about 0.1 %, the male:&#xD;
      female ratio is 3:1. The majority of patients have cluster periods of weeks to months with&#xD;
      frequent attacks which are alternated with symptom-free periods of months to several years;&#xD;
      the episodic from of CH. In about 10% of patients the CH is chronic (CCH) in which either no&#xD;
      remission occurs within 1 year or the remissions last less than 1 month. At least 10 % of CCH&#xD;
      patients are refractory to medical treatment or cannot tolerate the treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent pilot studies suggest that occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) in medically intractable&#xD;
      CCH (MICCH) might offer an effective alternative to medical treatment. There are no&#xD;
      randomised clinical trials and a placebo effect cannot be excluded. Long term tolerability is&#xD;
      known from other indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators propose a prospective, randomised, double blind, parallel group&#xD;
      multi-centre international clinical study to compare the reduction in attack frequency from&#xD;
      baseline of occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) in patients with MICCH between two different&#xD;
      stimulation conditions: high (100%) and low (30%) stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following implantation there will first be a run-in phase of 10 days of 10% stimulation&#xD;
      intensity, followed by a stepwise monthly increase up to either 30% or 100%. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed monthly by a blinded assessor. The primary outcome measure is the mean number of&#xD;
      attacks over the last 4 weeks of the double blind 6 month treatment period in the 100% versus&#xD;
      the 30% treatment group. Hereafter, in an open extension phase of 6 months, all patients will&#xD;
      receive 100% stimulation or the stimulation considered optimal by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include the rate of responders (≥ 50% reduction in attack&#xD;
      frequency during the last 4 weeks of each treatment period), patient's satisfaction,&#xD;
      medication use, quality of life, mean pain intensity, economic evaluation and whether&#xD;
      patients would recommend the treatment to another patient. The investigators will also&#xD;
      investigate whether predictive factors can be identified for efficacy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) are characterized by frequent, short-lasting attacks&#xD;
      of unilateral extremely severe headaches accompanied by ipsilateral facial autonomic features&#xD;
      and are the most severe of the primary headache disorders. TACs include cluster headache&#xD;
      (CH), paroxysmal hemicrania (PH) and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with&#xD;
      conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT). CH is the most common form of TAC. The 1-year&#xD;
      prevalence is about 1 in 1000, with the vast majority of patients having episodic CH (ECH):&#xD;
      periods of weeks to months with frequent attacks which are alternated with symptom-free&#xD;
      periods of several months to years. About 10% have chronic CH (CCH): attack free periods of&#xD;
      less than one month in every 12 months, unless treatment is given. The chronic form can be&#xD;
      primary unremitting from onset, or can be secondary, transform from the episodic form. CCH&#xD;
      may spontaneously become episodic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective acute treatments for CH attacks are injectable or intranasal triptans and oxygen&#xD;
      inhalation. Steroids (only for a short period), verapamil, lithium carbonate and methysergide&#xD;
      are the most effective preventive therapies. At least 10% of patients with CCH is or may&#xD;
      become refractory to or cannot tolerate medical therapy. For patients with medically&#xD;
      intractable CCH (MICCH) there is no common treatment. Different experimental treatments, such&#xD;
      as deep brain stimulation (DBS), radiofrequency lesions, glycerol injections, gamma knife,&#xD;
      and surgery or root section of the trigeminal nerve are either substantially ineffective, or&#xD;
      have significant short-comings with serious complications such as death or neurological&#xD;
      deficits such as anaesthesia dolorosa or lack of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CH has considerable impact on socio-economic and personal functions due to direct costs of&#xD;
      healthcare services and indirect costs of lost work days and decreased work efficacy. Higher&#xD;
      pain scores and a higher percentage of patients with poor health due to pain and social&#xD;
      functioning are found among CH patients compared with patients suffering from migraine. The&#xD;
      impact on social functions, quality of life and use of healthcare of patients with MICCH is&#xD;
      most likely even larger, although precise figures are not available. In the study of Burns et&#xD;
      al. patients, suffering from MICCH, had on average over four attacks per day. Attacks of CH&#xD;
      have been described by patients as being worse than child birth. Recently treatment of&#xD;
      headache was listed as one of the top priorities of US National the Institute of Medicine's&#xD;
      agenda for comparative-effectiveness research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional imaging studies in CH identified activations in the region of the posterior&#xD;
      hypothalamus, which led to the use of neurostimulation therapy in MICCH. Hypothalamic DBS was&#xD;
      shown to be effective in some patients with MICCH but unfortunately this treatment is&#xD;
      associated with a high risk of (even lethal) consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structures in the occipital region of the head are mainly innervated by the greater occipital&#xD;
      nerve that is a branch of the C2 spinal root. Convergence of cervical, somatic trigeminal and&#xD;
      dural trigeminovascular afferents on second order nociceptors in the brain stem is well&#xD;
      documented. Stimulation of the greater occipital nerve increased metabolic activity in&#xD;
      cervical regions of the spinal cord and in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis in the cat. In&#xD;
      humans an occipital nerve blockade decreased the ipsi- and contralateral R2 response,&#xD;
      confirming the anatomic and functional convergence of afferent cervical and trigeminal&#xD;
      pathways. These studies suggest that modulation of these pathways may influence headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suboccipital injection of corticosteroid with local anaesthetics was shown to be effective in&#xD;
      a placebo-controlled trial. In this study 4 patients suffering from CCH were included. In all&#xD;
      patients the attacks recurred eventually. The authors suggest that suboccipital steroid&#xD;
      injections ought to be tried as a single shot treatment before invasive treatments are&#xD;
      considered such as DBS, but in later studies this turned out to be of no predictive value of&#xD;
      the response to neuromodulation therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along the same line, stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (ONS) has been tried with&#xD;
      some success in intractable headaches including CCH. Burns et al. described 14 patients&#xD;
      suffering from MICCH and were treated with ONS in an open retrospective study. Ten patients&#xD;
      improved; three improved by 90% or more, 3 by 40%-90% and 4 by 20-30%. In a prospective open&#xD;
      ONS study on MICCH patients Magis et al. showed a reduction in attack frequency of 79.9%. No&#xD;
      serious complications were described in both studies.&#xD;
