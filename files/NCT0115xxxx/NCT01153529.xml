  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research project is to identify genes that contribute to or guard&#xD;
      against developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to better understand how genes&#xD;
      and life experiences work together to impact PTSD. Inherited traits are passed down from one&#xD;
      generation to the next in genes. Genes contain molecules called DNA, which contain the&#xD;
      information that determines our characteristics and carries instructions for constructing and&#xD;
      operating our body. Most human diseases have an inherited element. In addition, we, the&#xD;
      investigators, hope to learn about how genes and the other materials we find in participants'&#xD;
      blood relate to other illnesses and behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the feasibility project covered by this application is to test the possibility of&#xD;
      conducting research on a large number of veterans in order to look at the association between&#xD;
      genes and PTSD. We are inviting 1,000 OEF/OIF veterans to participate, of these, we are&#xD;
      anticipating approximately 250 veterans who have served in Afghanistan and/or Iraq to&#xD;
      participate in this study. Although 250 participants is our target enrollment, we plan to&#xD;
      enroll all veterans included in our initial mailings who desire to participate. We do not&#xD;
      anticipate this to exceed 500 individuals. This phase of the study is expected to last about&#xD;
      one year. Specific aims are: 1. evaluation of sampling methods and participation rates; 2.&#xD;
      field testing of assessment batteries including reliability and validity; and 3. evaluation&#xD;
      of the proposed DNA collection and storage procedures.&#xD;

      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this feasibility project is to evaluate the feasibility of collecting&#xD;
      a case-control cohort of OEF/OIF veterans that is large enough to make possible the&#xD;
      identification of genetic variants that affect the risk for PTSD after exposure to traumatic&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also determine if the DNA samples will be of sufficient quality for subsequent&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the main project which is not covered by this application is to&#xD;
      identify genes that affect the risk of developing PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RESEARCH QUESTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A.What will be the participation rates for the proposed recruitment strategy?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  B.How well will the proposed assessment batteries work and are there components&#xD;
                that will need to be modified?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  C.How well will the proposed sampling methods work?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  D.Will any proposed study procedures need to be changed to make them work better?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STUDY AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims have been developed for this feasibility phase of a main study that will&#xD;
      have the goal of identifying the most important genes that influence risk and resilience for&#xD;
      PTSD and understanding how those genes interact with environmental stressors to cause (or&#xD;
      protect from) the clinical disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility phase protocol presented here is designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1.Evaluate sampling methods and participation rates in the proposed populations to&#xD;
           determine recruitment feasibility for the main study,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2.Develop field experience with proposed assessment batteries and measure reliability&#xD;
           and validity to adjust if necessary for the main study,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3.Pilot the feasibility of DNA collection, storage and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the feasibility phase is complete, a protocol for the main study will be planned and&#xD;
      submitted for scientific peer review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OEF/OIF Roster generated by the Defense Manpower Data Center will be used to obtain a&#xD;
      list of veterans who have served in at least one of the two theaters of operation since the&#xD;
      beginning of the conflict in Iraq and/or Afghanistan. Access to this roster is managed by the&#xD;
      VA Environmental Epidemiology Service (EES). This roster currently contains 1,001,463&#xD;
      veterans, of whom 888,454 are male and 475,155 have sought treatment within the VA. Data&#xD;
      points abstracted from the roster include, but are not limited to, name, address, SSN, birth&#xD;
      date, combat end date, end service date, separation date, military branch, and deployment&#xD;
      country. To achieve our target enrollment of 250, 1,000 veterans from the roster will be&#xD;
      randomly selected for potential participation. After the sample of 1,000 is randomly drawn,&#xD;
      the Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center (CSPCC) will mail out letters inviting&#xD;
      study participation. We expect the initial 1,000 mailings to yield the following results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  300 letters will be non-deliverable for which another address search and re-mail will&#xD;
           take place. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that 200 letters will remain undeliverable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  800 letters will be deliverable out of which 400 are expected to yield no response after&#xD;
           2 weeks. Second reminder letters will be sent to those potential participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  500 will respond within 2 more weeks with 250 willing to participate (including stated&#xD;
           willingness to provide DNA sample) and 250 not interested in participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the above estimates do not yield a minimum of 250 participants, a second wave of mailings&#xD;
      will be sent to a new sample of potential participants (N to be determined based on&#xD;
      participation rate from the first N = 1000 mailings). Although 250 participants is our target&#xD;
      enrollment, we plan to enroll all veterans included in our initial mailings who desire to&#xD;
      participate. We do not anticipate this to exceed 500 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will indicate their interest in this study by returning the response&#xD;
      letter or by directly calling a dedicated toll-free telephone number. The VA website&#xD;
      (http://www.csp.research.va.gov/ ) will have both descriptive information about the study&#xD;
      which participants may view at any time as well as the approved informed consent documents.&#xD;
      Participants will have an opportunity to ask questions about the study by contacting the&#xD;
      study team at CSPCC. The information that we plan on including in the website is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While loss of confidentiality cannot be guaranteed and could be a possible risk, steps will&#xD;
      be taken to minimize the risk of loss of confidentiality. First, all collected data received&#xD;
      by the Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center will be stored in locked file cabinets&#xD;
      in a locked office to which only study team members will have access. In addition, Study ID&#xD;
      numbers will be used to identify materials with participant responses. Any identifying&#xD;
      information will be maintained separately (locked cabinet in a different office).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regards to participant discomfort, the participants are reminded at the beginning of the&#xD;
      interview that they can refuse to answer any questions and discontinue participation at any&#xD;
      time. If issues related to trauma memories arise, the participants are asked if they want to&#xD;
      be contacted by the study clinician or if they would like to be provided with other&#xD;
      medical/mental health resources. Participants will also be asked if they need a break at&#xD;
      different intervals during the interview should the participant be experiencing any fatigue&#xD;
      due to the duration of the survey. If the participant becomes upset, the study clinician will&#xD;
      be contacted by the interviewer. If they simply want to talk to the clinician (per exit&#xD;
      interview criteria, then they can as well). If the participant requests assistance without&#xD;
      being upset or distressed, they will be provided with information to connect with local&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of the psychologist will be to collaborate with all study staff, work directly with&#xD;
      the study clinician, interface with central IRB and will be the first line resource where&#xD;
      decisions need to be made and the first line resource for the coordinating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood sample will be taken by a certified home health nurse who has experience in&#xD;
      minimizing and managing venipuncture side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to minimize potential risks related to genetic samples by never revealing genotype&#xD;
      information to participants. No genotypes will become part of the participants' medical&#xD;
      records. Participant samples will be coded and the same codes will be used to identify&#xD;
      participants in the computer database. The computer files will be password protected. Any&#xD;
      hard copies will be maintained in locked filing cabinets in a locked office, and the code&#xD;
      book will be locked in a different office. Blood samples sent to Massachusetts Veterans&#xD;
      Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC) will be placed in secure storage.&#xD;
      Although these blood samples will not be banked as part of the CSPG001 - VA Genomic Medicine&#xD;
      Program: Specimen Collection and Banking Protocol, they will be processed using their&#xD;
      approved established procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Feasibility Outcomes and Resultant Decision Processes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1. Participation Rate Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  (a)If fewer than 1 in 10 participants are &quot;cases&quot; (i.e., have current PTSD), then&#xD;
                feasibility of the main study is in question, as this would require a sample of&#xD;
                over 100,000 screening interviews to achieve the future target sample size of N =&#xD;
                10,000 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  (b) If fewer than 1 in 4 potential participants agree to participate and follow&#xD;
                through to providing a DNA sample, then feasibility is in question, as this would&#xD;
                indicate a need for more than 4 times as many contacts in order to achieve&#xD;
                sufficient screening interviews to yield the final sample. A participation rate&#xD;
                lower than 1 in 4 would also indicate sufficient non-representativeness of the&#xD;
                sample that findings could be questioned on the basis of unknowable sample biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2.Assessment Batteries Evaluation and Reliability :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  (a)Time to complete the paper-and-pencil and interview measures will be recorded,&#xD;
                and some measures may be dropped to minimize participant burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  (b)Psychometric properties of customized measures will be determined, and if&#xD;
                unsuitable will be dropped, improved, or substituted. Specific critical measures to&#xD;
                be evaluated are:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  i.)PTSD interview components: Comparison of positive and negative predictive&#xD;
                     values of the War Related Illness and Injury Study Center Questionnaire&#xD;
                     (Section IV of the telephone interview)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  ii.)and the Short-Screening Scale for DSM-IV Posttraumatic Stress Disorder&#xD;
                     screen. Optimum measures require PPV and NPV &gt; 0.8&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  iii.)MINI interview for lifetime and current PTSD: Validity versus CAPS with&#xD;
                     kappa &gt; 0.7 for lifetime diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3.If the study's response system to participant psychological distress is needed during&#xD;
           this phase, the safety plan will be evaluated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4.Determine types and frequency of reported psychological distress to the telephone&#xD;
           interview. Ensure suitable emergency response plan available for participants who&#xD;
           describe psychological distress (e.g., suicidal ideation) during the telephone&#xD;
           interview.&#xD;
