  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to measure the effectiveness of a new intervention to decrease use of&#xD;
      services of primary care frequent attenders (FA).Among the secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost utility of the new intervention compared with usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: There will be a randomized controlled trial with cluster assignment. It will take&#xD;
      place in the field of primary care in the city of Malaga.It will be evaluated a new&#xD;
      multicomponent intervention called &quot;7H&quot; (7 Hypothesis). This intervention will be applied on&#xD;
      the FA by their family doctors in the intervention group. In the control group will be&#xD;
      developed usual cares.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is the total of visits of FA at 12 months of the follow-up. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include changes happened in biopsychosocial health, satisfaction, and quality of&#xD;
      life measurements. The investigators will assess the dependent and independents (from FA,&#xD;
      general practitioner [GP] and health centres) variables at baseline, and 12 months. At&#xD;
      baseline it will be include a random sample of 450 FA (225 for each arm), belonging to 30&#xD;
      family doctors of 10 health centres. It will be performed linear regression multilevel models&#xD;
      with 4 levels (time, patient, doctor and health centre) to evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention. . Moreover will be undertaken multivariate gamma and quantile regressions to&#xD;
      assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility respectively of the new intervention versus&#xD;
      usual cares, estimating their standard errors by bootstrap calculations.&#xD;

      The &quot;7H&quot; intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypothesis generation: analysis of available informationGPs analyze all the available&#xD;
           information about possible reasons for frequent attendance from clinical charts using a&#xD;
           standardized questionnaire designed to facilitate analysis of this information. This&#xD;
           questionnaire prompts analysis of the following: (1) category of visits and their&#xD;
           frequencies; (2) type of frequent attender according to the first point; (3) family and&#xD;
           personal history, and biopsychosocial problem list that needed follow-up; (4) searching&#xD;
           for common factors for frequent attendance from the previous points; (5) feelings and&#xD;
           thoughts questionnaires, 'In most interviews with this patient I think ...' (11 items),&#xD;
           'I feel ...' (13 items); (6) rethinking issues of GP capacity (and processes) to resolve&#xD;
           the frequent attendance in this patient; and (7) analyzing the different professionals&#xD;
           who intervened in patient care and their contribution to resolving or continuing&#xD;
           frequent attendance.Finally, GPs indicate the type of hypothesis from a list of seven&#xD;
           that they believe made the patient a frequent attender: biological, psychological,&#xD;
           social, family, cultural, administrative-organizational, or related to the&#xD;
           doctor-patient relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis confirmation: the decision to accept or refute each hypothesis is based on&#xD;
           the GP's interpretation of the data (cognitive component) and the self-perception about&#xD;
           feeling sure (emotional component). When necessary, the GPs can try out the hypothesis&#xD;
           with one or more of the following strategies: another interview with the&#xD;
           patient,biological and psychosocial tests, and/or asking for the opinion of other&#xD;
           professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Planning: the GP makes plans for each frequent attender based on the confirmed&#xD;
           hypothesis and available resources. There are many possible plans, examples of which&#xD;
           include: making longer intervals between medical revisits for stable chronic patients,&#xD;
           and asking for collaboration with nurses; looking for possible causes of the unstable&#xD;
           physical chronic illness and intervening accordingly; scheduling an interview to search&#xD;
           for a psychological, family or/and, social diagnosis; suppressing unnecessary&#xD;
           face-to-face medical revisits for repeat prescriptions in stable chronic patients, and&#xD;
           asking the health centre administrative staff for collaboration; asking the social&#xD;
           worker at the health centre for help; referring to community resources if necessary; and&#xD;
           being more realistic about the type of doctor-patient relationship expected. These plans&#xD;
           are then commented on at the group meeting, after which the GP negotiates the plan with&#xD;
           the frequent attender. The GP should never suggest to the patient: 'You have to attend&#xD;
           less frequently'. This would be too aggressive and the patient might react with anger or&#xD;
           guilt. It is better to offer a search for solutions to the patient's health problem from&#xD;
           both points of view.&#xD;

    <description>The GPs in the intervention group will undertake an interactive workshop training session (15 hours) on the '7 hypotheses' (7H) intervention. In short, this intervention encourages GPs to select from a list of seven possible hypotheses for why the patient is a frequent attender: biological, psychological, social, family, cultural, administrative-organisational, or related to the doctor-patient relationship.</description>
