    <textblock>
      The present prospective, multicenter study will therefore be performed with the primary&#xD;
      objective of establishing the correlation between fractional flow reserve (FFR) and&#xD;
      intravascular ultrasound with virtual histology (VH-IVUS)-derived parameters in&#xD;
      angiographically intermediate coronary lesions. The current study will also examine the&#xD;
      relative prognostic utility of FFR and VH-IVUS as a tool to defer percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI), by assessing the long-term rate (up to 3 years) of lesion-related&#xD;
      clinical events if deferred by FFR vs. VH-IVUS versus not deferred PCI.&#xD;

        Patient-specific inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical presentation: stable angina, unstable angina, non-ST segment-elevation&#xD;
             myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (Braunwald classification of unstable angina, see&#xD;
             Attachment 2) or recent STEMI (&gt;48 hours before enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is scheduled for coronary catheterization with or without percutaneous&#xD;
             coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is able to read, understand, and sign the informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient agrees to all protocol related procedures, including follow-up through 3&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lesion-specific inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has at least one intermediate coronary lesion to be assessed by FFR and&#xD;
             VH-IVUS, defined as a lesion with a visually-estimated diameter stenosis ≥40% to &lt;80%&#xD;
             with a visually-estimated angiographic reference segment diameter of 2.75 mm - 4.0 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. There may only be one study lesion in the major epicardial coronary artery or its&#xD;
             branches. All other stenosis in this epicardial coronary artery or its branches must&#xD;
             be &lt;40% by visual angiographic assessment. E.g.., if the lesion is in the Left&#xD;
             Anterior Descending(LAD), there may be no other significant lesions (≥40%) in the LAD,&#xD;
             septals or diagonal branches. A single lesion may have normal or nearly normal&#xD;
             appearing segments within the lesion as long as it is contained within one CASS&#xD;
             segment. Moreover, a single lesion may span two or more CASS segments as long as there&#xD;
             is no normal or nearly normal appearing segments &gt;5mm in length within the lesion.&#xD;
             However, if a diseased lesion extends across two or more CASS segments and has one or&#xD;
             more &gt;5 mm lengths of normal or nearly normal appearing segments within the lesion,&#xD;
             then it is considered 2 separate lesions, and may not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. More than 1 intermediate lesion per patient may be enrolled, as long as each lesion&#xD;
             meets the entry criteria as a study lesion (e.g. one intermediate lesion in 1, 2 or 3&#xD;
             unique epicardial coronary arteries (LAD vs. LCX vs. RCA), with FFR and VH-IVUS&#xD;
             performed in each vessel. Thus, up to 3 lesions may be enrolled per patient (one in&#xD;
             each major epicardial coronary artery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. PCI of any lesion in the target vessel (the main epicardial coronary artery or any of&#xD;
             its branches) may not have been performed in the preceding 1 year (including during&#xD;
             the index procedure) and may not be planned within the next 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients undergoing PCI of non-study lesions in non-study target vessels during the&#xD;
             index procedure may be enrolled if one or more qualifying intermediate lesion is&#xD;
             otherwise present in a different epicardial vessel, but PCI of all non-study lesions&#xD;
             must be performed first (including staged procedures) and must be successful and&#xD;
             uncomplicated before formal enrollment into this study. The PCI cannot occur in the&#xD;
             epicardial coronary artery or its branches containing the intermediate lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Successful PCI is defined as residual diameter stenosis of &lt;50% in all treated&#xD;
                  lesions with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) -3 flow in all treated&#xD;
                  vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncomplicated PCI is defined as the absence of intra-procedural chest pain or&#xD;
                  ST-segment changes lasting &gt;10 minutes, sustained vessel closure, slow or no&#xD;
                  reflow, side branch loss, distal embolization, perforation, residual dissection&#xD;
                  (&gt;type B), or requirement for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, cardioversion or&#xD;
                  defibrillation, pacemaker insertion, intubation, intra-aortic balloon insertion&#xD;
                  or intravenous pressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient-specific exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior CABG at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient is likely to undergo PCI, CABG or other cardiac surgical procedure within&#xD;
             1 year of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction within 48 hours of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Cardiogenic shock defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg lasting &gt;30 minutes, not&#xD;
             responding to intravenous fluids, and/or requiring intravenous pressors or an&#xD;
             intra-aortic balloon pump or other hemodynamic support device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Heart failure as defined by New York Heart Association class III or IV (see Attachment&#xD;
             2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Respiratory failure requiring intubation or supplementary oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30% as determined by 2D echo, nuclear testing,&#xD;
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or left ventriculography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any moderate or severe cardiac valve disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the past 60 days,&#xD;
             or any permanent neurologic deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt; 2.5mg/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of drug abuse or alcohol abuse or any other condition making it unlikely that&#xD;
             the patient will comply with all study procedures, including follow-up for 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any condition with expected survival &lt;2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Pregnant or nursing patients and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year&#xD;
             following the index procedure. Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients currently participating in another study of an investigational drug or device&#xD;
             which has not yet reached its primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Oral intake by the patient of any caffeinated beverage within 4 hours of the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Use within 12 hours of theophylline, aminophylline or any xanthine derivative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lesion-specific exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. An unprotected left main coronary stenosis is present (visually assessed %DS ≥40%,&#xD;
             whether or not requiring treatment). The study lesion cannot be a left main lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The intermediate lesion is in a vessel with thrombus, moderate or severe&#xD;
             calcification, angulation, or tortuosity. PCI may be performed in such non target&#xD;
             vessels or lesions prior to study enrollment, however, as long as successful and&#xD;
             uncomplicated, after which the patient is enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The study lesion is an ostial lesion (within 5 mm of the aorta or the distal left main&#xD;
             coronary artery) or is bifurcation lesion requiring planned dual stenting.&#xD;
