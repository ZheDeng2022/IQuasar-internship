  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine any differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of&#xD;
      darapladib when dosed to people with moderate liver disease as compared to when dosed in&#xD;
      normal healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, non-randomised study to assess the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      safety/tolerability of repeat oral 40 mg doses of darapladib in subjects with moderate&#xD;
      hepatic impairment (as defined by a Child-Pugh score of 7-9) in comparison to matched healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hepatically impaired and healthy volunteer groups will receive repeat oral doses of&#xD;
      darapladib for 10 consecutive days. The pharmacokinetics of darapladib and its metabolites&#xD;
      will be evaluated. The effect of liver impairment on the plasma protein binding of darapladib&#xD;
      and metabolites will also be determined as data permit. Safety will be assessed by clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry and urinalysis), vital signs (blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate measurements), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and monitoring for adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be housed in the clinical unit from the evening before first dose until 24&#xD;
      hours after the final dose of 10 days of repeat dosing. A follow-up period will include 2&#xD;
      visits, one of which will be conducted approximately 10-14 days from the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug and the second visit will be 35 days +/- one week after the last dose of study drug&#xD;
