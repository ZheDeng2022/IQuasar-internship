      This was a 48-week, open-label, prospective, multicentric, randomised, comparative with&#xD;
      parallel control, Phase 4 study to evaluate the effects of Saizen on cardiac function in GHD&#xD;
      subjects during the transition phase from childhood to adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed to evaluate whether recombinant-human growth hormone (r-hGH) treatment&#xD;
      also benefits young subjects with GHD. Some trials have already been published on this&#xD;
      subject, but they were mainly focused on the bone density.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Growth hormone is a 191 amino acid polypeptide hormone (MW 22,000) normally synthesised and&#xD;
      secreted by the somatotrophic cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. In normal&#xD;
      development, growth hormone and somatomedins are responsible for many of the manifestations&#xD;
      of normal growth and GHD is manifested by a marked short stature. Growth hormone deficiency&#xD;
      has been treated by human growth hormone for many years. Serono's r-hGH (Saizen) is produced&#xD;
      from genetically engineered mammalian cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from previous clinical studies on GH treatment in GH-deficient adults,&#xD;
      collectively indicate that the majority of adults with long-standing GH deficiency, whether&#xD;
      dating from childhood or acquired in adult life, are compromised both physically and&#xD;
      psychologically and can derive clinical benefit from GH replacement. Based on observations in&#xD;
      the clinical trials to date , a GH dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day (50% of the dose used in children),&#xD;
      is likely to be satisfactory for many subjects. Moreover, it should be possible to minimise&#xD;
      early side effects, particularly fluid retention, by initiating treatment with half of this&#xD;
      dose and increasing to the final dose after 4 weeks if well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it was proposed to enroll a group of childhood onset GHD subjects who were not&#xD;
      treated with r-hGH. Half of the study population started treatment for six months whilst the&#xD;
      other half remained on no r-hGH treatment. After six months the group already on r-hGH&#xD;
      therapy continued treatment for a further six months and the second group presently on no&#xD;
      r-hGH treatment started r hGH treatment for the remaining six months of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effects of Saizen on cardiac function (as assessed by percentage ejection&#xD;
           fraction) in subjects where 50% of the study population started r-hGH treatment for 24&#xD;
           weeks and then remained on r-hGH treatment for a further 24 weeks and subjects who&#xD;
           continued on no r-hGH for 24 weeks before starting r-hGH for 24 weeks during the&#xD;
           transition phase from childhood to adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the safety and tolerability of r-hGH in subjects who were transitioning from&#xD;
      childhood to adulthood, and to assess the change in body composition and lean body mass.&#xD;
      Subsidiary analyses of the other echocardiography parameters was also performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After entry into the trial, the subjects were randomised to one of two groups for a 48-week&#xD;
      period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Saizen (r-hGH), 0.15-1.00 mg/day for 48 weeks, subcutaneous (s.c.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: No treatment for the first 24 weeks followed by Saizen (r-hGH)0.15-1.00 mg/day&#xD;
           for the next 24 weeks, s.c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' visits to the study site was scheduled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 - Baseline (study day 1), weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 &amp; 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - Baseline (study day 1), weeks 12, 24, 28, 36 &amp; 48. The study drug was&#xD;
           administered subcutaneously once daily in the evenings during the active treatment&#xD;
           period. The dose was to be adjusted stepwise, controlled by Insulin-Growth Factor-I&#xD;
           (IGF-I) values. The recommended final r-hGH dose was not to exceed 1.00mg/day&#xD;
