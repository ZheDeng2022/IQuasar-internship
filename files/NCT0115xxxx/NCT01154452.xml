      This randomized phase I/II clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of&#xD;
      gamma-secretase/notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 when given together with&#xD;
      vismodegib and to see how well they work in treating patients with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      sarcoma. Vismodegib may slow the growth of tumor cells. Gamma-secretase/notch signalling&#xD;
      pathway inhibitor RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving vismodegib together with gamma-secretase/notch&#xD;
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 may be an effective treatment for sarcoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097&#xD;
      (RO4929097) when given in combination with fixed-dose Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 (GDC-0449)&#xD;
      which will become the recommended dose for the phase II portion of this study. (Phase Ib) II.&#xD;
      To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) of the combination of RO4929097 with and&#xD;
      without GDC-0449 in two arms of patients with advanced sarcoma. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the tolerability and adverse event profile of daily GDC-0449 administered&#xD;
      orally in combination with daily RO4929097 administered orally for 21 consecutive days.&#xD;
      (Phase Ib) II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of the combination of the combination of&#xD;
      GDC-0449 and RO4929097. (Phase Ib) III. To assess Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 overall response rates (complete and partial response [CR+PR]) for&#xD;
      combination therapy. (Phase Ib and II) IV. To conduct pharmacodynamic studies in tissue&#xD;
      biopsies (pre- and post-study) for explorative and hypothesis-generating studies. (Phase Ib&#xD;
      and II) V. To assess overall survival. (Phase II) VI. To further describe the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the combination of GDC-0449 and RO4929097 at the&#xD;
      phase II dose at the continuous schedule. (Phase II) V. To conduct pharmacodynamic studies in&#xD;
      tissue biopsies (pre- and post- study drug[s]) for explorative and hypothesis generating&#xD;
      studies. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase/notch signalling pathway&#xD;
      inhibitor RO4929097 followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE IB:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART A: Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART B: Beginning within 7 days of finishing part A, patients receive vismodegib PO and&#xD;
      gamma-secretase/notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD on days 1-21. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive gamma-secretase/notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD on&#xD;
      days 1-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive vismodegib PO and gamma-secretase/notch signalling pathway inhibitor&#xD;
      RO4929097 PO QD on days 1-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
