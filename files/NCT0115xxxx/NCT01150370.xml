      The protocol, approved by the Rwanda National Ethical Committee, was issued to assess the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the circumcision device for applying it to the national scale up of&#xD;
      adult male circumcision in Rwanda&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple randomized and controlled studies (WHO, USAID, UNAIDS) have proven that circumcised&#xD;
      men in high risk areas reduce their risk of HIV infection by 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Government of Rwanda has ranked HIV prevention as a top priority item, and wishes to&#xD;
      decrease the HIV incidence in the country by 50%. As part of a holistic HIV prevention&#xD;
      approach, we decided to embark upon a process of national scale up of adult male&#xD;
      circumcision. The national HIV prevention plan calls for voluntary MC of 2 million adults by&#xD;
      the end of 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PrePex System was designed to enable safe, effective, painless and bloodless male&#xD;
      circumcision programs, to support global public health efforts to stop the spread of HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PrePex System includes a simple, disposable device that is easy to use and can be&#xD;
      deployed by minimally trained healthcare professionals, in urban or rural settings, without&#xD;
      the need for sterile, hospital settings. As such, The PrePex System places minimal burden on&#xD;
      the existing health care infrastructure to accomplish national circumcision programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol, approved by the Rwanda National Ethical Committee, was issued to assess the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the circumcision device for applying it to the national scale up of&#xD;
      adult male circumcision in Rwanda.&#xD;
