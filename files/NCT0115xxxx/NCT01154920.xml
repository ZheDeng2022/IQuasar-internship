    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn which chemotherapy combination is more&#xD;
      effective in treating locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The side&#xD;
      effects of these combinations will also be studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment on this study consists of 2 parts. The first part of your treatment is called&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy and will last for 6-9 weeks, depending on which group you are in. The&#xD;
      second part of treatment will be radiation therapy (either with or without chemotherapy). The&#xD;
      type of treatment you will receive depends on the site and stage of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel, carboplatin, and 5-fluorouracil are designed to block cancer cells from dividing,&#xD;
      which may cause them to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cells to die.&#xD;
      It may also damage blood vessels in tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin has a platinum atom at its center. The platinum is supposed to poison the cancer&#xD;
      cells, which may cause them to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking proteins&#xD;
      inside the cancer cell, called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. There is an equal chance of being assigned to either&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group A, you will receive cetuximab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group B, you will receive cetuximab, docetaxel, cisplatin, and&#xD;
           5-fluorouracil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During induction, you will receive cetuximab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin by vein once a week&#xD;
      for 6 weeks. During Week 1, the cetuximab infusion will last about 2 hours. During Weeks 2-6,&#xD;
      the cetuximab infusion will last about 1 hour. Following the cetuximab infusion, you will&#xD;
      receive paclitaxel over about 1 hour followed by carboplatin over about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your vital signs will be monitored before, during, and after the cetuximab infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During induction, you will receive cetuximab, docetaxel, and cisplatin by vein. You will also&#xD;
      receive 5-fluorouracil as a non-stop infusion over 4 days through an infusion pump. This pump&#xD;
      is portable so that you can have this treatment on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each 21-day cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive cetuximab over about 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive docetaxel over about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive cisplatin over about 1-3 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will then begin receiving 5-fluorouracil. This infusion will be non-stop over the&#xD;
           next 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2 of each cycle, you will receive saline (salt water) to prevent dehydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 5-10 of each cycle, you will take antibiotics, by mouth, to prevent infection. Your&#xD;
      doctor will tell you what type of antibiotic to take.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8 of each cycle, you will receive cetuximab over about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have 3 cycles of induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other drugs may be given before you receive the study drugs to prevent side effects. You will&#xD;
      be closely monitored for side effects during the infusions in the clinic setting before you&#xD;
      will be allowed to leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have completed your induction therapy, you will have a CT scan, MRI scan, and/or a&#xD;
      PET-CT to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you begin radiation, you will have a dental exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will begin either radiation with chemotherapy or radiation without chemotherapy. Your&#xD;
      doctor will decide which treatment is best for you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will begin radiation about 2-4 weeks after induction therapy. You will&#xD;
      receive radiation Monday through Friday for about 7 weeks, or as recommended by the treating&#xD;
      radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are receiving radiation with chemotherapy, you will receive carboplatin or cisplatin&#xD;
      every week while you are receiving radiation. If you receive cisplatin, it will be given by&#xD;
      vein over about 1-3 hours. If you are given carboplatin, it will be given by vein over about&#xD;
      1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your skin and the lining of your mouth will be checked for sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 6 weeks after you finish all treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your skin and the lining of your mouth will be checked for sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you were in Group B, you will have a CT scan, MRI scan, and/or PET/CT scan at 6 weeks (+/-&#xD;
      14 days) after you have completed radiation/chemoradiation to check the status of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you were in Group A, you will have a CT scan, MRI scan, and/or PET/CT scan at 9 weeks (+/-&#xD;
      14 days) after you have completed radiation/chemoradiation to check the status of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six (6), 12, and 24 months after you finish treatment, you will have a videofluoroscopic to&#xD;
      check your swallowing. You will complete a separate consent form for this procedure. You will&#xD;
      also complete the questionnaire about your day-to-day activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have clinic visits every 3 months for 2 years. At these visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have additional tests/procedures performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Year 2, follow up will be done per standard of care. You will be contacted by a&#xD;
      member of the study team by phone or by letter and asked about you how you are doing and if&#xD;
      you have received any other treatment for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on treatment for about 15-16 weeks. If, during that time, the disease gets&#xD;
      worse or you experience intolerable side effects, you will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. All of the study drugs are FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available. The combination of these drugs when given to patients with locally advanced head&#xD;
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 128 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 100 will be enrolled MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
