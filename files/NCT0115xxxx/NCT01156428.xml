  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate in patients with kidney disease, the role that certain inflammatory&#xD;
      and immune mediators play in promoting kidney damage. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      certain mediators, (identified in the serum, urine and renal biopsy tissue), of patients with&#xD;
      a variety of different renal disease states will provide information regarding their clinical&#xD;
      course and that inflammatory and immune patterns in the serum and urine of patients with&#xD;
      kidney disease may yield predictive diagnostic information in place of a renal biopsy. The&#xD;
      ability to detect and quantify these mediators may lead to earlier detection and treatment of&#xD;
      kidney disease in order to prevent kidney failure and the requirement for renal replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate serum, blood and urine collected over a one year period post kidney&#xD;
      biopsy for the presence of inflammatory or immune mediators, which will be correlated with&#xD;
      kidney pathology findings (gene signatures). These gene signatures will be compared to&#xD;
      &quot;normal&quot; control specimens obtained from donor transplant kidneys or from normal kidney&#xD;
      tissue obtained from patients who require their entire kidney removed for a tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate in humans inflammatory and immune mediators that may play&#xD;
      a role in kidney damage. The investigators hypothesize that certain inflammatory and immune&#xD;
      mediators identified in the serum and/or urine of patients with a variety of different renal&#xD;
      disease states will provide prognostic information regarding their clinical course.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we hypothesize that RNA transcriptional profiling of renal biopsy specimens will&#xD;
      identify gene array patterns that provide prognostic information for various disease states.&#xD;
      Lastly, we hypothesize that patterns of inflammatory and immune mediators identified in serum&#xD;
      and/or urine may yield predictive diagnostic information in lieu of renal biopsy. The ability&#xD;
      to detect and quantify these mediators may lead to earlier detection and treatment prior to&#xD;
      the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to stage 4 and/or 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate serially collected serum, blood and urine over a one-year period post&#xD;
      kidney biopsy for both the presence of inflammatory or immune mediators. The blood, serum and&#xD;
      urine inflammatory and immune mediators will be correlated with the kidney pathology gene&#xD;
      signature. Note that all of the biopsies are conducted based upon clinical indication and not&#xD;
      for the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal pathology gene signatures obtained from study subjects will be compared to &quot;normal&quot;&#xD;
      control specimens. Normal specimens will be obtained from donor transplant kidneys or&#xD;
      nephrectomy specimens performed on patients undergoing nephrectomy for the clinical&#xD;
      indication of an identified renal mass. Representative &quot;normal&quot; tissue will be obtained from&#xD;
      the nephrectomized kidney at a site distant from the renal mass.&#xD;
