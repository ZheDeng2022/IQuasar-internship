  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric (obesity) surgery has become the preferred treatment option for patients with&#xD;
      severe obesity and is increasing in popularity. It is commonly performed, with nearly 350 000&#xD;
      operations in the world every year. The most common type of bariatric surgery is gastric&#xD;
      bypass, in which stomach size is reduced by 95% and the upper intestine is bypassed. Bypass&#xD;
      of the upper intestine may lead to medication malabsorption, although this potential adverse&#xD;
      effect has received little study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine whether gastric bypass reduces the absorption of&#xD;
      a azithromycin, a medication commonly prescribed first-line for infections, especially&#xD;
      pneumonia. Patients and non-surgical controls will receive a single dose of azithromycin&#xD;
      under highly standardized study conditions. The absorption of azithromycin will be calculated&#xD;
      and compared between surgical and non-surgical study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that there will be a significant reduction in the absorption&#xD;
      of azithromycin in gastric bypass patients compared to non-surgical controls. This raises the&#xD;
      possibility that post-gastric bypass patients treated with azithromycin may fail to respond&#xD;
      to treatment, become worse and even die. This study will have important implications for the&#xD;
      large number of past and future gastric bypass recipients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the past decade, bariatric surgery has emerged as the preferred treatment option for&#xD;
      patients with either severe obesity [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m2] or moderate obesity&#xD;
      (BMI 35.0-39.9 kg/m2) and a major medical complication (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, sleep&#xD;
      apnea). Surgery reduces weight by 33% after 2-3 years, and is associated with improvements in&#xD;
      obesity-related comorbidities, mortality and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, demand for bariatric surgery is increasing at an exponential rate in Canada,&#xD;
      the United States and globally, with 350 000 estimated surgeries performed annually globally.&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the most commonly performed type of bariatric&#xD;
      procedure. This operation restricts stomach capacity 5% of its original size and bypasses the&#xD;
      duodenum and much of the jejunum. The major adverse consequence of intestinal bypass is&#xD;
      nutrient malabsorption leading to deficiencies of iron, fat-soluble vitamins and vitamin B12.&#xD;
      The malabsorption of drugs, many of which are designed to be maximally absorbed in the upper&#xD;
      small intestine, is also a major potential concern. Surprisingly, this issue has received&#xD;
      surprisingly little attention in the published literature. A number of factors may&#xD;
      contributed to reduced absorption post-bypass, delayed gastric emptying, reduced intestinal&#xD;
      transit time, diminished opportunity for mucosal exposure, and changes in drug solubility&#xD;
      resulting from alterations in intestinal pH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic that interferes with ribosomal protein synthesis, is&#xD;
      indicated for the treatment of respiratory tract, skin/soft tissue, sinus and pelvic&#xD;
      infections. Azithromycin is most commonly prescribed orally for the treatment of&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and is recommended as first-line treatment in patients&#xD;
      with this condition who are being managed on an outpatient basis. CAP accounts for over 1&#xD;
      million physician visits, 60 000 hospital admissions, 640 000 days of restricted activity and&#xD;
      (together with influenza) is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States. In&#xD;
      Edmonton, at least 50% of CAP is managed as with outpatient therapy. Post-bariatric surgery&#xD;
      patients who develop CAP and are treated with outpatient oral antibiotics would clearly be at&#xD;
      risk of treatment failure if the antibiotic is not optimally absorbed. Treatment failure may&#xD;
      pose a significant risk of respiratory complications or death. Unfortunately, no studies have&#xD;
      examined the absorption of antibiotics post-gastric bypass. Because, azithromycin is&#xD;
      intrinsically poorly absorbed, with a bioavailability of only 38%, suboptimal absorption&#xD;
      post-gastric bypass is a major concern. The purpose of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      gastric bypass results in clinically significant reductions in azithromycin absorption.&#xD;
