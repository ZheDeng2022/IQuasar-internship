  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is a respiratory infection that is&#xD;
      sometimes difficult to diagnose. Proper diagnosis depends on accurate collection of&#xD;
      respiratory secretions, but these secretions may be contaminated by bacteria present in the&#xD;
      mouth at the time of collection. In addition, some individuals may have difficulty providing&#xD;
      respiratory secretions, because the infection affects lung function and sputum production. By&#xD;
      collecting new samples from individuals who have already been diagnosed with this infection,&#xD;
      and comparing the methods of collection, researchers hope to better understand and improve&#xD;
      the ability to accurately diagnose and treat the infection at an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare throat cultures and coughed-up and induced phlegm or sputum in individuals with&#xD;
      pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 79 years of age who have been diagnosed with pulmonary&#xD;
      nontuberculous mycobacterial infection and are currently participating in selected NIH&#xD;
      protocols on this infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will require a single 90-minute visit to provide research specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must not eat or drink for 2 hours prior to the collection of the early&#xD;
           morning respiratory specimens. Blood pressure, temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and&#xD;
           oxygen saturation level readings will be taken on the day of collection to ensure that&#xD;
           participants may safely provide the specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide the following samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample: Participants will provide a blood sample to measure indicators of&#xD;
           inflammation in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Throat swab: Participants will brush their teeth thoroughly before allowing researchers&#xD;
           to swab the inside of their throat with a sterile swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sputum collection (regular and induced): Participants will brush their teeth thoroughly&#xD;
           and then provide both a regular sputum sample (produced normally) and an induced sputum&#xD;
           sample (produced after using a nebulizer to stimulate sputum production).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, a repeated measure design is used to examine microbial and molecular&#xD;
      results in subjects with a diagnosis of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection.&#xD;
      Patients often experience difficulties in the spontaneous expectoration of sputum free from&#xD;
      contamination with oral flora which contributes to the poor quality of some respiratory&#xD;
      specimens sent to the laboratory. At present, it is not known how induced sputum,&#xD;
      expectorated sputum, and pharyngeal swabs compare for acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear and&#xD;
      culture results. Appropriate specimens are needed in the clinical setting for optimum&#xD;
      diagnosis. In this study, procedures for the non-invasive collection of respiratory&#xD;
      secretions will be used to decrease risk of specimen contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who cannot produce respiratory secretions will be compared to patients who are&#xD;
      successful. It is not known which factors prevent production of respiratory secretions for&#xD;
      testing. Airway inflammation may contribute to difficulty in producing sputum along with&#xD;
      dyspnea, phase of illness (newly diagnosed or chronic infection), treatment status, and&#xD;
      respiratory condition severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be characterized by phase of illness determined by health history and&#xD;
      inflammation using common laboratory tests of inflammation. Respiratory specimens and blood&#xD;
      will be collected for microbial testing and a portion will be stored then tested for analysis&#xD;
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, &amp; IFN-gamma). Clinical,&#xD;
      demographic, laboratory, and patient subjective variables will be tested using regression&#xD;
      statistical methods to determine predictors for specimen production success. Clinical&#xD;
      variables to be tested include forced expiratory volume at one minute (FEV1) from a pulmonary&#xD;
      function test (PFT), phase of illness and treatment, and age. The laboratory tests indicating&#xD;
      inflammation include erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and&#xD;
      Beta-2-Microglobulin (Beta-2M). Patient assessments for dyspnea will be evaluated using the&#xD;
      Borg questionnaire.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Any condition in the judgment of the investigators that would place subjects at risk&#xD;
             or would jeopardize the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Participation of Women:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Contraception:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -The protocol has no requirement for contraception or restriction due to contraception&#xD;
             choice as the study interventions (blood draw and collection of respiratory secretions&#xD;
             have no restriction relative to contraception).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -The protocol has no requirement for restriction due to pregnancy. Study interventions&#xD;
             (blood draw and collection of respiratory secretions have no restrictions relative to&#xD;
             pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Participation of Minorities:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -There are no restrictions for minority participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Participation of Children:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Children are not included in this study since the benefit versus the procedural&#xD;
             burden of the protocol does not support their inclusion. Asking children to produce&#xD;
             three respiratory specimens at a protocol visit is thought to be burdensome. Infants&#xD;
             and young children cannot spontaneously expectorate. The main protocol upon which this&#xD;
             protocol recruits only includes adults.&#xD;
