  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most countries of the world, including the USA are making preparations for a possible&#xD;
      influenza pandemic. Such an event will constitute a global public health emergency, but it is&#xD;
      impossible to predict when this will happen. Up to 80 million people could die worldwide, so&#xD;
      as much as possible needs to be done in advance to find ways of how the impact can be&#xD;
      reduced. Although the investigators know that medical interventions such as anti-influenza&#xD;
      drugs and antibiotics will be important, even in well resourced countries these might be in&#xD;
      short supply. Vaccines will also be important but these will not be available until at least&#xD;
      4-5 months after the pandemic has started. This means that other non-pharmaceutical measures&#xD;
      could well be important such as social distancing, school closures and the use of face masks.&#xD;
      Guidance also needs to be developed so that families can care for each other whilst&#xD;
      minimizing the spread of infection. To do these things, the investigators need to know how&#xD;
      influenza is transmitted from person-to person. This is poorly understood at present. The&#xD;
      investigators also need to know if face masks work before recommendations for public use can&#xD;
      be made. The best way to study influenza transmission and the effectiveness of masks is to&#xD;
      perform a study using healthy adult volunteers. The investigators will do this by giving some&#xD;
      volunteers normal influenza via nasal drops. When they get symptoms the investigators will&#xD;
      create an 'experimental household' by getting them to live with other non-infected volunteers&#xD;
      for 48 hours, in a specially designed quarantine isolation unit. Some of the non-infected&#xD;
      volunteers will be unprotected; others will be selected randomly to wear either face masks or&#xD;
      a special plastic 'cloak' so that they do not touch their faces; another group will wear&#xD;
      both. The investigators will then measure the rate at which the different groups get 'flu'.&#xD;
      From these data the investigators can work out whether it is touching the face or coughing&#xD;
      and sneezing that spreads flu most or whether both are important; the investigators can also&#xD;
      deduce how well face masks work to prevent spread. The investigators need almost 2000&#xD;
      volunteers for this study, it will take at least 2 years to complete and it will be very&#xD;
      costly, however, the results will be of global importance. If the study is successful, the&#xD;
      investigators can tell governments around the world whether face masks work to prevent&#xD;
      influenza and be clearer about the guidance that should be given to families.&#xD;

             inpatient challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to provide written consent for participation after reading the Subject&#xD;
             Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form and after having adequate opportunity to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects shall be registered with a general practitioner who will confirm a subjects'&#xD;
             past medical history and their suitability to participate based on this. Consent will&#xD;
             be obtained to receive this information.&#xD;

             the recommended post-operative intervals) or a history of abstinence deemed credible&#xD;
             by the Investigator]. The provision of this history does NOT replace the requirement&#xD;
             to perform, and obtain negative results in, pregnancy tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or psychiatric&#xD;

             respiratory viral illness [subjects with uncomplicated chronic diagnoses stable and&#xD;
             treated for 3 months (e.g. mild hypertension well-controlled with medication may be&#xD;
             enrolled) provided the condition and its therapy are not known to be associated with&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Smokers unwilling/unable to desist for the quarantine phase duration of the study and&#xD;
             any smoker who has a &gt;10 pack year history of smoking. A nicotine test will be done at&#xD;

             respiratory tract within 1 year prior to challenge.&#xD;

             after resolution of the illness; ii. Within 2 weeks prior to challenge or if challenge&#xD;
             is set to occur during November, December, January, February, or March if there are&#xD;
