  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the validity of two tests on bone marrow of sensitized&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients in order to better understand why these patients with antibodies&#xD;
      against their donors are at a greater risk of rejection of their transplanted organs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this risk protocol is to determine the variability of the AlloElispot and&#xD;
      Allospecificities assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has developed two novel assays to determine: 1) the number of donor-specific&#xD;
      alloantibody (DSA) secreting bone marrow derived plasma cells (AlloELISPOT assay); and 2) the&#xD;
      function of DSA-secreting Plasma cells (Allospecificities assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These assays were developed over the past 3 years and already have provided an important&#xD;
      means of testing new therapeutic protocols aimed at controlling DSA production. It is&#xD;
      important to note that repeated attempts to isolate PCs from peripheral blood have been&#xD;
      unsuccessful (PCs are extremely rare in peripheral blood) and the bone marrow is the only&#xD;
      accessible source of PCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now clear to that we have reached a point that we must validate these assays&#xD;
      (coefficient of variation, etc), in order to appropriately evaluate data derived from these&#xD;
      assays. Inter-assay variability can be assessed by performing two paired assays in the same&#xD;
      patient. This could be done in two ways-paired bone marrow aspirations separated by time or&#xD;
      two bone marrow aspirations performed at the same time. We have decided to pursue the latter&#xD;
      approach. We will do both marrows either at the time of transplantation when the subjects are&#xD;
      under general anesthesia or in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) using conscious sedation.. We&#xD;
      believe that this is safe and will be well-tolerated and will provide the data that we need&#xD;
      to validate the assays.&#xD;
