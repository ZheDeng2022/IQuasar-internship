    <textblock>
      Elevated fat level in blood is a risk factor for coronary heart disease, a major cause of&#xD;
      death in America. The overall goal of this project is to test a novel treatment using&#xD;
      nutrient (amino acid) supplementation against this condition in men and women, and to&#xD;
      understand how this treatment works.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the single largest killer of American men and women&#xD;
      (45). Hyper¬triglyceridemia (elevated triglyceride [TG] concentration in the blood) has been&#xD;
      shown to be a significant independent risk factor for CHD (7;8;25), accordingly, treatment&#xD;
      for hypertriglyceridemia has been included in the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) of the&#xD;
      National Cholesterol Education Program (36). In a meta-analysis of 21 population-based&#xD;
      prospective studies including a total of 65,863 men and 11,089 women, each increase of 89&#xD;
      mg/dl (1 mmol/l) in TG concentration was associated with a 32% increase in CHD risk in men&#xD;
      and 76% increase in women (3). Thus, hypertriglyceridemia is an even stronger risk factor for&#xD;
      CHD in women than in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia is high. It is a common finding with aging, and is&#xD;
      also associated with overweight, obesity, diabetes, and renal disease (39). With the aging of&#xD;
      the US population and ongoing epidemics of obesity and type 2-diabetes, the number of&#xD;
      individuals with conditions associated with elevated TG levels is likely to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.2 Effect of Amino Acids on Plasma Triglyceride Concentration In an effort to clarify the&#xD;
      potential independent effect of protein on plasma and tissue lipids, we supplemented a normal&#xD;
      weight-maintaining diet with a relatively small amount of amino acids (~90 kcal/day) between&#xD;
      meals. We measured tissue lipids in addition to plasma lipids since the increase in insulin&#xD;
      resistance with aging has been linked to increased fat accumulation in muscle and liver&#xD;
      tissue (20;63). Also, it has repeatedly been shown that amino acid intake stimulates muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis and improves muscle protein net balance (86). Our hypothesis was that&#xD;
      supplementation of the normal diet with a mixture of amino acids will reduce circulating and&#xD;
      tissue TG concentrations and improve insulin sensitivity in elderly subjects with impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance. Twelve impaired glucose tolerant elderly ingested 11 g of essential amino&#xD;
      acids (EAA) + arginine twice a day for 16 weeks, after a 7 week control run in. Diet and&#xD;
      activity were not otherwise modified. We found individuals consuming the EAA supplement had&#xD;
      improved physical function. Further, these individuals had lower plasma and liver TG&#xD;
      concentrations than before supplementation, and total cholesterol and VLDL-cholesterol&#xD;
      concentrations were also lower after supplementations (12). In the present study, we will&#xD;
      investigate this by supplementing the diet of older subjects shown to have&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia.&#xD;
