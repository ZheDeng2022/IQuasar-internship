      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR566658&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the safety profile of SAR566658&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of SAR566658&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the potential immunogenicity of SAR566658&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess preliminary antitumor activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of SAR566658 at recommended dose on CYP3A enzyme activity using&#xD;
           midazolam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety in the alternative schedules of SAR566658 administration&#xD;

      The duration of the study for one patient in the dose escalation phase of the study will&#xD;
      include a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a 3-week treatment cycle(s) and a 2-week&#xD;
      treatment cycle(s). The patients may continue treatment until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or willingness to stop, followed by a minimum of 30-day follow-up. If&#xD;
      a patient treated in dose escalation part or in an expansion cohorts, continues to benefit&#xD;
      from the treatment at the time of Clinical Study Report, the patient can continue study&#xD;
      treatment and will continue to undergo all assessments as per the study flowchart. Such&#xD;
      patients will be followed at least until 30 days after the last IMP administration.&#xD;
