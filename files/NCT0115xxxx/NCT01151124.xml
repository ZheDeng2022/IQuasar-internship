  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to test the safety of a manufactured neural stem cell line (CTX cells)&#xD;
      delivered by injection into the damaged brains of male patients 60 years of age or over who&#xD;
      remain moderately to severely disabled 6 months to 5 years following an ischemic stroke. In&#xD;
      addition the trial will evaluate a range of potential efficacy measures for future trials.&#xD;
      Treatment will involve a single injection of one of four doses of CTX cells into the&#xD;
      patient's brain in a carefully controlled neurosurgical operation performed under general&#xD;
      anesthetic. The trial is designed to treat 12 patients and measure outcomes over 24 months.&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to participate in a long-term follow-up trial for a further 8 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Design: The trial is an open label, single administration, ascending dose, single site trial&#xD;
      using CTX neural stem cells with 24-month patient monitoring following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment selection of patients : Males aged â‰¥60 years with unilateral ischaemic stroke&#xD;
      affecting sub-cortical white matter and/or basal ganglia 6 months to 5 years prior to entry&#xD;
      into the study, with persistent unilateral hemiparesis, a minimum infarct diameter of 1 cm&#xD;
      and stable neurological functional deficit as determined by the NIH Stroke Scale, (measured&#xD;
      twice at least 1 month apart), will be eligible for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: The CTX cells will be injected by stereotaxic procedures into the putamen region&#xD;
      of the brain of the patient under general anesthesia with imaging guidance to locate&#xD;
      injection site. Four ascending doses of CTX cells will be tested in 12 patients (4 dosage&#xD;
      groups of three patients at each dose level receiving 2 million, 5 million, 10 million or 20&#xD;
      million cells). Patients will be admitted to hospital the day before surgery and prepared for&#xD;
      CTX cell implantation to take place. Patients will be discharged two days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One patient will be treated at a time. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)&#xD;
      will make the decision to continue dosing at each dose level following satisfactory review of&#xD;
      the 28 day safety data for the first patient at that dose level; and to increase the dose to&#xD;
      the next level following satisfactory review of the 3 month safety data for all three&#xD;
      patients in the previous dose group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post treatment follow-up of patients: There will be 6 scheduled visits to clinic for&#xD;
      monitoring and neurofunctional testing and 5 scheduled telephone contacts to monitor adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) and concomitant medications over the 2 year follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-points: The primary end-point of the trial is safety, measured by numbers of relevant&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events, health screening, neurological assessment and scanning abnormalities.&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to evaluate various MRI and other test measures for their potential as&#xD;
      efficacy markers for subsequent trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post trial follow up: All trial patients will be flagged by the National Health Service&#xD;
      Central Register (NHSCR) Scotland for life-long follow-up. In addition, all patients will be&#xD;
      invited to take part in an 8-year follow up trial requiring an annual review by a suitable&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
