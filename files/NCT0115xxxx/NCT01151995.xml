      This pilot project will evaluate Internet-based remote access to electronic clinical systems&#xD;
      to support study monitoring tasks. The project engages two NIH-sponsored clinical trial&#xD;
      networks (adult: ARDS network; pediatrics: ChiLDREN network) at five trial locations and two&#xD;
      coordinating centers located across four states, which engages three collaborating&#xD;
      NCRR-funded CTSA institutions. Each study location uses different electronic clinical systems&#xD;
      and remote access methods, replicating the diversity of clinical applications and access&#xD;
      methods found across large research networks. The results of this pilot project will inform a&#xD;
      broader project that will engage all trial sites with electronic clinical systems in both&#xD;
      national networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal extends Specific Aim 1.2 of the Research Informatics Integrated Core (RIIC) in&#xD;
      the parent grant (UL1 RR025780) for the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences&#xD;
      Institute (CCTSI): &quot;The RIIC will develop and implement tools and services that willâ€¦.(2)&#xD;
      support the efficient execution of the CCTSI translational research projects.&quot; (CCTSI grant&#xD;
      page 1053). Specific Aim 1.2 proposes to develop new informatics methods that increase the&#xD;
      translational research capacity by improving the efficiency of executing clinical studies.&#xD;
      Reducing barriers to study monitoring via remote access will enable new innovative approaches&#xD;
      to protecting study subjects, ensuring study data quality and documenting regulatory&#xD;
      compliance. An example of a completely new model for study monitoring could be continuous&#xD;
      study monitoring from any coordinating center to any study location in the Internet-connected&#xD;
      world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that remote monitoring will demonstrate substantial improvements in study&#xD;
      monitoring efficiency, effectiveness, and possibly overall costs when compared to present&#xD;
      monitoring plans that require a prolonged on-site visit by a study monitor from the&#xD;
      coordinating center. We do not claim that remote study monitoring will replace all monitoring&#xD;
      tasks . But, for monitoring tasks that require access to electronic clinical data, we seek to&#xD;
      demonstrate that remote access can enable more frequent SDV and regulatory documentation&#xD;
      compliance, which in turn could facilitate new models of continuous study monitoring. The&#xD;
      results of these studies would support improvements in study monitoring that would both&#xD;
      significantly reduce the cost of conducting large multi-center clinical while improving the&#xD;
      safety of those patients who are enrolled into these trials&#xD;

      II. Research Project Plan Specific Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness of remote access to&#xD;
      electronic clinical systems for clinical trial study monitoring. Accuracy and completeness of&#xD;
      source document verification (SDV) and compliance with regulatory documentation requirements&#xD;
      will be the effectiveness outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the efficiency of remote access to electronic clinical systems&#xD;
      for clinical trial study monitoring. The time to complete SDV and regulatory review with and&#xD;
      without remote access prior to an on-site visit will be the efficiency outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine the data monitoring site costs of study data verification and&#xD;
      regulatory documentation compliance with and without remote access prior to an on-site visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods and Design The specific aims focus on evaluating the effectiveness (Aim 1),&#xD;
      efficiency (Aim 2), and cost (Aim 3) of remote study monitoring compared to on-site SDV. The&#xD;
      study design for the three Specific Aims is identical. The analysis variables and analytic&#xD;
      plan vary by Specific Aim. There are five phases to this project: (1) IT development, (2)&#xD;
      local pre-pilot, (3) remote monitoring, (4) on-site monitoring, and (5) study analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase 1: Initial IT development and testing Five study sites will provide remote access&#xD;
      to existing clinical systems using commercial or self-developed access methods. Phase 1 will&#xD;
      ensure that these access methods can be configured to provide appropriate security and&#xD;
      auditing capabilities. The University of Colorado Hospital (UCH) has identified the need to&#xD;
      integrate the McKesson CareManager clinical documentation system into their MedXplore remote&#xD;
      access system. The budget provides programming resources to support this integration&#xD;
      development during Year 1. Should a technical limitation arise at any location, Phase 1 will&#xD;
      be used to alter or extend existing access methods to meet institutional requirements.&#xD;
      Contingency plans include using remote desktop sharing, as proposed by Vanderbilt, to export&#xD;
      local application screens to remote desktops securely. This contingency ensures that the&#xD;
      remote monitor experiences the identical application screens as are seen during on-site&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase 2: Pre-pilot testing of remote monitoring using local study coordinators Study&#xD;
      coordinators, local to the five study sites and who have clinical research access privileges&#xD;
      already established at their respective hospitals, will perform remote study monitoring&#xD;
      review of one or more study subjects to fully test the technical issues of remote access to&#xD;
      required applications and the execution features of the data collection instruments. The&#xD;
      local coordinators will connect to the hospital systems from a secure computer that is off&#xD;
      site from the hospital. The study coordinator will then conduct an on-site chart review. The&#xD;
      study coordinator will collect the study measures outlined in Table 2. Procedures for when to&#xD;
      stop searching for a data element, how to account for work breaks, and other interruptions,&#xD;
      and when to call for additional help from local site managers will be developed. Data&#xD;
      collection instruments will be tested and altered as needed. The pre-pilot tests will&#xD;
      simulate the activities for Phase 3 &amp; 4 so that all operational issues are resolved. Once&#xD;
      completed, study procedures and data collection instruments will be finalized for use in&#xD;
      Phases 3 &amp; 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase 3: Remote monitoring by data coordinating centers Randomization of study subjects&#xD;
      into two equal arms will be stratified at each individual hospital. Subjects assigned to Arm&#xD;
      A will have remote monitoring performed 2-4 weeks prior to the scheduled on-site visit.&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to Arm B will have no remote monitoring performed. Both arms will have&#xD;
      traditional on-site study monitoring performed. Remote access provisioning performed by IT at&#xD;
      the five study locations will allow remote monitors to access electronic records. Depending&#xD;
      on institutional responsibilities, HIM or IT resources will provision these remote accounts&#xD;
      to access those subjects randomized to Arm A (remote + local monitoring). Remote monitoring&#xD;
      will consist of validating all data elements submitted on CRFs submitted to the coordinating&#xD;
      center that require source document verification, using the same data verification protocols&#xD;
      currently used during on-site visits. Remote monitors will have telephone access to the same&#xD;
      HIM and local coordinator resources that are available when on-site. Rules when to stop&#xD;
      searching for a data element will be established during Phase 2. Data collection instruments&#xD;
      for capturing study variables will be developed and pilot tested during Phase 2. Remote&#xD;
      monitors will be trained on the access procedures for each site and the study data collection&#xD;
      procedures developed in Phase 2 using simultaneous remote desktop sharing and a study subject&#xD;
      who is not scheduled for monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase 4: On-site monitoring by data coordinating centers On-site monitoring will occur&#xD;
      2-4 weeks following remote monitoring. Subjects from both Study Arms will have source&#xD;
      document verification. Only those elements not verified remotely (Step (A)) will be verified&#xD;
      for subjects from Arm A in Step (B). The same monitor will perform both remote and local&#xD;
      monitoring for subjects from Arm A. The study variables developed in Phase 2 and used during&#xD;
      remote monitoring in Phase 3 will be used during on-site monitoring in Phase 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase 5: Data analysis Specific Aim 1 focuses on accuracy and completeness of remote&#xD;
      monitoring versus on-site monitoring. The study variables are the number of variables&#xD;
      verified and the number of verified variables that were found to be discrepant. Specific Aim&#xD;
      2 focuses on efficiency, measured in this study as time to complete source document&#xD;
      verification and regulatory review. The number of minutes to complete both source document&#xD;
      verification and regulatory review will be captured and compared. Specific Aim 3 focuses on&#xD;
      costs, measured using a time-in-motion method by the study coordinator or monitor. Using a&#xD;
      time log, the time required to complete a CRF to be aggregated for the SDV total. This will&#xD;
      include time estimates for finding charts, making copies, and recording data. If a study&#xD;
      investigator participates in monitoring activities, then they will record their time&#xD;
      estimates separately. Standardized estimates of salaries and benefits for persons in those&#xD;
      positions will be used to standardize across local and regional wage and price differentials.&#xD;
