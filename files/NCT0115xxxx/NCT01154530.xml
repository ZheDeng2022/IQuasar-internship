      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is a surgical technique that has been&#xD;
      rapidly evolving over the last five years. The technique probably has a great potential in&#xD;
      surgical gastroenterology, urology and gynaecology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique is based on the idea of minimally invasive surgery. The human organism is&#xD;
      affected by a stress response when exposed to surgery. This stress response can be minimized&#xD;
      by reducing the size of the openings whereby the surgeon gains access to the organs. This&#xD;
      affects how quickly a patient recovers after surgery and can be discharged and resumes daily&#xD;
      life and work. The same principal have been responsible for the surgical evolution in the&#xD;
      last 15-20 years where many procedures have gone from traditional open operations with large&#xD;
      incisions in the abdominal wall to laparoscopic surgery with cameras through small holes in&#xD;
      the abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest addition to minimal invasive surgery is NOTES. Here the surgeon gains access to&#xD;
      the abdominal organs with flexible endoscopes through the body's natural openings i.e. the&#xD;
      mouth and stomach. With this technique the surgeon avoids cutting through skin and muscle of&#xD;
      the abdominal wall, thus minimizing the surgical stress response. This minimizes&#xD;
      postoperative pain, the incidence of incisional hernias, eliminates wound infection, and&#xD;
      properly prevents scar tissue formation inside the abdominal cavity which way lead to ileus.&#xD;
      The end result is a quicker discharge and a better cosmetic result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown in numerous animal studies that NOTES is feasible and in recent years a&#xD;
      rapidly increasing number of published patient series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is a risk of infection associated with accessing the abdominal cavity through&#xD;
      a natural body opening, which initially is unclean and can not be disinfected in the same way&#xD;
      as the skin of the abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous microbiological pig studies have shown that there is transfer of bacteria from the&#xD;
      body opening (i.e. mouth) to the abdominal cavity when performing NOTES, but this&#xD;
      contamination have no correlation to infection after surgery, neither in terms of healing or&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear from the literature whether patients should be offered proton pump inhibitor&#xD;
      (PPI) therapy to reduce the acidity of the stomach before NOTES interventions. The rationale&#xD;
      has been that such a treatment can make the gastric juices less acidic and thereby reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of chemical peritonitis, which can occur when acidic juices flows from the stomach&#xD;
      and into the abdominal cavity. It is known however that the acidic environment of the stomach&#xD;
      provides a natural barrier for bacteria. Making the gastric juices less acidic could&#xD;
      potentially increase the risk of bacterial peritonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that the bacterial content of the stomach is low due the acidic environment but&#xD;
      bacteria passed down from the mouth and throat with the endoscope could potentially result in&#xD;
      bacterial peritonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That bacteria from the throat can lead to infections due to instrumentation is known from&#xD;
      intensive care units. Ventilated patients may risk getting pneumonia with bacteria from the&#xD;
      throat. Several studies have shown that using mouthwash with a chlorhexidine solution can&#xD;
      reduce the risk of ventilator associated pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mouthwash with 2 cl 0,2% chlorhexidine solution before a gastroscopy reduces the bacterial&#xD;
      content in cultures taken from the stomach and the endoscope after a gastroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneous PPI treatment gives higher bacterial counts in the cultures.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Simultaneous PPI treatment gives higher bacterial counts in the cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Participants will be recruited among patients referred to gastroscopy in an outpatient&#xD;
      setting, at Herlev, Gentofte and Bispebjerg Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be over 18 years old regardless of gender. The participants are included&#xD;
      after oral and written information about the trial and with written consent. The request for&#xD;
      participation and written information about the trial is send to the patient by conventional&#xD;
      mail. The oral information is given on the day of the gastroscopy. Inclusion in the trial has&#xD;
      no consequences for the purpose of the gastroscopy, or on any further diagnostic procedures&#xD;
      or treatments. Trial Participants may at any time withdraw from the trial without&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included participants are randomized by drawing a random envelope with a continuous&#xD;
      registration number containing information on whether the patient is allocated to the&#xD;
      intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enclosed in the envelope is a registration form where the following is recorded: sex, age,&#xD;
      weight, height, indication for gastroscopy, number of instrumentations during gastroscopy,&#xD;
      the use of rinse and suction, and PPI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group perform a mouthwash with 2 cl 0,2% chlorhexidine for&#xD;
      30 seconds immediately before the gastroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group perform no mouthwash before the gastroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gastroscopy is performed in accordance with the indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 2 culture samples will be taken from each participant. The culture samples are&#xD;
      sent to the department of clinical microbiology, Herlev Hospital for cultivation, bacterial&#xD;
      count and typing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first culture sample is taken by instilling 50ml sterile saline through the&#xD;
      instrumentation channel with the gastroscope located in the fundus of the stomach .&#xD;
      Approximately 10ml is aspirated through the same channel in the antrum of the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second culture sample is taken from the gastroscope after the procedure by rinsing the&#xD;
      instrumentation channel with sterile saline. A sample of approximately 10 ml is collected at&#xD;
      the distal end of the gastroscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples are marked with the respective continuous registration numbers according to the&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects, discomfort and risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no side effects associated with the use chlorhexidine mouthwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some discomfort associated with the gastroscopy. This is not a result of&#xD;
      participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients feel slight discomfort when the gastroscope passes through the throat. The&#xD;
      passage can stimulate the vomiting reflex. For this reason a gastroscopy is always performed&#xD;
      with the patient in a left lateral position to ensure free airways. There may be mild&#xD;
      soreness and irritation in the throat during and in the first few days after the gastroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only discomfort that is directly linked to participation in the trial is the taste of&#xD;
      chlorhexidine mouthwash for half of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no risks associated with participation in the trial, although there are some risks&#xD;
      associated with the gastroscopy itself. These are bleeding from the stomach wall and&#xD;
      perforation of the stomach or duodenum. These complications are very rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the participants are recruited after referral to gastroscopy from a general&#xD;
      practitioner the indication for the gastroscopy has already been assessed and outweighs the&#xD;
      above mentioned rare risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only discomfort that is directly related to the trail is a brief sensation of bad taste&#xD;
      in the mouth for half of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results gained from the trial greatly overshadow the mild discomfort associated with the&#xD;
      taste of chlorhexidine mouthwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above mentioned trial is a part of a PhD project which tries to bridge the gap between&#xD;
      animal studies and the implementation of NOTES in daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salaries are funded through grants from the University of Copenhagen, Herlev Hospital&#xD;
      Research Council and the Capitol Region of Denmark Research Foundation for Health Research.&#xD;
      Operating costs are founded through grants from private foundations. There is no commercial&#xD;
      interest in or support for the project.&#xD;
