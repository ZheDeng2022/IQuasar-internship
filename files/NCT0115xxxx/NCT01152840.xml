      -  Although mTOR is clearly an attractive therapeutic target in tumor, no clinical study on&#xD;
           mTOR inhibition by RAD001 has been systematically conducted in adenoid cystic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In phase I study of RAD001, 2 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma show some response&#xD;
           to RAD001 (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  So the investigators design this phase II study of RAD001 in adenoid cystic carcinoma to&#xD;
           evaluate the efficacy of RAD001 in this orphan disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the histologic appearance of adenoid cystic carcinoma is low grade, management of&#xD;
      this malignancy is a distinct therapeutic challenge because of its insidious local growth&#xD;
      pattern, propensity for perineural involvement, tendency for distant metastasis, and&#xD;
      pronounced ability to recur over a prolonged period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prospectively performed clinical trials, objective responses to any cytotoxic agent or&#xD;
      regimen are infrequent, whereas stabilization of disease was observed more commonly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adenoid cystic carcinoma, the study focusing on PI3-K/AKT/mTOR pathway is rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Younes MN et al's study, adenoid cystic carcinoma cell lines have increased pAkt&#xD;
      activity when EGF-stimulation is added. And when treated with EGFR/VEGFR TK dual inhibitor,&#xD;
      the phosphorylated form of Akt decreased despite of total level of Akt is remained unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the investigators consider that the increased pAkt activity is one of possible predictor&#xD;
      to mTOR inhibitor, the mTOR inhibitor might have an activity in adenoid cystic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although mTOR is clearly an attractive therapeutic target in tumor, no clinical study on mTOR&#xD;
      inhibition by RAD001 has been systematically conducted in adenoid cystic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase I study of RAD001, 2 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma show some response to&#xD;
      RAD001 (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      So the investigators design this phase II study of RAD001 in adenoid cystic carcinoma to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of RAD001 in this orphan disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2. Local, locally-advanced or metastatic disease documented as having shown&#xD;
             progression on a scan (CT, MRI, MIBI scan) taken 2 to 12 months prior to baseline&#xD;
             compared to a previous scan taken at any time in the past. Progression must be&#xD;
             documented according to RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3. Disease that is not amenable to surgery, radiation or combined modality therapy&#xD;
             with curative intent and who is previously treated with chemotherapy or local&#xD;
             treatment (e,g transarterial chemoembolization)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4. Presence of at least one measurable target lesion for further evaluation according&#xD;
             to RECIST criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5. 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
