  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in&#xD;
      patients with severe brain injury has been associated with poor outcome. The application of&#xD;
      lung recruitment maneuvers (RM) for a short period of time to open collapsed alveoli and&#xD;
      reverse hypoxemia in early ARDS has been recommended. However, little is known about the&#xD;
      cerebral and vascular effects of RM in brain injury patients with ALI/ARDS. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the effects of a single standardized RM on oxygenation and on systemic and&#xD;
      cerebral hemodynamics in severe brain injury patients with ALI/ARDS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe brain injury comprise a significant portion of admissions to critical&#xD;
      care units. These patients are unable to adequately protect their airways and are usually&#xD;
      intubated and mechanically ventilated. The goal of mechanical ventilation in patients with&#xD;
      brain injury is to optimize blood gas exchange while minimizing intrathoracic pressure to&#xD;
      avoid interference with cerebral venous drainage.Over the last 20 years, a plethora of&#xD;
      experimental and clinical data have shown that mechanical ventilation can cause or aggravate&#xD;
      lung damage in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS). The aim of this pilot study was to assess the effects of a single&#xD;
      standardized recruitment maneuver (RM) on oxygenation and on systemic and cerebral&#xD;
      hemodynamics in severe brain injury patients with ALI/ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients with brain injury, as defined by a Glasgow Coma Score &lt;13, admitted into the&#xD;
      Trauma and Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, a RM will be performed by switching the ventilator from&#xD;
      assist/control ventilation to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and applying a&#xD;
      pressure of 40 cmH2O for 40 sec (11). After the RM, patients have been ventilated in pressure&#xD;
      control ventilation and PEEP will be gradually reduced in decremental steps every 3&#xD;
      respiratory cycles starting with PEEP at 30 cm H2O, maintaining a maximum peak pressure of 40&#xD;
      cmH2O during this procedure until pre-RM PEEP levels are achieved. The RM will be&#xD;
      discontinued if any of the following changes developed during the procedure: (i) ≥20% changes&#xD;
      in baseline systemic blood pressure, (ii) ICP ≥20 mmHg, or (iii) SaO2 ≤90%. After the RM is&#xD;
      performed, respiratory mechanics, arterial and SjO2 blood samples and systemic and cerebral&#xD;
      hemodynamics will be obtained at 30 min and 8 hours.&#xD;
