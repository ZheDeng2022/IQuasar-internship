  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis is the most used illicit substance in the United States. Previous studies suggest&#xD;
      that atypical antipsychotics decrease the frequency and the amount of substance use in&#xD;
      subjects with and without psychotic illness. So far, there are no controlled studies&#xD;
      assessing the effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics for decreasing cannabis and other&#xD;
      substance use in individuals with cannabis use disorders. The investigators postulate that&#xD;
      the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine ER is an effective agent for improving substance use&#xD;
      outcomes in subjects with cannabis use disorders. In this pilot study, the investigators will&#xD;
      test this hypothesis in heavy cannabis users (i.e., individuals who are cannabis dependent&#xD;
      and smoke three times or more per week). Because 50% of these heavy cannabis users report&#xD;
      histories of psychotic experiences (i.e., attenuated positive symptoms) while smoking and are&#xD;
      at risk for recurring psychotic symptoms, the investigators will focus this pilot clinical&#xD;
      trial on this subgroup of cannabis users in order to increase the risk/benefit ratio of this&#xD;
      study and target a population that may also benefit from the antipsychotic effect of&#xD;
      quetiapine ER. Considering the lack of controlled studies assessing the efficacy of atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotics in heavy cannabis users, assessing the effectiveness of an atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication on substance use and clinical outcomes in this population is&#xD;
      critical for improving the prognosis of these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the aims of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study are to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of an atypical antipsychotic (quetiapine ER) in 120 subjects with cannabis&#xD;
      dependence, a recent history (within a year) of attenuated psychotic symptoms, and using&#xD;
      cannabis 3 times or more per week for: (1) decreasing the use of cannabis and other&#xD;
      substances; and (2) preventing the recurrence of psychotic experiences. The investigators&#xD;
      will also assess the effects of quetiapine ER on craving and mood, and its tolerability. This&#xD;
      project will be a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with quetiapine&#xD;
      ER and it will include a comprehensive assessment of symptoms, substance use, and side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will benefit the field by providing unique data on the relative efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of treatment with atypical antipsychotics in heavy cannabis users with a&#xD;
      vulnerability to psychosis. This study will be the basis for future studies assessing the&#xD;
      long-term efficacy and tolerability of atypical antipsychotics in individuals with cannabis&#xD;
      use disorders.&#xD;
