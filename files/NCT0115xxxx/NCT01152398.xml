      The current trial, BNIT-BR-003, will evaluate the safety and biological activity of a fixed&#xD;
      dose of MVA-BN®-HER2 following adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HER-2-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent of vaccination is to induce a combined antibody and T-cell anti-HER-2 immune&#xD;
      response, which is intended to target HER-2-expressing tumor cells, and may induce tumor&#xD;
      regression or slow progression of disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MVA-BN®-HER2 is a candidate breast cancer immunotherapy product comprised of a highly&#xD;
      attenuated non-replicating vaccinia virus, MVA-BN®, engineered to encode a modified form of&#xD;
      the HER-2 protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MVA-BN® is a well-characterized, clonal strain of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) being&#xD;
      developed as a smallpox vaccine, suitable for use in high-risk (e.g., immunocompromised)&#xD;
      individuals. MVA-BN®-derived vectors encoding heterologous antigens are being developed for&#xD;
      use as vaccines for infectious diseases such as HIV, and for the treatment of cancer. A large&#xD;
      database exists from safety evaluations in animals and in humans for MVA-BN®, and&#xD;
      MVA-BN®-derived vectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HER-2 is overexpressed in 20-30% of human breast cancers. It is an oncogene/growth factor&#xD;
      receptor critical for the malignant phenotype of HER-2- expressing tumors. It is an&#xD;
      immunogenic target, and immune responses to this protein have been shown to mediate potent&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity in multiple animal models. Means to stimulate anti-HER-2 reactivity are&#xD;
      now being studied clinically. Sponsor, collaborators, and others have used both Protein and&#xD;
      DNA vaccine forms of HER-2, and a safety database is developed and no significant adverse&#xD;
      events have resulted from HER-2 directed vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MVA-BN®-HER2 encodes a modified form of the HER-2 protein, hereinafter referred to as HER2.&#xD;
      HER2 contains the extracellular domain of HER-2 but lacks the intracellular, cell signaling&#xD;
      domain. In addition, HER2 includes two universal T-cell epitopes from tetanus toxin to&#xD;
      facilitate the stimulation of an immune response to HER-2, a self-protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trial, BNIT-BR-003, will evaluate the safety and biological activity of a fixed&#xD;
      dose of MVA-BN®-HER2 following adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancers which&#xD;
      overexpress HER-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 6 subcutaneous vaccinations at 4-week intervals and will have blood&#xD;
      drawn for immune function analysis.&#xD;
