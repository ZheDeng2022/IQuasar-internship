      This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the oral solution of paracetamol,&#xD;
      chlorpheniramine maleate and phenylephrine hydrochloride in reducing symptoms of flu and the&#xD;
      common cold. There will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Will be&#xD;
      included 216 subjects, male or female, aged greater than 12 and less than or equal to 60&#xD;
      years, irrespective of color and / or race with symptoms of recent onset, for more than 6&#xD;
      hours and less than 48 hours length, characterizing Common Cold and / or Influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After clinical evaluation and laboratory research subjects will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      active drug or placebo, 10 ml oral solution every 6 hours for 48 hours. The follow-up visits&#xD;
      will be held on 2 (24 hours after first intervention) and in 3 days (48 hours after first&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes to assess the effectiveness so far consist of the scores of symptoms and to&#xD;
      assess the safety of the drug will be accompanied by the emergence of adverse events.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Infections of upper respiratory tract are common in the population, and its treatment, in&#xD;
      most cases involves the use of symptomatic drugs. Paracetamol is used as an analgesic and&#xD;
      antipyretic, while chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine and a vasoconstrictor phenylephrine&#xD;
      decongestant function. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the oral&#xD;
      solution of paracetamol, chlorpheniramine maleate and phenylephrine hydrochloride in reducing&#xD;
      symptoms of flu and the common cold. There will be a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial. Volunteers will be recruited through posters down at the Hospital&#xD;
      de Clinicals de Porto Alegre, and care in the public hospital network, which will undergo a&#xD;
      screening questionnaire on first contact. With a statistical power of 80% and the possibility&#xD;
      of random error of 5% should be followed in this study 194 subjects. Whereas a loss of up to&#xD;
      10% will be included 216 subjects, male or female, aged greater than 12 and less than or&#xD;
      equal to 60 years, irrespective of color and / or race with symptoms of recent onset, for&#xD;
      more than 6 hours and less than 48 hours, characterizing one of the following conditions:&#xD;
      Common Cold, which consists of at least 3 symptoms among the 10 following: sneezing,&#xD;
      rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, headache, muscle pain, throat discomfort, pain throat,&#xD;
      dysphonia, cough, fever, and these moderate or severe using a scale of severity of symptoms&#xD;
      of 4 points (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) and / or Influenza consisting&#xD;
      fever of at least 38.1 ° C and headache of moderate or severe or myalgia / arthralgia&#xD;
      moderate or severe using a scale of severity of symptoms of 4 points (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 =&#xD;
      moderate , 3 = severe). Will be included only subjects who agree with the Terms of Consent.&#xD;
      Not be included in the study pregnant women or infants with known hypersensitivity to&#xD;
      components of the formula, or research subjects that are experiencing chronic active or&#xD;
      exacerbated. After clinical evaluation and laboratory research subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive active drug or placebo, 10 ml oral solution every 6 hours for 48 hours. Be provided&#xD;
      paracetamol rescue co-intervention. Study subjects will receive a diary containing&#xD;
      questionnaires of symptoms. The follow-up visits will be held on 2 (24 hours after first&#xD;
      intervention) and in 3 days (48 hours after first intervention). The outcomes to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness so far consist of scores of symptoms, rescue medication use, improvement of&#xD;
      fever, subjective evaluation of palatability and tolerance and treatment compliance. To&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of the drug will be accompanied by the emergence of adverse events&#xD;
