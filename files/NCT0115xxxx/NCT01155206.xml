  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistant states are characterized by hepatic lipoprotein (VLDL) particle&#xD;
      overproduction. Numerous hormonal and nutritional factors are known to influence hepatic&#xD;
      lipoprotein particle production, including insulin and free fatty acids (FFA). In contrast to&#xD;
      the liver, the intestine has traditionally been viewed as a 'passive' organ with respect to&#xD;
      lipoprotein production, with intestinal lipoprotein particle production determined mainly by&#xD;
      the amount of fat ingested and absorbed. Glucagon plays a key role in the regulation of&#xD;
      carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism and has recently been shown for the first time to&#xD;
      regulate hepatic lipoprotein production in mice. Ours will be the first study to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of glucagon on hepatic and intestinal lipoprotein production in humans.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Potential role of glucagon in intestinal and hepatic lipoprotein production. Although&#xD;
      glucagon, the main hormone that opposes insulin action, is known to exert profound effects on&#xD;
      carbohydrate (stimulation of hepatic glucose production) and fatty acid metabolism&#xD;
      (stimulation of hepatic b-oxidation and ketogenesis), its potential role in the regulation of&#xD;
      lipoprotein metabolism has been largely overlooked and the mechanism whereby glucagon&#xD;
      modulates hepatic lipid metabolism in humans has not previously been examined. Longuet et al&#xD;
      recently showed that glucagon receptor (Gcgr) signaling is essential for control of hepatic&#xD;
      lipid homeostasis in mice (44). They showed that Gcgr-/- mice exhibit higher plasma TG levels&#xD;
      and increased hepatic TG production compared to littermate controls. Conversely, glucagon&#xD;
      administration to wildtype mice decreased hepatic lipid production and plasma TGs. A&#xD;
      combination of microarray and RealTime PCR analyses demonstrated that a period of fasting&#xD;
      increased the expression of genes regulating fatty acid b-oxidation in +/+ but not in Gcgr-/-&#xD;
      mice. Furthermore, exogenous glucagon administration mimicked the increase in expression of&#xD;
      enzymes involved in b-oxidation during fasting in +/+ mice. Enzymes involved in fatty acid&#xD;
      synthesis were not regulated by exogenous glucagon. Gcgr-/- mice were much more susceptible&#xD;
      to the accumulation of lipids in the liver, known to be associated with the development of&#xD;
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. To date, glucagon regulation of intestinal lipoprotein&#xD;
      production has not been examined in animals or humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is convincing evidence from mouse studies that glucagon plays a major role in the&#xD;
      regulation of hepatic lipoprotein production and may also play a role in intestinal&#xD;
      lipoprotein assembly and secretion. Ours will be the first study to examine the role of&#xD;
      glucagon in hepatic and intestinal lipoprotein production in humans. Since inhibition of&#xD;
      glucagon receptor activity is currently being explored as a therapeutic approach for the&#xD;
      treatment of Type 2 diabetes, our study will provide important information regarding&#xD;
      potential implications of this therapeutic approach for control of lipid homeostasis and&#xD;
      general metabolic health.&#xD;
