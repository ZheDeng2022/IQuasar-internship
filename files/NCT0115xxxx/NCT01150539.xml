      Young, overweight/obese women with PCOS along with age and BMI-matched healthy controls&#xD;
      without PCOS will be enrolled in this study. Participants will have assessments of body&#xD;
      composition (by DEXA), visceral and ectopic fat (by MR), ovarian parameters (follicle size&#xD;
      and number, by MRI) insulin sensitivity (by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp), interstitial&#xD;
      lipolysis (by microdialysis), whole body lipolysis and glycolysis (by stable isotopes),&#xD;
      aerobic fitness (by VO2max test) and a fat biopsy performed across two clinic visits (1&#xD;
      outpatient visit, and 1 overnight stay). Participants in the control group will undergo these&#xD;
      assessments once only, whereas participants in the PCOS Group will have these assessments&#xD;
      twice, once at baseline and once following a 16 week supervised aerobic exercise program.&#xD;
      Throughout the exercise program body weight will be measured weekly and menstrual cycle&#xD;
      frequency will be documented on a calendar. Additionally, vital signs, weight, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumferences will be measured and a fasting blood sample collected every 4 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women between the ages of 18-30, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI greater than or equal to 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sedentary lifestyle - not currently exercising more than 60 minutes per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A medical diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome. The diagnosis will be compared with&#xD;
             the most recent international criteria1. Together with irregular menses (fewer than 6&#xD;
             cycles per year), participants must also have at least one of the following&#xD;
             characteristics;&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. presence of polycystic ovaries on transvaginal ultrasound, &gt;10 cysts, 2-8 mm in&#xD;
                  diameter (ultrasound will not be done in this study however; ultrasound reports&#xD;
                  will be used if available) and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. clinical manifestations (hirsutism) examined by the PI at the screening visit or&#xD;
                  biochemical evidence (elevated testosterone or free androgen index) of&#xD;
                  hyperandrogenism, determined by fasting blood sample collected during the&#xD;
                  screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;

             per month).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to complete approximately 60 minutes of medium intensity exercise per day (5&#xD;
