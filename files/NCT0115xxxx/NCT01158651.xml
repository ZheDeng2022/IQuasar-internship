  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn if the study drug RAD001 can shrink or slow&#xD;
      the growth of low-grade gliomas in children with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).&#xD;
      Additionally, the safety of RAD001 will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, RAD001, is a drug that may act directly on tumor cells by preventing tumor&#xD;
      cell growth and development. RAD001 has been studied in participants with various types of&#xD;
      cancer as a single agent (a drug that is used alone to treat the cancer) or in combination&#xD;
      with a number of well known anticancer therapies. Information from these research studies&#xD;
      suggests that RAD001 may help to shrink or slow the growth of low-grade gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see the response of RAD001 in&#xD;
      children with low-grade gliomas and NF1 that have either not responded to treatment or have&#xD;
      come back after treatment. We are also looking for the highest dose of RAD001 that can be&#xD;
      given safely in this patient population.&#xD;

      After signing this consent form, you will be asked to undergo some screening tests or&#xD;
      procedures to find out if you can be in the research study. These tests and procedures are&#xD;
      likely to be part of regular glioma care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not&#xD;
      take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently,&#xD;
      they may or may not have to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medical history, which involves questions about your health history, any medications you&#xD;
      are taking or plan to take, and any allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical exam, during which you will be asked about any problems that you might be having.&#xD;
      Additionally, your clinician will check your vital signs (body temperature, heart rate,&#xD;
      breathing rate, and blood pressure) and bodily systems (respiratory, nervous, digestive,&#xD;
      etc). The doctor will also evaluate your performance status, which indicates how much your&#xD;
      illness affects your activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests, including tests to measure any effects of your disease. Approximately 1-2&#xD;
      teaspoons of blood will be drawn for these tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine test, which will be done to make sure your kidneys are functioning properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An assessment of your tumor using scans of the brain. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) will&#xD;
      be used to look at and evaluate the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of your heart&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential. A small amount of blood (about half a&#xD;
      teaspoon) or urine will be drawn for this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will&#xD;
      begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able&#xD;
      to participate in this research study.&#xD;
