      The aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of electronic reminder letters versus&#xD;
      none on general practices adherence to clinical quality guidelines regarding Point Of Care&#xD;
      Testing (POCT). The investigators hypothesize, that electronic reminder letters may increase&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Point-of-care testing (POCT) is increasingly being used in general practice to assist GPs in&#xD;
      their management of patients with diseases. An accredited external quality assessment (EQA)&#xD;
      program and internal quality control system is recommended1. In the Copenhagen area external&#xD;
      as well as internal quality control has been enforced by annual outreach consultant visits&#xD;
      and by split sample EQA procedures, where POCT results have been compared with central&#xD;
      laboratory results. However, the adherence to quality guidelines has been seen to be less&#xD;
      than anticipated among GPs in the Copenhagen municipality and in the former county of&#xD;
      Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of guidelines alone rarely brings about improvements in clinical practice2 and&#xD;
      even an multifaceted implementation of guidelines may not change clinical practice 3;4.&#xD;
      Multiple strategies for implementing guidelines appear to be more effective than single ones&#xD;
      5;6. However, well-designed empirical research looking into various implementation strategies&#xD;
      is still needed in this area 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-mails have successfully been used in several studies to promote health behaviour change in&#xD;
      risk populations 8;9 and our hypothesis is that electronic reminder letters (send to the GPs&#xD;
      electronic patient records) is an efficient and inexpensive way to influence the behaviour of&#xD;
      GP's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the low adherence, the Copenhagen General Practitioners' Laboratory (CGPL) plans to&#xD;
      introduce electronic reminder letters (alongside the standard implementation procedures)&#xD;
      during 2010 in order to increase adherence to the quality guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of electronic reminder letters on general practices adherence to&#xD;
      clinical quality guidelines regarding POCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the legacy effect of a potential effect of reminder letters (i.e. the impact of&#xD;
      the intervention after it has stopped).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Included in the study are all, approximately 320, GP practices conducting POCT&#xD;
      at least four POCT (either haemoglobin or glucose) during a 4 month before study period and&#xD;
      not conducting INR analysis (defined as four or less tests during 4 four months period).&#xD;
      These practices were identified in the GP database of the Capital area and by the CGPL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data on performed split test EQA procedures is retrieved from CGPL database.&#xD;
      These data do not contain any patient related data because all split test EQA are conducted&#xD;
      by a constructed identification code. Process indicators (sent reminder letters) are also&#xD;
      obtained from CGPL. KvEAP and Capital Region databases provide information on the&#xD;
      participating practices and corresponding GPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from The Capital Region Information regarding: Sex, age, year of graduation from&#xD;
      university, working address, type of practice, patient listed to practice and use the&#xD;
      following tests: Hemoglobin, Glucose, INR; CRP, HbA1C were retrospectively collected 6 months&#xD;
      before the start of the trial (tentative in order to establish a baseline). Each month in the&#xD;
      remainder of the study period the investigators receive data from the Capital Region&#xD;
      regarding practices in the study areas and identify practices having used Hemoglobin or blood&#xD;
      Glucose as a POCT. These data will be compared with the CGPL database every month and those&#xD;
      practices that have not done a split sample EQA will receive electronic reminder letters&#xD;
      during the following 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practices are stratified by area and type of organization by means of SAS (Proc PLAN) by an&#xD;
      independent organization. Practices are allocated to usual CGPL quality guideline activities&#xD;
      (control group) and usual CGPL implementation activities in addition to electronic reminder&#xD;
      letters (intervention group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total number of split tests performed in study period for Hemoglobin and Glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proportion of practices with a high quality of tests defined as 75% of the performed&#xD;
           split tests for Hemoglobin and Glucose within the accepted interval according following&#xD;
           the CGPL quality guidelines1 in study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Proportion of practices conducting split tests for Hemoglobin and Glucose in study&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators use a 10% adherence estimate based on CGPL data from 2007 in order to&#xD;
      ascertain the power of the study. Given a MEREDIF at 15% and a power of 90% it is estimated&#xD;
      that 274 practices are to be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in the outcomes between allocation groups at baseline and at 6 months follow-up&#xD;
      are tested by means of chi-square tests (outcomes 2 and 3) and t-tests (outcome 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test the development of adherence relative to the intervention the investigators&#xD;
      will in the 3 data collection points use logistic (outcome 2 and 3) and linear (outcome 1)&#xD;
      regression where the investigators use GEE methods to account for the repeated measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify predictors for adhering to guidelines adjusted odds ratios for the practice&#xD;
      characteristics are estimated in multivariate logistic (outcomes 2 and 3) and linear (outcome&#xD;
      1) regression analysis on the outcomes at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses are performed using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Standard implementation The standard implementation of EQA consists of invited&#xD;
      meetings and an annual facilitator visit in each practice. As part of the planned&#xD;
      implementation strategy GPs were invited to meetings, received written material from the&#xD;
      CGPL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic reminder letters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic reminder letters are sent to practices not adhering to the guideline&#xD;
      recommendations of split testing within 30 days; i.e. a reminder letter is send when the CGPL&#xD;
      database registers that the last split test or last reminder letter was 31 days ago. Thus,&#xD;
      all practices may receive up to 4 electronic reminder letters in each period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 4 months a cross-over will be applied, so that the practices allocated to the&#xD;
      control group receive electronic prompting while prompting ceases in the intervention group.&#xD;
      This further follow-up acts to investigate the legacy effect of the intervention. The main&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the first 4 months of intervention also shows some effect 4 months beyond&#xD;
      the intervention period.&#xD;
