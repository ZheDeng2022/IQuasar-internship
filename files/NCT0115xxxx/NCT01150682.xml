      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory&#xD;
      may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is studying the role of biomarkers in endometrial cancer&#xD;
      recurrence in samples from patients with stage II, stage III, or stage IV endometrial cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the association of endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EA) recurrence with&#xD;
           pre-operative serum levels of insulin, total and free insulin-like growth factor-I&#xD;
           (IGF-I), IGF-II, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and IGFB-3,&#xD;
           estradiol, estrone, progesterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in samples&#xD;
           from patients with stage II-IV endometrial cancer evaluated on GOG-0210.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the associations of EA recurrence with pre-treatment tumor expression of IGF-I,&#xD;
           IGF-II, and IGFBP-1 and -3 mRNA in samples from these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the associations of EA recurrence with pre-treatment tumor expression of&#xD;
           insulin receptor, IGF-I receptor, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor in&#xD;
           samples from these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the correlations of serum (protein) and tissue (mRNA) levels of IGF-I,&#xD;
           IGF-II, and IGFBP-1 and -3 from samples of patients with EA and participants without&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Banked serum and tumor tissues samples are analyzed for levels of insulin, total and&#xD;
      free insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), IGF-II, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3, estradiol, estrone,&#xD;
      progesterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG); expression of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1&#xD;
      and IGFBP -3 mRNA; and expression of the insulin receptor, IGF-I receptor, estrogen receptor,&#xD;
      and progesterone receptor by RT-PCR, IHC, and ELISA. Banked non-cancerous endometrial tissue&#xD;
      and fasting serum samples from controls are also analyzed for IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, and&#xD;
      IGFBP-3 and compared with the results of endometrial adenocarcinoma (EA) samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical information associated with each EA samples (i.e., age, BMI, performance status,&#xD;
      race, ethnicity, tumor stage, size, histology and grade, surgical compliance and type of post&#xD;
      surgical adjuvant therapy, overall survival, recurrence-free survival, site of first&#xD;
      recurrence, and biomarker values and expression) is also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 815 patient specimens and 50 control specimens will be accrued&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
