  <brief_summary>

      The primary study hypothesis of the investigators is that administration of an iron&#xD;
      supplement between meals at a dose like that used in the Pemba trial (~1 mg Fe/kg) during P.&#xD;
      falciparum parasitemia will increase plasma non-transferrin-bound iron. A key subsidiary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that iron administered with meals in amounts used in food fortification (~0.1&#xD;
      mg Fe/kg) will not produce plasma non-transferrin-bound iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be carried out at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Mahidol University,&#xD;
      Bangkok, Thailand. The studies are intended to help understand how giving iron and folic acid&#xD;
      to preschool children in Pemba, Zanzibar, Tanzania, (the &quot;Pemba trial&quot;) in the doses&#xD;
      recommended by the World Health Organization, could have resulted in an increase in&#xD;
      hospitalizations and deaths. The investigators will examine the most likely explanation, that&#xD;
      the dose of iron supplements used in the Pemba trial produced iron in the blood not bound to&#xD;
      the usual carrier for iron (a protein called &quot;transferrin&quot;), that is called&#xD;
      &quot;non-transferrin-bound iron&quot;, abbreviated as NTBI. In children with malaria, this NTBI might&#xD;
      favor the growth of malarial parasites or other causes of infection. At present, no studies&#xD;
      have been carried out to see if NTBI is present after giving iron to patients with malaria.&#xD;
      Using non-radioactive forms of iron (called &quot;stable isotopes&quot;), the investigators will study&#xD;
      iron absorption and NTBI after giving a single dose of iron (like that used in the Pemba&#xD;
      trial) one day after treatment for malaria has been started, while patients still have&#xD;
      malaria parasites in the blood, and then again two weeks later, after the malaria has been&#xD;
      cured. The investigators will study adults admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in&#xD;
      Bangkok, Thailand, with malaria. For reasons of safety, the investigators have chosen to&#xD;
      study adults in the hospital rather than children living in an area like Pemba but the&#xD;
      results should also apply to children. The outcome of this research will help us design ways&#xD;
      of safely giving iron in malarious areas to adults and children to prevent or treat iron&#xD;
      deficiency.&#xD;

      This research will determine the effects of acute infection with Plasmodium falciparum on the&#xD;
      absorption, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of iron from iron supplements and other iron&#xD;
      preparations in non-immune adults in Thailand. Our project will combine measurements of iron&#xD;
      absorption during and after successful treatment of acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria&#xD;
      with characterization of the pharmacokinetics of the appearance of plasma&#xD;
      nontransferrin-bound iron (NTBI) and measurements of the iron regulatory hormone, hepcidin,&#xD;
      and other proteins of iron metabolism. We will examine iron supplements like those used in&#xD;
      the Pemba supplementation trial (Sazawal et al., Lancet 2006; 367, 133-143) as well as&#xD;
      alternative iron interventions that could minimize or avoid the formation of plasma&#xD;
      non-transferrin-bound iron. This research has three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to characterize the pharmacokinetics of the appearance of non-transferrin bound iron in&#xD;
           the systemic circulation after oral administration of an iron supplement or other iron&#xD;
           intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the effect of acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria on absorption of iron&#xD;
           from iron supplements and other iron interventions, using erythrocyte incorporation of&#xD;
           stable isotopes of iron;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to assess the effects of acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria on iron metabolism by&#xD;
           repeated measurements of serum hepcidin, transferrin receptor, ferritin, haptoglobin,&#xD;
           and concentrations of pro- (Th-1) and anti- (Th-2) inflammatory cytokines, erythrocyte&#xD;
           zinc protoporphyrin, and the complete blood count with absolute reticulocyte count and&#xD;
           reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies of the effects of infection with P. falciparum on iron absorption and&#xD;
      metabolism will further our basic understanding of the interaction of iron supplements with&#xD;
      malaria and other infections. The results could help guide the choice of optimal means for&#xD;
      the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency in regions endemic for malaria.&#xD;
      Characterization of the pharmacokinetics of changes in plasma iron produced by administration&#xD;
      of conventional iron supplements could lead to the design and development of new formulations&#xD;
      of supplemental iron that would maximize iron absorption while minimizing risks associated&#xD;
      with non-transferrin-bound plasma iron. Because of the public health importance of assuring&#xD;
      iron sufficiency in mothers, our studies are focused on women of childbearing age but the&#xD;
      results should be broadly applicable to the optimal means of providing iron to infants and&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
