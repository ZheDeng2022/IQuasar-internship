      Deep Low-Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for cessation of pathological&#xD;
      gambling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathological gambling (PG) is characterized by a persistent pattern of continued gambling&#xD;
      behavior despite its adverse consequences. PG is a chronic, progressive, male-dominated&#xD;
      disorder, which has a prevalence of 1% to 3.4% among US adults. Typically, the patient's life&#xD;
      becomes dominated by the gambling behavior leading to overwhelming financial burdens, an&#xD;
      inability to maintain a career, and to the eventual disintegration of family relationships.&#xD;
      The enormous personal and social consequences of this disorder include a high rate of suicide&#xD;
      attempts, legal problems, and criminal behavior [R1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several theoretical models of drug addiction have suggested that addiction is related to&#xD;
      abnormal activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex system, which is necessary for&#xD;
      inhibiting both the craving for immediate reward and excitement-seeking behavior [ref2].&#xD;
      Neuropsychological studies of pathological gamblers [ref 3to9 ref2 ref10] have demonstrated&#xD;
      that pathological gamblers have deficits in the frontal lobe/reward system leading&#xD;
      investigators to hypothesize that impairment of executive function may play an important role&#xD;
      in the etiology of pathological gambling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drawing from the field of drug dependence, it has been speculated that the underlying&#xD;
      pathology in pathological gambling is a reduction in the sensitivity of the reward system.&#xD;
      Reuter et al studied pathological gamblers and controls during a guessing game using&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging and observed a reduction of ventral striatal and&#xD;
      ventromedial prefrontal activation in the pathological gamblers that was negatively&#xD;
      correlated with gambling severity, linking hypo-activation of these areas to disease severity&#xD;
      [ ref11]. Studies in the field of addiction have shown that prefrontal regulation of behavior&#xD;
      is reduced in basal conditions, thereby contributing to the reduced salience of non-drug&#xD;
      motivational stimuli and reduced decision-making ability. However, when stimuli predicting&#xD;
      drug availability are presented, there is profound activation of the prefrontal cortex and&#xD;
      glutamatergic drive to the nucleus accumbens [ref12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potenza et al in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated that male&#xD;
      pathological gamblers showed relatively reduced activity in the frontal and orbitofrontal&#xD;
      cortex, caudate and basal ganglia and thalamus as compared to controls when presented with&#xD;
      visual gambling cues [ref13].Recent neurobehavioral studies have demonstrated poor&#xD;
      performance on tests of executive function in pathological gamblers suggesting that the&#xD;
      financial risk-taking behavior seen in PG may be associated with both dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      and orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction [ref 14-17].Neuropsychological studies of PGs have&#xD;
      demonstrated that PGs have deficits in the frontal lobe/reward system [ref18 ref10].Patients&#xD;
      with pathological gambling demonstrated greater decreases in binding potential in the ventral&#xD;
      striatum during gambling (13.9%) than control patients (8.1%), likely reflecting greater&#xD;
      dopaminergic release. Ventral striatal bindings at baseline during control task were also&#xD;
      lower in patients with pathological gambling [ref19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reductions in right prefrontal activity during decision-making appear to be modulated by the&#xD;
      presence of gambling problems and may reflect impaired working memory, stimulus reward&#xD;
      valuation, or cue reactivity in substance dependent individuals [ref20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      PG is related to response perseveration and diminished reward and punishment sensitivity as&#xD;
      indicated by hypoactivation of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex when money is gained and&#xD;
      lost. Moreover, intact planning abilities and normal dorsal frontostriatal responsiveness&#xD;
      indicate that this deficit is not due to impaired executive functioning. Response&#xD;
      perseveration and ventral prefrontal hypo-responsiveness to monetary loss may be markers for&#xD;
      maladaptive behavior seen in chemical and non-chemical addictions [ref21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one study, subjects and 10 matched healthy control subjects underwent fMRI during visual&#xD;
      presentations of gambling-related video alternating with video of nature scenes. Pathological&#xD;
      gambling subjects and control subjects exhibited overlap in areas of brain activity in&#xD;
      response to the visual gambling cues; however, compared with control subjects, PG subjects&#xD;
      exhibited significantly greater activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC),&#xD;
      including the inferior and medial frontal gyri, the right parahippocampal gyrus, and left&#xD;
      occipital cortex, including the fusiform gyrus [R22].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that High-frequency (20-Hz) rTMS of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      can reduce cigarette smoking significantly [ref23].In another study, found that multiple&#xD;
      high-frequency rTMS of the DLPFC can attenuate nicotine craving [ref 24].Regarding cocaine&#xD;
      addiction treatment with TMS, it has been shown that one session of 10Hz rTMS over right, but&#xD;
      not left, DLPFC transiently reduces craving in cocaine dependent individuals [ref25].Politi&#xD;
      et al. conducted a study including thirty-six subjects fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for cocaine&#xD;
      dependence. Subjects were treated with 20 trains of TMS applied to the left prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      in frequency of 15 Hz and intensity of 100% of the motor threshold. Repeated measures&#xD;
      analyses of variance showed that cocaine craving were gradually reduced during sessions of&#xD;
      TMS [ref26].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Assuming substance addiction and pathological gambling share similar&#xD;
      patho-physiology and considering the evidence that transcranial magnetic stimulation of left&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can ameliorate addiction in both smoking [ ref23 ] and&#xD;
      cocaine[ ref26 ] we hypothesize that transcranial magnetic stimulation may also reduce&#xD;
      gambling &quot;craving&quot; in pathological gamblers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H-coil placed over the frontal cortex exerts a significant effect over the entire ipsilateral&#xD;
      cortical hemisphere, but significantly less over the contralateral hemisphere [ref27].Thus,&#xD;
      the H-coil placed over the DLPFC is hypothesized to exert a direct and more consistent effect&#xD;
      on cortical and subcortical regions such as the anterior cingulate and nucleus accumbens&#xD;
      (ventral striatum), compared to the figure-8 coil. Because these regions are considered to&#xD;
      play a role in drug craving and addiction, rTMS applied with the H-coil may be more effective&#xD;
      in reducing drug craving than rTMS applied with the standard figure-8 coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep TMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep TMS is currently being evaluated as a treatment option in major depression. It has been&#xD;
      shown to be a safe procedure [ref28, ref29]. The innovative design of Brainsway H-Coils is&#xD;
      intended to generate sufficient magnetic field strength to stimulate neurons deep inside the&#xD;
      brain mass without posing a hazard. This forms the basis of the Brainsway H-Coil used in&#xD;
      their deep rTMS device. The coils are designed to maximize the electrical field deep in the&#xD;
      brain by the summation of separate fields projected into the skull from several points around&#xD;
      its periphery. The device also minimizes the accumulation of electrical charge on the surface&#xD;
      of the brain, which can give rise to an electrostatic field that might reduce the magnitude&#xD;
      of the induced electric field both at the surface and inside, and reduce the depth&#xD;
      penetration of the induced electric field [ref30]. The unique shape of the device's base&#xD;
      includes wire coils containing several wire strips, set tangentially to the scalp's surface.&#xD;
      Each set of strips is connected in series and contains current flowing in the same direction,&#xD;
      therefore generating a field that extends into the brain in a specified orientation from each&#xD;
      location along the scalp. Computerized theoretical calculations were made in order to&#xD;
      optimize the coil design for maximizing the percentage of stimulation in depth relative to&#xD;
      the cortical regions. These, in conjunction with tests performed in a phantom model, [ref 30,&#xD;
      ref28, ref27] demonstrated the ability to stimulate, by means of the H-Coil, deep brain&#xD;
      regions. It may be assumed then that the activation of deep brain regions and their&#xD;
      interconnecting fibers may serve as a new approach in treating neuropsychiatry illnesses with&#xD;
      prominent advantage over the standard coil, unable to affect regions as deep as the H-Coil.&#xD;
      Deep TMS could be more effective than rTMS due to its deeper penetration into brain tissues&#xD;
      [ref28]. The deeper penetration should produce greater action on nerve fibers connecting the&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex to the limbic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized controlled study of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation conducted in&#xD;
      Israel, 32 healthy volunteers (9 of which were tested for H1 coil presented in this report)&#xD;
      were evaluated for possible cognitive impairment. Cognitive evaluation was conducted using&#xD;
      the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), which is sensitive to&#xD;
      cognitive changes caused by a wide range of Central Nervous System disorders and medication&#xD;
      side-effects. No deterioration in cognitive functions was found, except for a transient&#xD;
      short-term effect of the H1-coil on spatial recognition memory on the first day of rTMS (but&#xD;
      not in the following treatment days). Questionnaires conducted for emotional or mood&#xD;
      alterations, showed no significant changes except for reports on 'detachment' experienced by&#xD;
      subjects treated with the H1-coil.In addition, stimulation with the novel H-coils was found&#xD;
      to be well tolerated, with no adverse physical or neurological outcomes [ref29].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraindications to deep TMS are essentially the same as those for rTMS. Absolute&#xD;
      contraindications include history of any metal object in the head, known history of any&#xD;
      metallic particles in the eye, implanted cardiac pacemaker or any intra-cardiac lines,&#xD;
      implanted neurostimulators, surgical clips or any medical pumps, history of cochlear implants&#xD;
      and a history of seizure or heat convulsion. Relative contraindications include epilepsy or&#xD;
      seizure in first degree relatives, history of head injury; frequent or severe headaches,&#xD;
      migraines; hearing loss; drug abuse or alcoholism, pregnancy or not using a reliable method&#xD;
      of birth control and systemic and metabolic disorders.&#xD;
