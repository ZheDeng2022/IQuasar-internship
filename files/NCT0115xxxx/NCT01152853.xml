      In case of gastric cancer, the incidence of HER-2 positivity (2+, 3+ on IHC and/or FISH (+))&#xD;
      is reported as similar as that of breast cancer, that is 22% of all cases. A recent ToGA&#xD;
      Trial, phase III trial comparing trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy&#xD;
      (fluoropyrimidine+cisplatin) versus chemotherapy alone in chemotherapy-naïve HER-2 (+)&#xD;
      gastric cancer shows the significant benefit of using trastuzumab in terms of overall&#xD;
      survival and progression-free survival. It provides the clinical evidence of HER-2 as a&#xD;
      reasonable and potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, lapatinib, HER-1 and HER-2 dual inhibitor, is also testing under the clinical trial&#xD;
      in gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preclinical study, PF-00299804 is highly active in HER-2 amplified gastric cancer cell&#xD;
      lines.(SNU preclinical data) So, we plan this phase II trial of PF-00299804 monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with HER-2 positive advance gastric cancer after failure of at least one&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of HER-2 during carcinogenesis and its prognostic role in breast cancer has been&#xD;
      already well established. Furthermore the value of HER-2 as a reasonable therapeutic target&#xD;
      in breast cancer has translated into the good clinical therapeutic result using HER-2&#xD;
      targeting agent, such as trastuzumab and lapatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of gastric cancer, the incidence of HER-2 positivity (2+, 3+ on IHC and/or FISH (+))&#xD;
      is reported as similar as that of breast cancer, that is 22% of all cases. A recent ToGA&#xD;
      Trial, phase III trial comparing trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy&#xD;
      (fluoropyrimidine+cisplatin) versus chemotherapy alone in chemotherapy-naïve HER-2 (+)&#xD;
      gastric cancer shows the significant benefit of using trastuzumab in terms of overall&#xD;
      survival and progression-free survival. It provides the clinical evidence of HER-2 as a&#xD;
      reasonable and potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, lapatinib, HER-1 and HER-2 dual inhibitor, is also testing under the clinical trial&#xD;
      in gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PF-00299804 is an orally available, potent, and highly selective irreversible small molecule&#xD;
      inhibitor of the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER) family of tyrosine&#xD;
      kinases:HER-1 (EGFR), HER-2 and HER-4 (HER-3 does not possess kinase activity). PF-00299804&#xD;
      inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the HER family through binding at the ATP binding&#xD;
      site, which results in covalent modification of a cystine in the ATP binding pocket. The&#xD;
      unique irreversible and highly selective properties of PF-00299804 for the HER kinase family&#xD;
      results in sustained suppression of receptor tyrosine kinase activity. The long-lasting&#xD;
      inhibition of receptor phosphorylation reduces concern over potentially short plasma&#xD;
      half-lives. Furthermore, the low nanomolar potency and irreversible binding of the intended&#xD;
      targets reduce the need for high peak plasma levels, which in turn could minimize&#xD;
      target-nonspecific toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preclinical study, PF-00299804 is highly active in HER-2 amplified gastric cancer cell&#xD;
      lines.(SNU preclinical data)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the standard of care for advanced gastric cancer has been of modest benefit with&#xD;
      plateau in response rates using various combination chemotherapies. Therefore, development of&#xD;
      treatment options for these advanced gastric cancer patients, especially HER-2 (+) gastric&#xD;
      cancer patients, remains a target of active research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the investigators plan this phase II trial of PF-00299804 monotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      HER-2 positive advance gastric cancer after failure of at least one chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
