    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the incidence of side effects of buccal and&#xD;
      sublingual misoprostol when combined with mifepristone for medical abortions of less than 9&#xD;
      weeks gestation. The secondary outcome is to compare the complete abortion rate and&#xD;
      induction-abortion interval between the two methods of administration of misoprostol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After mifepristone was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2000,&#xD;
      the combination of mifepristone 200 mg and vaginal use of misoprostol 800 mcg became almost a&#xD;
      standard of care in early medical abortion up to 63 days of gestation. When combined with&#xD;
      mifepristone for medical abortion in the first trimester, vaginal administration of&#xD;
      misoprostol is more effective, faster, and has a lower rate of ongoing pregnancy, and fewer&#xD;
      gastrointestinal side effects than oral misoprostol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although misoprostol is more effective when given vaginally, most women prefer the oral route&#xD;
      because this can avoid the uncomfortable vaginal examination and provide more privacy during&#xD;
      medical induction. Another concern about vaginal administration is the potential risk of&#xD;
      infection. In late March 2006, analyses of serious uterine infections following medical&#xD;
      abortions by a regimen of oral mifepristone followed by vaginal misoprostol led Planned&#xD;
      Parenthood Federation of America health centres to change the route of misoprostol&#xD;
      administration. Given these concerns, alternative administration via sublingual (holding&#xD;
      pills under the tongue) and buccal (holding pills in the cheek) routes have been&#xD;
      investigated, as the misoprostol is absorbed directly and avoids the gastrointestinal system&#xD;
      similar to vaginal administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pharmacokinetic study showed that sublingual administration of misoprostol resulted in the&#xD;
      greatest bioavailability when compared with oral or vaginal administration. In a randomized,&#xD;
      cross-over pharmacokinetic study of 10 women by Schaff and colleagues of sublingual versus&#xD;
      buccal misoprostol 800 mcg, the mean misoprostol plasma concentration-time curves at 4 hours&#xD;
      and the maximum concentration were significantly higher for sublingual administration than&#xD;
      the buccal route. However, buccal misoprostol administration resulted in fewer symptoms and&#xD;
      was found to be more acceptable by women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Buccal misoprostol 800 mcg after mifepristone 200 mg for terminating pregnancy through 63&#xD;
      days of gestation has a higher success rate and less ongoing pregnancy when compared with&#xD;
      oral misoprostol, especially in pregnancies of 57-63 days. Adverse effect profiles were&#xD;
      similar, although fever and chills were reported approximately 10% more often among women who&#xD;
      took buccal misoprostol. When used for abortion through 56 days of gestation, buccal&#xD;
      administration of misoprostol after mifepristone appears to be a highly effective and&#xD;
      acceptable alternative compared with vaginal administration, and with similar adverse effects&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical abortions of less than 9 weeks gestation using sublingual misoprostol 800 mcg after&#xD;
      mifepristone 200 mg has achieved complete abortion rate of 98.2% but is associated with more&#xD;
      gastrointestinal side effects, fever, and chills when compared with vaginal route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both buccal and sublingual administration of misoprostol following mifepristone have been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in inducing first trimester medical abortions, but with different side&#xD;
      effects profile. No clinical trials have been conducted comparing buccal and sublingual&#xD;
      administration of misoprostol in first trimester medical abortion. The purpose of the present&#xD;
      study is to compare the incidence of side effects of buccal and sublingual misoprostol when&#xD;
      combined with mifepristone.&#xD;
