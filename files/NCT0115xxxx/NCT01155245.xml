  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects on bone quality of a medication (Teriparatide) used&#xD;
      to treat people with severe osteoporosis. Teriparatide is the only bone formation therapy&#xD;
      that has been approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in Canada.&#xD;
      Osteoporosis is currently diagnosed using a bone mineral density (BMD) scan, which measures&#xD;
      the amount of mineral (calcium etc) in bones (the higher the amount of mineral, the lower the&#xD;
      fracture risk). Although BMD is linked to bone strength and is used to measure fracture risk,&#xD;
      it does not give information on bone structure (called bone geometry) which can also tell us&#xD;
      a great deal about fracture risks. Clinical trials have shown that teriparatide increases BMD&#xD;
      at the lumbar spine and total hip, while BMD at the forearm decreases after 20 months of&#xD;
      therapy. Whether this decrease of BMD at the forearm suggests a higher risk of wrist fracture&#xD;
      or a change in bone structure is unclear. Bone biopsies of the pelvis done on people taking&#xD;
      teriparatide shows improvement of bone geometry (ie bone thickness and increased trabeculae&#xD;
      (small interconnecting rods of bone), suggesting that a change in bone geometry at the wrist&#xD;
      may be occurring as well. Currently, there is a new technology, high resolution pQCT&#xD;
      (HR-pQCT) that can assess bone geometry without a biopsy. Since bone strength is affected&#xD;
      both by BMD and bone structure (as well as other material properties), our group is&#xD;
      interested in examining changes in bone geometry at the forearm (a non-weight bearing site)&#xD;
      and ankle (a weight bearing site) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who receive 24&#xD;
      months of teriparatide therapy. The investigators believe that this new approach of measuring&#xD;
      bone strength will help us better understand whether teriparatide has different effects at&#xD;
      different bone sites.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects on bone quality of a medication used to treat severe&#xD;
      osteoporosis. Teriparatide (PTH) is the only bone formation therapy that has been approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in Canada. It works by inducing new&#xD;
      periosteal bone apposition, which results in improved bone geometry and increased bone&#xD;
      strength, changes that may not be captured by bone mineral density (BMD) measurements.&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trials have shown that teriparatide increases BMD at the lumbar spine&#xD;
      and total hip, while BMD at the forearm may decrease after 20 months of therapy. As no data&#xD;
      to date has been published on changes in bone geometry at the radius either by bone biopsy or&#xD;
      high resolution peripheral quantitative computer tomography (HR-pQCT) in patients receiving&#xD;
      PTH therapy, it is unclear whether the decline in BMD at the distal radius observed during&#xD;
      PTH therapy is indicative of decreases in bone strength, or is a result of increases in the&#xD;
      width of the radius. It is our intention to fill this gap in knowledge with regard to how PTH&#xD;
      affects BMD and bone structure at the radius and tibia in postmenopausal women with severe&#xD;
      osteoporosis. Examining these two components will enable us to better understand the effect&#xD;
      of teriparatide on bone strength at the radius and the tibia, and bone strength in general,&#xD;
      independent of changes in BMD after a course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are to determine the effect of 24 months of teriparatide&#xD;
      therapy on cortical thickness, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation&#xD;
      and BV/TV, as measured by HR-pQCT (XtremeCT, Scanco Medical, Switzerland) at the radius and&#xD;
      tibia in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The primary outcome will be cortical&#xD;
      thickness; the other measures will be secondary outcomes. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      determine the effect of 24 months of teriparatide therapy on moment of inertia, connectivity&#xD;
      index, and bone strength, as measured by the HR-pQCT and calculated using finite element&#xD;
      modeling analysis at the radius and tibia in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label before and after study of a cohort of postmenopausal women taking&#xD;
      teriparatide at baseline and at 24 months of teriparatide therapy. Recruitment of these&#xD;
      subjects will be by referral from specialty clinics of the participating investigators. The&#xD;
      postmenopausal women in this study will be prescribed teriparatide according to the most&#xD;
      recent Canadian product monograph for Forteo™. Participants will undergo two(2) procedures on&#xD;
      five(5) separate occasions (at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and at 24 months).&#xD;
      The procedures are HR-pQCT and DEXA. In addition to the above procedures, subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to complete blood tests which are part of standard clinical practice. Blood will be&#xD;
      drawn both at baseline and at 1 month. A follow up phone call will also be made to the&#xD;
      participant at 1, 6, and 12 months to discuss any updates in health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this data, the investigators hope to provide a better understanding of the changes that&#xD;
      occur in bone structure at the distal radius and tibia during teriparatide therapy.&#xD;
