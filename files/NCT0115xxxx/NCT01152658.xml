      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the impact and symptomatic efficacy of&#xD;
      platelets rich plasma (PRP \ PRGF) in the treatment of partial tears of supraspinatus tendon&#xD;
      of rotator cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speed of tendon healing of partial thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon influenced by&#xD;
      local injection of platelets rich plasma&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary endpoint: evaluate functional changes after treatment with local infection with&#xD;
      platelets rich plasma. This functional changes will be evaluate with Constant Score&#xD;
      (questionnaire of shoulder function) and clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: evaluate the healing effect of the platelets rich plasma locally injected&#xD;
      on partial tear of SSP tendon. These morphologic changes will be evaluated by echography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and withdrawal of subjects 40 patients with partial tear of supraspinatus tendon&#xD;
      diagnosed by echography. INCLUSION CRITERIA Male or female patients aged between 18 and 60&#xD;
      Patients suffering from partial tear of supraspinatus tendon on echography. Patients who are&#xD;
      willing to participate in the trial, to come to all scheduled visits and to sign the informed&#xD;
      consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients receiving other methods of treatment to this area, who had&#xD;
      concomitant other injury of the Rotator Cuff tendons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non cooperative patient with the basic rehab program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design&#xD;
&#xD;
      1st visit: Enrollment of patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient will be given a full verbal and written explanation regarding the trial and&#xD;
           treatment. The patient will sign the informed consent form and will be given a serial&#xD;
           number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The screening forms will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Demographic data: date of birth, sex, age and complete medical history, height and&#xD;
           previous treatments will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fill out questionnaire of shoulder function. Constant score. SST ( Simple shoulder test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical examination will be performed. The results will be recorded in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Radiology studies: RX Shoulder AP+LAT+ SSP OUTLET VIEW (as required in normal&#xD;
           examination of RC injury)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Each patient will receive a physiotherapy treatment order according to the protocol of&#xD;
           each social work&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized separation of the patients in two groups: Control group and the trail group.&#xD;
      Patients and medical staff do not know to which group they belong. Double blind trial.&#xD;
      (Outside the physician in charge of preparing the blood and the principal investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
      2nd visit: autologous platelet-rich plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood samples (4 test tubes) will be extracted from control groups and 8 test tubes for&#xD;
           the trial group. The blood of the trial group will be centrifuged and the platelet&#xD;
           fraction extracted and counted (only 4 test tubes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The enriched plasma fraction will be then injected to the trial group in sterile&#xD;
           conditions under ultrasound control. The control group will receive NACL0.9% solution&#xD;
           under the same conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3rd visit: 1sr trimester control&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fill out questionnaire of shoulder function. Constant score. SST ( Simple shoulder test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical examination will be performed. . Constant score The results will be recorded in&#xD;
           the CRF&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ultrasound shoulder examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      4rd visit: 2nd trimester control&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fill out questionnaire of shoulder function. Constant score. SST (simple shoulder test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical examination will be performed. . Constant score The results will be recorded in&#xD;
           the CRF&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ultrasound shoulder examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      5th visit: 3rd trimester control&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fill out questionnaire of shoulder function. Constant score. STT ( simple shoulder test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical examination will be performed. . Constant score The results will be recorded in&#xD;
           the CRF&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ultrasound shoulder examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      6th visit: 4th trimester control&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fill out questionnaire of shoulder function. Constant score. SST ( simple shoulder test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical examination will be performed. . Constant score The results will be recorded in&#xD;
           the CRF&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ultrasound shoulder examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. End of trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one year if treatment if PRGF is proved to be significantly effective on the result of&#xD;
      the trail the medical staff is committed to provide treatment, with rich plasma to control&#xD;
      patients at no cost.&#xD;
