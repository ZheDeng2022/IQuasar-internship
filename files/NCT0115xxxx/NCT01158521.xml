      RATIONALE: Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pazopanib hydrochloride before surgery may make the&#xD;
      tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well pazopanib hydrochloride works when given&#xD;
      before surgery in treating patients with kidney cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of partial nephrectomy in patients with primary renal tumors&#xD;
      otherwise requiring radical nephrectomy after neoadjuvant pazopanib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, tumor diameter/volume change, conversion of hilar to non-hilar&#xD;
      tumors and surgical morbidity of neoadjuvant pazopanib for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily for up to 18 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo either partial or radical&#xD;
      nephrectomy at least 7 days after completion of pazopanib hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Could Undergo Partial Nephrectomy After Pazopanib Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Partial nephrectomy performed after 8 to 16-weeks of pazopanib prescription. The median interval from treatment start to surgery was 10.6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary end point was the percentage of patients who could undergo partial nephrectomy after pazopanib therapy. A reduction in tumor size, with pazopanib treatment, may permit the use of a partial nephrectomy, as opposed to a radical nephrectomy. This would help preserve additional vascularized parenchyma.</description>

    <description>Efficacy of pazopanib was evaluated via the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Assessed by MRI. Definitions of response include Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR)=CR+PR</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically proven renal carcinoma with a clear cell component&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Need for optimized partial nephrectomy based on one or more of the following criteria&#xD;
             (all applicable criteria should be recorded and one criterion designated as the&#xD;
             primary reason):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Functional or anatomic solitary kidney, bilateral tumors, or pre-existing chronic&#xD;
                  kidney disease (CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by&#xD;
                  Cockcroft-Gault formula &lt; 60 mL/min) and tumor amenable to partial nephrectomy,&#xD;
                  but partial nephrectomy would result in estimated GFR &lt; 30 mL/min; this&#xD;
                  estimation will be based on current estimated GFR, nuclear renal scan to estimate&#xD;
                  relative renal function (if 2 kidneys), tumor location(s), and amount of normal&#xD;
                  renal parenchyma that would need to be removed with nephrectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radical nephrectomy is required for tumor excision; however, it would result in&#xD;
                  estimated GFR &lt; 30 mL/min; this estimation will be based on current estimated&#xD;
                  GFR, nuclear renal scan to estimate relative renal function (if 2 kidneys), tumor&#xD;
                  location(s), and amount of normal renal parenchyma that would need to be removed&#xD;
                  with radical nephrectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Greater than 30% likelihood that a partial nephrectomy would be associated with a&#xD;
                  high risk of significant morbidity (e.g. hemorrhage) due to proximity to the&#xD;
                  renal hilum (within 3 mm of main renal artery, renal vein or their primary&#xD;
                  branches) and/or other anatomic factors as determined by the operating surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal nephrometry score of 10-12&#xD;

             2.5 x laboratory upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum alanine transaminase (ALT; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 x&#xD;
             laboratory upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total serum bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 g/dL (no transfusion permitted within 1 week)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 2.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urine to protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio &lt; 1; if UPC &gt; 1, then a 24-hour urine&#xD;
             protein must be assessed; subjects must have a 24-hour urine protein value &lt; 1g to be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) and partial&#xD;
             thromboplastin time (PTT) =&lt; 1.2 X upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
