      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 50% of dialysis patients experience sleep disturbances that significantly affect&#xD;
      quality of life, overall morbidity, and mortality. There is no effective therapy except&#xD;
      hypnotics, which have notable side effects. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective&#xD;
      for treating peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, the elderly and cancer patients with chronic&#xD;
      insomnia, but its effectiveness has never been reported in hemodialysis (HD) patients and its&#xD;
      impacts on the inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and autonomic dysfunction in this&#xD;
      population are unknown. The investigators investigated the effectiveness of CBT in HD&#xD;
      patients by assessing changes in sleep quality, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and&#xD;
      autonomic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objects&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to assess the effectiveness of CBT on sleep disturbance in insomnias&#xD;
      HD patients. The investigators also evaluate the impacts of CBT on the inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, oxidative stress and autonomic dysfunction in these insomnias HD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expected to recruit 80 insomnias HD patients undergoing maintenance HD for&#xD;
      more than 3 months for the investigation. Besides, 40 HD patients without sleep disturbance&#xD;
      will be recruited for comparison. Patients with sleep disturbance (N=80) was randomized to&#xD;
      either intervention (CBT) group (N=40) or control group (N=40). Participants in CBT group&#xD;
      will receive 6-week CBT while in control group and patients without sleep disturbance only&#xD;
      receive sleep hygiene education. The subjects were assessed at baseline and after the&#xD;
      intervention with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS),&#xD;
      Beck depression index (BDI) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) for men&#xD;
      and the Index of Female Sexual Function (IFSF) for women; and inflammatory cytokines (serum&#xD;
      IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α levels), oxidative stress (TBARS, Total antioxidant status and serum&#xD;
      8-OHdG) and autonomic dysfunction (Baroreflex sensitivity, BRS) were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that CBT can improve the sleep disturbance in HD patients and may&#xD;
      change the inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and autonomic dysfunction after the&#xD;
      intervention in insomnias HD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is common in patients with renal disease. According to previous studies, it&#xD;
      occurs in more than 50% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and those undergoing&#xD;
      dialysis. 1, 2 Insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), daytime sleepiness, and sleep apnea&#xD;
      syndrome are common complaints; such sleep disturbances significantly affect the quality of&#xD;
      life, overall morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality. 3-5 The main remedy for sleep&#xD;
      disturbances, hypnotics, have notable side effects such as daytime sleepiness, psychological&#xD;
      dependence, and drug-to-drug interactions, which make these drugs less than an optimal&#xD;
      therapy. 6 Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), the most widely used psychological&#xD;
      intervention for insomnia, combines cognitive strategies such as stimulus control and&#xD;
      relaxation training and has been proven to be effective for chronic insomnia in the elderly,&#xD;
      cancer patients, and chronic pain sufferers7, 8. In most published articles CBT has been&#xD;
      reported be superior to pharmacological and other behavioral therapies.9 In our previous&#xD;
      investigation10, we found that the CBT was effective in PD patients with sleep disturbance&#xD;
      presented with declined of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Fatigue Severity Scale&#xD;
      (FSS); furthermore, the inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α also declined&#xD;
      after CBT in those insomnias PD patients. In previous studies, changes in cytokine release&#xD;
      correlated with insomnia in patients undergoing hemodialysis11 or with breast cancer.12&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the effectiveness of CBT of sleep disturbance in insomnias HD patients is still&#xD;
      not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of CBT for treatment of HD patients with&#xD;
      insomnia by assessing changes in sleep quality subjectively through self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires. The purpose of this study was to identify new therapeutic options for sleep&#xD;
      disorders beyond hypnotics in HD patients. Because the association of sleep disturbance,&#xD;
      oxidative stress and autonomic dysfunction in general population and patient with sleep apnea&#xD;
      were demonstrated in previous investigations, we also investigate the possible impacts of CBT&#xD;
      on the oxidative stress, autonomic dysfunction in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of CBT for sleep disturbance in maintenance HD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the possible impacts of CBT on inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and&#xD;
           autonomic dysfunction in insomnias HD patients. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and autonomic dysfunction in HD&#xD;
           patients with and without sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study designs and methods Eighty ESRD patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for&#xD;
      more than 6 months with subjective complaint of sleep disturbance and screening PSQI ≥ 5 will&#xD;
      be recruited for the investigation. Besides, 40 ESRD patients undergoing HD for more than 6&#xD;
      months without sleep disturbance will also be recruited as the population-base control group.&#xD;
      Insomnias HD patients (N=80) will be randomized into interventional group (CBT group) and&#xD;
      control group in 1:1 ratio in the following 6-week trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (N=120) will receive questionnaires including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index&#xD;
      (PSQI), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Beck depression index (BDI) and the International Index&#xD;
      of Erectile Function (IIEF) for men and the Index of Female Sexual Function (IFSF) and&#xD;
      check-ups of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) for autonomic dysfunction before the trial. Also,&#xD;
      all of them will get fasting blood sampling at the initiation of trial in the morning before&#xD;
      mid-week HD section for analysis of inflammatory cytokines (serum IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α&#xD;
      levels) and oxidative stress (TBARS, Total antioxidant status and serum 8-OHdG). Participants&#xD;
      with sleep disturbance will be randomized into CBT group and control group in 1:1 ratio and&#xD;
      all of them receive sleep hygiene education before the trial. Participants who randomized&#xD;
      into the CBT group will receive 6 1-hour weekly treatment sessions of CBT during the 6-week&#xD;
      period. Participants who received hypnotics chronically before being recruited were&#xD;
      maintained at the same dose of hypnotics during the therapy. After the 6-week trail, all&#xD;
      participants will receive PSQI, FSS, BDI, IIEF, IFSF and BRS again and 2nd blood sampling for&#xD;
      analysis of inflammatory cytokine and oxidative stress again. All the questionnaires, BRS and&#xD;
      analyses of inflammatory cytokine and oxidative stress will be performed again 3 months after&#xD;
      the trial for the long-term follow-up analysis. The details of investigation are demonstrated&#xD;
      in Figure 1.&#xD;
