      Many studies have shown that women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have&#xD;
      an increased risk of developing diabetes later in life. The purpose of the study is to test&#xD;
      whether a web-based lifestyle intervention program adapted from the NIH sponsored Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Program (DPP), modified specifically for women with a recent history of GDM,&#xD;
      incorporating advice about diet and physical activity, delivered in the first 12 months after&#xD;
      delivery will help women lose weight, improve overall health, and decrease their risk factors&#xD;
      for type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated that intensive lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) could reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (Knowler, Barrett-Connor et al. 2002). These findings were consistent,&#xD;
      regardless of ethnicity, age, body mass index (BMI), gender (Knowler, Barrett-Connor et al.&#xD;
      2002). However, the DPP lacks a specific focus on new mothers with a recent history of&#xD;
      gestational diabetes despite their documented high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Although there are recommendations that all women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)&#xD;
      receive postpartum testing for diabetes and type 2 diabetes risk reduction, study findings&#xD;
      suggest that women with a recent history of GDM may be unaware of their risk for future&#xD;
      diabetes, and also do not take steps to reduce their risks (Kim et al., 2007). The postpartum&#xD;
      period is also a time when many changes occur in a woman's life, with competing&#xD;
      responsibilities often altering sleep patterns, work schedules, eating patterns, exercise&#xD;
      regularity, and time allocation (Walker, 1999; Swan et al., 2007). New mothers may have&#xD;
      difficulties engaging in healthy lifestyle programs because of lack of time and energy, and&#xD;
      because of competing work and family demands, including child care (Swan, Kilmartin, and&#xD;
      Liaw, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modeled around the barriers identified in literature and gleaned from the focus groups and&#xD;
      informant interviews of the preliminary study (2009p-000042), we have created a&#xD;
      lifestyle/behavioral intervention that utilizes a modified DPP.&#xD;
