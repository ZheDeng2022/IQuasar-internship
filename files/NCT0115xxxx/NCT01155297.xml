      Introduction: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is considered an important public health problem,&#xD;
      with prevalence of 9.6% in our population. The CKD has as main symptoms fatigue, muscle&#xD;
      weakness and poor exercise tolerance, which directly contribute to physical inactivity and&#xD;
      low mobility, increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality in CKD patients with significant&#xD;
      impact on quality of life of these patients. Thus, patients with CKD have poor quality of&#xD;
      life, high incidence of cardiovascular diseases, high prevalence of endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
      the consequent increase in arterial stiffness and serum concentration of asymmetric&#xD;
      dimethylarginine (ADMA). It is believed that the conditioning of these patients may reduce&#xD;
      cardiovascular risks and improve the quality of life. Aim of the study: Evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of exercise training in relation to functional capacity, quality of life, pulse wave velocity&#xD;
      and ADMA in patients with CKD on dialysis. Materials and methods: Is a randomized controlled&#xD;
      study, with 34 CKD patients on conservative treatment, divided into control group (with&#xD;
      stretching exercises and metabolic exercises) and training group, those undergoing physical&#xD;
      training, aerobic and resistance during six months. Before and after exercise training,&#xD;
      patients will be assessed using the SF-36 and IPAQ. Also be held assessment of pulse wave&#xD;
      velocity, measurement of serum ADMA and spirometry testing. Statistical analysis consisted of&#xD;
      t test for independent data or chi-square when appropriate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CKD is currently regarded as an important worldwide public health problem. In the United&#xD;
      States, approximately 10.8% of population has this disease (Sarnak et al 2003) and it is&#xD;
      estimated that by 2015 about 40 million people in this country will develop chronic renal&#xD;
      failure (BRONAS, 2009). In Brazil, epidemiological data are rare, but there is a study that&#xD;
      there is a prevalence of 9.6% in the population (Bastos et al, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skeletal muscles of patients with CKD may present structural alteration and degeneration&#xD;
      of muscle fibers, contributing to reduction of strength and endurance. The use of steroid&#xD;
      medications, malnutrition, hormonal and electrolyte abnormalities are also other elements&#xD;
      (CHAN, CHEEMA, SINGH, 2007). These symptoms directly contribute to physical inactivity and&#xD;
      low mobility, increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD (MANSUR&#xD;
      LIMA; NOVAES, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the quality of life of CKD patient is needed to identify how and in which&#xD;
      dimensions of this patient's life is being affected, for such investigation SF 36 is widely&#xD;
      used (CATTAI et al, 2007). The SF-36 assesses quality of life for the individual analysis of&#xD;
      physical, social, emotional and mental health. (Castro et al, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous ways to assess functional capacity, and the cardiopulmonary exercise test&#xD;
      (ET), is a valuable method for. Involves the assessment of respiratory, metabolic and&#xD;
      cardiovascular variables by measurement of pulmonary gas exchange during exercise and&#xD;
      expression of functional assessment indices (SIERRA, 1997; Yasbek JR, 1998). The functional&#xD;
      capacity or aerobic capacity is determined by obtaining the contents of maximal oxygen uptake&#xD;
      (VO2 max) and ventilatory anaerobic threshold (BARROS NETO; Tebexreni; TAMBEIRO, 2001).&#xD;
      Several studies bounce the importance of physical activity and indicate the benefits that&#xD;
      this can bring to patients with CKD on dialysis. Smith and colleagues (2007) submitted their&#xD;
      dialysis patients to an exercise protocol, consisting of heating, stretching and active and&#xD;
      resistance exercises conducted in 24 sessions. They observed a significant improvement in&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), as well as improved quality of life assessed using&#xD;
      the SF-36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CKD have a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) including coronary&#xD;
      dysfunction, peripheral vascular dysfunction and heart failure (CANZIANI, 2004). The CVD&#xD;
      represent the leading cause of death for patients in early stages of CKD, with a rate of&#xD;
      approximately 45% in patients that do not do dialysis (Abedin et al, 2010). Recent studies&#xD;
      have shown that markers of arterial stiffness are important predictors of mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity related to CVD in CKD patients (MOLLER et al, 2007). The arterial stiffening is a&#xD;
      hallmark of the aging process, due to changes in wall structure of arteries and the&#xD;
      consequent remodeling process that can be accelerated by metabolic disturbances arising from&#xD;
      the CKD (Frimodt-MOLLER et al, 2008; PORAZKO et al, 2009 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a valid instrument to assess arterial distensibility, is&#xD;
      recognized as gold standard for measuring arterial stiffness, because it has good&#xD;
      reproducibility, noninvasive and easy to perform (Di Iorio et al , 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mustata et al (2004) in their study evaluated arterial stiffness and insulin resistance in&#xD;
      dialysis patients, aiming to measure the impact of aerobic training on these variables and&#xD;
      obtained as response a significant decrease in the values of arterial stiffness after&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toussaint et al (2008) conducted a prospective study on the impact of cycling during dialysis&#xD;
      in arterial stiffness patients with CKD and found a significant improvement after physical&#xD;
      training compared with no exercise. With this study the authors speculated that the&#xD;
      improvement in arterial compliance was related to enhanced NO bioavailability serum. The&#xD;
      results of these studies are promising and suggest that exercise training can improve&#xD;
      arterial compliance and reduces left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with CKD. Clearly,&#xD;
      more research is needed in this area to confirm these findings in patients with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abedin et al (2010) analyzing data from a controlled study, found a high prevalence of&#xD;
      vascular calcification and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis patients, showing a positive&#xD;
      relationship between the progression of CKD and CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CKD and generalized vasculopathy, mentioned above are accompanied by endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction (COSTA-HONG et al, 2009). One of the causes of endothelial dysfunction is the&#xD;
      inhibition of nitric oxide (NO), an important vasodilator and potent factor that opposes the&#xD;
      atherogenesis. This inhibition occurs, among other causes, increased serum concentration of&#xD;
      the substance asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) that is present mainly in CVD and CKD&#xD;
      (Mittermayer et al, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oner - Iyidogan et al (2009) show a close relationship between increased values of ADMA and&#xD;
      CKD, justified by the lack of excretion of this substance. In another study, Gibson et al&#xD;
      (2008) analyzed patients with metabolic syndrome and found that they had low endogenous NO&#xD;
      formation and high concentrations of circulating ADMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient with CKD generally along the disease develops insulin resistance, CHF and high&#xD;
      concentration of ADMA (ONER-IYIDOGAN et al, 2009). However in our knowledge no study has&#xD;
      evaluated the effect of physical exercise in the value of ADMA serum of this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only work in our knowledge that evaluated the impact of physical training in patients at&#xD;
      pre-dialysis, written by Boyce et al (1997), examined variables as renal function, blood&#xD;
      pressure and cardiorespiratory endurance. They concluded that exercise training reduces blood&#xD;
      pressure, increases aerobic capacity and muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moinuddin and Leehey (2008) reported that aerobic exercise and muscle training are a great&#xD;
      benefit to CKD patients, improving the VO2max and muscle mass. Chan, &amp; Singh Cheema (2007),&#xD;
      after undergoing 12 weeks of high intensity exercise with progressive and resistance training&#xD;
      during hemodialysis routine, obtained as a result increased muscle mass and strength and&#xD;
      subsequent improvement in quality of life of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the importance of the topic and the fact that appropriate therapeutic slow the&#xD;
      progression of dysfunction, reduce the suffering of patients and reduce costs to the national&#xD;
      health system, sees the need to study the implementation of physical rehabilitation in&#xD;
      patients with CKD who are not undergoing hemodialysis. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of exercise training in relation to functional capacity, quality of life, pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity and ADMA in patients with CKD on conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a randomized controlled study that will be developed at Clinic Hospital, at&#xD;
      School of Medicine of Botucatu. The work is approved by the Ethics and Research committee and&#xD;
      will be started after the informed and formal consent of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will begin with an assessment of quality of life using the SF-36&#xD;
      validated in Brazil; application the short version of IPAQ Questionnaire to identify&#xD;
      sedentary patients, evaluation the PWV and the functional capacity with a spirometry test&#xD;
      (brand Cosmed K4b2, Rome, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use the lab test that is already part of routine in our department for&#xD;
      monitoring patients with CKD, as The Brazilian Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease&#xD;
      recommend. Simultaneously will be collected a venous blood sample for measurement of serum&#xD;
      ADMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be recorded and submitted to statistical analysis. The baseline&#xD;
      characteristics of the groups will be compared by t test for independent data or chi-square&#xD;
      when appropriate. The behavior of the groups will be analyzed by t test for dependent&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
