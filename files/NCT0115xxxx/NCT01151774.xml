      The study doctors are trying to determine if the TEE measurements from your stomach are&#xD;
      helpful in measuring the blood flow to the kidneys.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The significant morbidity and mortality associated with acute kidney injury in critical care&#xD;
      patients and after cardiac surgery is well-known. Studies have demonstrated between 1 to 30%&#xD;
      postoperative mortality, and even higher rates of up to 70% when patients develop kidney&#xD;
      failure and require dialysis. Even small increases in creatinine between 0 to 0.5 mg/dl can&#xD;
      result in a greater than two-fold rise in 30-day mortality. Despite efforts to improve&#xD;
      outcome, there has been no proven effective pharmacological interventions to treat acute&#xD;
      kidney failure. Most recommendations are aimed at prevention by identifying high-risk&#xD;
      patients, avoiding nephrotoxic drugs and minimizing intraoperative hypotensive insults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few studies that have assessed renal blood flow using transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography (TEE). Yang et al. examined the left renal artery of 60 patients using TEE&#xD;
      during cardiac surgery and evaluated the feasibility of using TEE as a method to measure&#xD;
      renal blood flow intraoperatively. Although they were only able to include 60% of the&#xD;
      subjects due to technical difficulties, they did demonstrate less than 10% variability&#xD;
      between measurements and therefore good reproducibility using TEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal blood flow may not be the best method to predict sufficient renal perfusion. Renal&#xD;
      autoregulation is not preserved under general anesthesia even with the maintenance of&#xD;
      adequate mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output. Renal blood flow is further&#xD;
      worsened by hemodilution and hypothermia. In addition, due to its pulsatile nature, the&#xD;
      diameters of the renal arteries vary during the cardiac cycle and are a source of calculation&#xD;
      error when determining renal blood flow as a function of renal blood velocity and arterial&#xD;
      diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal resistive index (RI) is a measure of intrarenal hemodynamics that is calculated using&#xD;
      the blood flow velocities of segmental or intrarenal vessels and correlates with renal blood&#xD;
      flow and renovascular resistance. The renal artery is not used because the flow varies and is&#xD;
      inconsistent between systole and diastole. RI becomes elevated in pathological conditions and&#xD;
      is associated with increasing creatinine, renal injury and dysfunction. As blood flow and&#xD;
      creatinine clearance decrease through the renal vasculature, the resistive index increases.&#xD;
      Resistive index may be a better gauge of renal dysfunction rather than renal blood flow&#xD;
      because it is easier to assess and less dependent on obtaining a Doppler beam view that is&#xD;
      oriented perfectly parallel to the blood flow. Because RI is a ratio of the renal blood flow&#xD;
      velocities [RI = (peak systolic velocity - peak end diastolic velocity)/peak systolic&#xD;
      velocity], the margin of error created by non-parallel Doppler beams cancels out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, resistive index is obtained by transabdominal Doppler ultrasonography (USG)&#xD;
      although there have been transesophageal studies that have used RI as a secondary endpoint&#xD;
      when examining renal blood flow. There is currently no technique that routinely uses TEE to&#xD;
      intraoperatively monitor resistive index as a determination of adequate renal blood perfusion&#xD;
      and an indication of renal compromise.&#xD;
