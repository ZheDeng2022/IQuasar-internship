      The study hypothesis is that treatment of Hereditary Angioedema at the time of prodromal&#xD;
      symptoms will decrease morbidity associated with the disease&#xD;

      Section 3 Study Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal is to perform a randomized double-blind, three-arm, three-way cross-over study&#xD;
      in which subjects with HAE would be placed into one of three different treatment groups based&#xD;
      on computer randomization. Subjects will be randomized to receive placebo, 1000 units, or&#xD;
      1500 units of C1-INH at the onset of prodromal symptoms although they would be blinded to&#xD;
      which one they were receiving. Randomization will be to one of the two doses or placebo and&#xD;
      the sequence of further treatments will be determined randomly in a double-blinded fashion by&#xD;
      a person who is not involved in the study. The randomized drug will be available 24 hours and&#xD;
      7 days a week. They would have to come to the study office to receive the blinded drug, and&#xD;
      would need to seek treatment within 6 hours of the onset of the prodrome. Following the&#xD;
      blinded treatment, the subject would need to be observed for at least 30 minutes. If a&#xD;
      subject develops an acute HAE exacerbation in any of the three treatment periods, they would&#xD;
      have access to 20 units/kg of open label C1-INH for acute treatment also received at the&#xD;
      study office, and the time from onset of symptoms of an acute attack until the time the&#xD;
      subject sought open-label treatment could not exceed 12 hours. Following open label rescue,&#xD;
      the subject would need to be observed for at least 1 hour or until symptoms started to&#xD;
      improve. The subject would also be expected to complete a symptom diary card over the next 24&#xD;
      hours after receiving open-label C1-INH to monitor severity and duration of symptoms (24 Hour&#xD;
      Prodrome/Open-Label Diary Appendix IV) associated with the acute attack. The number,&#xD;
      duration, and severity of acute HAE attacks would be compared for each treatment period. Each&#xD;
      treatment period would last 16 weeks so each subject would be studied for a total of 48&#xD;
      weeks. Because safety has been established when C1-INH is used every third day with&#xD;
      prophylaxis therapy, and patients may receive C1-INH for an attack without limits on the&#xD;
      closeness of the attacks, our patients in this study may be retreated for prodromal symptoms&#xD;
      as they require it, but not more than every other day since prodromes may precede the&#xD;
      swelling and abdominal pain by up to 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombosis has been identified with C1-INH, but only in neonates who were premature and at&#xD;
      much higher doses than 1500 units every third day. Cinryze, also a C1-INH, is FDA approved&#xD;
      for 1000 units every third day for prophylaxis. The dosing used in our study reflects the FDA&#xD;
      approval dosing for Berinert, which is 20 units per kg for acute therapy, so that most&#xD;
      patients will receive 1000 to 2500 units of C1-inh whenever they have an attack without day&#xD;
      restrictions between dosing. The dosage approved by the FDA is 20 units per kg for Berinert&#xD;
      and 1000 units total dose for Cinryze. The dose used in our study approximates these doses,&#xD;
      but is not an FDA approved dose. There are no limits on how often Berinert can be dosed for&#xD;
      acute attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure IV outlines our treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure IV: Three-arm, randomized, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine effect of treating prodromal symptoms with C1-INH infusions of 1000 units, or 1500&#xD;
      units versus placebo. The sequence is random and double-blinded.&#xD;
