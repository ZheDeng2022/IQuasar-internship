  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In lung cancer with enlarged or non-enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) and Positron emission tomography (PET) scan frequently show&#xD;
      discrepancy in tuberculosis-endemic area. Endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial&#xD;
      aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) with ability of real-time nodal sampling possibly improves the nodal&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of nodal diagnosis of contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      CT and PET scan with and without EBUS-TBNA, this study will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer remains a fatal disease worldwide, and surgical treatment offers possibility for&#xD;
      long-term survival. However, the indication and outcome of surgical resection depends on the&#xD;
      pre-operative accurate staging and extent of intra-operative lymph node dissection.&#xD;
      Therefore, the accurate lymph node staging in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is crucial&#xD;
      for planning optimal treatment. Traditionally, the conventional contrast-enhanced CT&#xD;
      essentially identifies enlarged lymph node greater than 1cm as nodal metastasis.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, with moderate sensitivity and specificity, contrast-enhanced CT carries&#xD;
      substantial risk to under-stage small nodal metastasis and to over-stage inflammatory&#xD;
      lymphadenitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) provides&#xD;
      functional images of tumor metabolism, and has been used as a non-invasive alternative other&#xD;
      than contrast-enhanced CT for nodal staging in NSCLC. In the absence of detectable lymph node&#xD;
      enlargement by CT, FDG-PET scan were increasingly used to stage the lymph node status for&#xD;
      NSCLC in some part of world. Hence, the accuracy of FDG-PET might substantially alter the&#xD;
      treatment strategy in an institution where the mediastinoscopy is unavailable for lymph node&#xD;
      sampling. However, it is generally agreed that abnormal FDG uptake occurred frequently in&#xD;
      granulomatous and inflammatory disease. In an endemic area where tuberculosis is still&#xD;
      prevalent; such as Eastern Asia, FDG-PET scan has reportedly shown reduced sensitivity and&#xD;
      positive predictive value in nodal staging of NSCLC. Thereby, FDG-PET scan alone does not&#xD;
      appear to replace mediastinoscopy for nodal staging of NSCLC in a tuberculosis-endemic area,&#xD;
      especially in potentially operable patients without enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent development of curved ultrasound probe-equipped bronchoscope, which enables direct&#xD;
      and real-time aspiration by endobronchial ultrasound- transbronchial needle aspiration&#xD;
      (EBUS-TBNA) of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, has become an less invasive alternative for&#xD;
      nodal staging other than mediastinoscopy. By direct nodal sampling, EBUS-TBNA improves lymph&#xD;
      node staging from an image basis to a cytology basis; or even, pathology basis. However, the&#xD;
      variable sensitivity and negative predictive value of EBUS-TBNA has been reported, especially&#xD;
      in lymph node reduced in size after induction chemotherapy. Nevertheless, reports from NSCLC&#xD;
      without significant mediastinal lymph node enlargement on CT otherwise suggested EBUS-TBNA&#xD;
      exhibited a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting small nodal metastasis. Therefore,&#xD;
      whether EBUS-TBNA retains the reportedly high performance of nodal staging in lung cancer&#xD;
      patients without enlarged mediastinal lymph node on CT in a TB endemic country; a condition&#xD;
      of FDG-PET scan reportedly showed increased false-positive rate, is still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In present study, we primarily aim at the comparison of accuracy of nodal diagnosis of&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced CT and PET scan with and without EBUS-TBNA in a condition of mediastinal&#xD;
      and hilar lymph nodes of lung cancer. Secondarily, we aim at the accuracy of nodal diagnosis&#xD;
      by FDG-PET scan in the same condition, and investigate the characteristics of lymph nodes&#xD;
      with false PET result.&#xD;

    <description>All included patients received TBNA for lymph node study via a flexible ultrasonic bronchoscope with a linear scanning probe on the tip (BF-UC206F-OL8, Olympus). The curved-probe scanned parallel to the insertion direction of bronchoscope, and the obtained images were linked to the ultrasound scanner (EU-2000C, Olympus) incorporated with Doppler-flow imaging. Each lymph node greater than 5mm in short axis measured by cursors was selected for subsequent TBNA with a 22-gauge (NA-201SX-4022, Olympus) needle in a condition of real-time EBUS guidance. A cytology examination was sent for pathologist blinded for the clinical history and image result of patients. When a tissue core was obtained by TBNA, the specimen was also sent for pathology study.</description>
