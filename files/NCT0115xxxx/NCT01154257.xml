  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cleaning the mouth is difficult in critically ill patients who require support from a&#xD;
      breathing machine (ventilator). This is because the plastic (endotracheal) tube which is a&#xD;
      necessary interface between patient and ventilator impedes cleaning. New evidence suggests&#xD;
      that poor oral health may be linked to ventilator associated pneumonia. Throughout the world&#xD;
      both toothbrushes and foam swabs are used to clean the teeth and remove dental plaque,&#xD;
      however it is unknown if one method is more effective than the other. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to establish which (if any) method is most effective at removing plaque in this&#xD;
      population of patients.&#xD;

      Study Objective: The principle aim of this work is to determine whether foam swabs or&#xD;
      toothbrushes offer the most effective method of removing dental plaque in orally intubated&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to profile the microbiological flora in dental plaque,&#xD;
      endotracheal tube and lung. In addition, collection of both plaque samples, used endotracheal&#xD;
      tubes (ETTs) and non-directed bronchoalveolar lavage (NBL) will allow us to determine whether&#xD;
      oral microorganisms contribute to biofilm formation within the ETT and potentially promote&#xD;
      VAP. The findings of this study will not only enhance our knowledge on the organisms involved&#xD;
      in promoting biofilms on ETT, but may also highlight potential management strategies to&#xD;
      reduce their formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Critically ill adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit at the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff in whom mechanical ventilation has been initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: All patients satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria, admitted to the adult&#xD;
      ICU at the University Hospital of Wales from the start date of the study will be considered&#xD;
      eligible for recruitment. Patients identified by the duty consultant will be notified to the&#xD;
      research team. Consent will be obtained and in total 50 patients will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: This is a split mouth design study whereby the intervention (cleaning with a&#xD;
      foam swab or toothbrush) is performed on one side of the mouth. For example foam swab left&#xD;
      side of mouth and toothbrush right side of mouth. Cleaning will be performed daily for a&#xD;
      minimum of 24-hours or until extubation or up to seven days after recruitment, whichever is&#xD;
      the shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-directed bronchoalveolar lavages (NBLs) will be taken on a Monday and Thursday and when&#xD;
      clinically indicated (for example a suspected VAP). This involves the insertion of a sterile&#xD;
      suction catheter into the lung, 10-20ml of sterile saline is instilled and drawn back, and&#xD;
      placed in a sterile universal. The sample will be split into two when there is a suspected&#xD;
      infection, one half going to the UHW microbiology laboratory as usual, the other half will be&#xD;
      profiled as part of the study. If there is no suspected infection all of the sample will be&#xD;
      profiled as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Following recruitment, patients will have their teeth cleaned twice a day with&#xD;
      sterile water for 2 minutes using a 'baby toothbrush' and foam swab, the side to which the&#xD;
      cleaning method is allocated will be randomised. One minute of cleaning assigned to each side&#xD;
      of the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A modified Silness and Loe plaque score (Scannapieco et al 1992) and gingival index (Loe and&#xD;
      Silness 1963) will be recorded prior to cleaning and then each morning following cleaning&#xD;
      throughout the duration of the study. The plaque index will be recorded on the upper and&#xD;
      lower first molars, first bicuspid and central incisors on each side of the mouth from the&#xD;
      buccal surface. The plaque index score will be an average of the six teeth on each side. For&#xD;
      patients with missing index teeth, the remaining teeth in closest proximity will be scored.&#xD;
      The gingival index will be scored on the same teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following recording of the plaque and gingival index plaque samples will be collected on the&#xD;
      same teeth as used for the plaque score. Samples of supragingival plaque will then be&#xD;
      collected from the gingival third portion of the targeted teeth using a sterile curette prior&#xD;
      to initiation of oral care and then once a day before cleaning. Plaque will immediately be&#xD;
      inoculated into 1ml of microbiological transport medium. The transport medium will be diluted&#xD;
      in a serial decimal manner in phosphate buffered saline prior to inoculation of agar plates&#xD;
      using a spiral plating system (Don Whitley Scientific). The following agars will be used to&#xD;
      culture the microorganisms: Blood Agar (aerobic bacteria), Fastidious Anaerobe Agar&#xD;
      (anaerobic bacteria) and CHROMagar Candida (Candida and yeast species). Differential counts&#xD;
      of lactose fermenting enteric bacteria will be through the use of MacConkey Agar, whilst&#xD;
      Staphylococcus species (coagulase positive and coagulase negative) will be detected using&#xD;
      Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA). The inoculated media will be incubated under appropriate gaseous&#xD;
      environments at 37°C for 48 h (aerobes) or 7 d (anaerobes). A total aerobic microbial count&#xD;
      from each side will be obtained from the blood agars and expressed as total colony forming&#xD;
      units (CFUs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of each distinct colony morphotype will be through extensive phenotypic&#xD;
      investigation. Tests will involve Gram staining, oxidase and catalase activity and&#xD;
      biochemical profiling through a range of test systems. The biochemical test systems will&#xD;
      include the APICoryne system (Gram-positive bacilli), APIStrep system (catalase-negative&#xD;
      Gram-positive cocci), APIStaph and ID32Staph (catalase-positive Gram-positive cocci).&#xD;
      Oxidase-negative, Gram-negative bacilli will be profiled using the API20E test whilst,&#xD;
      oxidase-positive Gram-negative bacilli will be profiled using the API NE. Fungal organisms&#xD;
      (Candida and yeast species) will be identified based on colony colour and appearance on the&#xD;
      differential medium, CHROMagar and by biochemical profiling with the Auxocolour 2 system&#xD;
      (biorad).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NBLs collected as outlined in the section on interventions above. Identification of the&#xD;
      organisms present within the NBL samples will be done using the cultural methods outlined&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are extubated during the study then the endotracheal tube will be collected and&#xD;
      transferred to the laboratory. Processing of ETT will involve dividing each tube into&#xD;
      sections for either quantitative identification of organisms by microbial culture, molecular&#xD;
      analysis or microscopical imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sections of each ETT will initially be placed in 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline and vortex&#xD;
      mixed for 30 s with sterilised glass beads to disrupt biofilm aggregates. The PBS solution&#xD;
      will then be removed and diluted serial decimally, 106-fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of the organisms present within the biofilms will be done using the cultural&#xD;
      methods outlined above, together with supplemental molecular analysis (outlined below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      16S ribosomal RNA gene-defined bacterial contamination of endotracheal tubes Sections from&#xD;
      each region of recovered endotracheal tubes will be analysed using molecular procedures. The&#xD;
      method will involve the extraction of total DNA from 500 µl of the specimens using a&#xD;
      Puregeneâ bacterial DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems). Universal bacterial primer pairs, d88&#xD;
      and e94 (Paster et al, 2001) and primers specific for target organisms (Porphyromonas&#xD;
      gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus) will then&#xD;
      be used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene targets within the extracted samples using standard PCR&#xD;
      and reaction conditions. Negative controls will include a reagent control (sterile water as&#xD;
      PCR template) and a sample preparation control (sterile water used in place of the original&#xD;
      sample and exposed to the entire extraction protocol). Positive controls of template DNA from&#xD;
      known species of P. gingivalis, S. aureus and mutans will also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal laser scanning microscopy Sections of the used ETT will also be analysed using&#xD;
      fluorescent in situ hybridization using organism specific Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) probes.&#xD;
      Each specific probe will be conjugated with a distinct fluorescent label to allow for spatial&#xD;
      location and distribution of target organisms (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Candida albicans, S.&#xD;
      mutans) within the ETT biofilm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of other data: Baseline demographics of patients will be recorded, including age,&#xD;
      sex, APACHE II score, co-morbidities, days from hospital admission, and recent antibiotic&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Zsigmondy and DMFT (decayed, missing, filled teeth) score will be recorded by a dental&#xD;
      hygienist during the study to assess the baseline dental status of patients enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Primary outcome: Daily plaque and gingival scores following mechanical&#xD;
      cleaning, with identification and quantification of bacteria within plaque. Quantitative&#xD;
      comparisons will be ascertained from the total log transformed CFU counts and plaque and&#xD;
      gingival scores from the two cleaning methods.&#xD;
