      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the rapid development in technology telemedicine has become a tool with the potential to&#xD;
      improve and optimize the treatment of different diseases and to make diagnostics, treatment&#xD;
      and counseling possible over shorter or longer distances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home based telemedicine is a new method that leads to a series of important questions that&#xD;
      needs to be answered. This study is designed to answer questions concerning patient safety in&#xD;
      telehomecare, the patients´ quality of life, efficiency and a cost benefit analysis of&#xD;
      implementing this technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is about patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital with an acute exacerbation. Approximately 24 hours after admission&#xD;
      half of the patients are randomized to be admitted to their own home supported by telemedical&#xD;
      equipment while the other half remain admitted at the hospital (typically between 5-7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate if telemedical surveillance and treatment in the recovery period of an acute&#xD;
      exacerbation is just as safe as conventional admission of patients with COPD measured on&#xD;
      treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if telemedical surveillance and treatment in the recovery period of an acute&#xD;
      exacerbation compared to conventional treatment of COPD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is comparable in reestablishing Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Demands the same number of treatment days/time before discharge/cessation of telemedical&#xD;
           surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is comparable in quality of life in the two groups of treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Have comparable adverse event profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. leads to a lower total cost in health services (health economical analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Is possible to do for the patients (drop-outs because of the technical equipment or the&#xD;
           patient does not know how to use the equipment.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 Is better seen from the physician's perspective when it comes to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The virtual patient contact / communication&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Technology&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The work process compared to the conventional work process&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Time spent with the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Usability&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Improvement potentials (&quot;the doctors view&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
           8. The equipment is satisfactory for the patient to use&#xD;
&#xD;
           Method&#xD;
&#xD;
           For this study a telemedical platform has been developed on which it is possible to&#xD;
           treat patients in their own homes. The platform consists of a videoconference part that&#xD;
           allows the patients to make contact to qualified medical staff and a technology part&#xD;
           that can transfer vital indicators of the patients´ health condition (lung function,&#xD;
           oxygen saturation, pulse etc.) 175 patients will be included with an expected drop-out&#xD;
           of 20 % or 35 patients. The patients will be equally recruited from two hospitals&#xD;
           (Frederiksberg and Herlev Hospital). All patients must have an exacerbation in their&#xD;
           COPD that requires hospitalization to be included in this study. Each patient&#xD;
           participates in the study for 6 months after discharge with follow-up at 1, 3 and 6&#xD;
           months.&#xD;

      In addition to the main study, two sub studies will be conducted, using the same intervention&#xD;
      and subjects as the main study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. COPD patients´ self-efficacy after virtual admission compared to hospital admission -&#xD;
           implications for clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cognitive function and daily life after virtual admission compared to conventional&#xD;
           hospital admission in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
           --------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ad. 1: COPD patients´ self-efficacy after virtual admission compared to hospital&#xD;
           admission - implications for clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
           Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to transfer the patient from the hospital to the telemedicine based homecare&#xD;
           treatment regimen, the patient must be able to perform tests and treatments and also&#xD;
           contribute to identification of problems and changes in the physical condition. However,&#xD;
           so far it has not been investigated whether patients using telehomecare have or acquire&#xD;
           the necessary skills to cope with the problems entailed by COPD, in interaction with&#xD;
           healthcare professionals and relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary aim of this sub study is to describe what characterizes COPD patients´&#xD;
           self-efficacy after virtual admission compared to hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Self-efficacy will be measured using &quot;The COPD self-efficacy scale&quot;, developed by Wigal&#xD;
           et al (Chest 1991). The mean score will be compared between the two study arms, and&#xD;
           furthermore the changes within the two groups will be assessed. Data will be collected&#xD;
           at baseline, and also three days, six weeks and three months after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, analyses will be conducted to explore the association between&#xD;
           self-efficacy, readmission and the use of bed days during a three month follow-up&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           --------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ad.2: Cognitive function and daily life after virtual admission compared to conventional&#xD;
           hospital admission in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           COPD affects distant organs and causes several complications, including cognitive&#xD;
           dysfunction. The impairment forms a significant clinical problem with consequences for&#xD;
           the patients such as dependency on help for basic daily activities, increased symptom&#xD;
           experience and poor compliance with medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the study is to investigate cognitive function and daily life after virtual&#xD;
           admission compared to conventional hospital admission in patients with COPD. The study&#xD;
           is a part of a randomized multicenter trial, investigating the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
           a telemedicine based treatment regime in COPD patients, compared to conventional&#xD;
           hospital treatment (Telemedicine technology makes it possible to communicate with the&#xD;
           patient using a video conference system connected to a telemedicine communication&#xD;
           platform).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For this sub study, we consecutively include 150 patients from the multicenter trial.&#xD;
           The primary outcome will be cognitive function evaluated by a neuropsychological test&#xD;
           battery (ISPOCD), including verbal learning, memory capacity and attention, at&#xD;
           discharge, and six weeks after discharge. The secondary outcomes is daily life evaluated&#xD;
           by questionnaires including self-reported cognitive function, self-efficacy, activities&#xD;
           of daily living, health related quality of life, anxiety and depression, at discharge,&#xD;
           six weeks and three months after discharge.&#xD;
