  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientists have discovered a number of hormones that control our feelings of hunger and&#xD;
      fullness. One particular hormone, called GLP-1, has been associated with feelings of hunger&#xD;
      and fullness. The overall purpose of this study is to look more closely at how GLP-1 changes&#xD;
      these feelings and to observe how these hormones affect the brain's function. To do this,&#xD;
      volunteers will be asked to come to the clinic for a screening visit, and 2 study visits.&#xD;
      This is an outpatient study with a screening visit which will last about an hour and the two&#xD;
      subsequent study visits for about 3 hours each. During the study, patients will receive a&#xD;
      drug that blocks the effect of a hormone made in the gut. We will take a series of blood&#xD;
      samples to measure hormones and use functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to take&#xD;
      pictures of the brain. Understanding the action of these hormones in the brain may eventually&#xD;
      lead to new ways to help people avoid obesity or lose weight.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Many times each day, we see food or representations of food and evaluate whether or not the&#xD;
      food looks good to us. If it does, we then balance external factors, such as the social&#xD;
      situation or time of day, against internal signals about our hunger state in order to decide&#xD;
      what and when to eat. However, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies&#xD;
      suggest that internal signals, such as hormones regulating appetite and satiety, govern our&#xD;
      food intake in part by acting on neural circuits to affect whether a given food appears&#xD;
      appetizing at that moment. In addition, photographs of food perceived to be &quot;fattening&quot;&#xD;
      activate brain regions involved in appetite and reward processing, including the&#xD;
      hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and orbital frontal cortex. This activity is potently&#xD;
      reduced by food intake, suggesting that it reflects underlying brain mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      satiety. We now propose to study the mechanism of these changes in brain activity by asking&#xD;
      if they are directly related to the action of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a satiety&#xD;
      signal. GLP-1 is released by cells in the gut in response to nutrients, suppressing food&#xD;
      intake, and its actions can be blocked by a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, exendin-[9-39]. In 2&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, crossover studies, we will assess whether exendin-[9-39] infusions&#xD;
      reverse GLP-1-mediated effects on food intake and on brain response to visual food cues. Our&#xD;
      scientific aims are to 1) observe the effect of exendin (9-39) on blocking GLP-1-mediated&#xD;
      satiety in humans and assess its effect on food intake in humans for the first time (to our&#xD;
      knowledge) and 2) to test whether endogenous GLP-1 signaling is required for the effect of a&#xD;
      meal to reduce brain response to visual food cues in humans. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      exendin-[9-39] will diminish the effect of a meal in suppressing subsequent food intake and&#xD;
      in reducing activation to visual food cues in reward pathways. Determining the extent to&#xD;
      which the experience of satiety arises from a decrease in the reward value of food is&#xD;
      fundamentally important to understanding human feeding behavior. In addition, this promising&#xD;
      line of research is directly relevant to some of the most pressing public health issues of&#xD;
      our time: obesity and overnutrition. We hope that investigating mechanisms affecting our&#xD;
      perception of satiety at the most basic level will eventually result in novel behavioral or&#xD;
      pharmacologic strategies for obesity prevention and treatment.&#xD;
