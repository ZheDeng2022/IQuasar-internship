      Liposome Encapsulated Docetaxel (LE-DT) is a novel proprietary delivery system of docetaxel&#xD;
      developed by NeoPharm, Inc. In this Phase I study, the LE-DT was evaluated for the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in patients with advance solid tumors. It was&#xD;
      also evaluated for pharmacokinetic and anti-tumor effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Liposome Entrapped Doxetaxel (LE-DT) is a novel, proprietary delivery system of docetaxel&#xD;
      developed by NeoPharm, Inc. Docetaxel (currently marketed as Taxotere®) is an&#xD;
      anti-microtubule agent that prevents cell division by promoting the assembly and&#xD;
      stabilization of microtubules and is used for the treatment of malignancies from breast,&#xD;
      prostate, lung, gastric, head and neck. By removing toxic detergent used in Taxotere®, LE-DT&#xD;
      showed reduced toxicity and comparable therapeutic efficacy in preclinical studies. In&#xD;
      clinic, it is believed that LE-DT will offer advantages to the patient of fewer side effects&#xD;
      at similar doses, and possibly greater effectiveness when used at higher doses. In addition,&#xD;
      routine premedication to prevent hypersensitivity may not be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of LE-DT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel following intravenous administration of LE-DT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any anti-tumor effects of LE-DT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 5 dose levels have been studied.&#xD;

    <description>This Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LE-DT in patients with advanced cancer. LE-DT was administered by intravenous infusion, over 1 hour, once every 21 days until occurrence of disease progression or toxicity requiring early treatment discontinuation. Dose escalation was not done until the safety and tolerability at a given dose level has been confirmed.</description>
