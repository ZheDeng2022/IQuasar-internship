    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the transgene expression (synthesis of FGF-1 mRNA) in&#xD;
      injected tissue, at injection site, after Intra Muscular (IM) administration of increasing&#xD;
      single doses of NV1FGF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of IM administration of increasing single doses&#xD;
           of NV1FGF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the transgene expression (FGF-1 protein) in injected tissues (injection site&#xD;
           and remote site)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the presence of FGF-1 receptors in injected tissues (injection site and&#xD;
           remote site)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the NV1FGF biodistribution in injected tissues (injection site and remote&#xD;
           site), in multiple organs/tissues when appropriate, and plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the transgene expression (synthesis of FGF-1 mRNA) in injected tissue at&#xD;
           remote site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect data from plasma NV1FGF pharmacokinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate healing of the amputation site&#xD;
