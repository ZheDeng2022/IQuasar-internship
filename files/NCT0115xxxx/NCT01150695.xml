  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare 2 experimental vaccines that could provide protection&#xD;
      from the disease, tularemia. This research will compare the ability of the vaccines to cause&#xD;
      the body to develop an immune (protective) response and obtain more information on side&#xD;
      effects of the vaccines. About 220 male and non-pregnant female volunteers 18 to 45 years&#xD;
      will participate. Volunteers will be assigned to 1 of 2 vaccine groups by chance. About half&#xD;
      of the volunteers will be placed in the DVC-LVS vaccine group and half of volunteers will be&#xD;
      placed in the USAMRIID-LVS vaccine group. Additionally, both groups will receive an injection&#xD;
      of placebo (inactive salt water). Study procedures include physical exam and blood and urine&#xD;
      samples. Evaluation of the vaccination sites will be performed as well as blood samples to&#xD;
      measure the body's response to the vaccine. Participants will be involved in the study for&#xD;
      about 6 months.&#xD;

      Francisella (F.) tularensis is the organism responsible for tularemia. The organism can&#xD;
      infect many different vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, but mostly rodents and lagomorphs.&#xD;
      Transmission to humans is generally via an insect vector, such as ticks, mosquitoes, and&#xD;
      biting flies, or from handling contaminated animal products or carcasses. F. tularensis is a&#xD;
      highly infectious bacterium, with human infection and disease occurring with as few as 10&#xD;
      organisms, and mortality rates approaching 30 percent if untreated. Clinical presentation of&#xD;
      tularemia varies in severity depending on the virulence of the organism, the route of entry,&#xD;
      the extent of system involvement, and the immune status of the host. Following an incubation&#xD;
      period of 3 to 5 days, individuals have an abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, malaise,&#xD;
      anorexia, and fatigue. The clinical presentation of the disease can include one or more the&#xD;
      following forms: ulceroglandular (the most common form of the disease), glandular,&#xD;
      oculoglandular, pharyngeal, gastrointestinal, pneumonic or typhoidal. This study is a Phase&#xD;
      II, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, trial comparing the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      a Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) vaccine produced by DynPort Vaccine&#xD;
      Company (DVC-LVS) to a LVS vaccine in use by the United States Army Medical Research&#xD;
      Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID-LVS). Study Group A will include 110 volunteers&#xD;
      who will be vaccinated with a single dose of the DVC LVS product in one arm and normal saline&#xD;
      (NS) control in the other arm on Day 0. Group B will include 110 volunteers who will be&#xD;
      vaccinated with a single dose of the USAMRIID-LVS product in one arm and normal saline (NS)&#xD;
      control in the other arm on Day 0. Both vaccines will be administered by scarification.&#xD;
      Approximately 100 microliters aliquot will be withdrawn and placed on the skin, a bifurcated&#xD;
      needle will then be used to puncture the skin 15 times through the droplet. The primary&#xD;
      objectives are: (Safety): assess the frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) and Grade 3&#xD;
      and 4 laboratory values following vaccination with either DVC-LVS or USAMRIID-LVS vaccine;&#xD;
      (Take): assess the frequency of &quot;take&quot; (defined as the development of an erythematous papule,&#xD;
      vesicle, and/or eschar with or without underlying induration) following vaccination with&#xD;
      either the DVC-LVS or USAMRIID-LVS vaccine; and (Immunogenicity): assess the rate of&#xD;
      seroconversion following vaccination with either the DVC-LVS or the USAMRIID-LVS vaccine as&#xD;
      measured by a tularemia-specific microagglutination assay. The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
      (Safety): assess the incidence of adverse events (AEs) following vaccination with either the&#xD;
      DVC-LVS or the USAMRIID-LVS vaccine; (Take): assess &quot;take&quot; frequency and difference between&#xD;
      vaccine groups as assessed by an independent committee following vaccination with either the&#xD;
      DVC-LVS or USAMRIID- LVS vaccine; and (Immunogenicity): assess antibody responses for each&#xD;
      group following vaccination with DVC-LVS or USAMRIID-LVS vaccine as measured by a&#xD;
      tularemia-specific microagglutination assay. Parent protocol to sub-study 10-0019.&#xD;
