  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to develop a new and powerful type of immune therapy for&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients. This therapy involves vaccinations with special stimulator cells&#xD;
      found in the human body called dendritic cells. These dendritic cells can take up proteins&#xD;
      released from cancer cells and present pieces of these proteins to immune cells called T&#xD;
      lymphocytes to create a strong stimulatory signal to fight the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of these proteins is called telomerase, which is found on prostate cancers and is&#xD;
      critically important for prostate cancer cells to grow. However, in most cancer patients, the&#xD;
      immune system does not adequately destroy the tumor because the T cells are not stimulated&#xD;
      sufficiently. T cells require strong stimulation before they grow and become active against&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have discovered that substances called ribonucleic acids (RNA), which carry the genetic&#xD;
      instructions for the production of telomerase, can be used to overcome this problem and&#xD;
      stimulate a strong immune response in cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test this hypothesis we have designed a clinical study and will enroll patients&#xD;
      with metastatic prostate cancer expressing telomerase in order to determine whether or not&#xD;
      this vaccine will stimulate T cells, which can recognize and kill prostate tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are to find out whether injections with dendritic cells&#xD;
      grown from blood cells and &quot;pulsed&quot; (mixed together for a short period of time) with RNA&#xD;
      derived from the patient's own tumor are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safe without inducing any major side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. And effective in boosting the patient body's immunity against telomerase expressing&#xD;
           prostate cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Finally, we will test whether or not tumor shrinkage based on serum PSA levels or on&#xD;
           X-ray studies will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that this new form of immune therapy, although in its infancy, will ultimately slow&#xD;
      down tumor growth and prolong survival of prostate cancer patients.&#xD;

      Primary objectives of trial include to evaluate the safety and biologic efficacy of hTERT&#xD;
      mRNA transfected dendritic cells (DC), applied in a prime-boost format, to stimulate&#xD;
      hTERT-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in subjects with metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include estimating objective clinical response, the duration of such&#xD;
      responses, progression-free survival and overall survival among all subjects. The hTERT&#xD;
      mRNA-transfected DC vaccine platform has previously been studied in several phase I/II trials&#xD;
      and has demonstrated safety and bioactivity in subjects with metastatic prostate and renal&#xD;
      cell carcinomas. The objective of this trial is to enhance the observed bioactivity of the&#xD;
      vaccine by using a prime-boost strategy. This is an open label, uncontrolled safety and&#xD;
      efficacy study. Subjects with metastatic prostate cancer will be eligible for this study and&#xD;
      will receive 1x107 cells administered ID at study week 1,2,3,4,5, and 6 (Prime). Thereafter,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized with equal probability to receive either 5x106 cells administered&#xD;
      ID at study week 10 followed by monthly immunizations (Treatment arm A) or 1x107 cells&#xD;
      administered ID at study week 10 followed by monthly immunizations (Treatment arm B). The&#xD;
      safety, biologic and clinical efficacy of each regimen will be analyzed. The study will be&#xD;
      solely conducted at the University of Florida in Gainesville, FL. Subjects will be recruited&#xD;
      through the oncology clinics of the Departments of Urology and Radiation Oncology. The&#xD;
      vaccine will be manufactured in a dedicated GMP-compliant cell production facility located on&#xD;
      the 4th floor of the Cancer Genetics Research Institute. Immunological testing will be&#xD;
      performed in the Immunological Monitoring Core laboratory of the Department of Urology using&#xD;
      standardized assay systems. Subjects with histologically or clinically confirmed metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer (stages pT1-4, N0-3, M+) are eligible for this study. Subjects treated with&#xD;
      medical hormone ablative therapy (LHRH analogues or estrogens) should continue to receive&#xD;
      LHRH analogues only. In subjects receiving nonsteroidal medical hormonal treatment (i.e.&#xD;
      flutamide or bicalutamide) and who are experiencing a rising PSA, a 4 week period of&#xD;
      observation will be required following the discontinuation of the nonsteroidal antiandrogen&#xD;
      prior to study entry. Subjects will be excluded from study if they have received chemotherapy&#xD;
      or other forms of immunotherapy in the 4 weeks prior to study entry. They must not have a&#xD;
      history of autoimmune disease, serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, pulmonary&#xD;
      disease, active hepatitis, serologic evidence for HIV, or be receiving corticosteroid or&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy. All subjects must be older than 18 years. This is a randomized&#xD;
      phase II clinical trial, in which up to 36 subjects will be randomized with equal probability&#xD;
      to one of the two treatment arms. The objective of this trial is to decide which of the two&#xD;
      treatment regimens should be selected for further testing. Hence, the primary objective of&#xD;
      this trial is to select the arm with the highest biologic response and the first ranked arm&#xD;
      will be selected for further study in a larger efficacy trial.&#xD;
