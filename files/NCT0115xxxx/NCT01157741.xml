  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improved methods of community/home management and follow-up of severely undernourished&#xD;
      children need to be developed in low-income countries like Bangladesh. The proposed study&#xD;
      will be conducted at ICDDR,B Hospital and in different urban primary health care centres&#xD;
      within Dhaka city. The efficacy of four different interventions will be evaluated/compared&#xD;
      with control with respect to the rate of completion of clinical follow-up and growth,&#xD;
      morbidity, and changes in psychomotor development in 500 children aged 6-24 months presenting&#xD;
      to ICDDR,B with initial weight-for-age (WA) &lt;-3 Z score. The interventions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Usual follow-up (fortnightly for 1st 3 months) service at the hospital nutrition&#xD;
           follow-up unit (HNFU) including growth monitoring and promotion + health education +&#xD;
           micronutrient supplementation and treatment of intercurrent illness (current standard&#xD;
           practice; control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All management like control group, but follow up at community-based nutrition follow-up&#xD;
           unit (CNFU) (fortnightly for 1st 3 months) (intervention A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All management like intervention A at CNFU + supplementary food (SF) for the first 3&#xD;
           months (intervention B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All management like intervention A at CNFU + psychosocial stimulation (PS) for the first&#xD;
           3 months (intervention C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All management like intervention A at CNFU + SF + PS for the first 3 months&#xD;
           (intervention D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial three months intervention period, children in all groups will be followed&#xD;
      on fortnightly basis for next three months in their respective follow up unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up rate, nutritional status, mental and psychomotor development, behavior, morbidities&#xD;
      (including intestinal permeability in a sub-sample) of the children, and child rearing&#xD;
      practices, depression and self esteem of mothers will be assessed in different groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By ascertaining the most cost-effective/best management package, and by extending the package&#xD;
      to other systems in the country, it will be possible to rehabilitate a greater number of&#xD;
      severely malnourished children in their communities.&#xD;

      Study Design. A prospective, randomized, intervention trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site. The study will be conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The children will be recruited&#xD;
      on discharge from the Dhaka Hospital of ICDDR,B after treatment of their acute illnesses, and&#xD;
      the follow up visits will be conducted at HNFU or CMFU (will be established) at four PHC or&#xD;
      community clinics of Demra, Gulshan, Sabujbagh and Mirpur thanas of Dhaka city. The rationale&#xD;
      for choosing these four thanas is that higher proportions of children with severe&#xD;
      malnutrition come from these four thanas or nearby areas (unpublished data; Ahmed et al.,&#xD;
      ICDDR,B, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial hospital-based treatment protocol. At ICDDRB, severely malnourished children are&#xD;
      treated in either the general ward or the special care unit of the Dhaka Hospital, according&#xD;
      to a standardized protocol [50], which is similar to that recommended by WHO [5].&#xD;
      Implementation of this protocol has resulted in a 47% reduction in the case-fatality rate&#xD;
      (CFR) among severely malnourished children [51] and according to recent observation there was&#xD;
      further reduction of the case-fatality rate to 68 % (the current CFR is 5.4%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for enrollment. Once the children complete the initial phase of management of any&#xD;
      acute problems associated with severe malnutrition, they will be considered for recruitment,&#xD;
      according to the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age 6 - 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Either sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severely malnourished [weight for age (WA) &lt; -3 Z score]&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Resolution of acute illnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Not planning to leave the current residence within next six months (for the purpose of&#xD;
           follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Informed consent granted from the guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria. Children with any of the following clinical problems or other limitations&#xD;
      will be excluded from study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Persistent anorexia, fever, severe wasting (WH &lt; -3 Z score) or edema&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinically apparent congenital/acquired disorders that may affect growth&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other acute or chronic diseases requiring hospitalization and/or affecting growth&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lack of fixed address (to avoid difficulties in tracing for follow up examinations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Caregiver's condition: children accompanied by caregivers who are not able to give any&#xD;
           time for child care or unable to give stimulation due to any condition e.g. old age,&#xD;
           disease, physical or mental handicap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. Once the children fulfill all the criteria for entry into the study and&#xD;
      written consent to participate is granted by their parents/guardian, the children will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the five treatment packages (control or interventions A, B, C or&#xD;
      D). Four sets of randomization will be done separately (one set each for the children coming&#xD;
      from four thanas- Demra, Gulshan, Sabujbagh and Mirpur or respective nearby thanas) according&#xD;
      to computer-generated random numbers using permuted blocks of block lengths of five and ten.&#xD;
      The assigned treatment packages will be kept in closed opaque envelopes until the same serial&#xD;
      number is assigned to an enrolled child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: On the day of recruitment (i.e., on the day of discharge from the ICDDR,B&#xD;
      hospital after completion of acute phase management) a health worker (HW) will accompany the&#xD;
      child and mother to their home for identification of the home for any future home visits if&#xD;
      required, and next day the HW and a research assistant will go to the home to collect the&#xD;
      data about the quality of stimulation at home. At the beginning of the study, the importance&#xD;
      of bringing the child for clinical/nutritional follow up at the follow up unit (HNFU or CNFU&#xD;
      as assigned) at set intervals (according to assignment) after enrollment will be explained to&#xD;
      the mothers/caregivers. Among all scheduled follow-up visits, two visits i.e. at the end of&#xD;
      third and sixth month will be at HNFU and mothers/caregivers of all groups will be advised to&#xD;
      bring their children to HNFU during these two visits. The specific components of treatment&#xD;
      packages are described in the following sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard therapy: Standard therapy includes growth monitoring, health education, multiple&#xD;
      micronutrient supplementation, and clinical check up. In addition, self-referral will be&#xD;
      encouraged and entertained at any hour and day for intercurrent illnesses; children with&#xD;
      suspected serious illness, (e.g. dehydrating diarrhea, pneumonia, ear or throat infection,&#xD;
      fever, loss of appetite) will be admitted to the hospital, where standard treatment will be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth monitoring and promotion: During each follow up visit, the children's nutritional&#xD;
      status and general condition will be assessed. Anthropometrics will include weight,&#xD;
      length/height, mid-upper arm and head circumference, and the measures will be recorded on a&#xD;
      standardized form. The health workers will discuss child's overall condition, change in&#xD;
      weight and height and diet with respective mothers/caretakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health education of mothers/caregivers: The major components of the process of education are&#xD;
      providing information, showing examples, practicing and checking understanding. During each&#xD;
      follow-up, mothers or caregivers will be given structured lessons (standardized previously)&#xD;
      by health worker on the causes and prevention of malnutrition, the importance of breast&#xD;
      feeding, preparation of nutritious low-cost diets with locally available food items, home&#xD;
      management of diarrhea, recognition of referral sign/symptoms of common illnesses, such as&#xD;
      pneumonia, and when to seek help, use of safe water and hygienic practices, and counseling on&#xD;
      birth spacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micronutrient Supplementation. On recruitment and at each follow up visit during the first&#xD;
      three moths of the study, multivitamin drops, folic acid (in iron tablet) and zinc (standard&#xD;
      practice of ICDDR,B) will be provided for oral administration. Iron will be provided during&#xD;
      weeks 2-12 at a dose of 3 mg of elemental iron/kg/d. Caregivers will be asked to bring back&#xD;
      any leftover micronutrient/medicine at the time of each follow up visit to check the&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other services: Other components of the treatment package that will be offered to children in&#xD;
      all study groups include: immunization according to the Expanded Programme on Immunization&#xD;
      guidelines, deworming of children &gt;1 year of age if such treatment has not been provided in&#xD;
      the last six months, and counseling of parents on birth-spacing and contraceptives, which&#xD;
      will be provided free of cost to the mothers. At the end of six months, if any child still&#xD;
      has a WH &lt; 90% (&lt;-1 Z score), he/she will be invited to continue attending the nutrition&#xD;
      follow up clinic (regular service component) of ICDDR,B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up at the community-based clinics: Available data of 2001 showed that a good&#xD;
      proportion (~ 70%) of under-5 severely malnourished children were coming from four thanas&#xD;
      (Demra, Gulshan, Sabujbagh and Mirpur) or nearby areas of Dhaka city. One CNFU will be&#xD;
      established at each of these thanas within an already functioning PHC or NGO clinic. One&#xD;
      health worker contracted for the study will conduct the CNFUs on specified times and days of&#xD;
      the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provision of supplementary food (SF): Children assigned to treatment groups B and D will&#xD;
      additionally receive the SF packets for first three months of the study as take-home&#xD;
      supplementary food in addition to their usual meals. The SF packets will be distributed on&#xD;
      recruitment i.e. at the time of discharge from the hospital and at each follow up visit from&#xD;
      the CNFU to the respective groups. A sufficient supply of packets will be provided to ensure&#xD;
      1 and 2 packets/day for 6 -11 and 12-24 months old children respectively until the next&#xD;
      planned follow-up, which we consider will be effective based on our previous experience. The&#xD;
      composition of each packet of the SF is (based on supplements commonly available through a&#xD;
      national supplementary feeding program in rural areas): 1) toasted rice powder 20g; 2)&#xD;
      toasted lentil powder 10g; 3) molasses 5g; and 4) soy bean oil 3g, and total energy per&#xD;
      packet is ~ 150 kcal (~ 630 k joules) with 11% energy from protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ingredients will be bought from the local market and prepared in the HNFU-kitchen. The&#xD;
      health workers will measure the appropriate amounts into polythene packets under the guidance&#xD;
      of a research assistant (rice powder and lentil powder in one compartment, and molasses and&#xD;
      soybean oil in two separate compartments of each packet). Previous testing revealed that the&#xD;
      locally packaged supplements are stable for at least two months. Caregivers will be asked to&#xD;
      offer each packet mixed with (not more than) 30 ml (~ 6 teaspoonfuls) of water, and bring&#xD;
      back any leftover food and/or empty packets at the time of each follow up visit to check the&#xD;
      compliance. Under-five siblings of the index children will also receive the SF (according to&#xD;
      their age, as stated above) for the 1st three months (to minimize sharing of SF assigned to&#xD;
      the study subject). Mothers/caregivers of other treatment groups will receive education about&#xD;
      how to prepare the SF at home and be encouraged to give it to their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial stimulation (PS): The intervention program is comprised of child stimulation and&#xD;
      parental counseling, which will be conducted by female health workers trained on how to give&#xD;
      psychosocial stimulation to the children and parental counseling, how to attract the groups&#xD;
      of attending mothers/caregivers, how to interact with the children and attract them to the&#xD;
      play materials, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: At the beginning of the study information will be sought on the families'&#xD;
      wealth, standard of housing, family structure and parental characteristics. At the time of&#xD;
      each follow-up visit the children will be evaluated with regard to physical growth&#xD;
      (anthropometry), morbidity from infections and cognitive development and behavior. The data&#xD;
      collection methods and timing of each assessment are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry: At baseline and each subsequent scheduled follow-up visit the health worker&#xD;
      will record the children's nude weight, using a digital scale (Seca, model-345) with 10g&#xD;
      precision, length using a calibrated length board, and head and mid upper-arm circumference&#xD;
      to the nearest mm (non-stretch insertion tape), and triceps skinfold thickness by Harpenden&#xD;
      calipers to nearest 0.2mm. All anthropometrics will be taken twice; if they vary, a third&#xD;
      measurement will be done, and the average of the nearest two measures will be recorded. The&#xD;
      visits at the end of three and six month will be held at HNFU and the anthropometric&#xD;
      measurement taken there.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity: At each follow-up, the health worker will record child's morbidity since the&#xD;
      previous visit on a pre-coded form. Diarrhea will be defined as the passage of three or more&#xD;
      watery or liquid stools per day. An episode will be considered new if at least two&#xD;
      diarrhea-free days intervene between the current and the previous episodes. Acute lower&#xD;
      respiratory infection/pneumonia will be defined if there is cough + rapid respiratory rate (&gt;&#xD;
      50/min for 6-12 months group and &gt; 40/min for older than 12 months group). Fever will be&#xD;
      noted if the mother thinks that her child's temperature is elevated, and cough will be&#xD;
      registered if reported to result in at least some discomfort to the child. Although the&#xD;
      definitions are somewhat subjective, we are planning to accept these definitions considering&#xD;
      the constraints of the field situation. Children will be admitted to the hospital if they&#xD;
      have any serious illness requiring hospital-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactulose:Mannitol test: The test will be done in a randomly selected sub-sample of 15&#xD;
      children from each of the four intervention groups (A, B, C and D). Four sets of&#xD;
      randomization will be done separately (one set each for the children receiving interventions&#xD;
      A, B, C and D). There will be 100 opaque envelopes with serial number for each intervention&#xD;
      group and indication of Lactulose:Mannitol test be mentioned inside the envelope randomly in&#xD;
      15 out of 100. Incase any mother refuses the immediate next mother in the same group will be&#xD;
      asked for the test. Three ml sugar solutions per kg body weight (each 3 ml containing 400 mg&#xD;
      Lactulose + 100 mg Mannitol + up to 3 ml water) will be ingested in the morning of the day of&#xD;
      enrolment. After 30 minutes, they will be allowed to consume their usual meal and breast&#xD;
      milk. A urine collection bag will be placed just before the children consume the test dose of&#xD;
      sugars, and all urine will be collected for the next 5 hours. Every time the child voides,&#xD;
      the urine volume will be measured and recorded. One drop of 20% (wt/vol) chlorhexidine&#xD;
      gluconate will be added to each sample to prevent bacterial growth, and approximately 3 ml of&#xD;
      the pooled urine sample will be stored at -20OC until analysis. The same procedure will be&#xD;
      done at the end of the 3 months when the children will come to HNFU for their follow-up&#xD;
      visit. Urinary Lactulose and Mannitol (L:M) concentrations will be measured in the Clinical&#xD;
      Biochemistry Lab of ICDDR,B using an automated enzyme assay [55, 56]. For the sake of&#xD;
      comparison we will also collect L:M data from 20 non-malnourished children (one time) in the&#xD;
      same community.&#xD;
