      During patients' stay in the hospital, some of the patients may require artificial feeding&#xD;
      for various reasons either through a vein or through a tube going directly to the gut.&#xD;
      However, the amount of feeding that can be considered 'adequate' is unclear due to lack of&#xD;
      research data. The current evidence the investigators have suggests that doctors might be&#xD;
      giving patients more than they require, which might carry some risks. This hasn't been proven&#xD;
      until now and there is no evidence as yet to show investigators exactly how much the doctors&#xD;
      should feed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to see whether feeding patients less than what they are currently&#xD;
      been feed is associated with better outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomly (like tossing a coin) allocated into 2 groups. One group will&#xD;
      get 100% of the current amount; the second group will get 60%. The investigators will then&#xD;
      compare the groups to decide if feeding patients less than the current practice is associated&#xD;
      with better outcomes.&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to assess whether hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving&#xD;
      artificial nutritional support is associated with reduced septic and non septic morbidity&#xD;
      compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support. Secondary end points will include the assessment&#xD;
      of metabolic, physiological and clinical responses to the different feeding protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENTERAL FEEDING OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving enteral&#xD;
           artificial nutritional support is associated with reduced septic and non septic&#xD;
           morbidity compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving enteral&#xD;
           artificial nutritional support is associated with changes in the inflammatory response&#xD;
           compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving enteral&#xD;
           artificial nutritional support is associated with changes in metabolic response compared&#xD;
           to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving enteral&#xD;
           artificial nutritional support is associated with changes in nutrition status compared&#xD;
           to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving enteral&#xD;
           artificial nutritional support is associated with differences in systemic complications&#xD;
           compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To undertake a cost benefit analysis in patients receiving enteral artificial&#xD;
           nutritional support, with the assumption that patients receiving hypocaloric feeding&#xD;
           will not necessarily manifest lower feeding costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARENTERAL FEEDING OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving parenteral&#xD;
           artificial nutritional support is associated with reduced septic and non septic&#xD;
           morbidity compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving parenteral&#xD;
           artificial nutritional support is associated with changes in the inflammatory response&#xD;
           compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving parenteral&#xD;
           artificial nutritional support is associated with changes in metabolic response compared&#xD;
           to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving parenteral&#xD;
           artificial nutritional support is associated with changes in nutrition status compared&#xD;
           to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving parenteral&#xD;
           artificial nutritional support is associated with differences in systemic complications&#xD;
           compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To undertake a cost benefit analysis in patients receiving parenteral artificial&#xD;
           nutritional support, with the assumption that patients receiving hypocaloric feeding&#xD;
           will not necessarily manifest lower feeding costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Study Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. All patients requiring&#xD;
      adjuvant nutritional support will be included in this study. The need for nutritional support&#xD;
      and the method of administration (enteral or parenteral) will be decided by the hospital's&#xD;
      nutrition team as is present practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, patients requiring supplemental nutrition fall into two clinical groups. Those&#xD;
      with a functional gut are fed enterally; the other group, whose gut, for whatever reason, is&#xD;
      not functional are fed parenterally. This is the rationale of studying two groups of&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please see Flowchart for exact details. Patients will enter into the parenteral or the&#xD;
      enteral component of the stud y in a mutually exclusive manner with no crossover or&#xD;
      randomisation occurring at this point. Thereafter, patients in either arm of the study&#xD;
      (enteral or parenteral) will be randomised to one of two groups. Comparisons will be done&#xD;
      within, but not across, each of the enteral and parenteral arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteral feeding details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteral control group: patients will receive energy and protein intakes as recommended by the&#xD;
      use of Schofield equations (TER=total energy requirements), as is current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteral intervention group: patients will be prescribed 60% of recommended (by Schofield)&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenteral feeding details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenteral control group : the control group, will receive energy and protein intakes as&#xD;
      recommended by the use of Schofield equations, as is current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenteral intervention group: patients will be prescribed 60% of recommended (by Schofield)&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be on an &quot;intention to treat&quot; basis. Enteral and parenteral study arms&#xD;
      will be analysed separately.&#xD;
