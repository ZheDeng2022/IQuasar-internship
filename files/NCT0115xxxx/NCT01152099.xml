      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To know the utility of manual lymph drainage (MLD) as part of the Physical Complex Therapy&#xD;
      has turn out relevant because of the exclusive dedication that it supposes to the therapist.&#xD;
      To date, the evidence-base for MLD is very limited and only two studies analyze its&#xD;
      relevance. The first study measured the effect of compression bandage with or without MLD.&#xD;
      The group receiving compression and MLD had a significant reduction in limb volume and&#xD;
      decreased pain, despite the fact the MLD was given only for one week (Johansson et al.,&#xD;
      1999). A further study investigated the effect of eight sessions of MLD over two weeks in 42&#xD;
      women with breast cancer-related lymphoedema, and the findings suggested that MLD do not&#xD;
      contribute significantly to oedema reduction, although the MLD course was relatively short&#xD;
      and the study group was limited to those with mild to moderate swelling (20-30 % of&#xD;
      difference). Information about the quality of life, using the questionnaire EORT QLQ-C30 was&#xD;
      gathered but the results were not considered in the final assessment (Andersen and Cabbage&#xD;
      2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar studies would provide comparative and enlightening information with regard to the&#xD;
      previous results. The investigators could determine if the MLD, in spite of not obtaining an&#xD;
      improvement in the volume of the lymphoedema, provides a benefit in the reduction of the&#xD;
      symptoms related to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that MLD does not contribute significantly in volume limb&#xD;
      reduction but it provides a clinical improvement regarding the quality of life according to&#xD;
      the questionnaire EORT QLQ-C30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the calculation of the sample size the investigators depart from the following&#xD;
      assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the standard treatment on the control group control will produce an average&#xD;
      volume limb reduction of 5 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the treatment in the experimental group will be an average of the 25 % (a minor&#xD;
      difference of effects would indicate a discreet effect of the tested treatment). The&#xD;
      investigators also assume that, the standard deviation will be similar in both groups and&#xD;
      near to 25 %. With this information and for an alpha risk of 0.05 and a power of 0.80 the&#xD;
      calculation of the sample size is 20 patients in every group. Considering a rate of&#xD;
      withdrawal of 30 % in every group, the appropriate sample size is 58 patients assigned in two&#xD;
      groups of 29 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the effectiveness of Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) in the treatment of&#xD;
      postmastectomy lymphoedema in order to reduce the volume of lymphoedema&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the duration of the reduction of the lymphoedema in the time. To analyze the&#xD;
      improvement in the concomitant symptomatology of the lymphoedema using the results of two&#xD;
      quality of life tests validated in Spanish: EORTC QLQ-C30 version 2.0, for the cancer in&#xD;
      general and EORTC QLQ-BR23 specifically for the breast cancer. In particular, the items&#xD;
      refering to the upper extremity (47, 48, 49) and to the corporal image (39, 40, 41, 42) and&#xD;
      in which the higher the score the worse the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researching Project with methodology of randomized, controlled clinical trial. Group A or&#xD;
      Control: patients with standard treatment (care the skin, exercise and measures of&#xD;
      compression -bandage for one month and later a sleeve of compression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B or Experimental: patients with standard treatment (care of the skin, exercise and&#xD;
      measures of compression (bandage for one month and later a sleeve for lymphoedema) and in&#xD;
      addition they receive Manual Lymph Drainage Main variable: Volume reduction of the affected&#xD;
      arm after the treatment expressed in percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: 58 women.&#xD;

    <description>All the patients included in the study will be analyzed and all the analyses will be performed for &quot; intention of treating &quot; except that related to the withdrawal of the treatment that will be done by protocol.&#xD;
Firstly an analysis of comparability of the groups using the test of the T de Student or Mann-Withney's Test and test of Fischer´s exact test will be performed. Efficacy analysis:means differences and / or reason of medians for the quantitative variables and reason of risks and NNT for the quantitative variables.</description>

The tailor-made sleeve for lymphedema with gauntlet without protection at the edges and with extension to the shoulder is placed from the first four weeks of treatment.
