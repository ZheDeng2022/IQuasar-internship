    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is: 1) To assess the feasibility of implementing a clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing two potentially analgesic dietary interventions in patients with chronic daily&#xD;
      headache (CDH) and 2)To assess the preliminary efficacy of the dietary interventions on&#xD;
      headache frequency and severity and 3) to assess the impact of the diet on the percentage of&#xD;
      omega-6 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in total HUFA in whole blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a 6-week baseline phase, eligible individuals with CDH will complete web-based daily&#xD;
      diaries, self-report questionnaires, and nutrient intake assessments. Before randomization to&#xD;
      one of the two intervention groups, blood will be collected to measure baseline nutritional&#xD;
      biomarkers. Targeted dietary advice will be administered and foods will be provided&#xD;
      throughout the 12-week intervention phase. Samples for biomarkers will be collected every 4&#xD;
      weeks during the intervention. Participants will continue recording headache characteristics&#xD;
      with a daily headache diary. At the conclusion of the intervention, participants will provide&#xD;
      complete follow-up assessments and blood for nutritional biomarker measurement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CDH is characterized by structural and functional immune and nervous system derangements.&#xD;
      Specifically, disturbed regulation of the following critically important biochemical&#xD;
      processes has been demonstrated: 1) inflammation; 2) neuronal membrane excitability; and 3)&#xD;
      monoamine neurotransmitter signaling. Accordingly, major classes of medications used for&#xD;
      chronic pain (anti-inflammatories, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants) target these&#xD;
      processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foods consist of combinations of nutrient molecules that are incorporated into human tissues,&#xD;
      and enter into and regulate highly leveraged human biochemical pathways. By altering the&#xD;
      structure and function of the nervous system and immune system, and regulating biochemical&#xD;
      processes believed to play causal roles in the development and maintenance of chronic pain,&#xD;
      dietary choices may play a critical role in the initiation and/or perpetuation of CDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multifaceted, targeted dietary manipulation, directed towards correcting underlying&#xD;
      biochemical derangements, represents a novel therapeutic approach to the management of&#xD;
      chronic pain. Improved understanding of the relationships between dietary selections and&#xD;
      chronic pain promises to benefit the estimated 10 million Americans with CDH and possibly an&#xD;
      even larger population with chronic pain from any origin. For a more detailed description,&#xD;
      please refer to the complete rationale and literature review accompanying grant application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major research questions for this proposal include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Is it possible to implement a controlled dietary trial comparing two analgesic dietary&#xD;
      interventions for subject with CDH? and B. What are the preliminary estimates of impact of&#xD;
      targeted analgesic dietary interventions on headache frequency compared with one another and&#xD;
      the baseline headache frequency in patients for CDH? C. What is the rate and extent of change&#xD;
      in %n6 in HUFA with two targeted interventions? There is also an exploratory portion of the&#xD;
      study to gather more information about the potential relationship between nutrient and pain&#xD;
      to inform intended future trials. The study is needed to assess the potential utility of a&#xD;
      dietary approach for chronic pain, which may have major public health implications.&#xD;
