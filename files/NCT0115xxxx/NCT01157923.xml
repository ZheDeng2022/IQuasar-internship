      Prospective, randomized, controlled, 30-78 days trial comparing MD-Logic pump algorithm to&#xD;
      the standard of care of patients with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this feasibility study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of automated&#xD;
      determined Insulin pump settings (i.e., basal plan, correction factor, carbohydrate ration&#xD;
      and insulin activity time) using the MD-Logic Pump Advisor in individuals with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes.The study will be consisted from two segments:(I)pilot study, 30-78 days trial&#xD;
      evaluating the MD-Logic pump advisor and (II)randomized controlled 30-78 days trial comparing&#xD;
      MD-Logic pump algorithm to the standard of care.In segment 1, the pilot study, the aim is to&#xD;
      enroll 15-30 subjects without control group. In segment 2, the randomized controlled segment,&#xD;
      the aim is to enroll 92 subjects, but enrolling up to 105 eligible subjects to allow for&#xD;
      dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized controled study segment will be initiated after the pilot segment.Each segment&#xD;
      of the study will consist of 6 clinic visits taking place at intervals of 1-3 weeks, sum of&#xD;
      30-78 days study duration for each segment. Before each clinic visit, subjects will wear&#xD;
      continuous glucose sensors for 6 days; the intervention group will have up to 4 iterations&#xD;
      (e.g the pump setting will be reviewed and adjusted up to 4 times during the study period&#xD;
      according to the MD-Logic Pump Advisor).For the control group (at segment 2 only), insulin&#xD;
      pump settings will not be changed during the study period (patient's usual standard of care).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      the MD-Logic Pump Advisor was design by the Diabetes Technology Center, the Institute of&#xD;
      Endocrinology and Diabetes, National Center for Childhood Diabetes, Schneider Children's&#xD;
      Medical Center of Israel. The MD-Logic Pump Advisor learns and adapts the patient's insulin&#xD;
      pump settings in order to optimize glucose control. The MD-Logic Pump Advisor needs, as&#xD;
      input, sensor readings, insulin delivery and recording of the meals during home care. During&#xD;
      collection of the data, the patients are asked to continue their daily routine (no need for&#xD;
      special consideration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was designed to test the automatic algorithm that will evaluate and change,&#xD;
      when necessary, the patient's insulin pump settings based on prior sensor reading, insulin&#xD;
      delivery, and meals data that was collected while the patient is under his regular treatment&#xD;
      at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this feasibility study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of automated&#xD;
      determined Insulin pump settings (i.e., basal plan, correction factor, carbohydrate ration&#xD;
      and insulin activity time) using the MD-Logic Pump Advisor in individuals with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be consisted from two segments:(I)pilot study, 30-78 days trial evaluating the&#xD;
      MD-Logic pump advisor and (II)randomized controlled 30-78 days trial comparing MD-Logic pump&#xD;
      algorithm to the standard of care.In segment 1, the pilot study, the aim is to enroll 15-30&#xD;
      subjects without control group. In segment 2, the randomized controlled segment, the aim is&#xD;
      to enroll 92 subjects, but enrolling up to 105 eligible subjects to allow for dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized controled study segment will be initiated after the pilot segment.Each segment&#xD;
      of the study will consist of 6 clinic visits taking place at intervals of 1-3 weeks, sum of&#xD;
      30-78 days study duration for each segment. Before each clinic visit, subjects will wear&#xD;
      continuous glucose sensors for 6 days; the intervention group will have up to 4 iterations&#xD;
