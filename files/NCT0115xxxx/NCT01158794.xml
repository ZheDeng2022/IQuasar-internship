  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron overload, which can be defined operationally as too much iron in the body, develops as a&#xD;
      consequence of too many blood transfusions given, or due to genetic defects hereditary&#xD;
      hemochromatosis). Iron accumulates in several organs in the body, such as the heart, liver,&#xD;
      endocrine glands (pancreas, thyroid, etc.), and spleen. Excessive iron can damage organs and&#xD;
      may even cause death. Iron overload needs to be appropriately monitored and treated to avoid&#xD;
      unnecessary morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study, GENIOS, proposes to test prospectively the hypothesis that genetic&#xD;
      modifiers influence the iron overload status of patients receiving transfusions. To test this&#xD;
      hypothesis, the study will perform genetic studies to investigate possible genetic influences&#xD;
      for iron accumulation in the body and will study iron accumulation not only in the liver, but&#xD;
      also in the heart, pancreas, kidneys, and spleen. In addition: the study will investigate if&#xD;
      these same genes have any role during treatment of iron overload, in other words, if certain&#xD;
      genetic mutations will influence how iron exits the body. This study will also investigate&#xD;
      how substances that are known to control the trafficking of iron in and out of the body and&#xD;
      its damaging effects to the tissues (hepcidin and non transferrin-bound iron) are linked to&#xD;
      the accumulation of iron in the heart and liver. Iron in the body will be measured by R2*MRI&#xD;
      and no liver biopsies will be required. Genetic studies will be done by specialized tests&#xD;
      using peripheral blood DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron accumulates differently in different people and in different organs of the body. Some&#xD;
      people accumulate iron faster than others, even when receiving the same number of blood&#xD;
      transfusions&#xD;

      This study will focus on the following primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the association of GSTM1 gene deletion and liver iron concentration in&#xD;
           patients with sickle cell disease and transfusional iron-overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the role of other iron metabolism-associated candidate genes on liver iron&#xD;
           concentration of sickle cell patients with transfusional iron-overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the role of GSTM1 genotypes and other iron metabolism-associated candidate&#xD;
           genes on maintenance and decline of liver iron concentration of patients with sickle&#xD;
           cell disease and transfusional iron-overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the role of GSTM1 genotypes and other iron metabolism-associated candidate&#xD;
           genes on increase, maintenance, and decline of iron concentration in the heart,&#xD;
           pancreas, kidneys, and spleen of patients with sickle cell disease and transfusional&#xD;
           iron overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the role of GSTM1 gene deletion and other iron metabolism-associated&#xD;
           candidate genes on increase, maintenance, and decline of iron concentration in the&#xD;
           liver, heart, pancreas, kidneys, and spleen of non-sickle cell patients with&#xD;
           transfusional iron-overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the relationship between Non-Transferrin Bound Iron (NTBI), hepcidin, organ&#xD;
           function, and iron increase, maintenance, and decline in the liver, heart, pancreas,&#xD;
           kidneys, and spleen of patients with transfusional iron overload.&#xD;

      The total volume of blood transfused (in ml/kg) will be collected and stored in the study&#xD;
      database. Cumulative transfused blood volume (in ml/kg) will be captured. Serum samples will&#xD;
      be stored frozen at -20Â°C until the time of analysis. In addition to the protocol-specific&#xD;
      testing of specimens, study participants will be offered the option of allowing any leftover&#xD;
      purified DNA, serum, or blood cells to be saved or shared for future analyses. Leftover&#xD;
      purified genomic DNA, serum, and blood cells from subjects enrolled in the GENIOS protocol&#xD;
      will be de-identified prior to storage or any future testing and/or sharing.&#xD;

        Study participants will be patients who receive medical care at St. Jude Children's&#xD;
        Research Hospital and have developed iron overload secondary to multiple transfusions.&#xD;
        Patients will be approached during regular outpatient visits and will be invited to&#xD;
        participate in this study if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent to&#xD;
        participate in the study. Non-sickle cell patients with transfusional iron overload&#xD;
        includes patients with thalassemia, bone marrow failure syndromes, and patients who have&#xD;
        received multiple blood transfusions due to marrow aplasia secondary to the use of&#xD;
        chemotherapeutic agents. About 40 participants with sickle cell disease are targeted. About&#xD;
        10 participants with non-sickle cell disease are targeted.&#xD;
