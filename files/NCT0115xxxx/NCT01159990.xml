  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV vaccines are designed to create an immune response to certain components of the HIV virus&#xD;
      called peptides. Previous research indicates that one peptide, called Gag, may be&#xD;
      particularly important for stimulating an immune response to HIV. Many vaccines being studied&#xD;
      combine multiple peptides, but including other peptides may weaken the body's response to&#xD;
      Gag. This study will test whether a vaccine that targets Gag and another peptide called Env&#xD;
      is better than a vaccine without Env at causing an immune response to Gag.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      HIV vaccines are designed to create an immune response to certain parts of the HIV virus&#xD;
      called peptides. Researchers believe that eliciting a response to a peptide called Gag is&#xD;
      particularly important. Most HIV vaccines in current clinical trials combine multiple&#xD;
      peptides, but including these other peptides may cause antigenic competition. Antigenic&#xD;
      competition occurs when the body's immune system reaction to one part of a vaccine weakens or&#xD;
      inhibits the response to another part of the vaccine. Specifically, this study is concerned&#xD;
      that having too many other peptides in a vaccine might weaken the specific immune response to&#xD;
      Gag. This study will test whether a vaccine which only includes the peptides Gag and Pol&#xD;
      elicits a stronger immune response to Gag and Pol than a vaccine that also includes the&#xD;
      peptides Env A, B, and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 6 months. The number of study visits will vary by study&#xD;
      site. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive injections of one of two vaccines in&#xD;
      their upper arm. One group of participants will receive rAd5 gag/pol, which contains only the&#xD;
      Gag and Pol peptides, while the other group of participants will receive rAd5 gag/pol Env&#xD;
      A/B/C, which contains the Gag, Pol, and Env A, B, and C peptides. For 3 days after injection,&#xD;
      participants will need to record their temperature and any side effects, and they will be&#xD;
      contacted by study staff 7 days after the injection for follow-up monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During study visits, participants will complete the following assessments: an HIV test; a&#xD;
      physical exam; collection of blood samples; a pregnancy test; and an interview about health,&#xD;
      medications, HIV risk behaviors, and experiences with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by study staff once a year for 5 years after the vaccination&#xD;
      for follow-up health and safety monitoring.&#xD;
