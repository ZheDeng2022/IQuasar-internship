  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of RO4929097 when&#xD;
      given together with capecitabine in treating patients with refractory solid tumors. RO4929097&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving RO4929097 together with&#xD;
      chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and&#xD;
      15-17 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may undergo tumor biopsy before and after treatment for biomarker analysis and blood&#xD;
      sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days (Part 1) or every 3&#xD;
      months (Parts 2a and 2b).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Women who have had tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients may be considered NOT to be of childbearing potential for the&#xD;
             following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral&#xD;
                  salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient is medically confirmed to be menopausal (no menstrual period) for 24&#xD;
                  consecutive months&#xD;

                  not yet started menstruation should verify that menstruation has not begun. If a&#xD;
                  young female patient reaches menarche during the study, then she is to be&#xD;
                  considered as a woman of childbearing potential from that time forward&#xD;

          -  Preclinical studies indicate that RO4929097 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and inducer of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 enzyme activity; caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097 concurrently&#xD;
             with CYP3A4 substrates, inducers, and/or inhibitors; furthermore, patients who are&#xD;
             taking concurrent medications that are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications to minimize any potential risk;&#xD;

             stains as 0 or 1+ for HER2 by immunohistochemistry (IHC); if the IHC for HER2 is 2+,&#xD;
             fluorescence in-site hybridization (FISH) ratio must be less than 2 to be considered&#xD;
             NOT amplified; any tumor for which only FISH was performed must have a ratio of less&#xD;
             than 2 to be considered NOT amplified&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All 5 patients in this breast cancer cohort must be willing and able to have tumor&#xD;
