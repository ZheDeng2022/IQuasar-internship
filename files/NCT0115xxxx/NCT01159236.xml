      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using &quot;gene signatures&quot; can be an&#xD;
      effective way to decide the best treatment for breast cancer patients. Gene signatures may be&#xD;
      able to help researchers predict who will respond to chemotherapy given before surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At this time, treatment of stage I-III breast cancer for patients who are at high risk for&#xD;
      the cancer returning is surgery and chemotherapy. If the cancer is positive for estrogen&#xD;
      hormone receptor, patients also have endocrine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common standard chemotherapy treatment regimens for breast cancer at M. D. Anderson&#xD;
      are paclitaxel (T), followed by treatments with fluorouracil (F), doxorubicin (A) or&#xD;
      epirubicin (E), and cyclophosphamide (C). These chemotherapy combinations are known as T/FAC&#xD;
      and T/FEC. However, not all patients respond to these treatments, so researchers at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson have developed tests to predict how much a person's breast cancer might respond to&#xD;
      T/FAC or T/FEC chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the tumor are collected after numbing the skin of the breast&#xD;
      with local anesthesia, and the genes within the FNA sample are measured to calculate the&#xD;
      results of treatment prediction tests before treatment is selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the gene-based tests will help to select treatment based on the&#xD;
      predictions of response to chemotherapy, and to then measure the tumor response from the&#xD;
      surgery after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T/FAC and T/FEC are designed to damage the DNA (genetic material of cells), which may cause&#xD;
      cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients necessary&#xD;
      for tumor growth. This may prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells and make them more&#xD;
      susceptible to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor Biopsies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will have 3-4 fine needle biopsies&#xD;
      of the tumor collected. The skin over the tumor and the breast tissues surrounding the tumor&#xD;
      will be numbed using local anesthesia. To perform fine needle aspiration biopsies, tumor&#xD;
      cells are withdrawn from the tumor using a very thin needle alone, or using a syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These biopsies will be used to measure different genes and to predict how the cancer may&#xD;
      respond to different treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the information from these gene measurements, a computer model will predict if the&#xD;
      cancer is highly sensitive to chemotherapy and is likely to shrink to a great extent or&#xD;
      disappear completely due to chemotherapy. This response prediction is done separately for&#xD;
      estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the biopsies show that the cancer may respond well to standard T/FAC or T/FEC&#xD;
      chemotherapy, you will receive the chemotherapy before surgery (Group 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the biopsies show that the cancer may not respond as well to standard T/FAC or T/FEC&#xD;
      chemotherapy, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of dice) to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive T/FAC or T/FEC chemotherapy before surgery. One&#xD;
           (1) out of 3 participants whose cancer may not respond as well will be assigned to this&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 3, you will receive T/FAC or T/FEC chemotherapy combined with&#xD;
           bevacizumab before surgery. Two (2) out of 3 participants whose cancer may not respond&#xD;
           as well will be assigned to this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your doctor will decide if you receive T/FAC or T/FEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week during Weeks 1-12, you will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once every 3 weeks during Weeks 13-24, you will receive T/FAC or T/FEC by vein over about 3-4&#xD;
      hours. This chemotherapy treatment is considered routine standard of care and you may receive&#xD;
      this treatment closer to home outside of M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all chemotherapy, you will have surgery at M. D. Anderson to remove the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week during Weeks 1-12, you will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once every 2 weeks during Weeks 1-18, you will receive bevacizumab by vein once over about&#xD;
      1-2 hours. If your doctor thinks is it necessary, and based on heart related test results,&#xD;
      you may only receive bevacizumab during Weeks 1-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once every 3 weeks during Weeks 13-24, you will receive T/FAC or T/FEC by vein over about 4&#xD;
      hours. You must receive your chemotherapy at M. D. Anderson if you are in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all chemotherapy, you will have surgery at M. D. Anderson to remove the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have routine visits at M. D. Anderson at least once every 12 weeks&#xD;
      during chemotherapy. Your doctor will determine the tests and procedures to be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 3, you will also have the following additional procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a urine analysis within 1 month after starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an echocardiogram to check your heart's health within 3 months after you&#xD;
           begin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive chemotherapy for up to 6 months. Once surgery is performed, your&#xD;
      participation in this study is complete. Your doctor will decide together with you what&#xD;
      further treatment you will need after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The biopsy and testing to predict response to chemotherapy&#xD;
      is not FDA approved or commercially available. Its use in this study is investigational. The&#xD;
      chemotherapy and surgery are standard of care for patients with breast cancer. The addition&#xD;
      of bevacizumab to treatment is also investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 303 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
