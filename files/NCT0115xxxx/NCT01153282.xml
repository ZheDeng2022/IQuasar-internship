      Taxanes, a type of chemotherapeutic agent prescribed to breast cancer patients, have a known&#xD;
      physical side effect of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). The purpose of&#xD;
      this qualitative study is to understand the experience and physical functional side effects&#xD;
      of taxanes. This is the first of a two phase study. The overall goal is to identify existing&#xD;
      objective physical performance measures to assess functional side effects of taxanes.&#xD;

        The semi-structured interviews will be conducted with breast cancer patients of the Rena&#xD;
        Rowan Breast Center of the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. A&#xD;
        purposive sampling strategy in which study participants are recruited based on a particular&#xD;
        characteristic of experience of interest, will be used to select breast cancer patients&#xD;
        (N=30). Participants will be recruitedwith the goal of having a balanced sample of women&#xD;
        who experience documented CIPN (per Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE -&#xD;
        grading criteria, details below) and those who received a taxane but did not have&#xD;
        documented CIPN.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women 21-70 years old (Women over 70 are offered chemotherapy less frequently because&#xD;
             of their risk benefit ratio. Including them would be a selection bias because of their&#xD;
             differential underexposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initiated taxane-based chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or previously&#xD;
             untreated metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The range of exposure to taxane-based chemotherapy will include women on active&#xD;
             treatment having received two cycles, to women who are within three months of their&#xD;
             last infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented symptoms of CIPN per CTCAE grading criteria (half of sample) or NO symptoms&#xD;
             (half of sample) Grade 0 = no CIPN symptoms Grade 1 = mild symptoms Grade 2 = moderate&#xD;
             symptoms - prescribed Gabapentin (Neurontin) Grade 3&amp;4= severe symptoms - treated with&#xD;
             Gabapentin (Neurontin), treatment plan altered&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical disabilities - defined by use of assistive devices to complete functional&#xD;
             tasks (wheelchair, crutches, prosthetic limbs) prior to starting chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current exposure to neurotoxic agents (Navelbine, platinums or other taxanes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy during chemotherapy treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes - diagnosed 3 or more years , or insulin dependent, or with clinically&#xD;
             established neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive (high risk for neuropathy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other neurological diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other pre-existing neuropathy&#xD;
