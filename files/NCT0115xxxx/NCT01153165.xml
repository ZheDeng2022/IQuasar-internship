      Purpose and design: The relationship between psychological morbidity and asthma has been&#xD;
      previously recognised, however there is little evidence regarding the link between poor&#xD;
      mental health and asthma control in people with severe asthma. If evidence was available&#xD;
      showing that identifying and treating depression, resulted in meaningful improvements in&#xD;
      people's asthma symptoms, this would be helpful in changing doctors' approach to people with&#xD;
      severe asthma, ensuring that both physical and mental wellbeing were considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a double blind randomised placebo controlled pilot study which aims to&#xD;
      identify; if treating depression in patients with well characterised refractory asthma&#xD;
      improves depression and asthma control. Forty patients who meet the inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be randomised to either a placebo or anti-depressant medication group, neither the&#xD;
      participant nor the researcher will be aware of which medication they are given. Patients&#xD;
      recruited will have severe asthma; will be identified as having depression using two&#xD;
      validated questionnaires and will agree to take part and to take anti-depressant medication.&#xD;
      Patients with poor adherence to medication, other respiratory conditions and who have had&#xD;
      anti-depressant medication in previous the 6 months will be excluded. Outcome measures such&#xD;
      as depression questionnaires, quality of life questionnaire, lung function, measures of&#xD;
      airways inflammation and reduction in dose of oral steroids will be used to determine the&#xD;
      effect of anti-depressant medication on depression and asthma control. The treatment period&#xD;
      will be 12 weeks with outcomes assessed in the first and final week of treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to find out if the study protocol we have devised is feasible for a larger&#xD;
      multi-Centre clinical trial and demonstrate some evidence that treating depression in&#xD;
      subjects with well characterised refractory asthma will improve depression and asthma symptom&#xD;
      control (this will be used to estimate the size of a larger clinical trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Participants will be identified and approached by a member of their usual&#xD;
      healthcare team and invited to participate. Participants will be given time to consider&#xD;
      whether they wish to take part and will assured that their care will be unaffected should&#xD;
      they choose not to participate or to withdraw during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion: All patients will be assessed using our well established systematic&#xD;
      evaluation protocol. Refractory asthma will be based on the definition of the American&#xD;
      Thoracic Society Consensus Workshop. Patients recruited will have refractory asthma, will be&#xD;
      identified as having depression using two validated questionnaires and will agree to take&#xD;
      part and to take anti-depressant medication. Patients with poor adherence to medication,&#xD;
      other respiratory conditions and who have had anti-depressant medication in previous the 6&#xD;
      months will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent: People who are unable to give informed consent will be excluded from the study as&#xD;
      they may be particularly vulnerable. Capacity to give informed consent will be assessed by&#xD;
      the participant's usual healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, burdens and benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a small risk of agitation and suicidal ideation associated with commencement of&#xD;
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (SSRI) anti-depressants. The investigators will&#xD;
      attempt to minimise this risk by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Contacting participants 1 week after commencing treatment and 1 week after any&#xD;
           subsequent dose increase to ensure there is no suggestion of agitation or suicidal&#xD;
           ideation. This is in accordance with the guidelines for initiation of SSRI therapy in&#xD;
           adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will also be contacted weekly for 2 weeks after discontinuation of study&#xD;
           treatment. If depressive symptoms worsen patients will be advised to liaise with their&#xD;
           GP to consider institution of treatment on clinical grounds.&#xD;
