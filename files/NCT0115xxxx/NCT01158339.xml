  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unspecific low back pain (LBP) is a major world wide health problem. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to improve the care of LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) with physical intervention during&#xD;
      group sessions focusing on fear and avoidance behaviour will be more effective than physical&#xD;
      therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two arms. Both will receive education related to LBP and appropriate advice&#xD;
      regarding how to react and behave towards their LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main focus in the intervention group will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying their fear of movements and perform the frightened movements during the&#xD;
           group sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reassuring that gradually normalizing daily activities will not be harmful but rather&#xD;
           reduce their pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive-behavioural treatment is the treatment of choice in the treatment of most patients&#xD;
      with chronic LBP. Several randomized controlled trials and recent meta-analysis have&#xD;
      demonstrated the potent effects of CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fear and avoidance model developed by Vlaeyen and Linton has been recommended to be&#xD;
      applied in the treatment of patients with chronic low back pain. No randomized controlled&#xD;
      study has been published comparing the use of a fear and avoidance treatment with a&#xD;
      comparison treatment. Such a study is highly warranted to examine if the model actually has a&#xD;
      superior effect compared to other CBT-based treatments. In addition, it is of vital&#xD;
      importance to examine whether all patients profit better from such a treatment or whether it&#xD;
      only will demonstrate superior effect in a subgroup of patients with chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROBLEMS OF INTEREST:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main aims are to improve the treatment of patients with chronic LBP by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1) Testing the effect of a treatment assumed by the international scientific community&#xD;
           to be the treatment of choice;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2) To develop a diagnostic screening procedure that at an initial examination can&#xD;
           differentiate patients that need special treatment attention in the form of exposure&#xD;
           towards feared movements from those who can benefit sufficiently from just receiving&#xD;
           appropriate advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3) To identify the mechanism of change in the treatment of LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from general practitioners in the county of Nord-Trøndelag and&#xD;
      from our department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is clinical prospective and randomized. Each session will be videotaped. Two&#xD;
      independent raters will rate three random sessions from both the intervention and&#xD;
      non-intervention groups. Treatment differentiability will be measured by assessing the amount&#xD;
      of time (minutes) spent exposing the patients to various movements in the session (ISE).&#xD;
      According to the manuals, amount of ISE in CBGT (cognitive Behavioural Group Therapy) should&#xD;
      be zero and between ten to twenty minutes in the CBGT-ISE (cognitive Behavioural Group&#xD;
      Therapy- In Session Exposure) condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in both groups the therapists conducting the treatments are instructed to&#xD;
      measure amount of time devoted to ISE in each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapist will rate every session. Three out of six sessions will also be timed and rated&#xD;
      by two independent raters. The consistency of the time measured by the therapist and the&#xD;
      independent raters will be compared in order to assure correctness of reported time spent in&#xD;
      session. The raters will also asses the quality of the sessions. If the ratings are&#xD;
      consistent across therapists and independent raters, a total ISE score for each treatment&#xD;
      group will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE TWO ARMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: CBGT Patients will be given a manualised group treatment based on a fear and avoidance&#xD;
      model. A main focus will be identifying fear of movements. The patients will in a spoken&#xD;
      manner be reassured that they gradually can begin to perform normal daily activities and&#xD;
      perform movements in a normal manner without using various forms of safety behaviours.&#xD;
      Dysfunctional thinking patterns will be identified and challenged. Ten to twenty minutes of&#xD;
      each session will be devoted to reassuring patients that various forms of feared movements&#xD;
      can be performed in a graded fashion based on a feared hierarchy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: CBGT-ISE Patients will be given a manualised group treatment based on a fear and&#xD;
      avoidance model. A main focus will be identifying fear of movements. The patients will in a&#xD;
      spoken manner be reassured that they gradually can begin to perform normal daily activities&#xD;
      and perform movements in a normal manner without using various forms of safety behaviours.&#xD;
      Dysfunctional thinking patterns will be identified and challenged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten to twenty minutes of each session will be devoted to actually exposing the patients to&#xD;
      various feared movements and performing these in a graded fashion based on a fear hierarchy.&#xD;
