      -  According to Martin F et al, AKT is highly phosphorylated in phenochromocytoma but not&#xD;
           in benign adrenocortical tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In nonfunctioning carcinoid, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is activated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although mTOR is clearly an attractive therapeutic target in tumor, no clinical study on&#xD;
           mTOR inhibition by RAD001 have been conducted in pheochromocytoma or extra-adrenal&#xD;
           paraganglioma or non-functioning carcinoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  So we design this phase II study of RAD001 in pheochromocytoma or extra-adrenal&#xD;
           paraganglioma or non-functioning carcinoid to evaluate the efficacy of RAD001 in this&#xD;
           orphan disease.&#xD;

      Although several therapeutic options exist for patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma, all&#xD;
      options are limited and there is no cure. Reduction of tumor size palliates symptoms, but a&#xD;
      survival advantage of debulking is unproven. A reduced tumor burden can facilitate subsequent&#xD;
      radiotherapy or chemotherapy. External-beam irradiation of bone metastases and radio&#xD;
      frequency ablation of lesions are treatment alternatives. Chemotherapy with a combination of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, vincristin, and dacarbazine can provide tumor regression and symptom relief&#xD;
      in up to 50% of patients, but the responses are usually short-lived. To date, 131I-labeled&#xD;
      MIBG therapy is the single most valuable adjunct to surgical treatment of malignant&#xD;
      pheochromocytomas. As a single agent, 131I-labeled MIBG has a limited efficacy of cure, and&#xD;
      there is no consensus on what doses to use for treating either bone or organ metastases.&#xD;
      Multicenter studies are required to reach a consensus on the efficacy of high-dose versus&#xD;
      fractionated medium doses of 131I-labeled MIBG and monotherapy versus combination therapy&#xD;
      with other radio nuclides or modes of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI3-K/Akt/mTOR pathway is dysregulated in many cancers and is activated by several&#xD;
      upstream proteins, such as ras, TCL1, and bcr-abl, and membrane receptor tyrosine kinases,&#xD;
      including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor&#xD;
      receptor, c-kit, and Flt3. Increased expression and constitutive activation of the catalytic&#xD;
      subunit of PI3-K and Akt and/or decreased or absent PTEN protein expression have been&#xD;
      reported in many types of cancer. Activating mutation in PIK3CA, the gene for the catalytic&#xD;
      subunit of PI3-K have been reported in 25% of gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upstream in the growth-promoting pathways that converge on mTOR are critical molecules that&#xD;
      are often deregulated in cancer. These deregulated molecules precede inappropriate signals&#xD;
      that activate the mTOR switch, driving the growth and proliferation of the cancer cell.&#xD;
      Because the number of potential defects that can cause inappropriate activation of mTOR is&#xD;
      large and one or another is common to most cancer cells, blocking their effect at the point&#xD;
      of convergence is a rational approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Martin F et al, AKT is highly phosphorylated in phenochromocytoma but not in&#xD;
      benign adrenocortical tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although mTOR is clearly an attractive therapeutic target in tumor, no clinical study on mTOR&#xD;
      inhibition by RAD001 have been conducted in pheochromocytoma or extra-adrenal paraganglioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So we conduct this phase II study of RAD001 in this disease And we also include the&#xD;
      nonfunctioning carcinoid in this study.&#xD;
