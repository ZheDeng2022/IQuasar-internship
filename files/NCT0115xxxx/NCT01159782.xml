  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We, the investigators, hypothesise that there are distinct gene profiles in&#xD;
      rhinovirus-induced acute exacerbations of asthma. We further hypothesise that these changes&#xD;
      in gene expression involve both known mediators of the asthma phenotype as well as other&#xD;
      molecules not previously associated with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to use gene array analysis to determine differentially&#xD;
      expressed genes in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages from normal and&#xD;
      asthmatic subjects before and during rhinovirus infection in vivo. A secondary objective is&#xD;
      to determine whether any altered expressions are related to symptom severity, virus load,&#xD;
      lung function or airway inflammation in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to recruit 45 subjects: 15 healthy volunteers, 15 asthmatics naïve to inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy, and 15 asthmatics on inhaled corticosteroids who will undergo two&#xD;
      bronchoscopies, one prior to infection with rhinovirus and the second 4 days post&#xD;
      inoculation. Bronchial brushings, biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be&#xD;
      performed. RNA will be extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified&#xD;
      by passage through RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Exon 1.0ST array chips (Affymetrix,&#xD;
      Santa Clara, CA) will be used to analyse changes in gene expression. These are the most&#xD;
      powerful genome expression tools available with 1.4 million probe sets and over 5.5 million&#xD;
      features per array. Genes found to be significantly upregulated will be confirmed by&#xD;
      quantitative RT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a novel method of collecting undiluted bronchial epithelial lining fluid&#xD;
      (bronchosorption) large numbers of proteins will be measured with a MesoScale Discovery&#xD;
      multiplexed array system (MesoScale Discovery, Gaithersburg, Md) allowing further&#xD;
      confirmation of the gene array results as well as providing in vivo evidence of dysregulated&#xD;
      protein production in asthmatics. Gene expression and protein levels will be correlated with&#xD;
      viral load, symptom scores, lung function and airway inflammation in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study represents the first comprehensive evaluation of changes in bronchial epithelial&#xD;
      gene expression during rhinovirus infection in vivo and therefore has the potential to&#xD;
      provide significant insights into the host response in asthma and identify potential novel&#xD;
      targets for further evaluation.&#xD;
