      Phase IV, multi-center, non-treatment, observational, registry study to determine long term&#xD;
      effects of AVONEX® therapy on EDSS, MRI, QoL, and cognition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of long term AVONEX® treatment&#xD;
      on physical status, measured by expanded disability scale score (EDSS), of patients with&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) after their first clinical event (clinically isolated syndrome) and&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) consistent with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine the impact of long term therapy with AVONEX® on the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) MRI parameters- new or enlarging T2 lesions, T2 lesion volume, T1 lesion volume, brain&#xD;
      parenchymal fraction (BPF) b) Quality of Life (QoL): Heath Status Questionnaire (SF-36) c)&#xD;
      Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To determine the long term impact of therapy on the following in patients treated at the&#xD;
      onset of clinically isolated event (CIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EDSS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MRI parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SF-36&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. SDMT&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. To determine early clinical and MRI predictors of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Approximately 383 patients participated in CHAMPS, the original AVONEX® placebo trial,&#xD;
           will be approached for study participation. The patient population will be divided into&#xD;
           two cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cohort 1: Patients that participated in CHAMPS and CHAMPIONS 10 will be approached for&#xD;
           study participation at approximately twenty-four CHAMPIONS Continuation investigative&#xD;
           sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cohort 2: Patients that participated in CHAMPS will be located and approached for study&#xD;
           participation. Patient that participated in CHAMPIONS 10 will not be excluded from&#xD;
           Cohort 2. Efforts will be made to potentially locate patients through either the&#xD;
           original CHAMPS investigative sites, through the Biogen Idec patient services database,&#xD;
           and/or a third party (i.e., patient location service vendor) or some combination of the&#xD;
           three. .&#xD;
&#xD;
           For both cohorts, public databases may be utilized for patient reported death.&#xD;
