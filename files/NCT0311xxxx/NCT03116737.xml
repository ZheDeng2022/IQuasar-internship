        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients ages 5 to 12 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
             unilateral AOM, and with ear pain (current episode &lt;2 weeks duration). Baseline pain&#xD;
             entry requires a minimum score of 4 on the FPS-R.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients/guardians must provide Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved written&#xD;
             assent, as appropriate, which must be accompanied by an IRB approved written informed&#xD;

             or guardian), as applicable. In addition, all patients or their legally acceptable&#xD;
             representatives (i.e., parent or guardian) must sign a Health Insurance Portability&#xD;
             and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be physically active and otherwise judged to be in good health on the&#xD;
             basis of the medical history and a limited physical examination, as determined by the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must also have a negative urine human chorionic&#xD;

          -  Patients with bilateral AOM, perforated tympanic membrane, history of a perforated&#xD;
             tympanic membrane in the last 6 months, or if a perforated tympanic membrane could not&#xD;
             be ruled out by speculum examination, impedance testing tympanometry, pneumatic&#xD;
             otoscopy, or a Valsalva maneuver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are subsequently diagnosed with a perforated membrane during treatment&#xD;
             are to be discontinued immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with indwelling tympanostomy tubes or draining otitis in the affected ear(s),&#xD;
