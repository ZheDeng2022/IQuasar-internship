  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost 12% of women report smoking during pregnancy. Smoking during pregnancy is associated&#xD;
      with adverse fetal outcomes and up to 35-75% of women quit smoking during their pregnancy.&#xD;
      Clinical trials of tobacco cessation medications have reported safety concerns along with&#xD;
      limited efficacy. Subsequently, these medications are not generally recommended in pregnancy&#xD;
      and most women who stop smoking do so unassisted. Not surprisingly, the rates of smoking&#xD;
      relapse in the post-partum period are up to 67%. To date, clinical trials of behavior&#xD;
      interventions in the post-partum period have been largely null. Pharmacotherapy has not been&#xD;
      studied as a means of preventing relapse in smokers who quit without the use of medications.&#xD;
      Additionally, these medications are excreted in breast milk, which limits there use for&#xD;
      lactating women. Thus alternative, safe, and effective strategies to prevent smoking relapse&#xD;
      in high-risk, former smokers during the post-partum period are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) have anti-inflammatory properties and&#xD;
      appear effective as adjuvant therapy for depression. In animal models, n-3 LCPUFA&#xD;
      deficiencies can result in hypofunctioning of the dopamine mesocorticolimbic pathways which&#xD;
      are related to reward and dependence. Nicotine results in an elevation of dopamine in the&#xD;
      nucleus accumbens which is associated with the pleasurable sensations related to nicotine&#xD;
      use. It has been hypothesized that correcting the hypofunctioning dopaminergic system through&#xD;
      n-3 LCPUFA supplementation might reduce nicotine cravings. Taken together, these studies&#xD;
      suggest that supplemental n-3 LCPUFA might be useful in preventing smoking relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that post-partum former smokers randomized to n-3 LCPUFA&#xD;
      supplementation will be less likely to relapse and have less nicotine cravings compared to&#xD;
      women allocated to placebo. To test this hypothesis they will conduct a 12-week, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo controlled study of 4 grams/day n-3 LCPUFA supplementation versus&#xD;
      placebo. Participants will be enrolled prior to hospital discharge. The primary outcomes of&#xD;
      the trial will be time to smoking relapse and change in self-reported nicotine cravings. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome will be point prevalence abstinence at 6- and 12-weeks. compliance will be&#xD;
      monitored by measuring red blood cell phospholipid fatty acid content and verify smoking&#xD;
      cessation through end-expired CO and cotinine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goals of that submission will be to conduct a clinical trial of n-3 long-chain&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) to prevent smoking relapse in post-partum women who&#xD;
      quit smoking during pregnancy. For this proposal, the investigators will develop, test, and&#xD;
      refine our recruitment strategy, and collect data demonstrating our ability to successfully&#xD;
      recruit post-partum women who are former smokers. The investigators will collect side effect,&#xD;
      tolerability, and adherence data regarding our intervention. Finally, the investigators hope&#xD;
      to gather preliminary effect size data to allow more formal estimated of sample size. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize those post-partum former smokers randomized to n-3 LCPUFA&#xD;
      supplementation will be less likely to relapse and have less nicotine cravings compared to&#xD;
      women allocated to placebo. As a secondary analysis the investigators will compare the&#xD;
      differences in smoking point prevalence at 6 and 12 weeks between n-3 LCPUFA and placebo. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to use this preliminary data to inform a future randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation to prevent smoking&#xD;
      relapse in post-partum women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA1: To successfully recruit and randomize 90 post-partum, former smokers into a clinical&#xD;
      trial of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA2: To assess the tolerability of 4 gm/day n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in post-partum, former&#xD;
      smokers over a 12-week period&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA3: To determine the effect of 4 grams/day n-3 LCPUFA supplementation for 12-weeks on&#xD;
      smoking relapse rates and self-reported nicotine cravings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Rationale Cigarette smoking is the most preventable cause of cancer and is&#xD;
      estimated to account for 1 in 5 cancer related deaths. It is estimated that almost 11% of&#xD;
      American women report smoking during pregnancy with higher smoking rates in younger women&#xD;
      with lower educational levels. Rates of quitting smoking during pregnancy have been reported&#xD;
      to ranging from 35-75%. Regrettably, the rates of smoking relapse are particularly high in&#xD;
      the post-partum period with an estimated 67% of women eventually relapsing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-partum period represents an ideal opportunity to promote smoking cessations given&#xD;
      that: 1) many women have stopped smoking during pregnancy, motivated to improve fetal&#xD;
      outcomes; and, 2) smoking relapse appears at a very discrete time-point, giving an optimal&#xD;
      time to deliver an intervention. Unfortunately, the post-partum period also offers some&#xD;
      unique challenges. First, the most effective strategy to prevent relapse appears to be&#xD;
      prolonged pharmacotherapy. Given the safety concerns and lack of efficacy of these agents in&#xD;
      pregnancy, most women who quit smoking have done so without the use of pharmacologic agents&#xD;
      as these agents are not routinely recommended nor utilized in clinical practice. There is no&#xD;
      evidence to support the efficacy of behavioral interventions to prevent relapse in&#xD;
      non-pregnant adults and to date, prior studies of behavior interventions in the post-partum&#xD;
      period have been largely null at preventing relapses. Finally, all current FDA-approved&#xD;
      smoking cessations pharmacologic therapies are excreted into breast milk and manufactures&#xD;
      recommend stopping breast-feeding if the agents are to be used. The identification of safe&#xD;
      and effective adjuvant therapies to promote help maintain smoking abstinence in post-partum&#xD;
      women and are safe to use while breastfeeding could make an important contribution to smoking&#xD;
      cessation efforts and cancer prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n-3 LCPUFAs have anti-inflammatory effects and are possibly cardio-protective. Emerging data&#xD;
      is beginning to suggest that n-3 LCUFA relative deficiencies could have a role in behaviors&#xD;
      that are relevant to addiction. In animal models, n-3 PUFA deficiencies result in structural&#xD;
      changes in nervous tissue which impacts dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and correction&#xD;
      of these deficiencies can reverse these changes. In particular, n-3 PUFA deficiency can&#xD;
      result in hypofunctioning of the dopamine mesocortico-limbic pathways which underlie reward&#xD;
      and dependence. Nicotine results in an elevation of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, a&#xD;
      process which is associated with the pleasurable sensations related to nicotine use. As such,&#xD;
      it has been hypothesized that correcting the hypofunctioning dopaminergic system through n-3&#xD;
      LCPUFA supplementation might reduce the symptoms of withdrawal associated with smoking&#xD;
      cessation and reduce nicotine cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of 4 grams/day n-3 LCPUFA&#xD;
      supplementation versus placebo for 12-weeks. The study will recruit post-partum women with a&#xD;
      recent history of stopping smoking while pregnant. The primary outcomes will include time to&#xD;
      smoking relapse and change in self-reported nicotine cravings. The secondary outcome will be&#xD;
      point prevalence abstinence at 6- and 12-weeks. We will also collect safety and tolerability&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to stop any over-the-counter supplementations. The study will&#xD;
      include 3 in-person visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit (Week 0) This visit will occur within 6-weeks of delivery. The investigators&#xD;
      will review inclusion and exclusion criteria and obtain informed consent. Subjects will&#xD;
      complete the Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire, the Minnesota Withdrawal Symptom Checklist,&#xD;
      Beck Depression Inventory, and completes a detailed interview on tobacco use habits including&#xD;
      recording prior cigarettes per day smoked. Research interventions will include expired CO&#xD;
      level and blood collection for red blood cell phospholipid membrane and nicotine metabolites&#xD;
      (serum cotinine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visits participants will receive their randomization schedule. Participants&#xD;
      allocated to fish oil supplementation will be instructed to take four OmegaGenics® EPA-DHA&#xD;
      1000 capsules each containing 710 mg of EPA and 290 mg DHA daily; this will provide a total&#xD;
      daily dose of 2840 mg EPA plus 1160 mg DHA for a total daily dose of fish oil of 4 grams.&#xD;
      There will be dispensed a 6 week supply (70 capsules) Patients will take tablets with protein&#xD;
      meal to enhance bioavailability. In addition, subjects will be asked to refrigerate the&#xD;
      capsules, as the investigators have found in our prior studies that this step helps to&#xD;
      virtually eliminate fishy taste or eructation. The investigators will use oleic acid as our&#xD;
      placebo. The reason for the use of oleic acid is several-fold. First, oleic acid (olive oil)&#xD;
      capsules have a similar texture, size, color, and consistency to fish oil capsules. Oleic&#xD;
      acid has been used as a placebo in several prior studies and is well tolerated.(1-3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 6 and 12 In-Person Visits The investigators are planning two in-person CRC visits over&#xD;
      the course of the study. Study procedures associated with these visits will include smoking&#xD;
      habits interview, Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire, the Minnesota Withdrawal Symptom&#xD;
      Checklist, Beck Depression Inventory, expired CO level, blood markers of intervention&#xD;
      compliance, and plasma cotinine levels. The investigators will conduct pill counts and&#xD;
      interview subjects for any signs of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 3 and 9 Telephone Encounters Participants will be contacted in Weeks 3 and 9 via&#xD;
      telephone to assess for 1) medication compliance, 2) medication side effects, and 3)&#xD;
      self-reported tobacco use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Assays End-Expired CO levels The investigators will use the Smokerlyzer ED50 CO&#xD;
      meter (Bedfont Instruments) to assess end-expired carbon monoxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum Cotinine Serum cotinine will be measured using an isotope dilution-high performance&#xD;
      liquid chromatography/ atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry&#xD;
      using a commercially available testing center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of RBC Phospholipid Fatty Acid Analysis Lipids will be extracted using the&#xD;
      method of Folch-Lees. Fatty acid methyl esters are identified by comparing the retention&#xD;
      times to those of known standards. Inclusion of the internal standard, dipentadecanoyl&#xD;
      phosphatidylcholine (C15:0), permits quantitation of phospholipid amount in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Justification and Statistical Analysis Plan General Approach This study will&#xD;
      provide feasibility data regarding the recruitment strategy, the acceptability of n-3 LCPUFAs&#xD;
      supplementation in post-partum women, and preliminary data on effect size for power&#xD;
      estimation. The study power is based the primary outcome of smoking relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan For the primary outcome the investigators will compare the&#xD;
      time-to-relapse and the change in the Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include point prevalence abstinence at 12-weeks biochemically confirmed by end-expired carbon&#xD;
      monoxide. The investigators will use Cox proportional hazards models to compare the&#xD;
      differences in relapse between study arms. The investigators will compare the change outcome&#xD;
      at 12-weeks between arms using logistic regression using repeated measured ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation and power analysis The investigators will recruit 90 participants with&#xD;
      an expected drop-out rate of 20%. This should result in an analytic sample of 70. In this&#xD;
      study the investigators will randomize 45 post-partum women to n-3 LCPUFA supplements and 45&#xD;
      to control therapies. The investigators estimate a 50% relapse rate in controls by 12-weeks.&#xD;
      The investigators will be able to detect true hazard ratios (relative risks) of failure for&#xD;
      control subjects relative to experimental subjects of 0.478 with probability (power) 0.80.&#xD;
      The Type I error probability associated with this test of the null hypothesis that the&#xD;
      experimental and control survival curves are equal is 0.05. The Fagerström Tolerance&#xD;
      Questionnaire is on a 10-point Likert scale. Estimating a baseline score of 7.3 ± 1.6 the&#xD;
      investigators have 80% power to detect a difference of 1 SD between the study arms&#xD;
