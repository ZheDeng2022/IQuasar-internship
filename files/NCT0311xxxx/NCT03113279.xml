  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two independent, but interrelated conditions that have a growing impact on healthy life&#xD;
      expectancy and health care costs in developed nations are the age related loss of muscle mass&#xD;
      (sarcopenia) and obesity. Sarcopenia affects approximately one third of adults over 60 years&#xD;
      of age and more than 50% of those over 80 years, which is of concern when one considers that&#xD;
      the most rapidly expanding population demographic in the UK is adults &gt;80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle is important in regulating blood glucose and insulin sensitivity. Thus,&#xD;
      sarcopenia may play a role in exacerbating insulin resistance and progression toward Type II&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D). Indeed, the highest incidence of T2D in the UK has been noted to occur in&#xD;
      adults &gt;65 years. Obesity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases including T2D and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Progression towards obesity is associated with a concomitant decrease&#xD;
      in muscle mass, producing an unfavorable ratio of fat to muscle. Thus, obesity in old age may&#xD;
      exacerbate the progression of sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the proposed study the investigators will conduct preliminary laboratory tests to&#xD;
      characterize body composition, insulin sensitivity, systemic inflammation, aerobic capacity&#xD;
      and muscle protein metabolism (in the fasted and fed state) in healthy older and obese older&#xD;
      adults for comparison against healthy young individuals.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty healthy young (aged 18-35), healthy old and obese older adults (aged â‰¥65) will be&#xD;
      recruited. Old groups will be matched for age and sexual dimorphism. Obese participants will&#xD;
      be classed as prediabetic based on a fasting A1C between 5.7 and 6.4% and impaired fasting&#xD;
      glucose between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/L. Obese participants will habitually take between 2000-5000&#xD;
      steps per day, whilst healthy young and old participants will complete &gt;5000 steps per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 1 Preliminary assessments - Over a 3day period, participants will be instructed to wear&#xD;
      a portable pedometer, to allow visual feedback on step count, and an armband accelerometer to&#xD;
      determine habitual daily energy expenditure and the intensity of physical activity. In&#xD;
      addition, participants will log their dietary intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 2 Body composition and metabolic profiling After consuming a standardized meal the&#xD;
      previous evening, participants will report to the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility&#xD;
      in a 10 hour fasted state at approximately 09.00. Participants will be weighed in light&#xD;
      clothing and blood pressure will be measured. Thereafter, body composition will be determined&#xD;
      using dual energy Xray absorptiometry (DXA) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) via ventilated&#xD;
      hood and continuous gas collection. Following RMR, a catheter will be inserted into a forearm&#xD;
      vein and a resting, fasted blood sample obtained to determine postprandial insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity using the HOMA-IR index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 3 Muscle protein metabolism Participants will return to the lab in a 10 hour&#xD;
      fasted-state at approximately 07.00 having refrained from strenuous exercise for 48 hours&#xD;
      previously. Catheters will be inserted into the antecubital vein of both forearms. A primed,&#xD;
      continuous infusion of isotopically labeled amino acid will be infused into one arm and the&#xD;
      other will be used for frequent blood sampling. Muscle biopsies will be obtained 3 and 7&#xD;
      hours into the infusion to determine postabsorptive and postprandial rates of muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis.&#xD;

          1. Health problems such as: heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, poor lung&#xD;
             function, uncontrolled hypertension, or any health conditions that might put the&#xD;
             participant at risk for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Recent failure to obtain clearance for exercise participation from family&#xD;
             physician/medical doctor.&#xD;
