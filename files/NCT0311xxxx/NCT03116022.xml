      Hypoestrogenism leads to vaginal wall changes resulting in diminished vaginal lubrication&#xD;
      and, consequently, causing pain during intercourse. Topical estrogen therapy (THT) may&#xD;
      control this complaint. However, there are limitations on its use, especially in patients&#xD;
      with breast cancer and diagnosed endometrial cancer. This randomized clinical trial aims to&#xD;
      assess the impact of local estriol therapy in postmenopausal women complaining of coital pain&#xD;
      and to assess serum concentrations of estriol in these women after estriol use.&#xD;
      One-hundred-thirty-two women aged between 40 and 65 years will be randomized into three&#xD;
      groups: Women using estriol 1 mg / 1g at the proximal third of vagina every other night -&#xD;
      estriol proximal group (PEG), women in using estriol 1 mg / 1g at the distal third of the&#xD;
      vagina every other night - estriol distal group (DEG), gel group (GG) using water-based&#xD;
      during intercourse.&#xD;

      Introduction The daily application of estrogen in the vagina can improve the hydrogen&#xD;
      potential (pH), vaginal dryness, burning sensation, dyspareunia, and urinary symptoms.&#xD;
      Dyspareunia is highly prevalent after menopause as well as in women after gynecological and&#xD;
      breast cancer treatment. However, prescription of topical estrogen therapy (THT) to these&#xD;
      women is still controversial, and they are allowed to use only moisturizing cream and vaginal&#xD;
      lubricants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown increased serum concentrations of estrogens (estradiol and estrone) after&#xD;
      intravaginal suppository containing estradiol use. However, a cohort of 13,479 women treated&#xD;
      for breast cancer, 271 received topical hormone therapy (THT), and no increased risk for&#xD;
      recurrence was shown in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main blood supplement to the vagina is mainly from vessels that irrigate proximal vaginal&#xD;
      wall, a region where possibly the drug uptake is more intense. However, one study showed that&#xD;
      the concentration of estradiol is similarly high regardless of whether the drug was applied&#xD;
      to the proximal or distal wall of the vagina. Nevertheless, this study has not been&#xD;
      replicated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THT promotes an improvement of coital pain when used in the proximal vagina, but a large&#xD;
      population of women with clinical conditions such as thrombophilia and breast cancer cannot&#xD;
      benefit from this resource. It is not known if the estriol applied in the distal vagina wall&#xD;
      can lead to high serum levels of this hormone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES This study aims to evaluate the impact of topic estriol therapy applied in distal&#xD;
      vagina wall in coital pain, sexual function, and mood after estriol use. To evaluate serum&#xD;
      level of this hormone after estriol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study design This is a prospective, blind, and randomized clinical trial including&#xD;
      post-menopausal women complaining of pain during intercourse. The selected women will be&#xD;
      randomized into three groups: estriol proximal group (PEG), estriol distal group (DEG), and&#xD;
      gel group (GG). Participants and the assistance staff will not be blinded to the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size The sample size was based on the estimated Cohen effect size. Assuming an effect&#xD;
      size measure of 0.7 (considered large by Cohen) between groups, and considering a power test&#xD;
      of 90% and a significance level of 5%, at least 44 subjects in each arm are required for a&#xD;
      total of 132 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization will be conducted in blocks of random sizes to generate the&#xD;
      random allocation sequence. Participants will be randomized in 23 blocks and distributed in&#xD;
      intervention groups according to their position in each block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Sexually-active post-menopausal women between 40 to 65 years old complaining of&#xD;
      coital pain will be invited to participate in this study. Sexual activity must include&#xD;
      penis-vagina penetration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormonal profile evaluation Blood samples will be collected before the intervention to&#xD;
      measure basal serum levels of fasting glucose, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),&#xD;
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and serum estriol. These parameters will be applied in the&#xD;
      12th week of intervention. The measurements of FSH, TSH, and estriol will be performed by&#xD;
      chemiluminescence with IMMULITE® 2000 device (DPC IMMULITE® 2000 (Diagnostic Products&#xD;
      Corporation, Los Angeles, California, United States of America (USA)). For the measurement of&#xD;
      estriol free will be used IMMULITE® kit 2000 unconjugated estriol (SIEMENS, USA). The&#xD;
      measurement of hormonal status will be held before the intervention (time 1) and at the end&#xD;
      of the intervention (12 weeks). Glucose will be determined by automated spectrophotometry&#xD;
      using the liquid enzymatic glycemia kit (Wiener Laboratory, 2000, Rosario, Argentina) Sexual&#xD;
      function Sexual function will be evaluated with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). It&#xD;
      has 19 questions, with 6 subscales that assess desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm,&#xD;
      satisfaction, and pain. Each question is multiple choice and scored from 0 or 1 to 5. For&#xD;
      calculation of the total score (range: 2 to 36), the score of each subscale was multiplied by&#xD;
      a factor, and the 6 scores were summed. A lower score corresponds to a worse sexual function,&#xD;
      and a score below 26.55 indicates sexual dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional condition The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) was used to assess mood.&#xD;
      This scale has 14 items and two subscales, with 7 questions regarding anxiety (HAD-A) and 7&#xD;
      regarding depression (HAD-D). There are four responses to each question (score of 0 to 3),&#xD;
      and the sum of scores of each subscale provides a total score from 0 to 21. A cut-off score ≥&#xD;
      9 for anxiety and depression characterizes the mental state of the woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All questionnaires will be applied individually by a gynecologist before the intervention&#xD;
      (time 1) and at the end of the intervention (12 weeks) when women attend to collect blood&#xD;
      samples. Before applying the questionnaires, women will be informed about the content and&#xD;
      objectives of the research, and will also be informed about the issue of confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coital pain evaluation Coital pain will be assessed by the Analogic Visual Scale and the&#xD;
      McGill Pain Questionnaire, a multi-dimensional tool that consists of 4 groups of constructs&#xD;
      divided into 20 subgroups: Sensory-discriminative group (subgroups 1 to 10) relates to&#xD;
      traction, heat, twist, among others; the motivational-affective group (subgroups 11 to 15)&#xD;
      describes the affective dimension aspects of tension, as well as fear punishment, and&#xD;
      neurovegetative responses; the descriptors of the cognitive component evaluation (subgroup&#xD;
      16) allows the patient to express the overall assessment of the painful experience; subgroups&#xD;
      17-20 comprise miscellaneous items. The subject can choose only one alternative for each&#xD;
      subgroup, so the greater the number of most marked pain intensity descriptors, wherein the&#xD;
      maximum score is 78. This questionnaire will be applied individually by a gynecologist at the&#xD;
      beginning and at 12 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION For the PEG group, women will receive professional guidance to use an applicator&#xD;
      only 3 cm inside the vagina, once at night, each other night, while lying down to sleep, with&#xD;
      a woman in the dorsal position inserting the applicator 3 cm through the vaginal introitus.&#xD;
      For the DEG group, women will receive professional guidance to use an applicator totally&#xD;
      inside the vagina. The application will be recommended once each other night, while lying&#xD;
      down to sleep, with a woman in the dorsal position inserting the applicator 10 cm through the&#xD;
      vaginal introitus. Lubricant will be acquired by the researcher in commercial form and should&#xD;
      be used during sexual intercourse in the vagina introitus prior to penetration of the penis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certification of correct use of prescription A researcher will contact the patient by&#xD;
      telephone every two weeks to certify the proper use or any adverse symptoms related to the&#xD;
      use of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS This project was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee in Research,&#xD;
      and all women shall sign the Informed Consent. This project will be guided according to the&#xD;
      ethical standards by Resolution 196/96 of the National Health Council on research with the&#xD;
      human being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Qualitative variables are described considering the absolute and&#xD;
      relative frequencies, as quantitative variables are expressed by central position and&#xD;
      dispersion measurements. The comparison between the study groups will be performed using the&#xD;
      linear regression model of mixed effects; the model residue analysis will be representing&#xD;
      through normal graphics. Cohen measure will be used as the size measure, which is expressed&#xD;
      by the difference between the mean divided by the standard deviation. The Statistical&#xD;
      Analysis System (SAS) will be used for data analysis.&#xD;
