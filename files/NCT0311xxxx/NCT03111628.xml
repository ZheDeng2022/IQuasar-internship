      This is a Phase IV, single-site study that will examine blood cells or tissue obtained from&#xD;
      CIU ( chronic idiopathic Urticaria) patients receiving open-label treatment with omalizumab&#xD;
      at the current FDA-approved dose of 300 mg/month for 12 weeks in addition to standard therapy&#xD;
      with anti-histamines. Results from the 3 Phase III studies in CIU patients provide evidence&#xD;
      that a meaningful change in symptoms is apparent at 1-2 wks. The Minimal Important Difference&#xD;
      (MID) is achieved by 70% of patients by 2 wks on multiple background drugs for hives. The&#xD;
      goal is to identity the IgE bearing cell type associated with clinical symptom change.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a study of the kinetics of clinical symptom relief during treatment of patients&#xD;
      with CIU. The purpose is to determine if the rate of clinical remission is concordant with&#xD;
      the rate that IgE-dependent functions of basophil change or mast cell changes during&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basophil surface IgE, Fc epsilon Receptor I alpha (FcεRI) and Syk by flow cytometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dendritic cell surface IgE, FcεRI, functions&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Basophil anti-IgE, anti FcεRI, C5a, N-Formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP)&#xD;
           mediated histamine along with sensitivity measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Serum free IgE measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Characterization of presence of serum autoantibody presence ± Syk inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Basophil enumeration&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Basophil Messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling baseline at 3 timepoints (baseline, meaningful&#xD;
           clinical changes, and 30 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To assess the rate of IgE and FcεRI change in skin mast cells at day 0, 6, 90, via a&#xD;
           small punch biopsy as well as the Mas-Related gpr Family Member X2 (MrgX2) receptor&#xD;
           expression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase IV, single-site study that will examine blood cells or tissue obtained from&#xD;
      CIU patients receiving open-label treatment with omalizumab at the current FDA-approved dose&#xD;
      of 300 mg/month for 12 weeks in addition to standard therapy with anti-histamines. Results&#xD;
      from the 3 Phase III studies in CIU patients provide evidence that a meaningful change in&#xD;
      symptoms is apparent at 1-2 wks. The MID (Minimal Important Difference) is achieved by 70% of&#xD;
      patients by 2 wks on multiple background drugs for hives. The goal is to identity the IgE&#xD;
      bearing cell type associated with clinical symptom change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 30 patients and will consist of three phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit (Week -3 to Week-2)-establish compliance with diary and review safety labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard therapy Run-in (Week -2 to Day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label Treatment Period (Day 0 to Week 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible at the screening visit (Week -1), subjects must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Be &gt; 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Have a diagnosis of moderate to severe CIU, as defined by pruritus and hives for &gt; 3&#xD;
           days in a 7-day period for &gt; 6 consecutive weeks despite treatment with H1&#xD;
           antihistamine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Must have a non-diary based daily urticaria activity score (UAS) score ≥ 2 established in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting based on the patient's condition over 12 hours prior to the visit; the UAS&#xD;
      is a composite score of pruritus (0-3) and number of hives (0-3) with a maximum value of 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This requirement may be met either at screening visit, run-in visit (Week -2), or beginning&#xD;
      of treatment (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Must have been on an approved dose of an H1 antihistamine for CIU such as loratadine 10 mg&#xD;
      once a day or equivalent, for at least 7 days prior to the screening visit. Approved agents&#xD;
      include loratadine 10 qd, desloratadine 5 mg qd, fexofenadine 180 mg qd, cetirizine 10 mg qd&#xD;
      or levocetirizine 5 mg qd as once daily medications at the current FDA-approved dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Must be willing to fill out a twice-daily patient-diary to establish the patient's Urticaria&#xD;
      Activity Score 7 (UAS7) score. The UAS is a composite diary- recorded score with numeric&#xD;
      severity intensity ratings (0 = none to 3 = intense) for 1) the number of wheals (hives); and&#xD;
      2) the intensity of the pruritus (itch). The UAS7 is the sum of the daily average UAS scores&#xD;
      (average of a.m. and p.m.) for 7 days. The maximum UAS7 value is 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible to begin the run-in period (Week -2 to Day 0), the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Must remain on stable dose of a single H1 antihistamine at approved dose (not including&#xD;
      antihistamine rescue medication) as established at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 12-week treatment period , subjects will have last visit a final visit to&#xD;
      collect diary, blood work, non-lesional skin biopsy and safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be provided diphenhydramine (25 mg po TID) as rescue medication for&#xD;
      pruritus relief on an as-needed basis (to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours). Patients who&#xD;
      require treatments other than diphenhydramine (e.g., prednisone) to treat&#xD;
      persistent/worsening disease will be discontinued from the study. Patients will also be&#xD;
      provided an epipen and trained in its use as per American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp;&#xD;
      Immunology (AAAAI) guidelines for omalizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint The time to meaningful change in diary-based clinical symptoms as measured&#xD;
      by the Urticaria Activity Score from baseline (Wk -7 to Day -1) to the date at which an MID&#xD;
      (5 point change in weekly UAS 7) or achievement of &gt; 50% reduction in daily symptom score for&#xD;
      3 days if in the first week. The UAS score, which is the sum of pruritus and hives, will be&#xD;
      used to calculate the UAS7. The UAS7 score obtained 1 week prior to randomization will be&#xD;
      used as the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in the weekly pruritus score from baseline to the 12th week in the treatment period.&#xD;
      The pruritus score will be measured twice daily (a.m. and p.m.), on a scale of 0 (none) to 3&#xD;
      (intense). The weekly pruritus score is the sum of average daily pruritus scores over the&#xD;
      previous 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in the weekly score for number of hives from baseline to the 12th week in the&#xD;
      treatment period. The number of hives is measured twice daily (a.m. and p.m.), on a scale of&#xD;
      0 (none) to 3 (&gt; 12 hives, see below). The weekly score of number of hives is the sum of the&#xD;
      average daily scores over the previous 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in the amount of rescue medication (diphenhydramine 25 mg) from baseline to the 12th&#xD;
      week in the treatment period using the question on the rescue medication use in the patient&#xD;
      diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in SKINDEX29 (quality of life survey instrument with 29 questions) on a 5-point Likert&#xD;
      scale. It will be given at baseline and again at 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basophil surface IgE, FcεRI and Syk by flow cytometry- Day 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 20, 30 and 90&#xD;
           days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dendritic cell surface IgE, FcεRI -Day 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 20, 30 and 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Basophil anti-IgE, anti FcεRI, C5a, FMLP mediated histamine release along with&#xD;
           sensitivity measures- Day 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 20, 30 and 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Serum free IgE measures (stored serum) Day 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 20, 30 and 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Characterization of presence of serum autoantibody presence ± Syk inhibitors -Day 0, 1,&#xD;
           3, 6, 10, 20, 30 and 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Basophil enumeration by manual counting and blood histamine content - Day 0, 1, 3, 6,&#xD;
           10, 20, 30 and 90 days. This will determine the presence or absence of basopenia and&#xD;
           identify subjects for mRNA profiling studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Basophil mRNA profiling baseline at 3 timepoints (baseline, meaningful clinical changes,&#xD;
           and 30 days) in select subjects with sufficient basophil numbers ( &gt;1.5x 106/100 cc&#xD;
           blood)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Numbers of IgE +, FcεRI + cells in non-lesional skin biopsies at day 0, 6, 90 to monitor&#xD;
           skin mast cells well as the MrgX2 receptor expression&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Change in circulating leukocyte population numbers that are targeted by omalizumab such&#xD;
           as blood basophils, eosinophil and lymphocyte counts by automated analysis (week -3 to&#xD;
           week 12).&#xD;
