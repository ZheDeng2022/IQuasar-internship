  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will compare the drugs olaparib and cediranib with standard chemotherapy in&#xD;
      platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Patients will be randomised to one of three treatment&#xD;
      groups: olaparib only, olaparib and cediranib and the control group paclitaxel. The aim is to&#xD;
      compare efficacy of the 3 treatments and also how well each treatment is tolerated including&#xD;
      the participants quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor which targets BRCA1/2 mutated tumour cells and cediranib is an&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic drug which reduces blood supply to the tumour, suppressing tumour viability.&#xD;
      Phase I/II trials of both drugs have shown these are well tolerated alone or in combination&#xD;
      in ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial aims to compare the efficacy of the combination and of olaparib alone with&#xD;
      paclitaxel chemotherapy and whether the olaparib/cediranib combination is better tolerated&#xD;
      thus improving quality of life. Secondly standard paclitaxel chemotherapy must be&#xD;
      administered weekly at hospital whereas the olaparib/cediranib combination can be&#xD;
      administered at home potentially also improving patient quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' tumours will be resistant to platinum based therapies. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomised into one of the 3 treatment arms after stratification for prior&#xD;
      PARP/anti-angiogenic treatments/BRCA status. Participants will be on trial up to 18 months.&#xD;
