    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the test product, eslicarbazepine acetate&#xD;
      800 mg tablets (test 1, To be marketed (TBM) Treatment A), and the reference product,&#xD;
      eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg tablets (current Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) source&#xD;
      - Marketed formulation (MF)) (Reference, Treatment C), are bioequivalent and to demonstrate&#xD;
      dose equivalence between eslicarbazepine acetate 4 x 200 mg tablets (test 2, TBM Treatment B)&#xD;
      and eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg tablet (Reference).&#xD;

      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening period of maximum 21 days before the first administration of the&#xD;
           investigational medicinal product (IMP);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three treatment periods (each of which will include a profile period of 72 hours)&#xD;
           separated by a wash out period of 7 calendar days (minimum number of days based on&#xD;
           half-life of the analyte) to 14 calendar days (maximum number of days based on&#xD;
           logistical arrangements) between consecutive administrations of the IMP, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A post study visit within 1 and 2 weeks of completion of the last treatment period of&#xD;
           the study or within 72 hours of termination or withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned randomly to treatment sequence according to randomization schedule,&#xD;
      before the first administration of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the study center on Day -1 and will be allowed to leave 24 hours&#xD;
      after dosing. Subjects have to return for the subsequent blood sample collections up to 72&#xD;
      hours after dosing.&#xD;
