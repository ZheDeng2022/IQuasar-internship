      A study to assess effectiveness and safety of a drug FP-1201-lyo (Recombinant Human&#xD;
      Interferon Beta-1a) in the Prevention of Multi-Organ Failure on patients after Open Surgery&#xD;
      for a Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, Phase II, parallel group comparison&#xD;
      study of the efficacy and safety of FP-1201-lyo compared to placebo in patients surviving&#xD;
      emergency open surgery for an infra-renal ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Investigational&#xD;
      medicinal product will be administered as post-surgical preventive treatment either 10µg&#xD;
      FP-1201-lyo or placebo. Treatment will be administered daily every 24 hrs for 6 days. The&#xD;
      first dose will be given after successful surgery at the point when the patient arrives to&#xD;
      the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatment groups will receive standard supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim is randomise and initiate treatment of 152 patients. For the final analysis, a minimum of&#xD;
      129 evaluable patients will be required.&#xD;

VFDs to Day 30 were defined as the number of calendar days after initiating unassisted breathing (UAB) to Day 30 from first treatment, assuming that a patient survives at least 48 consecutive hours after initiating UAB.

    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Organ failure free days were defined as the number of days in the first 30 days after the first dose of study medication that the patient was alive and free of organ failure with a SOFA score of zero for the following six organ parameters: respiration, coagulation, liver, cardiovascular, central nervous system and renal function. It is graded from 0 to 4 according to the degree of dysfunction/ failure (higher scores indicate more severe organ failure). Patients who died without achieving a SOFA score of zero was assigned an organ failure free days value of zero.&#xD;
Note: the information for organ failure free days has been only collected when the patients have been in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). As ICU free days have been reported in a separate variable, it was decided that presented information will be kept, without trying to conduct imputation.</description>

&#xD;
          9. Ruptured Endovascular Aortic Repair (rEVAR) first (prior attempt for endovascular&#xD;
             aortic repair for the current rupture)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Diagnosed cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pregnancy and women with child bearing potential without negative pregnancy test&#xD;

               -  thoracoabdominal aneurysms requiring immediate repair&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  damaged renal arteries during emergency clamping requiring repair&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  temporary clamping above the renal arteries (max 30 min total clamping time above the&#xD;
             renal arteries) does not lead to exclusion&#xD;

        <title>The Efficacy of FP-1201-lyo Compared to Placebo Concerning Number of Organ Failure Free Days by Means of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score</title>
        <description>Organ failure free days were defined as the number of days in the first 30 days after the first dose of study medication that the patient was alive and free of organ failure with a SOFA score of zero for the following six organ parameters: respiration, coagulation, liver, cardiovascular, central nervous system and renal function. It is graded from 0 to 4 according to the degree of dysfunction/ failure (higher scores indicate more severe organ failure). Patients who died without achieving a SOFA score of zero was assigned an organ failure free days value of zero.&#xD;
Note: the information for organ failure free days has been only collected when the patients have been in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). As ICU free days have been reported in a separate variable, it was decided that presented information will be kept, without trying to conduct imputation.</description>

      <time_frame>The Adverse Event (AE) reporting period was up to study D30. In accordance with the protocol, the investigators reported AEs occurring after D30 only if the investigator considered a causal relationship with the study drug. All deaths were reported as SAEs throughout the study, up until D90.</time_frame>
