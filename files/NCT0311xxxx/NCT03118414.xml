      The objectives of this study were to 1) compare balance of the elderly by Berg Balance Scale&#xD;
      (BBS) and Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) among physical exercise, virtual reality, brain exercise&#xD;
      and control groups after intervention, 2) compare cognitive function of the elderly by using&#xD;
      Timed Up and Go Cognitive (TUGC) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) among physical&#xD;
      exercise, virtual reality, brain exercise and control groups after intervention, 3) compare&#xD;
      muscle strength of elderly by 5 Times Sit-To-Stand Test (5TSTST) and Hand Grip Strength (HG)&#xD;
      among physical exercise, virtual reality, brain exercise and control groups after&#xD;
      intervention, 4) compare fear of falling by using Fall Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I)&#xD;
      among physical exercise, virtual reality, brain exercise and control groups after&#xD;
      intervention, 5)investigate the perspective of exercise among physical exercise, virtual&#xD;
      reality, brain exercise and control groups after intervention.&#xD;

      This study used healthy elderly participants with the age of 65-85 years. Eighty-four elderly&#xD;
      participants were recruited by announcing the study information at the elderly homes. Sample&#xD;
      size calculation was performed using G*Power software (G*Power version 3.1.9.2, University&#xD;
      Kiel, Germany). To our knowledge, no study compare the effects of physical exercise, virtual&#xD;
      reality and brain exercise on balance of the elders. Based on previous finding on the effects&#xD;
      of virtual reality on balance of the elderly, a total of 84 participants were required at&#xD;
      confidence level (α) of .05 and power (1-β) of 0.80. Participants who were interested in&#xD;
      participation underwent a screening process using inclusion-exclusion criteria and receive&#xD;
      brief information regarding the study. If they met all inclusion criteria, the consent&#xD;
      process was performed. To ensure they understood the study, they were simply asked regarding&#xD;
      the study (i.e. objectives, benefits, etc.) before signing the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participants provided a written informed consent, all participants filled out the&#xD;
      information sheet and demographic data were collected. After that, age matching with range of&#xD;
      ± 5 years and random allocation to different studies groups were done. Pretest assessment for&#xD;
      balance by BBS and TUG, cognitive function by TUGC and MOCA, muscle strength by 5 TSTST and&#xD;
      Hand Grip Strength (HG) and fear of falling by FES-I and perspective of exercise by&#xD;
      questionnaires were done and recorded by blinded assessor. In this study, random allocation&#xD;
      of the participants to different study groups; physical exercise group (PE), virtual reality&#xD;
      group (VR), brain exercise group (BE) and control group; was done by the medical doctor and&#xD;
      intervention was given the physical therapist from the study area which is the elderly home.&#xD;
      All the assessments were done by the principal researcher. The assessor was blinded to reduce&#xD;
      the bias which might come from the assessor's expectation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, all the participants from intervention groups were explained and demonstrated&#xD;
      about the respective interventions until they clearly understand about the intervention&#xD;
      program before commencing the intervention program. The PE, VR and BE groups got their&#xD;
      respective intervention for 30 minutes per sessions, 3 non-consecutive days per week for 8&#xD;
      weeks. The control group was reminded not to participate in any other exercise or&#xD;
      intervention program except their routine daily activities for 8 weeks. Participants from PE&#xD;
      group needed to do the 5-minute warm-up, 20-minute core content (upper and lower limb&#xD;
      strengthening exercises and balance challenging exercises), and 5-minute cool down exercise&#xD;
      programs. For the virtual reality group, the participants were reminded to play the game&#xD;
      according to the program and try to get as high a score as possible they can. This&#xD;
      intervention program included 10 games. The participants were asked to choose 6 games from&#xD;
      the list before each 30-minute session, and were asked to choose the games to include the&#xD;
      upper limbs, lower limbs, and also for both strength and balance challenges instead of&#xD;
      choosing the games that need to use only upper limbs or lower limbs, and were just for&#xD;
      strength and balance gain. For the brain exercise, participants needed to play cognitive&#xD;
      stimulating games; Chinese Checker, Jenga and Memory Matched pair game; in the sitting&#xD;
      position. The participants needed to paly 10 minutes for each game and total duration for all&#xD;
      3 games was about 30 minutes. After 8-week study period, post-test assessments were done to&#xD;
      find out the effect of interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS for windows version 18.0, statistical&#xD;
      software package. The value of p&lt;0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. As&#xD;
      the objective of this study was to find out the effects of PE, VR and BE on balance,&#xD;
      cognitive function, muscle strength and fear of falling in the elderly. Two-way mixed ANOVA&#xD;
      was used to test the variance differences among the four groups with post-hoc analysis as&#xD;
      appropriately. Prior to utilization of statistical tests, descriptive statistics were&#xD;
      performed and statistical assumptions were tested. Transformation will be performed if the&#xD;
      data were not normally distributed. Appropriate statistical tests (parametric vs.&#xD;
      non-parametric) were performed to determine the effects of different interventions in this&#xD;
      study on balance, cognitive function, muscle strength and fear of falling in the elderly.&#xD;
      Post-hoc power analysis was also performed.&#xD;
