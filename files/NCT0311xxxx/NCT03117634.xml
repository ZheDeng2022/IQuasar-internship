  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polypoidal choroidal neovasculopathy (PCV) is a subtype of wet age related macula&#xD;
      degeneration (AMD) occuring more commonly in the Asian population. Besides the phenotypic&#xD;
      differences, PCV is thought to have a lesser response to anti VEGF therapy which is the&#xD;
      mainstay of treatment for other typical wet AMD. Recent trial data suggest that a combination&#xD;
      with photodynamic therapy may help in the visual and anatomical outcome of PCV, and emerging&#xD;
      evidence shows favourable outcomes the newer anti VEGF agent, aflibercept 2mg monotherapy.&#xD;
      These trials however, have assessed aflibercept in a strict 2mg every 8 weekly regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical setting, a significant an unmet need in the management of PCV is a tailored&#xD;
      treatment regime. Here we propose a treatment regimen based on disease activity for PCV with&#xD;
      aflibercept mono therapy. A limitation of the 2q8 regime is that it is fixed and does not&#xD;
      vary regardless of polyp closure or anatomical outcome at the first time point of assessment&#xD;
      (month 3). We hypothesize that after the initial 3 monthly injections of aflibercept, about&#xD;
      50% of PCV will close and become quiescent, and in the remaining 50%, a further 3 monthly&#xD;
      injections will increase overall polyp closure rate. After a loadings phase of either 3 or 6&#xD;
      months, all eyes will start on a treat and extend regime (T&amp;E), with a minimum period of 8&#xD;
      weeks and a maximum of 12 weeks between treatments with 2 week increments if PCV remains&#xD;
      quiescent. The proposed study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a modified treat and extend&#xD;
      regime based on disease activity with aflibercept monotherapy for PCV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide.&#xD;
      In its exudative or wet form, choroidal neovascularization (CNV) causes an exudative&#xD;
      maculopathy resulting in sudden loss of vision with severe effects on patients' quality of&#xD;
      life.1,2 Intra vitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents&#xD;
      (anti-VEGF) agents have become the mainstay of treatment for AMD CNV and have been shown to&#xD;
      have favorable outcomes in most AMD CNV subtypes.3,4 In the Asian population however, a&#xD;
      particular subtype called polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), which affects about 50% of&#xD;
      exudative maculopathy, has been shown to have less favorable response to anti-VEGF&#xD;
      therapy.5,6 The EVEREST trial, a randomized controlled trial which compares the efficacy of&#xD;
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) with or without ranibizumab for treatment of PCV showed that PDT&#xD;
      with or without anti VEGF improved polyp closure rate on angiographic assessment but this&#xD;
      trial did not take into account vision as a primary end point.7 PDT appears work through its&#xD;
      effects on choroidal vasculature, hence making it relevant to PCV which is increasingly&#xD;
      thought to be a condition on the pachychoroid spectrum.8 PDT however, as a treatment modality&#xD;
      presents several disadvantages. Firstly, PCV often presents as a widely distributed lesion,&#xD;
      making it difficult to treat, with a single beam of PDT. Secondly, PDT is limited in its&#xD;
      ability to treat lesions in the peripapillary area as there is risk of damage to the optic&#xD;
      nerve. Thirdly, features commonly associated with PCV such as a large pigment epithelial&#xD;
      detachment (PED) or extensive submacular hemorrhages are not usually suitable for PDT.&#xD;
      Fourthly, there is a risk of long-term choroidal atrophy especially if repeated treatments&#xD;
      are administered.8,9&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is emerging evidence for the use of aflibercept monotherapy in PCV. Reports range from&#xD;
      small case series and retrospective studies to larger prospective studies. Recent data from&#xD;
      the PLANET study showed that monotherapy of aflibercept resulted in similar letter gains in&#xD;
      visual acuity as compared to combination treatment with PDT at 1 year. Polyp closure rate was&#xD;
      also similar between the two groups at 38.9% with monotherapy and 44.8% with combination&#xD;
      therapy. The VAULT and APOLLO studies suggest vision and anatomical improvements with 66-72%&#xD;
      polyp closure in 1 year.10 These trials however, use a fixed dosing regimen (3 monthly&#xD;
      loading doses of 2mg aflibercept followed by fixed dosing every 8 weeks (2q8) totaling 7&#xD;
      injections in 1 year). In addition to resolution of subretinal fluid, recent studies using&#xD;
      the novel OCT-angiography (OCT-A) to evaluate choroidal vasculature suggests re-modelling of&#xD;
      choroidal vasculature may also be an important therapeutic effect. We reported more prominent&#xD;
      reduction in choroidal vessel calibre after combination treatment with PDT and bevacizumab&#xD;
      compared to bevacizumab monotherapy. The effect of Aflibercept on choroidal vasculature has&#xD;
      been less well studied. Some evidence however, suggested aflibercept may have more profound&#xD;
      effect on choroidal vasculature with the reducing choroidal thickness than ranibizumab or&#xD;
      bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant unmet need in the management of PCV with anti VEGF monotherapy is a practical&#xD;
      way of treating patients in the real world setting that maximizes efficacy with minimal&#xD;
      number of visits and injections. Clinical trial regimes follow a rigid treatment algorithm&#xD;
      that aim to maximize response. In the clinical setting, these regimes are impractical in&#xD;
      &quot;real world&quot; patients. Regular intensive course of treatment involves lengthy visits which&#xD;
      include consultation time, clinical examination, retinal imaging, and often an intra vitreal&#xD;
      injection. In clinical practice this often result in treatment fatigue and in a co-payment&#xD;
      healthcare environment in Singapore, may also result in significant financial burden to the&#xD;
      patient and society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While aflibercept affords an 8 weekly treatment regime which is better than other monthly&#xD;
      anti VEGF therapy regimes, trial regimes still do not take into account individual patients'&#xD;
      disease patterns. This study aims to take disease activity into account to tailor treatment&#xD;
      regimes specific for patients. In addition, it aims to provide insight into the outcomes of&#xD;
      patients on a more clinically relevant treat and extend (T&amp;E) regime which changes the&#xD;
      treatment tempo in relation to disease activity.&#xD;
