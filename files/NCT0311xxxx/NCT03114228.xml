  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather and evaluate additional safety data on the combination&#xD;
      of midostaurin and standard of care for adult patients with newly diagnosed Fms-like tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase receptor (FLT3) mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who are eligible for standard&#xD;
      induction and consolidation chemotherapy and are without satisfactory treatment alternatives&#xD;
      prior to the commercial availability* and reimbursement of midostaurin during the regulatory&#xD;
      approval process&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any screening procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have a documented unequivocal diagnosis of AML according to WHO 2008&#xD;
             classification (≥20% blasts in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood), excluding M3&#xD;
             (acute promyelocytic leukemia). Patients with secondary AML are eligible, e.g.&#xD;
             patients with antecedent history of treatment for prior malignancy. AML patients with&#xD;
             a history of antecedent treatment for myelodysplasia (MDS), e.g. azacitidine or&#xD;
             decitabine, remain eligible for treatment on this study. These agents must have been&#xD;
             discontinued for a period of at least 30 days or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever&#xD;
             is greater) before midostaurin can be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a documented FLT3 mutation (ITD or TKD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be 18 years of age or older; elderly patients must be fit to receive&#xD;
             intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must enroll prior to completion of cycle 2 of the consolidation chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients requiring intrathecal chemotherapy must have a minimum washout of 48 hours&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of midostaurin&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have the following laboratory values:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Total Bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Serum Creatinine ≤ 2.5 x ULN Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior therapy for AML with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. emergency leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. emergency treatment for hyperleukocytosis with hydroxyurea for ≤ 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. cranial RT for CNS leukostasis (one dose only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. growth factor/cytokine support 2. Patients with LVEF less than 45% (by echocardiogram&#xD;
             or MUGA) or symptomatic congestive heart failure, Class III or IV according to New&#xD;
             York Heart Association (NYHA) classification 3. Patients with any pulmonary infiltrate&#xD;
             including those suspected to be of infectious origin (unless resolved to &lt; Grade 1&#xD;
             within screening timeframe) 4. Patients with any uncontrolled illness, including, but&#xD;
             not limited to, acute or chronic pancreatitis or uncontrolled infection 5. QTc &gt;500&#xD;
             msec on screening ECG. 6. History of hypersensitivity to any drugs or metabolites of&#xD;
             similar chemical classes as the study treatment. 7. Participation in a prior&#xD;
             investigational interventional (drug) study with administration of the investigational&#xD;
             product within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is&#xD;
             longer. 8. Pregnancy statements and contraception requirements: Women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless&#xD;
             they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 3&#xD;
             months after stopping medication. Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male&#xD;
                  partner should be the sole partner for that subject&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement&#xD;
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for&#xD;
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of use&#xD;
                  of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a&#xD;
                  minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
