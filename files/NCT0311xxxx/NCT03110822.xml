    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      ruxolitinib, steroids and lenalidomide among MM patients who currently show progressive&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell dyscrasia, is the most common primary malignancy of the&#xD;
      bone marrow.The etiology of myeloma is largely unknown, although genetic predisposition and&#xD;
      environmental factors have been speculated. MM arises from malignant plasma cells that&#xD;
      clonally expand and accumulate in the bone marrow. These clonal plasma cells produce high&#xD;
      levels of monoclonal immunoglobulins. Plasma cell dyscrasias are classified as monoclonal&#xD;
      gammopathy of undetermined significance, solitary plasmacytoma, smoldering myeloma, active&#xD;
      myeloma, extra-skeletal myeloma, or plasma cell leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015 an estimated 26,850 adults (14,090 men and 12,760 women) in the United States will be&#xD;
      diagnosed with multiple myeloma. It is estimated that 11,240 deaths (6,240 men and 5,000&#xD;
      women) from this disease will occur this year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, new and more effective drugs have become available for the treatment of MM.&#xD;
      Such drugs have been evaluated together and in combination with older agents, rapidly&#xD;
      increasing the number of therapeutic options available to MM patients, and resulting in an&#xD;
      improvement in their overall survival (OS) rates. Among the drugs that have been FDA approved&#xD;
      specifically for myeloma are the immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) thalidomide, and its newer&#xD;
      analogs lenalidomide and pomalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMiDs exert their anti-neoplastic action by affecting various cancer cell functions and the&#xD;
      microenvironment, including cytokine production, immune cell function, and in some instances,&#xD;
      inflammation, cell proliferation and cell death. The IMiD thalidomide has been found to be&#xD;
      effective as an anti-MM agent in one-third of myeloma patients; notably, higher response&#xD;
      rates have been observed when combined with steroids. Lenalidomide is an analog of&#xD;
      thalidomide that has shown more potent anti-MM activity than thalidomide in preclinical&#xD;
      studies, and has been FDA-approved for the treatment of previously untreated as well as&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory MM (RRMM) in combination with dexamethasone. Recently, an analog of&#xD;
      thalidomide and lenalidomide, pomalidomide, has also been approved for RRMM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5-year survival rate for MM patients has increased from 25% in 1975 to 34% in 2003 and is&#xD;
      currently closer to 40% due to these newer and more effective treatment options.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, even with these newer agents, responses to therapy are transient, and MM&#xD;
      remains an incurable disorder with an eventual fatal outcome; and, therefore, new therapies&#xD;
      are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JAK2 is an intra-cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Janus kinase family. JAK&#xD;
      kinases play a major role in the transmission of signals from cytokine and growth factor&#xD;
      receptors into the nucleus. JAK kinases activate several intracellular signaling proteins,&#xD;
      among which the STAT transcription factors are well defined. The JAK/STAT pathway mediates&#xD;
      diverse cellular events that affect cell growth, differentiation and cell survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal JAK2 activation has been implicated in several hematological disorders and&#xD;
      malignancies. Mutations, gene translocations or cytokines released by bone marrow stromal&#xD;
      cells, may all result in aberrant JAK2 activation. The activating JAK2 V617F mutation results&#xD;
      in uncontrolled cytokine and growth factor signaling, and is believed to play a key role in&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Constitutive JAK2 activation through&#xD;
      specific chromosomal translocations is thought to contribute to the development of leukemia,&#xD;
      lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In MM, elevated levels of cytokines and growth factors such as&#xD;
      interleukin-6 (IL 6), vascular endothelial growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, basic&#xD;
      fibroblast growth factor, IL-1, IL-10, IL-11, IL-15, IL-21, granulocyte macrophage colony&#xD;
      stimulation factor, interferon-α, and leukemia inhibitory factor may also contribute to&#xD;
      exacerbated JAK2 activation.11 Among these cytokines, IL-6 has been most widely studied and&#xD;
      is considered to be a growth and survival factor for myeloma cells. Binding of IL-6 to the&#xD;
      IL-6 receptor activates JAK2, which in turn can phosphorylate the IL-6 receptor, thereby&#xD;
      augmenting its downstream signaling effects. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of JAK1/2 may&#xD;
      be a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, treatment of MM cell lines and patient derived primary MM cells with various&#xD;
      JAK1/JAK2, JAK2 and JAK pan specific inhibitors (e.g. INCB16562, CYT387 and TG101209) has&#xD;
      been shown to inhibit cell proliferation. Furthermore, JAK inhibitors have demonstrated&#xD;
      synergistic activity with established anti MM therapies such as melphalan and bortezomib&#xD;
      (CYT387) or melphalan, bortezomib and dexamethasone (INCB16562), in both MM cell lines and&#xD;
      patient derived primary MM cells. Sensitization of MM cells to dexamethasone in response to&#xD;
      JAK inhibitors may occur through crosstalk between the JAK/STAT pathway and glucocorticoids.&#xD;
      In this regard, dexamethasone treatment has been shown to increase STAT3 and the pro survival&#xD;
      factor phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) levels in melanoma cells; in turn, PI3K was found&#xD;
      to increase STAT3 levels. Prolonged exposure to dexamethasone results in resistance, which&#xD;
      could be overcome, at least in part, by JAK/STAT inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ruxolitinib is an oral, selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, and is the only JAK1/2&#xD;
      inhibitor approved by the US FDA for the treatment of intermediate and high-risk&#xD;
      myelofibrosis. Pilot experiments carried out in our research laboratory at the Institute for&#xD;
      Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research have demonstrated that the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in&#xD;
      combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone inhibited the proliferation of the MM cell&#xD;
      lines U266 and RPMI8226 and primary tumor cells derived from MM patients, and that this&#xD;
      inhibition was greater than that achieved with these drugs as single agents. Enhanced&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity was also observed when these three drugs were administered together to&#xD;
      severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing LAGκ-1A (bortezomib- and melphalan-sensitive) or&#xD;
      LAGĸ-2 (bortezomib- and melphalan-resistant) human myeloma tumors, both of which were&#xD;
      originally derived from fresh bone marrow biopsies from MM patients. In addition, ruxolitinib&#xD;
      as a single agent showed no anti MM effects whereas the combination of this drug with&#xD;
      dexamethasone showed enhanced anti-MM effects compared to steroid treatment alone. Finally,&#xD;
      an elderly heavily pre treated MM patient with polycythemia rubra vera (PRV), who had&#xD;
      previously received single-agent ruxolitinib while progressing from MGUS to MM and then&#xD;
      subsequently failed treatment with lenalidomide and methylprednisolone, responded to the&#xD;
      addition of low dose ruxolitinib twice daily to these two drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together, these results suggest that ruxolitinib may overcome lenalidomide and steroid&#xD;
      resistance for RRMM patients that are failing therapy from steroids alone or in combination&#xD;
      with lenalidomide. Therefore, in this phase 1 trial, the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in combination with methylprednisolone and lenalidomide.&#xD;

               4. Non-hematologic malignancy within the past 5 years with the exception of a)&#xD;
                  adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or thyroid&#xD;
                  cancer; b) carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast; c) prostate cancer of&#xD;
                  Gleason Grade 6 or less with stable prostate-specific antigen levels; or d)&#xD;
                  cancer considered cured by surgical resection or unlikely to impact survival&#xD;
                  during the duration of the study, such as localized transitional cell carcinoma&#xD;
                  of the bladder or benign tumors of the adrenal or pancreas&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including&#xD;
                  any one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or greater heart failure or&#xD;
                       uncontrolled angina&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Clinically significant pericardial disease&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Echocardiogram or MUGA evidence of LVEF below institutional normal within 28&#xD;
                       days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system&#xD;
                       abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at Screening has to&#xD;
                       be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Severe hypercalcemia, i.e., serum calcium ≥ 12 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) corrected for&#xD;
                  albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness&#xD;
                  that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places&#xD;
                  the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or&#xD;
                  confounds the ability to interpret data from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Undergone major surgery within 28 days prior enrollment or has not recovered from&#xD;
                  side effects of such therapy (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty is not considered to&#xD;
                  be a major surgery; however, the investigator is to discuss enrollment of a&#xD;
                  subject with a recent history of kyphoplasty with the medical monitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Pregnant or breast feeding females (lactating females must agree not to breast&#xD;
                  feed while taking lenalidomide)&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Received the following prior therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Chemotherapy within 3 weeks of study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Corticosteroids (&gt;20 mg/daily prednisone or equivalent) within 3 weeks of&#xD;
                       study drugs to ensure that steroid dose intensity at the beginning of the&#xD;
                       treatment is not altered by administration of steroids prior to the study.&#xD;
                       Consumption of steroids within 3 weeks of the treatment may interfere with&#xD;
                       efficacy and side effects due to differences of steroid intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Immunotherapy or antibody therapy as well as thalidomide, arsenic trioxide,&#xD;
                       or bortezomib within 21 days before study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Lenalidomide within 7 days before study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Extensive radiation therapy within 28 days before study drugs. Receipt of&#xD;
                       localized radiation therapy does not preclude enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, strong CYP3A4 inducers and fluconazole doses &gt;200&#xD;
                       mg daily within 5 half-lives before study drugs. (For example,&#xD;
                       clarithromycin has half-life of 4 hours so washout period for clarithromycin&#xD;
                       is 20 hours.)&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Known hypersensitivity to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition&#xD;
                  to thalidomide and lenalidomide or steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Concurrent use of other anti-cancer agents or treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while&#xD;
                  taking thalidomide or similar drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
              15. Known positivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C, and&#xD;
                  /or active tuberculosis (TB) including subjects with latent TB or with the risk&#xD;
                  factor for activation of latent TB.&#xD;
