  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a two-arm, comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      of two culturally adapted, empirically based programs (EBP) - Narrative Exposure Therapy&#xD;
      (NET) vs. Motivational Interviewing with Skills Training (MIST) in terms of lowering HIV&#xD;
      sexual-risk behaviors (HSB) for American Indian / Alaska Native (AIAN) men and women. NET&#xD;
      addresses Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a pathway to preventing substance use&#xD;
      disorders (SUD) and HSB whereas MIST addresses substance misuse as a way of preventing SUD&#xD;
      and HSB.&#xD;

      Recruitment Participants will be recruited from tribal health and wellness service agencies&#xD;
      and counseling centers on the Reservation as well as through advertising in the community.&#xD;
      Investigators will post flyers in public spaces like coffee shops, the library, the cultural&#xD;
      center, and community centers. We will also send the flyer through the tribal listserv; post&#xD;
      it on Facebook, and the local newspaper. Investigators will provide brief oral presentations&#xD;
      at the local health centers to orient providers of the project and provide contact&#xD;
      information and flyers. Providers and potential participants who are interested may contact&#xD;
      the study coordinator for more information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants are screened in person or over the phone using a screening script.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who screen out will be given a community resource list either by mail,&#xD;
           email, or in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a person is eligible but declines to participate, they will be given a one item exit&#xD;
           question regarding general reason for non-participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent and Baseline Assessment After completing the screener, the participant will be&#xD;
      scheduled for an in-person consenting / baseline assessment appointment. Study staff will&#xD;
      review the consent form with the participant. Once participant has consented, study staff&#xD;
      will gather all relevant contact information. Next, study staff will set up the computer for&#xD;
      the participant to complete the Audio Computer Assisted Self-interview (ACASI) survey, which&#xD;
      will take approximately 30 minutes. While the participant is completing the survey, local&#xD;
      study staff will call the Research Coordinator (RC) to confirm the consent has been obtained&#xD;
      and to determine randomization. The RC will let the local study staff know which counselor&#xD;
      the person should be scheduled with for the 1st counseling appointment. The counselor will&#xD;
      inform which therapy the participant was assigned to at their first counseling session. Once&#xD;
      participant completes the computer survey, study staff will schedule their first counseling&#xD;
      appointment to take place within a week of the baseline appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments The assessments will be conducted via Audio-Computer Assisted Self-Interviews&#xD;
      (ACASI) programmed into study computers. Participants will complete 4 surveys: baseline,&#xD;
      immediately after completing counseling, a three-month follow up and a six-month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counseling sessions Participants will be randomly assigned to either NET or MIST. To ensure&#xD;
      the equivalence of groups and to reduce opportunities for selection bias we will stratify the&#xD;
      randomization by gender (male vs. female) and age groups (&lt;30 vs. &gt;=30) and perform&#xD;
      randomization in blocks with varying size (4/6/8). Participants will begin their six 90 to&#xD;
      120 minute sessions in within a week of completing the Baseline assessment. Each counseling&#xD;
      session is audio recorded in order for investigators to test for fidelity and adherence to&#xD;
      the culturally adapted therapy.&#xD;
