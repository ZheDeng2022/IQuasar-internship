  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates hepatitis B virus replication through the bile acids&#xD;
      pathway. EYP001a is a selective, synthetic FXR agonist under development for the treatment of&#xD;
      hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1 study is designed primarily to evaluate the single ascending dose (SAD) followed&#xD;
      by a multiple ascending dose (MAD) safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of EYP001a in&#xD;
      healthy male subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Healthy male subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive EYP001a or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SAD part, up to 6 cohorts will receive EYP001a single doses of 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg,&#xD;
      250 mg, 500 mg, and 800 mg. In the MAD part, 4 cohorts will receive EYP001a doses of 60, 120,&#xD;
      250 and 500 mg, once daily for 14 days over 15-day period. Each cohort will include 6 active&#xD;
      &amp; 2 placebo subjects. Dose escalation will depend on evaluation of safety parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will include up to 21-day screening period followed by dosing period (1 to 15&#xD;
      days). A follow-up evaluation will occur at 6 ± 2 days post final dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring adverse events, laboratory values, ECG&#xD;
      parameters, and vital signs.&#xD;
