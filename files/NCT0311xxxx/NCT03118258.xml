  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year, in France, 3 000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 1 000 die each&#xD;
      year. Recent studies highlighted regional, social and economical inequalities with respect to&#xD;
      cervical cancer incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, the pap-smear test is currently the reference test in order to screen for cervical&#xD;
      cancer and neoplasia (CIN). Screening and treatment reduced the incidence and the mortality&#xD;
      due to cervical cancer by half in the two last decades. That said, many women are still not&#xD;
      reached by prevention programs, especially women living in precarious conditions. In 2013,&#xD;
      Doctors of the World France estimated that almost 70% of women aged 25 to 65 years old&#xD;
      visiting its medical facilities had never had of a pap-smear test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the proportion of individuals with abnormal cytology across two screening&#xD;
      strategies in order to determine which strategy detects a greater proportion of individuals&#xD;
      with abnormal cytology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two strategies consist of a preventive consultation followed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Direct patient referral for Pap smear testing in a partner health facility ('Pap smear'&#xD;
           study arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An invitation to perform a self-collected vaginal swab for HPV-HR testing followed by&#xD;
           patient referral for Pap smear testing in a partner health facility if the HPV-HR test&#xD;
           is positive* ('self-collected vaginal swab for HPV-HR testing + Pap smear triage' study&#xD;
           arm) *A women who tests negative for HPV-HR can still be referred for further Pap smear&#xD;
           testing, or can be referred for a gynaecological consultation for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First of secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the proportion of individuals who completed cervical cancer screening in each&#xD;
      study arm in order to determine which strategy resulted in greater screening participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above clarification of the study objectives and the related changes in the study&#xD;
      protocole have been approved by the Comité de Protection des Personnes Ile de France IV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Woman aged 25 to 65 years old met within one of Doctors of the World participating programs&#xD;
      will be offered to attend a preventive consultation adressing sexual and reproductive health,&#xD;
      and cervical cancer screening. Seven programs are taking part in this study (medical&#xD;
      facilities and mobile health programs) in four french cities. Those programs aim to&#xD;
      facilitate access to care for people who do not seek or have little access to health services&#xD;
      and preventive health measures (lack of health insurance, living far from health services,&#xD;
      knowing little about preventive health and how the health system works in France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two cervical screening strategies consist of a preventive consultation followed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Direct patient referral for Pap smear testing in a partner health facility ('Pap smear'&#xD;
           study arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An invitation to perform a self-collected vaginal swab for HPV-HR testing followed by&#xD;
           patient referral for Pap smear testing in a partner health facility if the HPV-HR test&#xD;
           is positive* ('self-collected vaginal swab for HPV-HR testing + Pap smear triage' study&#xD;
           arm) * A women who tests negative for HPV-HR can still be referred for further Pap smear&#xD;
           testing, or can be referred for a gynaecological consultation for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion of participants in one or the other study arm will be done through&#xD;
      randomization. There will be 11 one-month periods during wich women are invited to perform a&#xD;
      self-collected vaginal swab and 11 one-month periods during which women are directly referred&#xD;
      to a partner health facility for Pap smear testing. Each one-month period with an invitation&#xD;
      to perform a self-collected vaginal swab is followed by a one-month period with direct&#xD;
      patient referral for Pap smear testing. The allocation of the starting period has been&#xD;
      randomized for each participating program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors of the World staff who will be offering this preventive health consultation received&#xD;
      a specific training adressing sexual and reproductive health topics, cervical screening and&#xD;
      counseling approaches. Illustrated tools have been specially developed for this purpose.&#xD;
      Professional translators will be sought when needed.&#xD;
