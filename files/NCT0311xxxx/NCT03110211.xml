      Purpose and Objective: To determine the effectiveness of a physical therapist first versus a&#xD;
      primary care physician first for patients entering a primary care setting with a&#xD;
      musculoskeletal complaint on the outcomes of costs/charges, utilization and healthcare&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study activities and population group: This will be a randomized clinical trial enrolling&#xD;
      patients who are seeking care to the Duke Outpatient Clinic with a musculoskeletal complaint.&#xD;
      Patients, adults aged 18 years or greater, that agree to be part of the study will be&#xD;
      randomized to see a physical therapist first or primary care physician first. All aspects of&#xD;
      the evaluation and treatment by both providers will be standard care for musculoskeletal&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and risk/safety issues: Descriptive data including means and standard&#xD;
      deviations and counts and proportions of baseline scores will be conducted. Differences in&#xD;
      total costs/charges, opioid prescriptions, emergency department visits will be calculated and&#xD;
      tested across groups. Participants may not personally be helped by taking part in this study.&#xD;
      Participants may experience improvements in pain, function, or other symptoms from physical&#xD;
      therapy program in this study. There is a minimal risk of loss of confidentiality. If a&#xD;
      patient chooses not to participate, there will be no effect on their medical treatment and&#xD;
      the study team will cease contact.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness an initial evaluation by a physical therapist compared to a primary care&#xD;
      provider for patients with a musculoskeletal (MSK) complaint entering a primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background &amp; Significance: MSK Conditions in Primary Care are Prevalent: More than 50% of the&#xD;
      US population reported MSK conditions in 2011. The increase number of people over the age of&#xD;
      65 years will continue to increase the number of people with MSK conditions and increase&#xD;
      demands on the health care system. The US healthcare system is already facing numerous&#xD;
      challenges and care inefficiencies. Care for MSK conditions in primary care is an important&#xD;
      area for care redesign to reduce inefficiencies. About 85% of people with MSK conditions have&#xD;
      at least one visit with a primary care provider (PCP) and average six visits a year.&#xD;
      Although, clinical guidelines recommend physical therapy as front-line care for MSK&#xD;
      conditions, referrals to physical therapy for evaluation and management are disproportionate&#xD;
      to the number in need. Uptake of these clinical guidelines is slow; yet advanced imaging and&#xD;
      prescriptions for opioids for MSK pain is common. There was a 142% increase in the number of&#xD;
      prescription medications filled by people with MSK conditions from 2009-2011. Overuse of&#xD;
      opioids and advanced imaging and underuse of physical therapy can be deviated with novel care&#xD;
      models that include physical therapists (PT) as frontline providers to where downstream&#xD;
      healthcare utilization and costs are reduced and patients' needs are more directly met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coordinated care models can impact outcomes for prevalent conditions in primary care but data&#xD;
      on MSK conditions is lacking: The high prevalence of depression among patients seeking&#xD;
      primary care led to new models of integrated care. Co-location, for example, has proven&#xD;
      successful for PCP and mental-health services, where it has almost doubled the rate of&#xD;
      guideline based care, facilitating collaboration and referral due to proximity of specialized&#xD;
      services. The current standard for primary care and patient-centered medical homes (PCMH) is&#xD;
      for patients with MSK-related pain or complaints to be seen and evaluated by a PCP and then&#xD;
      be recommended for advanced diagnostic imaging, opioids, or referral to PT at an offsite&#xD;
      location (sometimes considered the medical neighborhood). Referral to an offsite location may&#xD;
      negatively impact care continuity, provider communication and collaboration, and result in&#xD;
      lower patient satisfaction from de-fragmented care and overuse of unnecessary services and&#xD;
      prescription medication. Our approach to integrated and co-located PT could significantly&#xD;
      decrease healthcare costs, improve patient satisfaction with care, decrease &quot;no-show&quot; PT&#xD;
      rates and decrease physician burnout (by improving collaboration and satisfaction). In turn,&#xD;
      changing mainstream MSK care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; Procedures: This is a one-year randomized clinical trial of a novel health system&#xD;
      redesign to study the immediate effect of a physical therapist first versus a primary care&#xD;
      provider first for MSK conditions within a single primary care setting, the Duke Outpatient&#xD;
      Clinic (DOC), at Duke University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: This study will have two levels of randomization. Our biostatistician will&#xD;
      generate the randomization schedule using a computerized random number generator with equal&#xD;
      allocation to both groups for both levels of randomization. The investigators will use&#xD;
      Redcap's Randomization Module to implement randomization scheme after consent to randomize&#xD;
      appointments via phone. The first level consists of randomization to a Physical Therapist or&#xD;
      Primary Care Physician as front line provider, both are considered standard of care&#xD;
      approaches. The research coordinator will coordinate all randomization who will be blinded to&#xD;
      the primary outcomes data collection. The second level of randomization will occur in the&#xD;
      Primary Care Physician arm of the study. In this arm, if the Primary Care Physician decides&#xD;
      physical therapy is medically necessary then the participant will be randomized to either be&#xD;
      evaluated by an onsite Physical Therapist or receive a referral to be evaluated by an offsite&#xD;
      Physical Therapist at a location of their choosing which is the current model of care at the&#xD;
      DOC. This second level of randomization is so that the investigators can determine if&#xD;
      physical therapy outcomes provided onsite are better when compared to offsite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants that meet eligibility and following informed consent by the research&#xD;
      coordinator, measures about demographics and health status will be completed. Patients&#xD;
      assigned to the physical therapist first group will receive an evaluation by a licensed&#xD;
      physical therapist onsite at the Duke Outpatient Clinic and be provided with a treatment plan&#xD;
      of care for their MSK complaint(s). This evaluation and treatment plan of care will follow&#xD;
      standard care currently implemented in clinical practice. Patients may return to the DOC for&#xD;
      follow-up treatments if the physical therapist deems this treatment to be medically&#xD;
      necessary. Patients assigned to the primary care provider group will receive an initial&#xD;
      evaluation from a licensed primary care provider onsite. The evaluation by the primary care&#xD;
      provider will follow standard care for evaluating MSK complaints in primary care. During the&#xD;
      evaluation, the primary care provider may decide to refer to physical therapy or not for the&#xD;
      patients with a MSK complaint. If the primary care provider refers to physical therapy the&#xD;
      patient will be randomly assigned to either see the physical therapist onsite at the DOC or&#xD;
      be assigned a referral to an offsite physical therapy clinic of the patients choosing with&#xD;
      the assistance of the research coordinator. If the primary care provider decides that&#xD;
      physical therapy is not medically necessary, the patient will follow the usual plan of care&#xD;
      and treatment recommendations provided by their primary care provider. Following the visit,&#xD;
      with either the physical therapist or primary care provider, the research coordinator will&#xD;
      ask the patient to complete a short patient satisfaction survey about the initial visit. At&#xD;
      approximately 3-months later the research coordinator will contact all enrolled patients by&#xD;
      phone to collect health status questions and satisfaction with healthcare. Also, at 3-months&#xD;
      outcomes related to total and MSK costs/charges will be collected by Duke University Health&#xD;
      System Finance, outcomes of opioid prescriptions and emergency department visits during the&#xD;
      3-month period will be collected by electronic health record / administrative data (DEDUCE)&#xD;
      and appointments to physical therapy that were referred offsite will be collect by&#xD;
      administrative data from the Department of Physical Therapy / Occupational Therapy. The&#xD;
      investigators will also collect, by electronic health record, usual care measures of&#xD;
      functional status. The study will end following the 3-month follow-up phone call and outcomes&#xD;
      and data are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions: All aspects related to physical therapy care are based on standard care&#xD;
      provided by physical therapists for MSK complaints. Current practice at the Duke Outpatient&#xD;
      Clinic consists of an onsite physical therapist to provide examinations, onsite exercise and&#xD;
      home based exercise programs, and pain control education. Our planned study will consist of&#xD;
      two interventions, both of which are standard care, however the investigators are modifying&#xD;
      the order of when a patient may be seen by a physical therapist for a MSK complaint within&#xD;
      the primary care setting. Our two interventions are physical therapist first or primary care&#xD;
      provider first. The primary care provider first model may utilize the onsite physical&#xD;
      therapist to provide physical therapy care by referral, known as the co-located primary care&#xD;
      provider to physical therapist model, or utilize physical therapy by offsite referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Therapist First. This model builds upon our current clinical model of a physical&#xD;
      therapist co-located within the Duke Outpatient Clinic. This physical therapist has their own&#xD;
      assigned treatment room, are known to the front desk scheduling staff for scheduling&#xD;
      follow-up appointments, attend staff meetings and events and are considered a provider within&#xD;
      the DOC system. Full support for their co-location is provided by the administration of the&#xD;
      DOC and the Department of Physical and Occupational Therapy. The utilization of physical&#xD;
      therapy services is considered standard care; however, the timing of services is unique given&#xD;
      their co-location. This allows prompt access to not only physical therapy evaluation (billing&#xD;
      for services occurs) but consultation with primary care provider (contact note for&#xD;
      consultation in patients' medical records). For the current study, the investigators will&#xD;
      utilize this already co-located physical therapist to be a front-line provider for&#xD;
      musculoskeletal complaints of patients seeking care at the DOC. The physical therapist&#xD;
      evaluation will be standard care for all patients seeking care to a physical therapist. It&#xD;
      will not be modified in any way for the purposes of the study. If, at any time during&#xD;
      evaluation the physical therapist determines that the patient would benefit from an&#xD;
      additional primary care provider assessment, the patient will be scheduled for a primary care&#xD;
      provider assessment, which may happen immediately following the physical therapist&#xD;
      evaluation. In our experience these referrals from the physical therapist to primary care&#xD;
      provider can occur within the same day, which adds considerable value to the efficiency of&#xD;
      the integrated physical therapy model for those patients in need of additional primary care&#xD;
      provider assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Care Provider First. In this model, patients would have an initial assessment from&#xD;
      the primary care provider, which is considered standard care. If the primary care provider&#xD;
      deems that the patient should be referred for physical therapy for medically necessary&#xD;
      treatment, the research coordinator will randomly assign physical therapy referral to the&#xD;
      onsite physical therapist at the Duke Outpatient Clinic or to an offsite location. The&#xD;
      research coordinator will assist with scheduling and track referrals and all outcome data for&#xD;
      patients referred offsite. In some cases, the primary care provider will not refer to&#xD;
      physical therapy. In this case, the patients will follow the care recommendations provided by&#xD;
      the primary care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis &amp; Statistical Considerations: The investigators will calculate differences in&#xD;
      total and MSK specific costs and charges between the physical therapist first group and the&#xD;
      primary care provider group using standard T-tests or tests of medians depending on the&#xD;
      distribution of data (parametric vs. non-parametric). The investigators will also calculate&#xD;
      differences in the number of opioid prescriptions and emergency department visits between the&#xD;
      two groups using chi-square categorical data analysis. The investigators will calculate&#xD;
      changes in already routinely collected disease specific measures stored in electronic health&#xD;
      record. Physical therapy missed appointments, patient and provider satisfaction will be&#xD;
      reported as descriptive data. The investigators will also explore differences in outcomes of&#xD;
      cost/charges, opioid prescriptions, emergency department visits and missed appointments&#xD;
      between onsite provided physical therapy to offsite physical therapy.&#xD;
