    <textblock>
      The aims of this project are: to investigate the impact of VLCD on control of muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis, muscle structure and function, cardiac function (ejection fraction), vascular&#xD;
      function (blood flow and capillary function), overall physiology status (cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      function) and metabolic status (insulin sensitivity) in overweight and obese middle-aged male&#xD;
      with or without exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 groups for the study, to which each participant will be randomly assigned into&#xD;
      one of either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. VLCD only&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. VLCD with resistance exercise training (RET)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. VLCD with high intensity interval training (HIIT) The total duration of the intervention&#xD;
           is six weeks, with exercises taking place three times per week at the research unit&#xD;
           under close supervision by trained staff.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent interest has emerged on the role of hypoenergetic very low calorie diets (VLCD) in&#xD;
      managing overweight and obese people with or without type 2 diabetes. However, VLCD results&#xD;
      in 20-30% of mass lost as lean body mass (LBM) besides adipose tissue. Since LBM in the form&#xD;
      of skeletal muscle plays an important role for maintaining whole-body metabolic health and&#xD;
      represents a vast protein store, better understanding of the mechanisms of VLCD induced&#xD;
      weight loss is very important. In a recent systematic review, the investigators observed that&#xD;
      information on the subject is scarce. Early studies with VLCD, using poor quality protein&#xD;
      supplements showed that VLCD was associated with an increased risk of adverse mortality&#xD;
      outcome mainly due to cardiac muscle atrophy. Although current VLCDs are safer, concerns&#xD;
      regarding preservation of LBM persist. This is because, in middle-aged (and older) people who&#xD;
      are already suffering the early stages of sarcopenia at approximately 0.5-1%/y from the age&#xD;
      of ~40y, VLCD may result in additional significant muscle mass loss. Low muscle mass,&#xD;
      especially in older individuals is associated with increased mortality, dynapenia (reduced&#xD;
      muscle function) and numerous metabolic conditions. Exercises remain the most effective means&#xD;
      by which to maintain and increase muscle mass through stimulation of muscle protein synthesis&#xD;
      (MPS). Although studies have shown that losses of LBM during a VLCD can be attenuated with&#xD;
      the inclusion of resistance exercise training (RET) [5], the mechanism by which VLCD (with&#xD;
      and without exercise) effects MPS is poorly defined. The investigators also know now that&#xD;
      high intensity interval training (HIIT) improves LBM, cardiac and metabolic function, yet no&#xD;
      study has clarified the outcome of HIIT with VLCD on MPS and LBM. The investigators will&#xD;
      investigate the different effects of VLCD with RET, VLCD with HIIT, and VLCD alone on MPS and&#xD;
      overall metabolic function in overweight middle-aged males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to investigate the impact of VLCD on MPS, insulin sensitivity, muscle&#xD;
      structure and function (strength), cardiopulmonary fitness in overweight and obese&#xD;
      middle-aged adults with or without RET or HIIT. The investigators hypothesised that VLCD will&#xD;
      impair MPS and slightly reduce muscle thickness and function, and cardiopulmonary fitness,&#xD;
      while exercises will improve MPS and muscle structure and function. All group will show&#xD;
      overall improve in insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve 36 overweight (and obese) male (BMI 27-50kg/m2) subjects aged 30-60y.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomised into one of 3 groups (12 each) following baseline investigations&#xD;
      and prior to starting interventions: 1) VLCD; 2) VLCD + RET; 3) VLCD + HIIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be excluded if they have evidence of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in a formal exercise regime&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active cardiovascular disease: uncontrolled hypertension (BP &gt; 180/110), angina, heart&#xD;
           failure (class III/IV), arrhythmia, right to left cardiac shunt, recent cardiac event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cerebrovascular disease: previous stroke, aneurysm (large vessel or intracranial),&#xD;
           epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory disease including: pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
           disease (COPD), severe uncontrolled asthma,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active inflammatory bowel or renal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clotting dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Musculoskeletal or neurological disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history of early (&lt;55y) death from cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known sensitivity/ allergy to contrast Sonovue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other ongoing acute or significant chronic medical condition that is not mentioned&#xD;
           above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight &gt;120kg -weight limit for dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan All subjects&#xD;
           will undergo a full medical screening before being enrolled into the study. This&#xD;
           screening will involve measures of height and weight, medical history and physical&#xD;
           examination, blood tests (for fasting FBC's, U&amp;E's, LFT's, TFT's, glucose, HbA1C, lipid&#xD;
           profiles and coagulation), and ECG. Abnormal screening results will be discussed with&#xD;
           the subject and their General Practitioner (GP) will be informed appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject who meets inclusion criteria will be enrolled and randomised to one of the 3 groups&#xD;
      (outlined above) and invited to attend for baseline investigations (before intervention).&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to fast from midnight (except clear water) prior to attending their&#xD;
      first day of investigations: DAY(-4). On this day, baseline investigations will include a DXA&#xD;
      scan, fasting specimen (blood glucose, saliva, muscle and fat) collection, vascular&#xD;
      ultrasound scans (flow mediated dilation (FMD), leg blood flow (LBF)), and an oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test (OGTT) with 2-Deoxyglucose (2DOG) tracer infusion to assess glucose uptake and&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity. The muscle biopsy will be repeated after the 2DOG infusion, followed by&#xD;
      leg ultrasound scans to assess muscle structure. A standard lunch will be provided in the&#xD;
      afternoon. A cardiac echocardiogram (ECHO) will be performed to assess cardiac function&#xD;
      followed by ultrasound scan (USS) of dominant thigh muscles (for pennation angle, thickness,&#xD;
      fascicle length) and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to determine maximal aerobic&#xD;
      capacity and set the load for the HIIT training (Watt Max, where applicable). A loading dose&#xD;
      of deuterium oxide (D2O) and D3 creatine tracer solutions will then be given. Before leaving,&#xD;
      subjects will be supplied with 3-Methylhistidine (3MH) tracer solution to be taken 2 days&#xD;
      later DAY(-2), plus daily 'top-ups' of D2O (all tracer amounts based on body weight). Saliva&#xD;
      bottles for daily saliva collection (3 hours after daily D2O top up, to be stored in the&#xD;
      fridge) and containers for urine collection for D3 creatine assessment (daily urine sample&#xD;
      collection for 3 days in containers begin with 24-hour urine collection, then spot urine at&#xD;
      30h, 48h and 72h) for muscle mass assessment will also be provided. After consuming 3MH on&#xD;
      DAY(-2), subjects will then attend our unit the next day (DAY(-1)) in the morning, fasted&#xD;
      from midnight (except clear water). Hourly blood samples for 6 hours to measure 3MH levels&#xD;
      (the first sample to be taken 20-24 hours after 3MH ingestion) and contrast enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound (CEUS) will be done. Following this, baseline muscle strength/ function will be&#xD;
      assessed; 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) assessment on 6 (3 upper body, 3 lower body) exercises&#xD;
      and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of leg extension. After this visit subjects will&#xD;
      begin their intervention period (DAY 1) according to their group. All groups will have a&#xD;
      6-week intervention period of nutritional intervention in the form of LighterLife VLCD meal&#xD;
      replacement diets: 4 meals/day providing 600kcal/d with 100% recommended daily allowance&#xD;
      (RDA) vitamins and minerals. For RET group, the exercise format will be 2 sets of 12&#xD;
      repetitions at 70% 1-RM for each muscle group with 1-2 minutes rest between sets after a&#xD;
      prescribed warm-up 3 sessions/week. The exercises will involve upper and lower body exercises&#xD;
      and will be progressive in nature with muscle strength assessed every ~14 days to ensure that&#xD;
      the intensity of training remains constant throughout. In the HIIT group, it will be 3&#xD;
      sessions/week, involving 60s high intensity cycling at 95-125% Watt Max, with 90s recovery,&#xD;
      for 5 cycles, with 2 minutes warm up and cool down. All subjects will have blood samples&#xD;
      (including 3MH tracer) and muscle/ fat biopsies every 3 weeks. DXA scan, ultrasound&#xD;
      measurements (vascular and muscle), D3 creatine assessment, 2DOG infusion, OGTT (as explained&#xD;
      above), CPET, MVC, muscle strength assessment will be performed before and after the 6-week&#xD;
      intervention period. Subjects will be collecting saliva daily into saliva bottles. The&#xD;
      collections will be kept in fridge and will be sent to our unit 3 times/week for exercise&#xD;
      group (during exercise sessions), and once a week for VLCD only group. Diet diary and&#xD;
      physical activity (Actiheart Monitor) also will be monitored (for 4-5 days) before and during&#xD;
      interventions, which should include weekend measurement.&#xD;
