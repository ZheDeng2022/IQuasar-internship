      Pemetrexed in combination with erlotinib as a salvage treatment in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      biliary tract cancer (BTC) who failed gemcitabine containing chemotherapy&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) is rare in the Europe and the United States, but not uncommon&#xD;
      in Asia and Latin America. The tumor arises from the ductular epithelium of the biliary tree&#xD;
      within the liver (intrahepatic), the extrahepatic ducts (extrahepatic), or the gallbladder.&#xD;
      Intrahepatic cancer is steadily increasing in the Western world. BTCs carry a poor prognosis&#xD;
      with 1-year survival rate of 25%. Although surgery remains the only curative treatment for&#xD;
      BTC, most patients present with advanced disease and die within a few months of diagnosis.&#xD;
      While a combination of gemcitabine and platinum agents seems to be a conclusive treatment&#xD;
      option as first-line treatment until now, the role or the optimal regimen for second-line&#xD;
      treatment has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pemetrexed, a multitarget antifolate which inhibits thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate&#xD;
      reductase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase, was approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      lung cancer and mesothelioma. In addition to its therapeutic efficacy, pemetrexed has&#xD;
      tolerable safety profile and is considered as important therapeutic option for patients of&#xD;
      poor performance statue or older age. Pemetrexed was studied in combination with gemcitabine&#xD;
      in BTC patients and needs further research in BTC patients. Erlotinib is EGFR tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor. In BTC and pancreatic cancer, erlotinib showed prolonged survival in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy. Moreover, the addition of erlotinib to gemcitabine and oxaliplatin showed&#xD;
      antitumour activity in our previous phase III trial. And combination of pemetrexed and&#xD;
      erlotinib showed tolerable safety profile in lung cancer trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So we plan this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed in combination with&#xD;
      erlotinib as a second line treatment in biliary tract cancer&#xD;
