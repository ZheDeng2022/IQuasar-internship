      The purpose of this study is to better understand the linkages between family health history&#xD;
      (FHH) and genomics in a Singaporean population. Secondly this study will evaluate the&#xD;
      facilitators and barriers to implementation of a family history collection and risk&#xD;
      assessment tool within a Singaporean population.&#xD;

      This study is a collaboration between Duke University School of Medicine Center for Applied&#xD;
      Genomics and Precision Medicine (CAGPM) and the National Heart Center of Singapore (NHCS) and&#xD;
      SingHealth Duke-NUS Center for Precision Medicine (PRISM). The NHCS study, Molecular and&#xD;
      Imaging Studies of Cardiovascular Health and Disease (&quot;Biobank study&quot;) is collecting genomic,&#xD;
      clinical, and environmental data on a large cohort of healthy Singaporean volunteers. Data&#xD;
      from the Biobank study is being deposited into a large healthy population cohort database,&#xD;
      SPECTRA, organized under PRISM. The investigators will collaborate with the NHCS Biobank&#xD;
      study and PRISM to integrate the Duke family history risk assessment platform, MeTree, into&#xD;
      the data collection of the Biobank study cohort for in-depth analyses of FHH and genomic&#xD;
      associations as well as exploration of the feasibility of MeTree implementation into the&#xD;
      Singaporean clinical context. The Biobank study is a prospective observational study. It has&#xD;
      already enrolled 1,000 subjects and will continue enrollment over the next year and possibly&#xD;
      beyond. Previously enrolled subjects will be re-contacted for completion of MeTree as well as&#xD;
      having future enrollees complete the tool prospectively. The investigators anticipate 5,000&#xD;
      subjects completing MeTree over a one-year period. The investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and effectiveness of implementing MeTree in the larger Singaporean context. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess implementation related outcomes- questions/problems people have&#xD;
      when completing their family histories, how complete are the FHH entered, what types of risk&#xD;
      are identified and what existing programs in Singapore are designed to manage that risk. The&#xD;
      completion of this project will provide a significant amount of data to better understand the&#xD;
      associations between FHH and genomic data within a healthy Asian population. It also will&#xD;
      result in a better understanding of an appropriate implementation strategy for MeTree within&#xD;
      the Singaporean clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To explore the correlation of genomic data and FHH within a healthy Asian&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To assess the clinical utility and appropriateness of a patient-entered FHH&#xD;
      risk assessment tool within a Singaporean population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To create an implementation strategy for broader implementation of a&#xD;
      patient-driven risk assessment tool in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duke University will be providing access to the MeTree Family Health History tool, storage of&#xD;
      the PRISM participant data, participant and provider risk assessment reports, and education&#xD;
      about the tool to PRISM study staff as needed. Duke University personnel will not be involved&#xD;
      in any recruiting, consenting, or follow-up with study participants, but will have access to&#xD;
      de-identified participant data housed in the MeTree research database in order to provide&#xD;
      support for the study coordinators for participant account trouble-shooting and also to&#xD;
      provide interim and final datasets to the PRISM statisticians. The MeTree research database&#xD;
      currently sits on a DHTS server behind the Duke firewall, and is maintained and secure in&#xD;
      accordance with Duke policy for patient data.&#xD;
