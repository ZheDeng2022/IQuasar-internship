  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy versus&#xD;
      extended dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following 12-month of DAPT in patients undergoing&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bioresorbable scaffold (BRS)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the development of second generation drug-eluting stent (DES), clinical outcomes&#xD;
      including in-stent restenosis have been dramatically improved in patients with coronary&#xD;
      artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with bare metal&#xD;
      stent or first generation DES era. However, interventional cardiologist still concern about&#xD;
      late adverse cardiac events including stent thrombosis (ST) in patients who received&#xD;
      implantation of permanent metallic stent. Bioresorbable scaffold (BRS) have been developed to&#xD;
      provide mechanical support and drug-delivery function similar to those of DES for&#xD;
      approximately 1 year, followed by complete bioresorption over several years. It has the&#xD;
      advantages of reducing the risk of late ST and maintaining of normal vascular function&#xD;
      because these novel devices are expected to leave no permanent materials within the vessel.&#xD;
      Although there was no significant difference from previous randomized controlled studies for&#xD;
      evaluating the clinical outcomes at 1-year between BRS and DES, recently documented ARSORB II&#xD;
      trial, which compared 3-year outcomes between BRS and DES, show that patients treated with&#xD;
      BRS had a higher risk of device-oriented composite endpoint mainly driven by target vessel&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (MI) compared to those with DES. In addition, in several case reports,&#xD;
      the late ST after discontinuation of dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) was reported in&#xD;
      patients who underwent BRS implantation. Therefore, the efficacy of extended DAPT and needs&#xD;
      for optimal DAPT duration in patients treated with BRS have been emerged. In the DAPT study,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial including approximately 10,000 patients, DAPT beyond 1 year after&#xD;
      placement of a DES, as compared with aspirin therapy alone, significantly reduced the risks&#xD;
      of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and ST. However, extend&#xD;
      use of DAPT increases bleeding risk and cost. Endoscopic, dental, and surgical procedures are&#xD;
      often delayed due to extended DAPT, which may affect the patient's quality of life. In&#xD;
      addition, there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between extended DAPT&#xD;
      and aspirin monotherapy in the DAPT study because of increased bleeding risk in extended DAPT&#xD;
      group. Therefore, to determine the optimal or minimal necessary duration of DAPT is very&#xD;
      important. The other important issue is that which antiplatelet agent is more appropriate&#xD;
      after DAPT. In CAPRIE (Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events)&#xD;
      trial, clopidogrel showed a superior efficacy in preventing ischemic events compared with&#xD;
      aspirin and the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly lower with&#xD;
      clopidogrel than with aspirin. Moreover, clopidogrel monotherapy was associated with a&#xD;
      reduced risk of ischemic events without increased bleeding risk compared with aspirin&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients receiving DES after 12-month DAPT. However, current guidelines still&#xD;
      recommend aspirin monotherapy after 6-12 months of DAPT in patients treated with DES, there&#xD;
      were no data for evaluating the optimal duration of DAPT and preferred choice of monotherapy&#xD;
      in patients treated with BRS. Through results of previous studies, the authors postulated&#xD;
      that P2Y12 antagonist monotherapy, which might have superior ability to prevent ischemic&#xD;
      event compared to aspirin monotherapy, had similar risk of ischemic events with lower risk of&#xD;
      bleeding complication compared with extended DAPT in patients who received BRS implantation&#xD;
      with 12-month DAPT. Therefore, in the SMART-CHOICE II trial, we will test noninferiority of&#xD;
      P2Y12 antagonist monotherapy compared with aspirin plus P2Y12 antagonist after 12-month of&#xD;
      DAPT in patients treated with BRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification: presence of diabetes mellitus, clinical presentation (acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome), type of P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor), and investigational center.&#xD;
