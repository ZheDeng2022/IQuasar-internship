      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some blood and immune disorders can be helped with HSCT. This is allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation. The person who gets the stem cells has their immune system&#xD;
      suppressed. This is done to help prevent their body from rejecting the transplant. During&#xD;
      this time, the person is at a high risk to get viral infections. Researchers want to study&#xD;
      the records of people who had transplants a few years ago. They want to look at how often&#xD;
      certain viral complications happened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how often certain viral complications occurred after HSCT and what risks factors&#xD;
      were involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records will be reviewed. No participants will be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will review medical records from the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The records will be from people who had HSCT between 2010 and 2015 when they were between 4&#xD;
      and 85 years old. They already gave consent for their data to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital statistics like age and sex&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral status of the recipient and donor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reason for transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant details&#xD;
&#xD;
      How the immune system recovered after transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the recipient got graft versus host disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival&#xD;

      This protocol is a retrospective chart review of patients who have underwent hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at the NIH Clinical Center. If this proposal is approved,&#xD;
      BTRIS will identify and populate the patients in these protocols, and BTRIS identified&#xD;
      reports will be used going forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BTRIS identified reports will be used to review patient progress notes, all aspects of the&#xD;
      transplant platform, as well as viral titers over the course of each patient s follow-up,&#xD;
      supplemented by review of paper or CRIS electronic medical records as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve review of patient records and will not use specimens or participant&#xD;
      contact. The participants whose records will be reviewed in this protocol were enrolled in&#xD;
      NIH protocols between 2010 and December 1, 2020. BTRIS policy requires approval from&#xD;
      Principal Investigators on certain protocols. These Principal Investigators have been&#xD;
      contacted via email for permission to conduct this study and have verified that none of the&#xD;
      original protocols or informed consent documents precludes such a review of clinical data.&#xD;
