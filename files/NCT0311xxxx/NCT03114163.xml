      This is a German, observational study in adult participants diagnosed with squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) progressing on or after platinum-based therapy, who&#xD;
      start a new systemic therapy with nivolumab in 1st line (cohort 2) or ≥2nd line (cohort 1)&#xD;
      for the first time, and are treated within the market authorization approval. Participants&#xD;
      are to be enrolled into the study no earlier than the decision to initiate treatment with&#xD;
      nivolumab and no later than the first dose of nivolumab treatment.&#xD;

        The study will enroll adult participants who are at least 18 years of age at the time of&#xD;
        the treatment decision, with the diagnosis of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck&#xD;
        (SCCHN) (either initial diagnosis or during later course histologically or cytologically&#xD;
        confirmed). It is mandatory that the physician has already decided to initiate a treatment&#xD;
        with nivolumab as 1st line or ≥2nd line therapy for the first time for the treatment of&#xD;
        SCCHN, according to the label approved in Germany.&#xD;

        - Adult participants (at least 18 years of age at time of treatment decision)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and participants are&#xD;
             progressing on or after platinum-based therapy, administered for locally advanced,&#xD;
             metastatic or recurrent disease (Cohort 2: prior platinum-based therapy was&#xD;
             administered for locally advanced disease in the adjuvant or primary setting, e.g.&#xD;
             radiotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of SCCHN has been confirmed by histology or cytology (either at initial&#xD;
             diagnosis or any time later during the course of the disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment decision to initiate a treatment with nivolumab for the first time for the&#xD;
             treatment of SCCHN (according to the label approved in Germany) has already been taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current primary diagnosis of a cancer other than SCCHN, ie, a cancer other than SCCHN&#xD;
             or cancer of unknown primary (CUP-syndrome) that requires systemic or other treatment,&#xD;
             or has not been treated curatively (as per discretion of the investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously treated with nivolumab and/or ipilimumab, an anti-PD-1, anti-programmed&#xD;
             death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1), anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody&#xD;
             or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways&#xD;
             (applicable for any indication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently included in an interventional clinical trial for their SCCHN. Participants&#xD;
             who have completed their participation in an interventional trial; or who are not&#xD;
             receiving study drug anymore and who are only followed-up for Overall survival (OS)&#xD;
             can be enrolled&#xD;
