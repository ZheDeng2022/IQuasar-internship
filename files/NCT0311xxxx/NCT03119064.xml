  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New treatments are greatly needed for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Metronomic&#xD;
      temozolomide is a standard treatment option but has, at best, modest activity. The&#xD;
      nanoliposomal irinotecan may be much more active than the parent compound irinotecan since&#xD;
      nanoliposomal irinotecan's ability to cross the blood brain barrier is improved. This phase I&#xD;
      study will establish the MTD of the combination of nanoliposomal irinotecan in combination&#xD;
      with temozolomide safety and preliminary clinical efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      nanoliposomal irinotecan and metronomic temozolomide.&#xD;

      1.1 Primary Objective 1.1.1. To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of nanoliposomal&#xD;
      irinotecan with continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2 To assess the preliminary response rate and progression free survival of nanaliposomal&#xD;
      irinotecan with continuous low-dose temozolomide in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Secondary Objectives 1.2.1 To evaluate the safety of nanoliposomal irinotecan with&#xD;
      continuous low-dose temozolomide.&#xD;

    <description>Three patients will be accrued to level 1. If no dose limiting toxicities are observed following completion of 4 weeks (2 cycles) of treatment then accrual to dose level 2 will proceed (patients must be evaluated prior to their cycle 3 treatment and this will be used to confirm DLTs). If a DLT is observed in one of the first 3 patients in a dose level, then accrual for that level will be expanded to 6 patients. Accrual will continue in this way until the MTD of nanoliposomal irinotecan with temozolomide 50mg/m2/day is determined. Two or more instances of DLT in a cohort of 6 patients will result in the preceding dose level being defined as the MTD. If two or more instances of DLT in a cohort of 6 patients occurs in dose level 1 then dose level -1 of nanoliposomal irinotecan will be investigated. After determination of the MTD, the final cohort will be expanded so that a total of 25 patients are treated on study. The final cohort will be treated at the MTD.</description>
