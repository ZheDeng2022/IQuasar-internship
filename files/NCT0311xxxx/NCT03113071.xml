  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that digoxin can be safely added to decitabine and will increase&#xD;
      the response rates in medically unfit patients with newly diagnosed AML/MDS or those with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory AML/MDS. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the addition of digoxin to&#xD;
      decitabine will result in distinct epigenetic alterations in AML/MDS patients.&#xD;
