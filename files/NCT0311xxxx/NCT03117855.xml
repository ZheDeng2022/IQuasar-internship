    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of capecitabine and Y-90 radioembolization in&#xD;
      treating patients with bile duct cancer in the liver that has spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body and cannot be removed by surgery. Radiation therapy, such as Y-90 radioembolization,&#xD;
      injects tiny radioactive Y-90 microspheres into the blood supply next to the liver tumors to&#xD;
      kill tumor cells. Capecitabine may make radiation more effective. Giving capecitabine and&#xD;
      Y-90 radioembolization may work better in treating patients with bile duct cancer in the&#xD;
      liver.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of capecitabine, to be used in combination with&#xD;
      yttrium Y-90 (yttrium 90) (Y-90) radioembolization (RE), in patients with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the toxicities associated with Y-90 + capecitabine in patients with ICC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To develop a preliminary assessment of efficacy by evaluating liver-specific&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To develop a preliminary assessment of efficacy by evaluating response rate according to&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)/modified RECIST (mRECIST) and the&#xD;
      Europeans Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) imaging criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To develop a preliminary assessment of efficacy by evaluating cancer antigen (CA) 19-9&#xD;
      response and its correlation with imaging markers of tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To develop a preliminary assessment of efficacy by evaluating duration of response in the&#xD;
      liver, as measured by the time for target liver lesions to progress according to&#xD;
      RECIST/mRECIST beyond size at study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To develop a preliminary assessment of efficacy by evaluating rate of conversion to&#xD;
      surgical resection for subjects who are surgically unresectable at presentation due to size&#xD;
      or location of hepatic lesions (excluding subjects with extrahepatic disease or medically&#xD;
      inoperable at presentation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To develop a preliminary assessment of efficacy by evaluating overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo yttrium Y 90 resin microspheres radioembolization over 60-90 minutes on day&#xD;
      1. Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.&#xD;
