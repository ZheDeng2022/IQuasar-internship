    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal, uterine atony accounts for 75-90% of&#xD;
      primary postpartum hemorrhage. The efficacy of the Uterine compression suture in the&#xD;
      treatment of atonic postpartum hemorrhage is time-tested and can be said to be almost&#xD;
      established .The aim of this study was to assess the role of the Mansoura-VV uterine&#xD;
      compression suture as an early intervention in the management of primary atonic postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage.&#xD;

      This prospective observational study was carried out at the Obstetrics and Gynecology&#xD;
      Department Mansoura University Hospital, and private settings in Mansoura, Egypt, during the&#xD;
      period from May 2013 to December 2016. Inclusion criteria included women diagnosed with&#xD;
      primary atonic PPH, during cesarean section when the uterus failed to contract after the&#xD;
      routine doses of uterotonics. Women and their partners were counseled and signed a consent&#xD;
      regarding the technique as an alternative to devascularization or hysterectomy. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria included patients with placenta previa complete or incomplete centrails, and/or&#xD;
      placenta accreta. Also one case of atonic PPH, when the uterus was incompressible and failed&#xD;
      to contract on bimanual compression was excluded from the study, as in our experience these&#xD;
      cases failed to respond to any type of UCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this series, immediately after anesthesia, all women received misoprostol 400 mcg (two&#xD;
      tablets of MisotacR, Adwia Co, 6th October city, Egypt) sublingual, as well as 20 IU of&#xD;
      oxytocin (Syntocinon, Sanofi Aventais, Egypt) in 50 0-mL lactated Ringer's solution as an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion, after delivery of the baby and clamping of the umbilical cord. This is&#xD;
      routine practice for all women undergoing CS in our department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After closure of the uterine incision, uterine atony was diagnosed in 108 women when the&#xD;
      uterus felt soft and flappy, and failed to respond to intermittent fundal massage, the second&#xD;
      dose of the previously mentioned ecbolics was given. Then, bimanual compression of the uterus&#xD;
      was attempted for 10 to 15 minutes until the tone of the uterus is regained as well as to&#xD;
      assess the potential chances of success of the Mansoura-VV uterine compression suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 15 minutes of the diagnosis, the uterus was rechecked to identify any bleeding points.&#xD;
      the investigators performed Mansoura-VV uterine compression suture. The right V was performed&#xD;
      as follow: (i) 100-cm Vicryl no. 1 was thrown to form two nearly equal parts (each 50 cm) on&#xD;
      a blunt semicircular 70-mm needle, the curve of the needle was straightened. (ii) The needle&#xD;
      transfixed the right uterine wall from anterior to posterior, about 2 cm below the&#xD;
      hysterotomy incision and 3 cm from the (this represents the apex of the V suture). (iii)&#xD;
      after transfixation, the Vicryl was divided thus two threads from one transfixation each&#xD;
      50-cm threads penetrated the lower uterine segment; medial (M) and lateral (L) threads, each&#xD;
      has anterior (aL and aM) and posterior (pL and pM) ends in relation to the uterus (iv) The&#xD;
      free anterior and posterior ends of the lateral thread (aL and pL) were tied above the fundus&#xD;
      with three double - throw knots about 3 cm from the right cornual border of the uterus&#xD;
      forming the lateral limb of the V suture. (v) The free anterior and posterior ends of the&#xD;
      medial threads (aM and pM) were tied above the fundus 2-3 cm medial to the lateral limb&#xD;
      completing the V suture . The lead surgeon pulled the suture to provide moderate tension,&#xD;
      while the assistant surgeon lift the uterus upward while perform a bimanual uterine&#xD;
      compression to minimize trauma and to achieve or aid compression during the ligation of each&#xD;
      vertical limb. (vi) using a similar technique, the left V suture was laid on the left side,&#xD;
      and then the VV suture is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vagina was inspected to check for control of bleeding with Mansoura-VV sutures, the&#xD;
      uterus cannot be stretched. Only one case (1/108) required additional bilateral uterine&#xD;
      vessels ligation for control of bleeding, the abdomen was closed routinely. Antibiotics were&#xD;
      given and continued postoperatively for 5 days.&#xD;
