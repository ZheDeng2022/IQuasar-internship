      To apply Bold-fMRI technology to observe and compare the differences of task-related&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the common cerebrovascular diseases. With the improvement of medical&#xD;
      conditions and treatment technology, the death rate of stroke patients has declined, but the&#xD;
      disability rate has increased. In China about 50%-70% of stroke patients have the residual&#xD;
      sequelae such as paralysis, paralalia dysfunction and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemiplegic is the most frequent sequelae in post-stroke patients, finger movements recovery&#xD;
      has already became the most difficult question in all the movement kinematics and dynamics&#xD;
      rehabilitation,which affects the total movement function and ability of daily life in the&#xD;
      patients.The finger recovery is tightly related to the neural plastic and brain function&#xD;
      realignment.Furthermore, whether the special brain movement functional cortex area in&#xD;
      bilateral hemispheres can be effectively activated is the crucial solved link. A number of&#xD;
      recent literature have displayed the special brain motor area including the primary motor&#xD;
      cortex(M1), the supplementary motor area(SMA), the premotor area(PMA), the primary&#xD;
      sensorimotor area(SM1),the secondary area(SM2), the cingulate sulcus area(CMA) and the&#xD;
      cerebellum hemispheres(CB). However，the study on the above-mentioned motor area synchronously&#xD;
      activated when the patients after systematically rehabilitative treatment performed fingers&#xD;
      grasping task was reported rarely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bold-fMRI technology is a new brain functional imaging technology developed on the basis of&#xD;
      MRI in 1990s, which not only retains the anatomical imaging characteristics of ordinary MRI,&#xD;
      but also obtains the physiological information. The emergence of Bold-fMRI technology&#xD;
      provides a new way to study the mechanism, evaluation and prognosis of stroke rehabilitation,&#xD;
      and it shows a good research and clinical application value in the field of rehabilitation&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
