  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: After having a spinal cord injury (SCI), people develop changes in their body&#xD;
      composition that influences their long-term health. Individuals with paralysis after SCI will&#xD;
      have large declines in their bone density ant increases in fat mass which increases their&#xD;
      risk of fracture and heart disease. Therapies to prevent SCI-related changes in body&#xD;
      composition and their health effects are needed. Drugs known as &quot;statins&quot; used often to&#xD;
      reduce high cholesterol, may help to reduce bone loss and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Among adults with SCI for a long time, treatment with a drug named Rosuvastatin&#xD;
      or a sugar pill, with supplements (coenzyme Q10, calcium and vitamin D), for twelve months&#xD;
      can decrease their endocrine metabolic disease risk by increasing bone density and reducing&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A clinical trial will be conducted in Toronto, Ontario and Miami, Florida.&#xD;
      Subjects will get statin therapy or placebo (sugar pill) by chance. Study subjects and&#xD;
      research staff will not know whether they are taking the study drug or a sugar pill until&#xD;
      after the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Fifty-four adults (age 18-60 years) with a long-term SCI and no movement below&#xD;
      their level of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Subjects will be prescribed Rosuvastatin 10 mg daily or a sugar pill. In addition,&#xD;
      all subjects will receive 100 mg of Co-Q10 daily, calcium carbonate 1250 mg and, vitamin D&#xD;
      2,000 IU once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collected: Subjects' bone density will be collected at the start and end of the study.&#xD;
      Change in bone density between the two groups will be compared to see if one is better. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected quarterly to make sure subjects are safe and do not develop&#xD;
      problems with their liver or muscles and to measure the effects of the study drugs on&#xD;
      inflammation throughout the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Implications: Statins may be safe and effective therapy for adults living with SCI&#xD;
      who are at increased risk of endocrine metabolic disease as they age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Individuals with motor-complete spinal cord injury (SCI) undergo dramatic changes&#xD;
      in body composition in the first 18 months post-injury, including declines in bone mineral&#xD;
      density (BMD) that increase lower-extremity fragility fracture risk, and increases in fat&#xD;
      mass that increase cardio-metabolic disease (CMD) risk. While statins are an effective&#xD;
      treatment for dyslipidemia, research evidence suggests additional pleiotropic effects on bone&#xD;
      through promotion of osteogenesis, suppression of osteoblast apoptosis, and inhibition of&#xD;
      osteoclastogenesis. There are currently no effective therapies to treat sublesional&#xD;
      osteoporosis (SLOP) and reduce the risk of fragility fractures in individuals with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Twelve months of statin therapy with concurrent coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), to reduce&#xD;
      risk of statin neuromyotoxicity, and standard care (calcium 1250mg OD and vitamin D3 2000IU&#xD;
      OD) will be superior to placebo with CoQ10 and standard care, for augmenting knee region BMD&#xD;
      and reducing inflammatory stress (hs-CRP), thereby reducing endocrine metabolic disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of statin therapy for augmenting distal&#xD;
      femoral BMD among adults with chronic motor-complete SCI in Toronto, Ontario and Miami,&#xD;
      Florida.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Multi-centre, double-blind, randomized controlled Phase II safety and efficacy&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Consenting men and premenopausal women (N=54, age 18-60 yrs) with chronic (≥2&#xD;
      years) spinal cord injury with a neurological level between C1-T10 and an AIS category of&#xD;
      A/B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Rosuvastatin 10 mg po daily at night versus placebo for 12 months. All subjects&#xD;
      will receive osteoporosis standard care (calcium carbonate 1250mg po daily and vitamin D3&#xD;
      2000 IU po daily) to maintain bone mass and CoQ10 100mg po daily to prevent statin-induced&#xD;
      myopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Primary safety outcomes: i) establish the safety of rosuvastatin in chronic SCI by&#xD;
      reporting the frequency of myotoxicity and type II diabetes onset; ii) frequency and mean&#xD;
      duration of liver transaminase elevations in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups. Primary&#xD;
      efficacy outcome: measure the mean between group absolute changes in distal femur areal BMD&#xD;
      (aBMD, g/cm2) from baseline to one year. Secondary efficacy outcomes: will examine the mean&#xD;
      absolute changes from baseline in: i) volumetric BMD (vBMD, g/cm3); ii) markers of bone&#xD;
      turnover - Bone Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BALP), telopeptide (CTX), Sclerostin and RANK&#xD;
      Ligand (RANK-L); iii) serum inflammatory markers including high sensitivity C-reactive&#xD;
      Protein (hs-CRP), Interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß). interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor - alpha&#xD;
      (TNF-alpha), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); and, iv) lipid profile; low density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides, and&#xD;
      total cholesterol Clinical Implications: Should rosuvastatin prove to be safe and efficacious&#xD;
      for reducing endocrine metabolic disease risk for adults with chronic SCI, the results will&#xD;
      advance the health of people with SCI by reducing the frequency and severity of heart disease&#xD;
      and fracture as they age, with a single intervention.&#xD;
