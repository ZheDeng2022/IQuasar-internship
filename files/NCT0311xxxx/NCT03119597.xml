      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a 4-week dietary intervention with wild&#xD;
      blueberry powder can have an effect on cognitive performance in participants aged between&#xD;
      13-17.&#xD;

      Interventions: Flavonoid drink and a matched placebo will be used in this study. Flavonoid&#xD;
      drink will contain approximately, 13g of freeze dried wild blueberry powder, containing 250mg&#xD;
      of anthocyanin flavonoid, mixed with 170ml water and flavored with 30ml 'Rock's Organic&#xD;
      Orange Squash' as it has a low flavonoid content. The placebo drink will contain placebo&#xD;
      powder matched for vitamin C (45mg), glucose (4.52g) and fructose (4.79g), mixed with 170ml&#xD;
      of water and 30ml 'Rock's Organic Orange Squash'. Participants will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      either placebo or treatment. Participants will be instructed to consume the drink every&#xD;
      morning for 4 weeks. The powder will be prepared and sealed in opaque packets. Participants&#xD;
      will be provided with 2 weeks worth of supplies at baseline and then in week 2. Parents will&#xD;
      be provided with instructions on how to prepare the drinks in addition to supplies such as&#xD;
      opaque straws and containers. Assessment of left-over product will be conducted in 2 weeks to&#xD;
      allow for continued compliance verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: the study comprises of a screen and four visits, including a familiarization week&#xD;
      and 2 test visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening: Once a school has indicated interest in aiding with this trial, participants&#xD;
           will be given a brief overview of the study and asked to complete a set of&#xD;
           questionnaires regarding their mood and general health to confirm suitability for&#xD;
           participating in this study. The questionnaires include Mood and Feeling Questionnaire&#xD;
           (MFQ) and Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS).Participants who score 27&#xD;
           or above (depressed) and score 14 or below (healthy) on the MFQ will be invited to&#xD;
           participate in the second part of the study. Parents of the participants meeting the&#xD;
           criteria will then be contacted to ascertain that each interested volunteer and parents&#xD;
           are willing to participate for the entire duration of the study and to schedule their&#xD;
           familiarization visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Familiarization Visit: Volunteers and parents will be invited to volunteers' first visit&#xD;
           at the location of volunteers' choice (Nutritional Psychology Unit at the University of&#xD;
           Reading or volunteers' school) where participants will receive a detailed explanation of&#xD;
           the study by the participating research associate and will be asked to sign the informed&#xD;
           consent form before any study procedure starts. A log will be kept identifying all&#xD;
           participants having signed the informed consent form (ICF) and the participant will be&#xD;
           allocated a participant number. Once consent has been given, the participants will then&#xD;
           be asked to complete the EPIC Food Frequency Questionnaire so that background flavonoid&#xD;
           intakes can be measured prior to the start of the intervention, Rumination Response&#xD;
           Scale (RRS) and a General health questionnaire. Participants intelligence quotient (IQ)&#xD;
           will be assessed using The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASIII). Parents&#xD;
           will also be asked to complete questionnaires, regarding children mood and behaviors,&#xD;
           including the Parent version of MFQ, RCADS and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&#xD;
           (ADHD) Rating Scale-IV. Finally, participants will be given training on the cognitive&#xD;
           test battery (tasks outlined below) that will be used during the study to reduce the&#xD;
           chances of 'practice' adversely affecting performance on subsequent test days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test Visits (Weeks 0, 2 and 4): All of these sessions will be held at times that suit&#xD;
           participants' individual needs. The timings of the testing sessions will be consistent&#xD;
           for each participant over the 4 weeks. Upon arrival, participants will be asked of any&#xD;
           adverse events and any issues with compliance. Participants will then complete the&#xD;
           battery of cognitive tasks consisting of (i) Modified Eriksen Flanker task, (ii) The&#xD;
           Keep track task (KTT) and (iii)The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), in&#xD;
           addition to completing the daily mood measure Positive and Negative Affect Schedule&#xD;
           (PANAS). Additionally, the last test session (week 4) participants and parents' will&#xD;
           once again be asked to complete the MFQ, RCADS and RRS mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may stop the study treatment without stating any reason at any time during the&#xD;
      study. In addition, a participant will be withdrawn from the study if a volunteer or parents&#xD;
      request a discontinuation, participant exhibits a serious adverse event to any component of&#xD;
      the test product, an illness emerges and/or the investigator's opinion is that withdrawal is&#xD;
      appropriate and in the best interest of the participant. If a participant withdraws from the&#xD;
      study, participants will be encouraged to make a final visit as soon as possible,&#xD;
      irrespective of the reason for withdrawal, to complete a final battery of cognitive tasks.&#xD;
