      The purpose of this research project is to determine if use of optimized target oxygen&#xD;
      strategy during delivery room resuscitation can reduce oxidative stress in premature&#xD;
      newborns. Objective is to compare oxidative stress markers between preterm neonates&#xD;
      resuscitated in the delivery room using three different target oxygen strategies. OX50 target&#xD;
      oxygen strategy is currently in use and recommended by neonatal resuscitation program. In&#xD;
      this strategy oxygen is adjusted to meet the goal transitional saturations which are&#xD;
      approximated 50th centile saturations observed in healthy term newborns. In OX25 target&#xD;
      oxygen strategy oxygen will be adjusted to meet the goal transitional saturations which are&#xD;
      25th percentile transitional saturations observed in healthy term newborns. In OX75 target&#xD;
      oxygen strategy oxygen will be adjusted to meet the goal transitional saturations which are&#xD;
      75th percentile transitional saturations observed in healthy term newborns.&#xD;

      Study Design: A prospective randomized controlled trial of OX50 versus OX25 versus Ox75 will&#xD;
      be conducted at Parkland Hospital. This study will test the hypothesis that the OX25 target&#xD;
      oxygen strategy will result in successful resuscitation of preterm neonates with less O2&#xD;
      exposure and reduction in oxidative stress compared to the currently recommended Ox50 target&#xD;
      O2 strategy and novel OX75 target oxygen strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Neonates with obstetric gestational age (GA) of 23-30 weeks, born at&#xD;
      Parkland Hospital, Dallas, TX, who require active resuscitation, will be included. Active&#xD;
      resuscitation is defined as positive pressure ventilation (PPV), continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP), or ventilation via an endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Increase in oxidative balance ratio from baseline by 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power estimation: The primary outcome for this study is the change from&#xD;
      baseline (cord blood - first 2 hour after birth) in the oxidative balance ratio. From our&#xD;
      recently completed randomized control trial, mean ∆ oxidative balance ratio for Ox50 in&#xD;
      preterm neonates is 9.28 with standard deviation (SD) of 2.42.41 Based on these preliminary&#xD;
      data, in order to detect a 20% change in the ∆ oxidative balance ratio, 25 infants are needed&#xD;
      for each arm using two sided alpha of 0.05 and power of 80% and allowing 10% attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Secondary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in other oxidative stress markers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in oxygen load in the delivery room&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time spent in goal saturations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time spent with saturations above 94%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and frequency of bradycardia during resuscitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of intubation in the delivery room&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount of ventilator support needed in the delivery room&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of neonatal morbidities such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP),&#xD;
           bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular&#xD;
           hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), neurodevelopmental impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain abnormality score on MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective randomized controlled trial of optimal oxygen strategy will be conducted at&#xD;
      Parkland Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening procedure: A research nurse will screen and identify eligible mothers admitted to&#xD;
      labor and delivery suites at Parkland hospital. Investigators will obtain antenatal informed&#xD;
      consent from mothers admitted to the OB service. A total of 75 neonates will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the trial, 25 in each group.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study intervention and control group: The study intervention #1 is the Ox25 where&#xD;
      resuscitation will be initiated at 30% O2 and target goal saturations will be the 25th&#xD;
      percentile saturations observed in healthy term newborns.52 The study intervention #2 is the&#xD;
      Ox75 where resuscitation will be initiated at 30% O2 and target goal saturations will be the&#xD;
      75th percentile saturations observed in healthy term newborns. The control group will be&#xD;
      resuscitated with the OX50 in which resuscitation will be initiated with 30% O2 and target&#xD;
      goal saturations will be the approximated median SpO2 observed in healthy term newborns as&#xD;
      per current NRP guidelines. Table 1 compare the transitional goal saturations that will be&#xD;
      used in OX25, OX50 and Ox75. For the first 6 minutes after birth, target ranges of different&#xD;
      strategies are different. After 6 min, the target ranges are similar. Target saturations are&#xD;
      an approximation of the percentile curves created by Dawson et al based on transitional&#xD;
      saturation data of 306 healthy term neonates who did not receive any intervention other than&#xD;
      warmth and stimulation.52&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Allocation Procedure: Assignment to the OX25, OX50 and OX75 group will use&#xD;
      a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The Biostatistician will use a blocked randomization schema,&#xD;
      programmed using SAS Proc Plan (SAS version 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Allocation&#xD;
      will be concealed by serially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes that will be opened&#xD;
      sequentially by the resuscitation team before delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resuscitation management: The high-risk resuscitation team attends delivery of all neonates &lt;&#xD;
      35 wks GA. Radical pulse oximeters (Masimo, Irvine, CA) will be set to maximal sensitivity&#xD;
      with 2 seconds averaging. Randomization will be done before delivery by opening a sealed,&#xD;
      opaque envelope. The probe will be placed on the pre-ductal hand within the first 30 seconds&#xD;
      of life using previously described strategies to optimize time to reliable signal as per NRP&#xD;
      2011 guidelines. A neonatal transducer (Invos Cerebral Oximeter Monitor , Covidien,&#xD;
      Mansfield, Massachusetts) will be attached to left fronto-pareital forehead to measure&#xD;
      continuous near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements. Apart from the randomly assigned&#xD;
      O2 strategy, resuscitation will follow 2011 NRP guidelines. Treatment failure will be defined&#xD;
      as HR&lt; 60 bpm after 90 seconds of resuscitation. In this event, the O2 concentration will be&#xD;
      increased to 100% as recommended by current NRP guidelines. Once HR is stabilized, FiO2 will&#xD;
      be reduced to meet the goal saturations of the assigned strategy. If pulse oximetry does not&#xD;
      register stable values, resuscitation will be continued at the current FiO2 as long as HR &gt;&#xD;
      100 bpm is maintained. If HR remains below 100 bpm, after making ventilation correcting&#xD;
      steps, FiO2 can be increased by 10-20% based on clinician's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent NICU management: Following NICU admission, all care decisions including ventilator&#xD;
      management will be at the discretion of the attending neonatologist. Target SpO2 will be&#xD;
      88-94% throughout the NICU stay as per unit policy. Infants with O2 requirement at 36 weeks&#xD;
      corrected GA will undergo an O2 challenge test to define physiologic BPD as per the NICHD&#xD;
      definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of baseline variables: Baseline demographic characteristics, maternal and delivery&#xD;
      characteristics including maternal age, prenatal clinic attendance, antenatal steroids given,&#xD;
      maternal diabetes, illicit drug use, preeclampsia, prolonged rupture of membrane,&#xD;
      chorioamnionitis, abruption, previa and cesarean section will be collected. Baseline infant&#xD;
      characteristics such as gender, obstetrical GA, birth weight, intrauterine growth&#xD;
      restriction, breech presentation, multiple pregnancies, cord blood gas pH, base deficit will&#xD;
      be recorded. This data will be collected from the electronic medical records by research&#xD;
      nurse and Parkland neonatal intensive care unit database which collects this information on&#xD;
      all the infants admitted to Parkland NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and Statistical plan by each aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Specific Aim I: To determine if OX25 will decrease DR O2 load and oxidative stress&#xD;
      compared to OX50 and OX75. Investigators hypothesize that OX25 neonates will require less O2&#xD;
      in the DR, spend more time in goal SpO2 range and will have lower oxidative stress&#xD;
&#xD;
      DR O2 exposure and SpO2: SpO2 will be downloaded from pulse oximeters used during&#xD;
      resuscitation as per Masimo pulse oximeter guidelines using TRENDCOM software (Masimo,&#xD;
      Irvine, CA). Investigators have described and successfully performed acquisition of such data&#xD;
      in our previous study. Resuscitation interventions including changes in FiO2 will be recorded&#xD;
      at 30 seconds intervals by the OB circulating nurse whose sole responsibility is to record&#xD;
      resuscitation details in a pre-specified record sheet as per routine practice at Parkland&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress and oxidative injury measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation and storage by research nurse: Sample will be centrifuged to separate plasma and&#xD;
      stored at -80 C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Oxidative balance ratio: All samples will be analyzed for total hydroperoxides (TH) and&#xD;
      biological antioxidant capacity (BAP) using the Free Radical Analytical System (FRAS4&#xD;
      analyzer, H&amp;D SRL, Parma, Italy) as described in our previous study. TH represents the total&#xD;
      of radical O2 metabolites produced by peroxidation of protein, lipids and amino acids,&#xD;
      measures oxidative damage and serves as a biomarker of overall free radical attack. BAP&#xD;
      measures both endogenous and exogenous antioxidative capacity of serum to reduce oxides by&#xD;
      inactivating, and eliminating free radicals and reactive O2 species. BAP by exploiting the&#xD;
      chemical principle of the well-known ferric reducing ability of plasma provides a reliable&#xD;
      measure of biological antioxidant potential of plasma. To estimate the global balance between&#xD;
      oxidative stress and antioxidant potential, the oxidative balance ratio (BAP/TH) will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Other oxidative stress markers: 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), F2-Isoprostanes and&#xD;
      Isofurans and Protein Carbonyls. Along with these, investigators will also measure cytokines,&#xD;
      Interleukin 1 receptor antagonitst, hyaluronidase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Specific Aim II: Determine if preterm neonates can be resuscitated successfully with less&#xD;
      ventilatory support using Ox25. Investigators hypothesize that OX25 infants will achieve&#xD;
      quicker heart rate stabilization and will require less ventilatory support including&#xD;
      intubation in the DR. Resuscitation interventions including changes in ventilator support,&#xD;
      need for CPR will be recorded at 30 seconds intervals by OB circulating nurse whose sole&#xD;
      responsibility is to record resuscitation details in a pre-specified record sheet as per the&#xD;
      our routine practice. The research nurse will download continuous heart rate data from Masimo&#xD;
      pulse oximeters and continuous NIRS data from cerebral oximeter monitor for the duration of&#xD;
      resuscitation. Admission parameters will also be recorded by the research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Specific Aim III: Determine if OX25 strategy will result in lower incidence of adverse&#xD;
      clinical outcomes compared to OX50 or OX75 strategy. Investigators hypothesize that OX25&#xD;
      neonates will have lower incidence of BPD. Investigators will also record other clinical&#xD;
      outcomes such as ROP, NEC, IVH, length of hospitalization, neurodevelopmental impairment and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal morbidity during NICU stay: Short term clinical outcomes including duration and type&#xD;
      of respiratory support and O2 supplementation during the NICU stay, respiratory morbidities&#xD;
      such as respiratory distress syndrome, need for surfactant, pulmonary hypertension, and BPD&#xD;
      will be obtained from the NICU database. In addition, other short term morbidities such as&#xD;
      sepsis, Grade III/IV IVH, NEC, symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus, severe ROP, length of&#xD;
      hospitalization and mortality during NICU stay will also be collected from the NICU database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain MRI at term equivalent age: All study infants who underwent a brain MRI at term&#xD;
      equivalent age as part of standard of care at parkland hospital will be assessed for brain&#xD;
      abnormality score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental impairment: All study infants will follow up at 18-24 months of age in the&#xD;
      high risk Low Birth Weight Clinic. A blinded developmental pediatrician will perform&#xD;
      standardized neurological examination to identify cerebral palsy. Developmental specialist&#xD;
      will administer the Bayley Scale of Infant Development III Instrument. Moderate to severe&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental impairment will be defined as Bayley III Motor Developmental Index or&#xD;
      Psychomotor Developmental Index score less than 70, moderate or severe cerebral palsy,&#xD;
      bilateral blindness, bilateral hearing loss requiring hearing aids or cochlear implants.&#xD;
