      The trial is open to patients who have metastatic renal cell carcinoma/urothelial (bladder)&#xD;
      carcinoma with at least 2 measurable sites of disease. All eligible patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to immunotherapy(nivolumab/atezolizumab/pembrolizumab) versus immunotherapy&#xD;
      (nivolumab/atezolizumab/pembrolizumab) plus radiotherapy, 10 Gy x3 (conformally or by&#xD;
      intensity modulation radiation therapy/Image-guided radiation therapy (IMRT/IGRT) to&#xD;
      maximally spare normal tissue), to one of their measurable lesions.&#xD;

      The trial is open to patients who have metastatic renal cell carcinoma/urothelial (bladder)&#xD;
      carcinoma with at least 2 measurable sites of disease. All eligible patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to immunotherapy(nivolumab/atezolizumab/pembrolizumab) versus immunotherapy&#xD;
      (nivolumab/atezolizumab/pembrolizumab) plus radiotherapy, 10 Gy x3 (conformally or by&#xD;
      IMRT/IGRT to maximally spare normal tissue), to one of their measurable lesions. For patients&#xD;
      assigned to the immunotherapy plus radiotherapy arm, immunotherapy treatment starts with the&#xD;
      first radiotherapy fraction. Nivolumab will be given every 2 weeks for patients with&#xD;
      metastatic renal cell cancer and atezolizumab/pembrolizumab will be given every 3 weeks for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Patients will be re-imaged at 9 week (year 1) or&#xD;
      12 week (years 2-3) intervals and evaluated for response (defined as an objective response of&#xD;
      measurable metastatic sites outside the radiation field). This response will be evaluated&#xD;
      with CT scans in non-irradiated measurable metastatic sites per RECIST version 1.1. Patients&#xD;
      will continue to receive their respective immunotherapies for up to three years or until&#xD;
      disease progression or until a dose limiting toxicity is reached.&#xD;
