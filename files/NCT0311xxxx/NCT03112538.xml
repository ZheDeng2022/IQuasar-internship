    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the comparative efficacy of insulin pump therapy&#xD;
      versus multiple daily injections in insulin-taking type 2 diabetes mellitus who are&#xD;
      sub-optimally controlled with premixed insulin regimen. This research is necessary because&#xD;
      many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus do not meet their glucose targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In advanced Type 2 diabetes mellitus, many patients develop worsening diabetes control and&#xD;
      unable to reach the glucose targets despite intensive insulin regimens.This is further&#xD;
      complicated by the risks of low blood sugar and weight gain. These limitations of multiple&#xD;
      daily injection treatment show the need for new treatments for this group of patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study evaluates between group change in glycemic control (HbA1c) after 6 months of&#xD;
      insulin pump therapy in patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, as compared to patients on&#xD;
      multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy over the same time period. It also evaluates between&#xD;
      group changes in diabetes clinical outcomes after 6 months in patients with type 2 DM.&#xD;
      Patient related outcomes will be measured after 6 months of therapy. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      will be between group difference in average HbA1c changes from baseline to 6 months, when&#xD;
      comparing Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) to MDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary end point concerns the safety issues such as severe hypoglycemia incidence:&#xD;
      defined as an episode absolutely requiring assistance from another person and preferably&#xD;
      accompanied by a confirmatory blood glucose by finger stick of less than 50mg/dL (2.8&#xD;
      mmol/L), (i.e., subject is unable to treat self and requires carbohydrate, glucagon or other&#xD;
      resuscitative actions to prevent further clinical deterioration), hospitalizations, Diabetic&#xD;
      Ketoacidosis (DKA), an acute metabolic complication of diabetes, characterized by&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, and metabolic acidosis, within group difference in HbA1c from&#xD;
      6 months to 12 months, change in weight or BMI, change in Lipids : total cholesterol, high&#xD;
      density lipoprotein(HDL),low density lipoprotein(LDL),triglyceride, change in blood pressure,&#xD;
      Insulin Dosage Changes (Total Daily Dose), Number of self monitoring blood glucose&#xD;
      (SMBG)/day, treatment satisfaction: Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status and&#xD;
      change version (DTSQs and DTSQc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses underlying the secondary outcomes : the pump therapy improves glycaemic&#xD;
      control whilst utilizing less total daily dose of insulin in comparison to multiple daily&#xD;
      injections of insulin. This is associated with parallel improvement in metabolic profiles&#xD;
      such as blood pressure and lipids. As for the glucose monitoring, investigators want to&#xD;
      evaluate whether there is any difference in the frequency of SMBG/day between the 2 treatment&#xD;
      groups. More frequent SMBG monitoring denotes better compliance, motivation and empowerment&#xD;
      by the participants to control their diabetes.&#xD;
