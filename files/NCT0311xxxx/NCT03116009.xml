      This will be a randomization of two groups of obese pregnant women into early screening for&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus at the time of their first or subsequent prenatal visits before 20 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation versus standard time of screening for diabetes at 24 - 28 weeks as it is done for&#xD;
      all pregnant women. The perinatal outcomes between the two groups will be compared to&#xD;
      determine whether early screening for diabetes in all obese pregnant women has a clinical&#xD;
      merit or significant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of normal physiological changes of pregnancy, there is increased insulin resistance,&#xD;
      which causes dysregulation of maternal glucose homeostasis. Obesity, which is body mass index&#xD;
      greater or equal to 30 kg/m2, is also associated with impaired glucose metabolism. Women with&#xD;
      higher body mass index (BMI) usually have higher risk of developing gestational diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (GDM) than normal BMI women. The American Congress of Obstetricians and&#xD;
      Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends early screening for gestational diabetes mellitus in certain&#xD;
      categories of patients with higher risk factors which includes previous medical history of&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus, known impaired glucose metabolism and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is poor compliance by many clinicians of this ACOG recommendation.. One of the&#xD;
      reasons for the poor compliance is that it was based on expert opinion and consensus which is&#xD;
      level III evidence. There has not been any robust study to determine the clinical importance&#xD;
      of screening obese women early versus screening them at the same time like every pregnant&#xD;
      women at 24 - 28 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The justifications for recommendation for early diabetes screening are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It will help diagnose pre-existing type 2 DM unrecognized prior to pregnancy.&#xD;
           Uncontrolled pre-gestational type 2 DM in the first trimester has been shown to have the&#xD;
           same maternal and perinatal adverse effects as type 1 DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It will help detect women with impaired glucose metabolism, in which early interventions&#xD;
           may prevent the development of GDM later on in pregnancy and its associated&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment of type 2 diabetes in the first trimester will minimize adverse maternal and&#xD;
           perinatal outcomes such as congenital malformation, hypertension or preeclampsia often&#xD;
           associated with poorly controlled diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is currently no strong evidence to support that early GDM screening in obese&#xD;
      pregnant women is cost effective or is beneficial in reducing maternal and perinatal adverse&#xD;
      outcomes despites its recommendation by many professional societies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To compare the rate of neonatal large for gestational age (&gt; 90 percentile) or&#xD;
                macrosomia (&gt; 4000gm birth weight) between the two groups: The study group and the&#xD;
                control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To compare the rate of neonatal large for gestational age (&gt; 90 percentile) or&#xD;
                macrosomia (&gt; 4000gm) between participants with diabetes diagnosed at early&#xD;
                screening and those with true gestational diabetes diagnosed at 24 - 28 weeks.&#xD;
                Those with true GDM are those who test negative during early screening but become&#xD;
                positive at 24 - 28 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To compare pregnancy outcomes between the early screening group and the control&#xD;
                group. Maternal outcomes will include the development of pre-eclampsia, pregnancy&#xD;
                induced hypertension, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, and 3rd or 4th degree&#xD;
                perineal lacerations. Perinatal outcomes will include rate of miscarriage, preterm&#xD;
                delivery, intra-uterine growth restriction, intra-uterine fetal death and neonatal&#xD;
                metabolic complications (hypoglycemia, hypocalcaemia or hyperbilirubinemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To compare pregnancy outcomes between diabetes diagnosed at early screening and&#xD;
                true gestational diabetes diagnosed at 24 - 28 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To describe characteristics of participants in each group including medical&#xD;
                co-morbidities and obstetric complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. To determine glycemic control by measurement of HbA1C at the time of diagnosis of&#xD;
                diabetes and at term, prior to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. To compare composite neonatal complications between the two groups such as NICU&#xD;
                admission, duration of NICU stay, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal sepsis,&#xD;
                necrotizing enterocolitis, intra-ventricular hemorrhage and neonatal death.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. To determine sensitivity and specificity of early diabetes screening across the&#xD;
                obesity classes according to the world health organization (WHO) classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Cost analysis of early diabetes screening among obese pregnant women. The duration&#xD;
                of this study will be approximately 2 years; obese pregnant women will be enrolled&#xD;
                September 2016 to August 2017, and they will be followed to the end of their&#xD;
                pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  This will be a randomized controlled trial of two groups of obese pregnant&#xD;
                     women. The study group will receive early diabetes screening (a GCT) during&#xD;
                     their first prenatal clinic visit or a subsequent visit at less than 20 weeks&#xD;
                     of gestation. The control group will be screened at 24 - 28 weeks of&#xD;
                     gestation, which is the time all low risk pregnant women are screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The study will be performed in the Center for Women's Health and Mile Square&#xD;
                     health center of the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Science System&#xD;
                     (UI Health). The providing physician, midwife or trained recruiters will&#xD;
                     recruit participants from these two sites if they meet eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Eligible participants will be approached and counseled about the nature of the&#xD;
                     study. If they are willing to participate, informed consent would be obtained&#xD;
                     from them and a questionnaire to obtain vital clinical information would be&#xD;
                     administered. Thereafter, they would be instructed to go to the laboratory to&#xD;
                     perform 1 hour 50 g glucose challenge test (GCT) with HbA1C (study group) or&#xD;
                     HbA1C only (control group). The 1-hour GCT involves administration of 50g of&#xD;
                     glucose solution by mouth. Participants do not need to be fasting. After 1&#xD;
                     hour, venous blood will be drawn along with other prenatal labs, and glucose&#xD;
                     level and HbA1C would be analyzed. The control group will not be given the&#xD;
                     1-hour GCT but only perform HbA1C level during their routine prenatal lab&#xD;
                     tests. Practitioners at UIC routinely request the HbA1C test as standard of&#xD;
                     care for obese pregnant women at early gestation based on ACOG recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  As part of standard clinical care, if a pregnant patient has a positive 1-hour&#xD;
                     GCT at any point in her pregnancy (defined by plasma glucose level of 140&#xD;
                     mg/dl or greater) they are to receive a 3-hour 100g oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
                     test (OGTT) at a later date. In this test, the patients are advised to avoid&#xD;
                     smoking or alcohol for 3 days preceding the test date, although they may&#xD;
                     continue with their regular diet during this period. The patient is instructed&#xD;
                     to fast over-night for 8 -10 hours prior to the test. A 2.5 ml blood sample is&#xD;
                     drawn for the fasting plasma glucose level, then a 100 g glucose solution is&#xD;
                     given to the patient orally. A 2.5 ml blood sample is then drawn each at 1, 2&#xD;
                     and 3 hours. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is made if there are two or more&#xD;
                     abnormal plasma glucose values using the Carpenter and Coustan criteria&#xD;
                     (Fasting plasma glucose &gt; 90 mg/dl, 1 hour &gt; 180 mg/dl, 2 hours &gt; 155 mg/dl&#xD;
                     and 3 hours &gt; 140 mg/dl) 21. A random plasma glucose or 1-hour 50 g GCT&gt; 200&#xD;
                     mg/dl will also be considered as diagnostic of diabetes mellitus and will no&#xD;
                     require the 3-hours OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  As part of standard clinical care, those diagnosed with DM would receive&#xD;
                     diabetic teaching and would be referred to a dietitian for nutritional&#xD;
                     counseling. Patients would be taught on how to monitor daily blood glucose at&#xD;
                     home and come back 1 - 2 weeks later for evaluation where they would be&#xD;
                     evaluated for glycemic control. If the blood glucose values are within normal&#xD;
                     range, patient would continue with dietary intervention only. However, if the&#xD;
                     blood glucose values are abnormal, they would be given oral hypoglycemic drugs&#xD;
                     (Metformin or Glyburide), or insulin according to the discretion of the&#xD;
                     provider. All pregnant diabetic patients on medications are usually managed in&#xD;
                     the high risk OB clinic at UIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Those in the study group that test negative to the 1-hour GCT and 3-hour OGTT,&#xD;
                     and the participants in the control group will be followed routinely according&#xD;
                     to their medical and / or other obstetric conditions. At 24 - 28 weeks, they&#xD;
                     will undergo a 1-hour GCT and those that test positive will be also have the&#xD;
                     3-hour OGTT based on current ACOG recommendation. If they are diagnosed with&#xD;
                     diabetes, they would receive the same standard-of-care interventions or&#xD;
                     treatments as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: those patients in the early screening group who have a negative GCT or OGTT at the &lt;&#xD;
      20week prenatal visit will not be charged for the GCT at the 24-28week visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As part of standard clinical care, participants will be followed until delivery in a&#xD;
           manner appropriate to their clinical or other medical and obstetric conditions. Data&#xD;
           would be collected via the administered questionnaire and also from the participants'&#xD;
           electronic medical records. Additionally, the records of the participant's newborns will&#xD;
           be reviewed in order to collect neonate outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The questionnaire will be used to collect baseline data such as medical record number,&#xD;
           maternal age, race / ethnicity, educational level, employment status, nature of job,&#xD;
           BMI, gravidity, parity, social and family history, obstetric history, medical and&#xD;
           surgical history, and medications.&#xD;
