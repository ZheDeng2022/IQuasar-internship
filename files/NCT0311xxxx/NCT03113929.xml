  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current goal in the treatment of Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD) is to manage&#xD;
      ALD-associated complications as there are no disease-specific therapies. Identifying&#xD;
      disease-specific therapies to slow ALD progression is critical to improving the outcomes in&#xD;
      these patients. Despite preclinical treatment studies in animal models that have shown&#xD;
      promise, clinical trials in ALD patients have been limited by the absence of sensitive,&#xD;
      quantitative methods for identifying severity and monitoring progression of liver disease.&#xD;
      The rates of progression of liver disease in ALD are variable and difficult to predict, which&#xD;
      makes assessments of therapies difficult. Clinical measures of hepatic or biliary disease&#xD;
      (e.g., bilirubin, transaminases) may be normal, only mildly elevated and/or stable despite&#xD;
      ongoing organ damage. Liver biopsies are diagnostic, but are invasive and are of limited&#xD;
      value for longitudinal monitoring. Currently clinical imaging, including standard volumetric&#xD;
      imaging (MRI and ultrasonography) and hepatic fibrosis assessment (e.g. Fibroscan) are also&#xD;
      of limited utility in fully staging disease severity and monitoring progression in ALD. The&#xD;
      absence of clinically available methods for accurately determining the severity and&#xD;
      progression of liver disease progression in ALD has limited implementation of clinical trials&#xD;
      using novel therapeutic agents. Development of non-invasive imaging biomarkers to assess&#xD;
      rates of liver progression will overcome this barrier and allow for such studies to be&#xD;
      undertaken. This study intends to perform a one-time MRI on patients with ALD to search for&#xD;
      these biomarkers that can improve the diagnosis and treatment of ALD patients.&#xD;
