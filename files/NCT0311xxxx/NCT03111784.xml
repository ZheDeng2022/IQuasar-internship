      IConsumption of fish provides a vital contribution to the survival and health of a&#xD;
      significant portion of the world's population. Lipids in fish foods consist mainly of&#xD;
      long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as eicosapentaenic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3)&#xD;
      and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA C22:6n-3) which belongs to the physiologically important group&#xD;
      of n-3 fatty acids. The increase of unsaturated fatty acids, along with the reduction of&#xD;
      saturated fats, supports the lowering of blood cholesterol in humans and causes a positive&#xD;
      impact on human nutrition. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 fatty acids) plays a role in&#xD;
      preventing heart disease and has anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombosis effects and these&#xD;
      fatty acids cannot be synthesized and they must be obtained through diet. These nutritional&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consumption of fish provides a vital contribution to the survival and health of a&#xD;
           significant portion of the world's population. Lipids in fish foods consist mainly of&#xD;
           long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as eicosapentaenic acid (EPA,&#xD;
           C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA C22:6n-3) which belongs to the physiologically&#xD;
           important group of n-3 fatty acids. The increase of unsaturated fatty acids, along with&#xD;
           the reduction of saturated fats, supports the lowering of blood cholesterol in humans&#xD;
           and causes a positive impact on human nutrition. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3&#xD;
           fatty acids) plays a role in preventing heart disease and has anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
           anti-thrombosis effects and these fatty acids cannot be synthesized and they must be&#xD;
           obtained through diet. These nutritional benefits of fish consumption is mainly&#xD;
           attributed to the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids , which are thought to&#xD;
           have several potential cardio protective actions. This research is focused mainly&#xD;
           identify highly consumed food fishes available in Batticaloa district( fresh, lagoon and&#xD;
           sea water ) and their consumption pattern (cooking methods) of local community and by&#xD;
           cardiovascular patients (CV) . Secondly Omega-3- Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and&#xD;
           tocopherol content (Vit E) in the fresh fish and dried or smoked fish of the highly&#xD;
           consumed food fishes would be assessed and the relationship between fish consumption and&#xD;
           its PUFA and Vit E content would be known. Also research will focus how lifestyle,&#xD;
           socio-demographic factors' influences on the Cardiovascular diseases among community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Justification Since the consumption of marine fish have high omega-3 fatty acid and&#xD;
           showed the reduction of death by CVD, there is no record about the content of omega-3&#xD;
           fatty acid in fresh and brackish water fishes and effects on consumption of fresh and&#xD;
           brackish water fishes by South Asian population. Nearly 50 % of population of Sri Lankan&#xD;
           consume Inland fishes and it is not known the lipids content, omega-3- fatty acids and&#xD;
           tocopherol in muscle of these fishes. This would be first study to understand the&#xD;
           content of type of lipids , omega-3 fatty acids, tocopherol and the relationship with&#xD;
           fish consumption and CVD. This research will identify the formula of cooking and&#xD;
           consumption method of fish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Over all Objectives i) Identification of highly consumed food fish varieties (fresh,&#xD;
           marine and lagoon) in the district and consumption rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii) Quantifying the Omega-3 -Polyunsaturated fatty acid and Tocopherol content of flesh&#xD;
           of selected highly consumed fishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv) Compare the lipid profile of the randomly selected CVD patients and apparently&#xD;
           healthy subjects and to relate it to PUFAs content of fish v) Assess all the factors&#xD;
           related with fish consumption and CVD and to finding a new method of consumption of&#xD;
           fish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Literature Review Consumption of fish provides an important nutrient for 135 billions of&#xD;
           people worldwide and thus makes a very significant contribution to nutrients (FAO,&#xD;
           2010). Fish consists of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the form of arachidonic acid,&#xD;
           eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (Kinsella et al.1990). Marine species&#xD;
           have high level of PUFAs and those species are less likely consuming by the poor and low&#xD;
           income people. And Small pelagic forage fish species have rich PUFAS and they are&#xD;
           cheaper and preferably consumed by them (Tacon and Metain, 2009). Increasing consumption&#xD;
           of omega-3 fatty acid can benefit health by reducing Cardiovascular diseases (Udani and&#xD;
           Ritz, 2013). Kinsella (2005) reported that the increase of unsaturated fatty acids along&#xD;
           with the reduction of saturated fats , supports the lowering of blood cholesterol in&#xD;
           humans. Din et al., ( 2004) stated that the fish consumption were mainly attributed to&#xD;
           the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are thought to have several&#xD;
           potential cardio protective actions. It was observed that Greenland Eskimos exhibited&#xD;
           significantly lower rates of mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) compared to&#xD;
           Danes due to high intake of fish which are rich of omega -3 PUFAs (Menotti et al, 1999&#xD;
           Heidel et al ., 2007). However, Coronary heart disease is still the leading cause of&#xD;
           death and disability in the world. Well known risk factors for heart diseases include&#xD;
           age, sex, smoking, diet, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high&#xD;
           cholesterol level and some more factors associated such as life style, social class,&#xD;
           income and occupational factors comprising job stress, combustion products and&#xD;
           environmental factors (Yasunori Suematsu et al,2013). The consumption of fish and fish&#xD;
           products is recommended as a means of preventing cardiovascular diseases and greatly&#xD;
           increased over recent decades in many European countries (Cahu et al .,2004).&#xD;
           Modification in the fatty acids profiles by different culinary technologies in cooking&#xD;
           fish for consumption alters the nutritive value of final product is major importance of&#xD;
           human health. Therefore, the fatty acids profile in fish varied with fresh, processed&#xD;
           and cooked form(Garcia-Arias et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Sri Lanka, as per the 2011 health ranking report 11.69% of total population death&#xD;
           reported due to Coronary heart disease and 7.41% hypertension.Some Nutritionally&#xD;
           important fatty acids in seven type of fishes eaten in Sri Lanka has been studied&#xD;
           (Liyanage et al., 1989). And the fish consumption behaviors is determined by many&#xD;
           factors (Pethiyagoda and Olsen, 2012). . Some nutritionally important fatty acids in&#xD;
           seven varieties of fish eaten in Sri Lanka has been studied (Liyanage, et al., 1989) and&#xD;
           the fish consumption behaviour is determined by many factors ( Pethiyagoda and Olsen,&#xD;
           2012). The peroximate composition of three species of Scomberoides fish from the Sri&#xD;
           Lankan waters was done by (Sutharsiniy and Sivashanthy, 2011b) and stated Scomberoid&#xD;
           commonsonianus is good diatetic species. The total lipid and cholesterol content of the&#xD;
           five commercial important fish species has been assessed by the ((Sutharsiniy and&#xD;
           Sivashanthy, 2011a). Wimalasena and Jayasuriya ( 1996) studied the nutritional analysis&#xD;
           of some freshwater fishes in Sri Lanka&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Methodology 5.1. Study Design Annexure I&#xD;
&#xD;
           . 5.2.Hypothesis of study Omega-3- fatty acid (PUFAs) and Tocopherol content in fish&#xD;
           flesh are high in inland fishes and it prevents CVD diseases as per the interview from&#xD;
           the fish eating people.. However, there are many factors such as life style and&#xD;
           socio-demographic factors and eating methods of fish will be taken into our study since&#xD;
           those are influencing factors of CVD and the Lipid profile of CVD patients and non- CVD&#xD;
           people will be compared with fish consumption. This research is justified as a first&#xD;
           study in Sri Lanka to understand the relationship of fish consumption and its pattern in&#xD;
           naïve and CVD from Eastern Sri Lankan Community 5.3.Study Area&#xD;

           of naïve regular fish consuming people (250) and CVD people who are engaged in treatment&#xD;
           .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lipid profile for selected subjects (naïve) after 6 month of fish consumption lipid&#xD;
           profile will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood (2ml) will be collected from the subjects for the lipid profile analysis with&#xD;
           their consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ( This procedure will be done once the ethical clearance certificate issued)&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.10 Data Analysis SPSS -19 package , EXCEL and SAS ( if needed) for ranking will be&#xD;
           used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.11. Study Sensitization This study will reveal the different fatty acids in fish and&#xD;
           the content and these will not be sensitized issue. Since lipid profile of naïve human&#xD;
           and CVD people will be treated confidentially and data will be treated same and after&#xD;
           research . All data will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.12. Consent Statement- Annexure 3&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.13. Confidentiality Statement Annexure 3&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.14. Work Plan Annexure 4&#xD;
&#xD;
           Annexure 2 Phase I This survey will be specially focused on the relationship between&#xD;
           consumption of fish /food and its preference of quality, the impact of consumer&#xD;
           involvement, role of life styles, experience and habit, quantity intake, time of&#xD;
           consumption, socio-demographic characteristics, health and diet beliefs and convenience.&#xD;
           It would be done among one in 500 people of total population(525142). That is nearly&#xD;
           1500.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Of the randomly selected people of fish consumers , nearly 250 people (male &amp; female),&#xD;
           aged between 35 to 50 who are engaging in treatment for Cardiac vascular disease (CVD) ,&#xD;
           hypertension and stroke in three different national hospitals in Eastern Province. The&#xD;
           daily fish consumption data, type of fish, amount of fish consumption in three times&#xD;
           will be assessed during health survey among patients. During the survey fish eating&#xD;
           frequency, cooking method, special ingredients used to cook fish , how many minutes they&#xD;
           cooked fish, and processing technique will be interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase II By doing Market survey (nearly 5 city markets and 5 local markets) the major&#xD;
           food fishes would be identified taxonomically and fish consumption rate will be&#xD;
           calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase III The total fat content subjected to the study will be extracted according to&#xD;
           the Soxhlet protocol (ADAC,1995 ) from the flesh of 10 highly consumed fishes. Total&#xD;
           lipid extraction was made with chloroform methanol (2:1) and according to Folich et al&#xD;
           ,.(1957) methodology modified by Bligh and Dyer (1959). Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME)&#xD;
           will be prepared with methanol using BF3 -MeoH complex, as catalyst, according to the&#xD;
           method of Metcalfe et al (1966). Omega-3 fatty acid of the highly consumed fresh, cooked&#xD;
           and dried fish muscle would be analyzed using Gas Liquid Chromatography and the&#xD;
           tocopherol content will be analyzed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).&#xD;
           These would be correlated with consumer preference of fish and CVD. The omega-3 -PUFA&#xD;
           and Tocopherol content of all samples would be analyzed at same time. Sample of ten&#xD;
           selected highly consumed fish species will be taken for this study. Lipid profile of&#xD;
           randomly selected (50) CVD patients who will be selected with the help of the Batticaloa&#xD;
           cardiology unit will be taken in our study and it will be monitored monthly for five&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase IV The correlation between the fish consumption and the cooking methods and life&#xD;
           style of the community and Cardiovascular diseases in the Eastern Community will be&#xD;
           analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase V The nutritional composition of identified of selected highly consumed fish and&#xD;
           existing cooking method would be studied and new method of cooking style formulated and&#xD;
           would be tested and will be introduced among consumers.&#xD;
