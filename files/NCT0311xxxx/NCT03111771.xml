      Loss of muscle mass (scientific term: cachexia) affects about 80% of patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer and impacts their prognosis by decreasing tolerance and response to treatment,&#xD;
      decreasing quality of life and survival. The prognosis in these patients depends directly on&#xD;
      the importance of the loss of muscle mass. Preserving it is therefore an essential&#xD;
      therapeutic objective. It is therefore important to understand perfectly the mechanism of&#xD;
      this muscular loss. The accumulation of fat in the muscle (scientific term: myosteatosis)&#xD;
      could be a mechanism responsible for this loss of muscle mass. It is indeed a hypothesis&#xD;
      proved on animal models. Moreover, it has recently been shown that more the cancer patient&#xD;
      loses weight, more his muscle contains fat. This lets think that this deposit of fat in the&#xD;
      muscle would be directly related to the loss of muscle mass. All of these observations could&#xD;
      not be clearly established in humans and investigators are seeking by this study to&#xD;
      illuminate these mechanisms at the human level. A better understanding of these mechanisms&#xD;
      would allow investigator to set up targeted treatments against the accumulation of fat in the&#xD;
      muscle, which would significantly improve the quality of life of patients with cancer of the&#xD;
      aerodigestive pathways and their chances of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MYOMEC study includes the inclusion of healthy patients (to form a control group) but&#xD;
      also patients with cancer of the upper aero-digestive tract. The study will be divided into&#xD;
      two parts: clinical examination and nutritional evaluation the day before surgery at the time&#xD;
      of the participants' admission to hospital and then the biological samples during surgery.&#xD;
      The nutritional examination consists in collecting the morphological data of the patient,&#xD;
      namely:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its weight, size, calculation of the body mass index Tests of muscular strength (wearing&#xD;
      weight of 1, 2 and 3 kilos) Measurement of the percentage of fat mass and lean mass&#xD;
      (Impedancemetry)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants benefit from the following investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination complete with elaboration of the clinical nutritional status,&#xD;
           realized the day before the surgical intervention in hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elaboration of the radiological nutritional status by a complementary analysis of the&#xD;
           scanner envisaged in the balance of extension of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performing surgical site sampling during surgery without additional invasive procedure&#xD;
           and under general anesthesia. It will be realized:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A muscle biopsy of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle (neck muscle) (maximum volume 5 mm3), A&#xD;
      tumor biopsy (maximum volume 5mm3). A blood sample (maximum volume 5ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
      No invasive procedure, supplemental examination or additional consultation is required for&#xD;
      the whole off-set study for the extensive muscular percutaneous biopsy regarding which&#xD;
      additional patient agreement will be required. No additional follow-up is required when&#xD;
      participating in this study. Participation in this study does not entail any particular&#xD;
      constraint or additional treatment. The duration of the patient's participation is defined as&#xD;
      follows: from the date of the preoperative consultation or from the consultation of&#xD;
      announcement until his / her discharge from hospital. The exclusion period defined in this&#xD;
      study extends from the date of inclusion of the patient to the date of the surgical&#xD;
      procedure, during which time the patient can not participate in another clinical research&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

      Malnutrition is characterized by a negative energy balance due to a deep skeletal muscular&#xD;
      loss, which is itself secondary to the reduction of intake and metabolic abnormalities&#xD;
      aggravating the loss of weight. Sarcopenia is defined as the loss of muscle mass, the&#xD;
      consequences of which are a decrease in muscle strength and physical performance .Cachexia,&#xD;
      identified in many chronic diseases (renal insufficiency, heart failure, diabetes, COPD), is&#xD;
      the result of an imbalance between proteolysis and proteogenesis and can be defined as a&#xD;
      multifactorial syndrome characterized by a weight loss resulting mainly from a loss of lean&#xD;
      mass, in particular muscle mass, which is not reversible by an adequate nutritional&#xD;
      contribution and which leads to functional abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancers of the ENT sphere represent about 15% of all cancers in men and 2% in women. They&#xD;
      mainly concern subjects between 45 and 70 years of age with a predominant role of&#xD;
      ethylo-tobacco poisoning. Patients with upper aero-digestive tract cancers are particularly&#xD;
      prone to malnutrition on the part of the tumor itself but also on the context (ethylo-tobacco&#xD;
      intoxication, sedentary behavior, poor general condition), tumor localization involving&#xD;
      reduction of intake (Mechanical obstruction, anorexia, pain), but also after treatment&#xD;
      (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer cachexia affects approximately 80% of patients with advanced cancer and impacts their&#xD;
      prognosis by increasing morbidity and mortality, decreased tolerance and response to&#xD;
      treatment , decreased quality of life and decreased survival. Its prognosis depends on the&#xD;
      extent of the loss of muscle mass. It is generally reported for a patient with a weight loss&#xD;
      superior than 5% of its initial weight over the last 6 months, with 3 stages described:&#xD;
      Pre-cachexia stage, clean cachexia stage, refractory cachexia stage. It is characterized,&#xD;
      among other things, by the development of systemic inflammation and tumor cell lines and&#xD;
      tumor cells from cancer patients have been shown to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The loss of skeletal muscle mass, up to 75% in severe malnutrition is related to an&#xD;
      acceleration of muscle catabolism and an alteration of muscle protein anabolism, mediated by&#xD;
      large tumor signals and leads to a decrease in performans status, decrease in overall&#xD;
      survival, increase in susceptibility to toxicity of chemotherapy, and increase in exposure to&#xD;
      long-term hospital stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This muscular loss is the result of an increase in proteolysis phenomen but also of a&#xD;
      decrease in protein synthesis. The main proteolytic pathways are the&#xD;
      calpain-calcium-dependent pathway, the lysosomal pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome-ATP&#xD;
      pathway. Several studies have shown the activation of these proteolytic pathways in cancer&#xD;
      cachexia . Among these proteolytic pathways, the ubiquitin-proteasome-ATP-dependent pathway&#xD;
      appears to be the most involved in cancer cachexia .This proteolytic pathway is mediated by 2&#xD;
      ubiquitin ligases specific for skeletal muscle, MAF-Box and MURF1, which are largely&#xD;
      overexpressed in many models of muscular atrophy and cancer cachexia . On the other hand, the&#xD;
      growth factor IGF1 is a known anabolic factor which activates the proteosynthesis via the&#xD;
      signaling pathway PI3K / Akt / mTOR . The decrease in IGF1 expression in skeletal muscle is&#xD;
      observed in experimental models of cancer cachexia . Studies have shown that certain factors&#xD;
      of tumor origin may contribute to cancer cachexia in some animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 factors have particularly attracted the attention of scientists in recent years, the ZAG&#xD;
      factor (Zinc alpha 2 glycoprotein), a veritable lipid mobilization factor in humans ,&#xD;
      overexpressed in the liver and adipose tissue and PIF (proteoglycan identified in mouse&#xD;
      murine adenocarcinoma tumor cells which would be responsible for muscle wasting induced by&#xD;
      the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome-ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway . More recent&#xD;
      work suggests that Myostatin and Activin A, two members of the TGFβ superfamily, may&#xD;
      contribute to cachexia, particularly muscular atrophy, induced by certain cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose loss is an early syndrome in the development of cancer cachexia and is negatively&#xD;
      correlated with patient life expectancy . Early studies on this adipose melt revealed a lack&#xD;
      of storage of triglycerides in adipose tissue . The storage of triglycerides is achieved by&#xD;
      the action of lipoprotein lipase. It predominantly exists in adipose tissue and hydrolyzes&#xD;
      lipoproteins circulating in the blood, thus allowing the capture of fatty acids by adipocytes&#xD;
      and storage of adipose reserves . The development of the tumor would induce a decrease in the&#xD;
      gene expression and activity of lipoprotein lipase via the action of inflammatory cytokines .&#xD;
      However, current research seems to demonstrate that the adipose melt observed in cancer&#xD;
      cachexia is mostly explained by an increase in lipolysis (shown indirectly by an increase in&#xD;
      plasma fatty acid concentration in cachectic patients with gastrointestinal cancer). .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipolysis, via hormone-sensitive lipase (LHS) and monoglyceride lipase (MGL), allows the&#xD;
      hydrolysis of triglycerides into diglycerides and diglycerides into monoglycerides themselves&#xD;
      degraded into free fatty acids and glycerol. Adipose tissue-specific triglyceride lipase&#xD;
      (TGLA) has recently been discovered and has a role that is redundant to that of LHS. Studies&#xD;
      of Cao et al. showed that the activation of LHS by catecholamines could constitute a&#xD;
      mechanism of regulation of lipolysis during cancer cachexia. . An alteration of TGLA and LHS&#xD;
      would also be responsible for an accumulation of DAG and TAG in the muscle of cancerous mice&#xD;
      . A recent study showed that the invalidation of TGLA and LHS in 2 models of cachexia induced&#xD;
      by injection of Lewis pulmonary carcinoma cells or B16 melanoma cells induced resistance to&#xD;
      the development of cachexia by limiting adipose and muscular loss . Systemic inflammation&#xD;
      developed during cancerous cachexia could also induce an increase in insulin resistance via&#xD;
      TNFalpha . TNFalpha could inhibit the expression of perilipin A, a protein expressed on the&#xD;
      surface of adipocyte lipid droplets , which plays a major role in the integrity of adipose&#xD;
      tissue since it limits the access of enzymes involved in lipolysis to the lipid droplet . A&#xD;
      decrease in the expression of perilipin A would induce an increase in lipolysis. In addition,&#xD;
      a study by Stephens et al. in 2011 concluded that the number and size of intramuscular lipid&#xD;
      droplets are increased in the presence of cancer and also increase with weight loss / adipose&#xD;
      fat loss in other body compartments .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myosteatosis, a pathological fatty deposit in skeletal muscle, is another characteristic of&#xD;
      body composition, in addition to low muscle mass, which is associated with the poor prognosis&#xD;
      of the cancer disease, in particular a decrease in overall survival and it has recently been&#xD;
      shown that the muscle of cancer patients contains all the more adipose tissue that severe&#xD;
      weight loss . Several studies have shown that myosteatosis is associated with an increase in&#xD;
      insulin resistance and therefore a decrease in proteolysis via the inhibition of insulin&#xD;
      transport of amino acids. The fat content of the muscle may be indirectly and non-invasively&#xD;
      studied on the basis that the adipose tissue typically attenuates the radiation applied&#xD;
      thereto. . The value of the attenuation measurements are determined by the rate at which the&#xD;
      radiation passes through the tissue and is expressed in Hounsfield units (HU). Muscle and&#xD;
      adipose tissue attenuation values were defined between -190 and -30 HU .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weakening of the radiation in the muscle was correlated well with the fat content of the&#xD;
      muscles. . Thus, the HU values defined by the CT scan may reflect the degree of intramuscular&#xD;
      adipose tissue and are used to categorize the muscle of normal or exposed to myosteatosis .&#xD;
      Low muscle mass and weakening of the radiation in muslce testify of high degree of&#xD;
      myostaatosis and were identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and&#xD;
      mortality in cancer patients, respectively. . The comparison of muscle metabolism in obese&#xD;
      and normoponded subjects showed an abolition of protein synthesis in response to insulin&#xD;
      especially in muscle mitochondria in overweight subjects. Interestingly, muscle protein&#xD;
      renewal was inversely correlated with fat mass. Such an observation raises the question of&#xD;
      the possibility of a deleterious effect of fat mass on protein synthesis. The hypothesis of&#xD;
      this lipotoxicity was confirmed by a work carried out in the rat which showed that the&#xD;
      synthesis of the muscle proteins is slowed down when there is infiltration of fat into the&#xD;
      muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the cellular level, metabolism is governed by the mitochondria which provides 90% of our&#xD;
      energy in the form of ATP. This energy is synthesized within oxidative phosphorylation, which&#xD;
      consists of 2 entities (the respiratory chain and ATP synthase) and which allows the&#xD;
      conversion, in water and ATP, of the reduced equivalents resulting from dehydrogenation&#xD;
      reactions (and Decarboxylation) of energetic nutrients, in the presence of dioxygen (O2) and&#xD;
      ADP, according to chemosmotic coupling theory . The decoupling of oxidative phosphorylation&#xD;
      may be involved in involuntary weight loss. The work of Romestaing et al. Showed that weight&#xD;
      loss following the development of a steatosis was associated with a decrease in the ATP / O2&#xD;
      ratio . Mitochondrial dysfunctions could therefore have a direct effect on the protein&#xD;
      degradation observed during cancer cachexia. In addition, systemic inflammation caused by the&#xD;
      development of the tumor can also affect mitochondrial bioenergetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The works of Hochwald et al. were among the first to suggest an alteration of muscle&#xD;
      mitochondrial metabolism by demonstrating a decrease in ATP concentration in the&#xD;
      gastrocnemius of rats with MCA sarcoma . The recent works of Constantinou and col. confirmed&#xD;
      this hypothesis by demonstrating in vivo by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) a reduction&#xD;
      in the rate of synthesis of ATP on the lower limb of mice with Lewis pulmonary carcinoma&#xD;
      compared to its healthy mice . This work suggested a decrease in the ability to synthesize&#xD;
      ATP during cancerous cachexia through decoupling proteins such as UCP3 . This decrease in ATP&#xD;
      synthesis could also be explained by alterations in the functioning of the mitochondrial&#xD;
      respiratory chain .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Julienne and col. in 2012 studied the mitochondrial activity of skeletal muscles in murine&#xD;
      models of cancer cachexia based on the ATP / Oxygen ratio and concluded that muscular&#xD;
      mitochondrial oxidative capacities were reduced by decreasing the activity of complex IV,&#xD;
      responsible for muscle loss and accumulation of free fatty acids in muscle (myosteatosis)&#xD;
      since less oxidized by mitochondria. They also observed that the expression of MURF1 and&#xD;
      MAF-Box (proteolytically active ligases) was increased in the muscle of rats with cancers .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancerous cachexia affects about 80% of patients with advanced cancer and increases their&#xD;
      prognosis by increasing their morbidity and mortality. It is defined as a loss of lean mass&#xD;
      especially muscular resulting from an imbalance between proteolysis and proteogenesis. It has&#xD;
      been shown that the presence of cancer in the murine model favors the development of&#xD;
      myosteatosis, which is linked, among other things, to alteration of muscle lipases and a&#xD;
      decrease in mitochondrial activity, the consequence of which is a decrease Of the oxidation&#xD;
      by the latter of free fatty acids which would consequently accumulate in the muscle of mice&#xD;
      suffering from cancer. It is known that this myosteatosis then induced is responsible for an&#xD;
      insulin resistance participating in a decrease in proteogenesis and therefore in weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective here is to confirm this same hypothesis in humans by studying the&#xD;
      influence of cachexia on muscle mitochondrial activity as a marker of myosteatosis in&#xD;
      patients with cancer of the upper air-digestive tract, cachectic or not, and non-cachectic&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from ENT and Cervico-facial Surgery at CHU Gabriel Montpied in&#xD;
      Clermont-Ferrand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients in 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group K +: cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract with or without cachexia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group K-: absence of cancer and absence of cachexia The recruitment arrangements for the&#xD;
           K + group will be made through a Multidisciplinary Consultation Meeting (RCP), the&#xD;
           decision of which is an exclusive or non-exclusive surgery. Before the protocol is&#xD;
           realized, during the preoperative consultation, an information sheet is given to the&#xD;
           patient and an informed consent in 2 copies is signed after a period of reflection of&#xD;
           the patient of 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion, the day before the surgery, patients benefit from a dual general and&#xD;
      nutritional evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of epidemiological data: age, medical and surgical history (cardiac&#xD;
           insufficiency, renal insufficiency, respiratory insufficiency, COPD, coronary artery&#xD;
           disease), ethyl intoxication (gram / day), tobacco poisoning (package / year), usual&#xD;
           treatment, tumor characteristics for group K+ (histological type, location, tumor stage,&#xD;
           nature of treatment), indication and nature of surgery for group K-, pre-operative&#xD;
           renutrition program for K + group (food supplements, enteral or parenteral feeding )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical nutritional evaluation: bodyweight (kg), weight loss in the last 6 months (kg),&#xD;
           height (m), body mass index (BMI in kg / m²) (NPH), Short Physical Performance Battery&#xD;
           (SPPB), muscle strength measurement by dynamometry (Newton), Impedancemetry (Kyle index,&#xD;
           Janssen index)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myostéatosic and nutritional morphological evaluation by, respectively, Hounsfield Unit&#xD;
           and Muscular Mass Index at L3 level (cm² / m²) by abdominal tomodensitometry for the K +&#xD;
           group (carried out in the cancer extension imaging balance)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will benefit from 4 organic samples during the planned surgery (carcinological&#xD;
      surgery for Group K +, cervical surgery for Group K-):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carrying out a muscle biopsy of the SCOM muscle with a total volume of about 300 mg,&#xD;
           without resorting to an additional invasive act. This sampling is immediately divided&#xD;
           into 6 samples and placed in a liquid nitrogen tank for transport to the place of&#xD;
           storage. It will then be frozen at -80 ° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carrying out a blood sample according to the following conditions: 1 dry tube, 1 EDTA&#xD;
           tube and 2 dry tubes for biochemistry The dry tube and the EDTA tube will be immediately&#xD;
           put in ice for transport to the storage site. It will then be immediately centrifuged&#xD;
           and then frozen at -80 ° C. The two dry tubes for biochemistry will be transmitted to&#xD;
           the laboratory of biochemistry of the CHU Gabriel-Montpied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carrying out a tumor biopsy with a total volume of approximately 200 mg without&#xD;
           resorting to an additional invasive procedure. This sampling is immediately divided into&#xD;
           4 samples and placed in a liquid nitrogen tank for transport to the place of storage. It&#xD;
           is then frozen at -80 ° C (only for K + Group).&#xD;
