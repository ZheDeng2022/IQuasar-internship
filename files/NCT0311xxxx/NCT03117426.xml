  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the introduction of intraocular lenses (IOL) in the treatment of cataract, the&#xD;
      postoperative accommodative loss of the human eye has been a trending topic. Numerous studies&#xD;
      show a high rate of spectacle-independency after bilateral implantation of multifocal IOLs&#xD;
      (MIOL). However, glare, halos, and reduced visual acuity under different light conditions are&#xD;
      common complaints after MIOL implantation. Due to its unique design, the TECNIS® Symfony&#xD;
      Extended Range of Vision ZXR00 IOL (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, USA, hereinafter&#xD;
      referred to as Symfony IOL) is theoretically providing a continuous range of high-quality&#xD;
      vision for far, intermediate, and near distances with the same low incidence of halos and&#xD;
      glare associated with monofocal IOLs under different light conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to compare the AT LISA tri 839MP IOL (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena,&#xD;
      Germany, hereinafter referred to as AT LISA IOL) versus the Symfony IOL in terms of&#xD;
      postoperative achieved visual acuity at different distances, patient satisfaction (e.g.&#xD;
      spectacle-independency, QoL), and postoperative complication profile (e.g. halo's and glare)&#xD;
      under different light conditions. So far, there are no published studies comparing both IOLs.&#xD;
      Therefore, we will perform this randomized control trial.&#xD;

      Rationale: Since the introduction of intraocular lenses (IOL) in the treatment of cataract,&#xD;
      the postoperative accommodative loss of the human eye has been a trending topic. Numerous&#xD;
      studies show a high rate of spectacle-independency after bilateral implantation of multifocal&#xD;
      IOLs (MIOL). However, glare, halos, and reduced visual acuity under different light&#xD;
      conditions are common complaints after MIOL implantation. Due to its unique design, the&#xD;
      TECNIS® Symfony Extended Range of Vision ZXR00 IOL (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, USA,&#xD;
      hereinafter referred to as Symfony IOL) is theoretically providing a continuous range of&#xD;
      high-quality vision for far, intermediate, and near distances with the same low incidence of&#xD;
      halos and glare associated with monofocal IOLs under different light conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to compare the AT LISA tri 839MP IOL (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena,&#xD;
      Germany, hereinafter referred to as AT LISA IOL) versus the Symfony IOL in terms of&#xD;
      postoperative achieved visual acuity at different distances, patient satisfaction (e.g.&#xD;
      spectacle-independency, QoL), and postoperative complication profile (e.g. halo's and glare)&#xD;
      under different light conditions. So far, there are no published studies comparing both IOLs.&#xD;
      Therefore, we will perform this randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to compare the postoperative visual&#xD;
      outcomes in a series of patients bilaterally implanted with the AT LISA IOL versus those&#xD;
      bilaterally implanted with the Symfony IOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single-centre randomised clinical trial. Study population: 30 patients (60&#xD;
      eyes) with bilateral cataract who require cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of either a&#xD;
      Symfony IOL or an AT LISA IOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the binocular uncorrected visual&#xD;
      acuity at 66 cm distance under both photopic and mesopic conditions 13 weeks postoperatively.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are: binocular (un)corrected visual acuity at far (4 meters) and near (40&#xD;
      cm) under both photopic and mesopic conditions, reading performance, patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      and complication profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Both lens models used in this study are CE-marked and commercially available.&#xD;
      The pre- and postoperatively examinations to be performed in this study are part of the&#xD;
      regular medical treatment of patients with cataract who need cataract surgery. There is one&#xD;
      more postoperative visit compared to standard cataract surgery. Potential risks, such as&#xD;
      postoperative residual refractive error, halo's and glare, associated with multifocal IOL&#xD;
      implantation are expected to be comparable or even lower after implantation of Symfony IOL.&#xD;
      Spectacle-independency and high quality visual acuity postoperatively are the expected major&#xD;
      benefits of implantation of the Symfony IOL.&#xD;

    <description>The unique design of this IOL merges two complementary enabling technologies: (1) its diffractive echelette design feature extends the range of vision, and (2) achromatic technology corrects chromatic aberration for enhanced contrast sensitivity. Theoretically, combining these two mechanism of action results in a continuous range of high-quality vision for far, intermediate, and near distances with the same low incidence of halos and glare associated with monofocal IOLs (see figure 2).&#xD;
Primary indication is implantation for the visual correction in adult patients in whom a cataractous lens has been removed, who desire useful vision over a continuous range of distances including far, intermediate, and near, resulting in spectacle independency. This device is intended to be placed in the capsular bag.</description>

    <description>This trifocal IOL provides three useful focal distances, far, intermediate, and near, and therefore aims to provide functional visual restoration after cataract surgery.&#xD;
