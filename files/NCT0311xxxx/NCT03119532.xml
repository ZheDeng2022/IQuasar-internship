  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 40 million major operative procedures are performed in the US annually and comprise&#xD;
      about 40% of healthcare expenditures. Despite decades of research, perioperative mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity remain a major healthcare system cost and detriment to long-term quality of&#xD;
      life. More than ten percent of patients experience a significant event such as surgical site&#xD;
      infection, reoperation, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, or death. Nearly 100,000&#xD;
      patients die after surgery each year. National data demonstrate a 3-fold variation in risk&#xD;
      adjusted surgical morbidity and mortality, suggesting many opportunities for improvement in&#xD;
      perioperative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesiology care demonstrates wide variation in practice. Sometimes, this variation is&#xD;
      appropriate because the anesthesiologist is responding to patient comorbidities or procedure&#xD;
      specific events. However, even after controlling for patient specific factors, there is a&#xD;
      substantial amount of unexplained variation in fundamental elements of anesthesiology care.&#xD;
      The same procedure and patient can be performed using completely different anesthetic&#xD;
      techniques, hemodynamic management strategies, and medications. This variation in care can&#xD;
      lead to a variation in outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of electronic health records (EHR) with detailed preoperative and intraoperative data&#xD;
      allows an automated system to be developed to notify clinicians their compliance to both&#xD;
      process of care metrics and outcome metrics. The Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group&#xD;
      (MPOG) quality improvement arm is known as Anesthesiology Performance Improvement Reporting&#xD;
      Exchange (ASPIRE). Like other Collaborative Quality Initiatives, the primary goal of ASPIRE&#xD;
      is to provide hospitals with risk-adjusted feedback on outcome and process of care variation.&#xD;
      In addition, ASPIRE creates an active best-practice sharing environment to enable data to&#xD;
      spur action. Recent literature has demonstrated that hospital-level feedback may not be&#xD;
      adequate to improve performance and clinical outcomes. In addition to hospital level data and&#xD;
      feedback, ASPIRE can disseminate provider-specific electronic feedback that may decrease&#xD;
      variation in care known to impact complications and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim for this research study on ASPIRE's QI program is to determine if the&#xD;
      investigators can change behavior as measured by a provider's compliance to specific&#xD;
      performance metrics. The investigators believe that the start of individual provider&#xD;
      performance feedback reports to ASPIRE members presents a unique opportunity to research the&#xD;
      efficacy of these novel tools. The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that monthly&#xD;
      provider specific feedback emails on ASPIRE quality metrics over a period of 9 months&#xD;
      improves provider compliance as measured by a either a 10% improvement in the Total&#xD;
      Performance Score or by moving from below to above the 90% performance threshold in the Total&#xD;
      Performance Score Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each provider type (faculty, CRNA, resident/fellow) within a hospital participating in ASPIRE&#xD;
      will be individually randomized to either receiving the electronic performance improvement&#xD;
      email or not for a total of nine months. No individual at the participating site will see the&#xD;
      individualized email compliance reports except for the specific provider. Only an aggregate&#xD;
      of the compliance across the entire hospital will be supplied to the chairperson and the&#xD;
      quality assurance directors. After the completion of the nine month randomization period, all&#xD;
      providers will receive monthly ASPIRE performance improvement emails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Michigan is the coordinating center but also participating in this research&#xD;
      on QI project. De-identified patient data will be pulled in aggregate for each provider using&#xD;
      the MPOG database. The provider performance for each measure will then be sent from ASPIRE to&#xD;
      the randomized care provider via an email. The chairperson and quality assurance directors&#xD;
      will only see aggregate data on compliance rates and can NOT identify individual compliance&#xD;
      rates. Each participating site will obtain their own institutional IRB to participate in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      Anesthesiology care demonstrates wide variation in practice. Sometimes, this variation is&#xD;
      appropriate because the anesthesiologist is responding to patient comorbidities or procedure&#xD;
      specific events. However, even after controlling for patient specific factors, there is a&#xD;
      substantial amount of unexplained variation in fundamental elements of anesthesiology care.&#xD;
      The same procedure and patient can be performed using completely different anesthetic&#xD;
      techniques, hemodynamic management strategies, and medications. This variation in care can&#xD;
      lead to a variation in outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic Management: Despite expert opinion that blood pressure should be maintained&#xD;
           within 20% of baseline, several studies have demonstrated that more than 40% of patients&#xD;
           experience profound hypotension in the operating room, defined as systolic blood&#xD;
           pressure of 79 mmHg or below. These blood pressure levels have been demonstrated to be&#xD;
           associated with acute kidney injury, myocardial ischemia, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative ventilation strategies: A recent prospective, randomized trial in major&#xD;
           abdominal surgery demonstrated that the use of low intraoperative tidal volumes&#xD;
           decreases the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, including pneumonia and&#xD;
           reintubation, by more than 50%, with no additional costs or adverse events. The use of&#xD;
           large tidal volumes and failure to administer intraoperative recruitment maneuvers is&#xD;
           widespread.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuromuscular blockade (paralysis): The use of intraoperative neuromuscular blockade for&#xD;
           many patients undergoing general anesthesia is necessary to optimize surgical conditions&#xD;
           and prevent catastrophic injury due to unintended patient movement. However, several&#xD;
           trials have now demonstrated that most patients suffer from residual neuromuscular&#xD;
           blockade at the conclusion of surgery, resulting in markedly increased risk of&#xD;
           postoperative hypoxia, pneumonia, reintubation, and prolonged recovery room stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluid balance: Although fluid administration strategies have been studied in small&#xD;
           prospective trials extensively, basic consensus regarding the definition of &quot;liberal&quot;&#xD;
           versus &quot;restrictive&quot; intraoperative fluid administration is absent. Prospective&#xD;
           randomized controlled trials of restrictive fluid administration combined with&#xD;
           vasopressor administration in major abdominal cases have demonstrated markedly reduced&#xD;
           complications and length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluid choice: The use of colloid fluid therapy has been demonstrated to increase costs&#xD;
           without an improvement in outcomes, yet there are no signs that the use of albumin or&#xD;
           synthetic colloids has decreased. In addition, despite overwhelming evidence that&#xD;
           discretionary transfusion of red blood cells above a hemoglobin of 10 mg/dl is rarely&#xD;
           indicated, recent data demonstrate its continued occurrence in many perioperative&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of electronic health records (EHR) with detailed preoperative and intraoperative data&#xD;
      allows an automated system to be developed to notify clinicians their compliance to both&#xD;
      process of care metrics and outcome metrics. The primary goal of ASPIRE is to provide&#xD;
      hospitals with confidential risk-adjusted feedback on outcome and process of care variation.&#xD;
      In addition, ASPIRE creates an active best-practice sharing environment to enable data to&#xD;
      spur action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent literature has demonstrated that hospital-level feedback may not be adequate to&#xD;
      improve performance and clinical outcomes. In addition to hospital level data and feedback,&#xD;
      ASPIRE can disseminate provider-specific feedback that may decrease variation in care known&#xD;
      to impact complications and cost. ASPIRE uses the underlying EHR data integration foundation&#xD;
      of the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group to aggregate and analyze process of care and&#xD;
      outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no anesthesia standard for quality improvement practice regarding&#xD;
      provider-specific feedback. The primary aim of this research study on ASPIRE's QI program is&#xD;
      to determine whether provider-specific feedback affects quality improvement performance&#xD;
      metrics. The investigators believe that the start of individual provider performance feedback&#xD;
      reports to ASPIRE members presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of these&#xD;
      tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that monthly provider specific feedback&#xD;
      emails on ASPIRE quality metrics over a period of 9 months improves provider compliance as&#xD;
      measured by a either a 10% improvement in the Total Performance Score or by moving from below&#xD;
      to above the 90% performance threshold in the Total Performance Score Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-defined process of care and outcome metrics will be calculated using the Multicenter&#xD;
      Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG) database. De-identified patient data will be extracted&#xD;
      from the MPOG database in aggregate for the anesthesia providers to determine their overall&#xD;
      compliance to the process of care and outcome metrics. The compliance metrics for each&#xD;
      provider will be stored in the MPOG/ASPIRE database. Any measure implemented in production in&#xD;
      between July 1, 2015 and July 1, 2016 will be incorporated into the analysis. The quality&#xD;
      improvement system generates a monthly email to the provider stating their performance&#xD;
      compared against the performance of their peers for each measure. Each measure is then&#xD;
      hyperlinked back into ASPIRE web-based dashboard where the provider can review the cases that&#xD;
      they failed on each measure. The visualization removes protected health information but is&#xD;
      the representation of the physiologic monitoring, medication and fluids administered,&#xD;
      laboratory values, and time-based events of the procedure. Provider attribution for each&#xD;
      measure will follow existing ASPIRE specifications (available at&#xD;
      https://www.aspirecqi.org/aspire-measures ). Each provider type (faculty, CRNA,&#xD;
      resident/fellow) within a hospital participating in ASPIRE will be individually randomized to&#xD;
      either receiving the electronic performance improvement email or not for a total of nine&#xD;
      months. After the completion of the nine month randomization period, all providers will&#xD;
      receive monthly ASPIRE performance improvement emails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the project, clinical outcomes of interest will be extracted from the&#xD;
      MPOG database via an honest broker using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes and all-cause 30 day&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASPIRE Quality Measures: Measure Description BP 01: Avoiding intraoperative hypotension (mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure less than 55 mmHg) BP 02: Avoiding gaps in systolic or mean arterial&#xD;

&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analysis will be completed using a de-identified dataset for which the&#xD;
      analyst will have no link back to each of the individual's unique names. The investigators&#xD;
      will combine several key process of care measures into a process of care bundle for the&#xD;
      analysis. The bundle for each participating site will include the process of care quality&#xD;
      measures included on month 1 of the email feedback program. If there were more than one&#xD;
      instance that a provider could pass or fail for a specific case, if the provider passed or&#xD;
      failed at least once it would pass or fail for the entire case. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      the proportion of providers that achieve improvement in performance from start to end of the&#xD;
      study period. The investigators will exclude providers that already met all the metric&#xD;
      thresholds for the primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary analysis will include all providers. Secondary analysis will include performers&#xD;
      not meeting threshold measures. Improvement in performance will be determined by the&#xD;
      following method:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The performance rates for the measures of each site's bundle will be summed. This total&#xD;
           will be known as the Total Performance Score. The Total Performance Score Index will be&#xD;
           the score divided by the number of measures in the bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improvement is defined as greater than or equal to 10% change in the performance index&#xD;
           from beginning to end of study, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Total Performance Score Index crossing the 90% threshold between study beginning or end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The threshold for what will be considered a performer not meeting threshold measures will be&#xD;
      determined by examining the distribution of the bundle compliance. Randomization is&#xD;
      pre-determined at the start of the project and is NOT based on if the provider is classified&#xD;
      as a performer meeting threshold measures or not. Each provider's baseline compliance rate&#xD;
      will be determined by the performance from the first month's feedback email. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will do a secondary analysis investigating if the providers that met all the&#xD;
      threshold metrics prior to the project further improved during the study period. A sub-group&#xD;
      analysis excluding the coordinating center is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will only include sites where all provider types are randomized&#xD;
      (attendings/residents/CRNAs). Sites where one provider type (ie attending or CRNA) was&#xD;
      randomized and the other provider type was not will be included in a secondary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the investigators primary hypothesis of the impact of provider-specific emails on&#xD;
      overall compliance during the nine-month study period, a repeated measures generalized linear&#xD;
      model (GLM) will be used. Between-subjects (randomization to email) and within-subjects&#xD;
      (compliance) analyses will be reported. The primary analysis will be stratified by provider&#xD;
      type (faculty, fellow, resident, and CRNA). A sub-group analysis excluding the coordinating&#xD;
      center is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the investigators secondary analysis to determine if a provider who already met the&#xD;
      threshold performance metric prior to the study further increased in their compliance a&#xD;
      linear regression will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome analyses will be performed only using data related to inpatient / admit day of&#xD;
      procedure operations. First, to determine if providers receiving an email about the&#xD;
      participants specific bundled compliance affects a patient's overall combined morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality a binary logistic regression model will be used. The dependent variable will be&#xD;
      combined morbidity and mortality as a Boolean concept. The independent variables entered into&#xD;
      the model will be: primary provider AND primary attending both received an email, primary&#xD;
      provider did NOT receive an email but the primary attending did receive an email, primary&#xD;
      provider did receive an email but the primary attending did NOT receive an email, elixhauser&#xD;
      comorbidity score of 2 or more, ASA (binary concept as 1,2 versus 3,4), age (binned by decade&#xD;
      of life), male gender, BMI (defined by the World Health Organization Classifications). The&#xD;
      investigators can then determine whether providers receiving feedback emails have a risk&#xD;
      adjusted improved combined morbidity and mortality rate. If the investigators find this to be&#xD;
      true, a mediation analysis at the provider level will be performed to determine if our&#xD;
      independent variable (email received) influences the mediator variable (bundle compliance&#xD;
      rate) which thereby influences the dependent variable (outcome of interest). The&#xD;
      investigators will report the direct effect for receiving the email on the provider's outcome&#xD;
      rate as well as the indirect effect of the email that passes through the bundle compliance&#xD;
      rate to affect the outcome rate. These values will be reported as the proportion of total&#xD;
      effect that is mediated by compliance. Sensitivity analyses for residents/fellow and CRNAs&#xD;
      will also be performed. A sub-group analysis excluding the coordinating center is planned.&#xD;
