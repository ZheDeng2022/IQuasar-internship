  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to determine if anatomic/kinematic total knee arthroplasties&#xD;
      (TKAs) are superior to mechanical axis-referenced TKAs with respect to determinants of gait&#xD;
      functionality, patient satisfaction and other objective tests of knee function as a potential&#xD;
      indicator of long-term prosthesis outcomes. To our knowledge there has not been any&#xD;
      literature comparing TKAs using the kinematic and mechanical axes with respect to gait&#xD;
      analysis. A single study has compared gender-specific TKAs and found that there is no&#xD;
      difference with respect to determinants of gait when using these prostheses (Thomsen et al,&#xD;
      2012), but again this study was not based on referencing off of the anatomical/kinematic axis&#xD;
      of the knee. Our group is hoping that the small variability that may be detectable with the&#xD;
      precision of gait analysis may be used as a predictor of future prosthesis outcome measures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The reference standard for total knee replacement or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has&#xD;
      historically been based on a 2-dimensional &quot;mechanical axis&quot; of the knee which surgically&#xD;
      creates a joint line parallel to the ground. This is based on the idea that this alignment&#xD;
      will evenly distribute the stress on the prosthesis, thus improving the wear characteristics&#xD;
      and longevity of the replacement. More recent studies have shown that TKAs with greater than&#xD;
      3 degree deviation (in either valgus or varus) from this previously accepted ideal does not&#xD;
      convey a survival benefit over a 15 year period. This is not to say that alignment does not&#xD;
      play a role in survivorship as gross deviation from neutral does result in earlier implant&#xD;
      failure, but a simple 2-D model may not be the ideal approach to TKAs. With the developments&#xD;
      and improvements in patient-specific technology (or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI)),&#xD;
      our ability to create TKAs that reproduce the patient's original anatomic or kinematic&#xD;
      alignment in 3-Dimensions has dramatically improved. Early research with respect to function&#xD;
      and survivorship has shown that PSIs are at least equivalent when compared to conventional&#xD;
      TKAs. Some studies have also suggested improvements with respect to shorter operating times,&#xD;
      less blood loss and increased range of motion. Most of the current PSI TKA literature has&#xD;
      placed an emphasis on the technology's effect on TKA alignment or to show that it is&#xD;
      bioequivalent with respect to range of motion or early prosthesis survivorship when compared&#xD;
      to conventional TKAs. Although a single study using PSIs (Howell et al., 2013) has shown&#xD;
      improvement in Oxford Knee Scores when comparing patients preoperatively to postoperatively,&#xD;
      to our knowledge there is no research done to directly compare the functional knee scores&#xD;
      between a mechanically-aligned and anatomically aligned TKA. This randomized control trial&#xD;
      will compare these two approaches using implants from the same manufacturer and also hope to&#xD;
      identify more subtle functional differences using power testing and gait analysis, in&#xD;
      addition to assessing other perioperative outcomes such as blood loss, hospital stay duration&#xD;
      and operative time.&#xD;
