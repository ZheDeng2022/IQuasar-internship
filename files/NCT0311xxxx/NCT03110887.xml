      Rationale: Approximately 10% of neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units develop a&#xD;
      major hemorrhage. In an attempt to avert this severe complication various preventive measures&#xD;
      have been implemented. One of these is the transfusion of platelets to premature neonates&#xD;
      with low platelet counts. However, this practice is not supported by scientific evidence.&#xD;
      Most neonates with low platelet counts never experience a major bleeding and platelet&#xD;
      transfusions may carry risks of volume overload or infection. Therefore, it is important to&#xD;
      treat only those patients that truly benefit from this intervention. We urgently need a&#xD;
      scientifically based tool to predict which premature neonates are at risk for major bleeding.&#xD;
      A few prediction models do exist, but these only allow assessment of bleeding risk at&#xD;
      baseline, and do not correct for changes in clinical status during the admission period. We&#xD;
      believe that adding this feature to our prediction model will significantly improve our&#xD;
      ability to predict bleeding. The prediction model will also be helpful in developing&#xD;
      individualized transfusion guidelines as it helps us to predict which neonates would benefit&#xD;
      from prophylactic platelet transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: to develop a dynamic prediction model for bleeding in preterm neonates with&#xD;
      low platelet counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: retrospective observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: neonates with a gestational age at birth of &lt; 34 weeks admitted to a&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), with a thrombocyte count of less than 50x109/L will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: only data generated through standard care will be collected. This includes&#xD;
      platelet counts, cerebral ultrasounds, information about bleeding and transfusions, and&#xD;
      multiple clinical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoint: major bleeding during admission&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: dynamic prediction model using landmarking.&#xD;

      2. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 The relationship between thrombocytopenia and bleeding A complex relation exists between&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia in preterm neonates and bleeding. This is illustrated by a recent&#xD;
      observational study that demonstrated that only 9% of neonates with a very low platelet count&#xD;
      developed major bleeding.(1) Moreover, patients with normal platelet counts bleed quite&#xD;
      frequently, as evidenced by another study in which 25-38% of the patients with an IVH did not&#xD;
      have thrombocytopenia.(2,3) Several recent reviews have highlighted that the fact that&#xD;
      neonatal bleeding and neonatal thrombocytopenia often occur in the same timeframe, does not&#xD;
      necessarily imply a causal relationship.(4,5) It is difficult to identify the role of&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia in bleeding, because bleeding is a multifactorial process, and because there&#xD;
      are a lot of interactions between bleeding, thrombocytopenia and clinical variables.&#xD;
      Moreover, neonatal platelets appear to be different from adult platelets in many ways, which&#xD;
      complicates our understanding of the effect of low platelet counts on bleeding risk, or the&#xD;
      effect of transfusion of (adult) platelets in the neonatal system.(6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 potential prognostic variables The most important known risk factor for bleeding is low&#xD;
      gestational age.(1) In the specific case of IVH, it is thought that the prematurity of the&#xD;
      brain - which has a highly vascularized germinal matrix that can easily be damaged - is an&#xD;
      important causal factor. However, several other factors have been associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of bleeding, for example low Apgar scores, acidosis, vaginal birth, need for&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, disordered coagulation,NEC, DIC, indomethacin or surfactant&#xD;
      treatment, low oxygen saturation levels, a low Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP),&#xD;
      and many more. But many of these studies have severe limitations such as lack of multivariate&#xD;
      analysis, unclear selection of controls, small numbers and different study populations. Most&#xD;
      are also limited to a baseline risk assessment, without a possibility to correct the risk&#xD;
      assessment as the clinical status of the child changes. Therefore there is no clarity as to&#xD;
      which factors are really relevant in clinical practice when assessing neonatal bleeding in&#xD;
      neonates with thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Current prediction models A few prediction models for neonatal bleeding have been&#xD;
      published, but to our understanding, none of these is used regularly in clinical&#xD;
      practice.(7-9) The main disadvantage of these models is that they only allow assessment of&#xD;
      bleeding risk at baseline, and do not correct for changes in clinical status during the&#xD;
      admission period. We believe that adding this feature to our prediction model will&#xD;
      significantly improve our ability to predict bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 The MONET study The MONET study is a retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort&#xD;
      study that assesses risk factors for neonatal bleeding in thrombocytopenic preterm neonates.&#xD;
      This population is chosen because these are the neonates that are currently being treated&#xD;
      with prophylactic thrombocyte transfusions. The results of this study will allow us to&#xD;
      identify neonates within this population that are at high risk of bleeding. These neonates&#xD;
      may potentially benefit from different treatment strategies. Also, modifiable risk factors&#xD;
      can be further explored as potential targets for preventing neonatal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a dynamic prediction model for bleeding in preterm neonates with low platelet&#xD;
      counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective observational cohort study. Timeframe in which data will be collected is 5&#xD;
      years (2010-2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Population (base) Neonates will be selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      defined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the Netherlands, including&#xD;
           postnatal transfers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gestational age at birth &lt; 34 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A platelet count of &lt;50 x109/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;
      participation in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Severe congenital malformations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. High suspicion of spurious platelet count (e.g. clots in the sample, or very rapid&#xD;
           'recovery' to previous non-severely thrombocytopenic levels);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Thrombocytopenia which occurred exclusively in the context of exchange transfusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prior admission to a NICU (only first admissions to NICU's will be included. Postnatal&#xD;
           transfers from non-NICU's will be included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Sample size calculation Data on the frequency of bleeding outcomes in severely&#xD;
      thrombocytopenic neonates are available from the PlaNeT-1 survey in which 15/169 or 9% of&#xD;
      neonates experienced a major bleed while on study.(1) However, this proportion applies to&#xD;
      neonates of all gestational ages. Other studies show incidences in premature neonates of&#xD;
      7-11%, depending on the type of population studied.(3,10,11) Assuming an event rate of&#xD;
      approximately 10%, we calculated that for testing 5 variables we will need a sample size of&#xD;
      500 neonates, because we will need approximately 10 events per tested variable. Each year,&#xD;
      4000 neonates are admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, of which approximately 5%&#xD;
      have severe thrombocytopenia. Therefore, we expect 200 eligible neonates each year, and a&#xD;
      total sample size of 1000 neonates, which will allow us to include a maximum of 10 variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Main study endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major or severe bleeding during admission is the primary outcome. This has been defined as&#xD;
      either one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3 (&gt;50% of ventricle filled with blood)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intraventricular hemorrhage of any grade in combination with parenchymal involvement.&#xD;
           Information about dimensions will be collected: maximum diameter of &lt;1 cm, or 1-2 cm or&#xD;
           &gt;2 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Parenchymal hemorrhage (without IVH) visible on ultrasound (contrary to small bleeds&#xD;
           visible only on MRI). Information about size will be collected: maximum diameter &lt;1 cm,&#xD;
           1-2 cm or &gt;2 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cerebellar hemorrhage visible on ultrasound (contrary to small bleeds visible only on&#xD;
           MRI). The maximum diameter of the bleeding will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Other types of intracranial hemorrhage. The maximum diameter will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pulmonary hemorrhage, defined as fresh blood from the endotracheal tube in combination&#xD;
           with increased ventilatory requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Any other type of hemorrhage, if major. A bleeding was considered major if it required&#xD;
           or was related to either one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Red cell transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Volume boluses&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Need for inotropes (either start of inotrope therapy, or increased dose of current&#xD;
                therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Significant drop in blood pressure The first time a major bleed was diagnosed is&#xD;
                the endpoint for this study. Date and time of first major bleed will be recorded,&#xD;
                if the exact time cannot be retrieved from the medical file, an estimate will be&#xD;
                computed based on what is known about the timing (for example, that it occurred in&#xD;
                an evening shift, or that it occurred after 16:00).&#xD;
&#xD;
                6.2 Clinical variables The initial strategy was to select clinical variables&#xD;
                through a systematic review of the literature in combination with expert advice.&#xD;
                The review was started, but yielded over 8000 abstracts, and over 1000 included&#xD;
                full texts, and was therefore considered too large for the scope of this project.&#xD;
                However, an overview of the clinical variables assessed in these papers was made,&#xD;
                and will be taken into account during the variable selection process. Clinical&#xD;
                variables will be selected based on literature in combination with expert advice.&#xD;
                Exclusion of a variable will be considered when the variable is not not&#xD;
                consistently documented in medical records, when few studies concerning this&#xD;
                variable have been published, when multiple published studies show a weak&#xD;
                association with bleeding, when a strong interaction with another variable is&#xD;
                expected (e.g. birth weight and IUGR), or when the variable is difficult to measure&#xD;
                regularly (e.g. blood parameters that need large blood samples).&#xD;
&#xD;
                6.3 study procedures Data will be collected by study personnel, including research&#xD;
                nurses, datamanagers and medical students under supervision of the principal&#xD;
                investigator. Data will be collected from the hospital's written or online patient&#xD;
                record files, recorded imaging reports and nurses records. Data collection ends&#xD;
                when a neonate is transferred out of the neonatal intensive care unit, when a major&#xD;
                bleed occurs, or when a neonate dies.&#xD;
&#xD;
                7. SAFETY REPORTING&#xD;
&#xD;
                MONET is an observational study, therefore we consider reporting of adverse events&#xD;
                or serious adverse events not applicable for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
                The development of the prediction model will take place in cooperation with several&#xD;
                experts, including prof. dr. J.G. van der Bom, professor in clinical transfusion&#xD;
                medicine, and prof dr. H. Putter, professor of medical statistics and an expert in&#xD;
                dynamic prediction modelling. We will develop a dynamic prediction model using&#xD;
                landmarking, as described elsewhere.(12) A statistical analysis plan will be&#xD;
                written and signed prior to any analysis. Variables to be included in the model&#xD;
                will be chosen prior to the statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
                9. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
                9.1 Regulation statement This study will be conducted according to the principles&#xD;
                of the Declaration of Helsinki (version 59, oct 2008). The Medical Research&#xD;
                Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) does not apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
                9.2 Recruitment and consent Informed consent does not need to be obtained for this&#xD;
                study, as only retrospective data are being collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
                10. ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS, MONITORING AND PUBLICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
                10.1 Handling and storage of data and documents Data will be held and processed in&#xD;
                accordance with the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act. All study data will be held&#xD;
                securely. It will not be disclosed to third parties. All staff working on the study&#xD;
                owe a duty of confidentiality to the participants. Manual records will be held&#xD;
                securely (for example in locked filing cabinets). Electronic records will be held&#xD;
                on a secure network requiring user ID and password access. A fully anonymised data&#xD;
                set will be used for data analysis. Individuals will not be identifiable from the&#xD;
                results of the study. Neonates enrolled in the MONET study will receive a unique&#xD;
                study code. Data will be send to the study manager and entered into a MONET&#xD;
                database.&#xD;
&#xD;
                10.2 Monitoring and Quality Assurance Because of the retrospective, observational&#xD;
                nature of this study, monitoring was not deemed necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
                10.3 Public disclosure and publication policy The study will be registered in the&#xD;
                website of the Dutch National Competent Authority, the 'Centrale Commissie&#xD;
                Mensgebonden Onderzoek' (CCMO) and a public study registry. The results from the&#xD;
                MONET study will be analyzed and published as soon as possible in peer-reviewed&#xD;
                international scientific journals and presented at scientific meetings, unless the&#xD;
                study was terminated prematurely and did not yield sufficient data for a&#xD;
                publication. The responsibility for presentations and/or publications belongs to&#xD;
                the investigators. No restriction regarding the public disclosure and publication&#xD;
                of the research data have been, or will be made by the funding agencies. The final&#xD;
                publication of the study results will be written by the principal investigators and&#xD;
                the co-investigators. A draft manuscript will be submitted for review to all&#xD;
                co-authors. Results will also be published in a PhD-thesis. Authors of the main&#xD;
                manuscript will include the Principal Investigator, the co-investigators and,&#xD;
                investigators who have included evaluable patients in the study. Others who have&#xD;
                made a significant contribution to the study may also be included as author, or&#xD;
                otherwise will be included in the acknowledgement.&#xD;
