  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with high tumor burden, low grade follicular lymphoma that has never been treated,&#xD;
      will receive venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and bendamustine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is an oral Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. It targets the B-cell lymphoma 2&#xD;
      (BCL-2) protein, which supports cancer cell growth and is overexpressed in many patients with&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma. Venetoclax may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause&#xD;
      cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see whether adding venetoclax to obinutuzumab and&#xD;
      bendamustine improves the response (the tumor shrinks or disappears) in patients with&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of 9/5/2018, a higher than expected incidence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) was&#xD;
      experienced among patients receiving venetoclax, obinutuzumab and bendamustine on Cycle 1,&#xD;
      Day 1 of treatment. TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. These patients&#xD;
      developed an increase in some of their blood tests (uric acid, phosphorus, potassium and/or&#xD;
      creatinine). They received a medication called rasburicase and continued with treatment. It&#xD;
      is unclear if the TLS was due to the venetoclax or the standard treatment of obinutuzumab and&#xD;
      bendamustine. For the remaining patients, venetoclax will start on Cycle 2, Day 1 (previously&#xD;
      Cycle 1, Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of 9/16/2021, additional maintenance therapy has been suspended for those patients who&#xD;
      remain on study. These patients will not receive any further treatment and will move on to&#xD;
      the two year survival follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common low grade lymphoma comprising 70% of low-grade&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 22% of all cases of NHL. The survival rates for patients&#xD;
      with indolent NHL remained unchanged from the 1950s through the early 1990s, but recent&#xD;
      evidence suggests that outcomes continue to improve. High-risk patients with FL, defined as&#xD;
      having advanced stage and high tumor burden have significantly shorter progression free&#xD;
      survival despite significant advances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label phase II study of venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and&#xD;
      bendamustine. Patients will receive induction therapy with obinutuzumab and bendamustine for&#xD;
      six cycles (1 cycle = 28 days). Venetoclax will start with 2nd cycle of induction therapy&#xD;
      (previously started with cycle 1). There will be a formal, detailed toxicity evaluation after&#xD;
      21 patients complete 3 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who achieve partial response or stable disease will receive therapy with&#xD;
      obinutuzumab every 2 months for 12 cycles and venetoclax every month for 24 cycles. Patients&#xD;
      who achieve a complete response will receive obinutuzumab every 2 months for 12 cycles.&#xD;
      Patients with progressive disease will not continue onto the maintenance arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments will be performed approximately every 12 weeks during induction and every 6&#xD;
      months during maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandatory pre-treatment tumor tissue sample (i.e., obtained during a previous procedure or&#xD;
      biopsy) will be required for research (if sufficient tissue is available). Optional tumor&#xD;
      biopsy samples obtained during treatment or post-treatment will also be requested for&#xD;
      research.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases that could affect&#xD;
             compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results or that could increase risk&#xD;

          -  No major surgery within 2 weeks prior to cycle 1, other than for diagnosis.&#xD;

             of other classes are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient may not receive the following agents within 7 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
