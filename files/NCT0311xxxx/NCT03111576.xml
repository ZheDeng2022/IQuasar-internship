  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal pregnancy is associated with vasodilation and decreased peripheral resistance, which&#xD;
      is detected as early as 5 weeks' gestation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-eclampsia is a multi-system disorder of the second half of pregnancy , which is&#xD;
      characterized by increased vascular reactivity and peripheral resistance with pathological&#xD;
      changes that are consistent with impaired blood flow to the affected vascular beds.&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate fetal and maternal vascular changes in normotensive and&#xD;
      pre-eclamptic patients by Ultrasound and Doppler and their impact on prediction of pregnancy&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia affects 2-8% of all pregnancies, although treatment is generally effective.&#xD;
      However, 10-15% of direct maternal deaths are associated with Pre-eclampsia and&#xD;
      eclampsia(WHO, 2011). There is a considerable evidence that generalized endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction underlies the clinical manifestations of the disease (Oladipupo et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that peripheral nutritive blood flow is impaired in pregnancies&#xD;
      complicated by pre-eclampsia and precedes onset of the disorder (Kenny et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiological mechanism is characterized by a failure of the trophoblastic invasion&#xD;
      of the spiral arteries which may be associated with an increased vascular resistance of the&#xD;
      uterine artery and a decreased perfusion of placenta. (Al-Jameil et al ; 2014 ) Ultrasound of&#xD;
      the brachial artery, and Doppler ultrasound of the carotid artery and uterine artery are&#xD;
      propaedeutic , non-invasive methods that contribute to the understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of PE and Eclampsia (Takata et al., 2002 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doppler assessment of the placental circulation plays an important role in screening for&#xD;
      impaired placentation and its complications of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction&#xD;
      and perinatal death. Assessment of the fetal circulation is essential in the better&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of a wide range of pathological pregnancies and their&#xD;
      clinical management(Ghidini &amp; Vergani, 2012).&#xD;
