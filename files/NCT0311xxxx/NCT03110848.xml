  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is the most common extra-thyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease&#xD;
      (GD), being observed in ~25% of patients. Besides genetic and demographical variables, risk&#xD;
      factors associated with the development of GO in GD patients are known to be inadequate&#xD;
      control of hyperthyroidism, radioiodine treatment, and smoking. In a large retrospective&#xD;
      study conducted in more than 8,000 individuals with GD it was observed that treatment with&#xD;
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme reductase inhibitors, better known as statins, is&#xD;
      associated with a ~40% reduced risk of developing GO in GD patients. The findings were&#xD;
      interpreted as the consequence of the anti-inflammatory action of statins, being GO&#xD;
      notoriously an autoimmune, inflammatory conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins are widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, for which they are quite&#xD;
      effective. The possibility that their &quot;protective&quot; effect in terms of GO development in GD&#xD;
      patients, as observed by Stein et al., was simply due to their hypolipemic actions was not&#xD;
      considered. To evaluate the possibility that the findings reflected lowering of cholesterol&#xD;
      rather than a direct anti-inflammatory effect of statins a prospective, observational study&#xD;
      to assess the association between GO and high cholesterol levels and/or the relationship&#xD;
      between the degree and/or activity of GO and hypercholesterolemia is ongoing. Preliminary&#xD;
      findings suggest that GO is more severe and active in patients with high cholesterol levels.&#xD;
      On the basis of these observations, the present randomized clinical trial was designed to be&#xD;
      performed in hypercholesterolemic patients with GD and moderate-to-severe and active GO,&#xD;
      aimed at investigating if lowering of cholesterol levels with statins is associated with a&#xD;
      better outcome of GO.&#xD;

A composite evaluation of GO was described previously.&#xD;
Possible outcomes are: improvement, worsening, no change, resulting in 3 categorical values&#xD;
Improvement: amelioration of two parameters in at least one eye, without deterioration of any parameters in both eyes:&#xD;
Deterioration: worsening in two parameters in at least one eye:&#xD;
All other cases are &quot;no change&quot;&#xD;
Parameters are:&#xD;
Eyelid swelling (improvement/worsening according to EUGOGO Atlas evaluation) Lid aperture in mm (significant variation: 2 or more mm) Clinical activity score (CAS) (7 items: spontaneous pain, evoked pain, eyelid edema, eyelid redness, conjunctiva redness, caruncle edema, chemosis; significant change: at least 2 points) Exophthalmos in mm (significant variation 2 or more mm) Eye muscle involvement - diplopia score (Gorman score) (significant variation: disappearance or change in the degree, or improvement of ≥12 degrees in motility)</description>
