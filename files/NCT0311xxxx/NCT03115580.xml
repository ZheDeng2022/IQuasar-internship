    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to predict any changes in the side branch after stenting the&#xD;
      main branch blood vessel using three dimensional intravascular images. (Frequency domain&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography FD OCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an established medical imaging technique that uses&#xD;
      light to capture high-resolution, three-dimensional images of blood vessels. These images&#xD;
      will be used before and after implanting the stent in the main blood vessel. Fractional Flow&#xD;
      Reserve (FFR) test, which makes it possible for the interventional cardiologist to calculate&#xD;
      blood flow across an area of a coronary artery, will be done after stenting and will help to&#xD;
      determine if there are any changes in the side branch blood flow.&#xD;

      Coronary artery bifurcation lesion is a common lesion subset in PCI accounting for 15-20% of&#xD;
      the total number of interventions. Treatment of coronary artery bifurcation lesions&#xD;
      represents a challenging area in interventional cardiology. When compared with&#xD;
      non-bifurcation interventions, bifurcation interventions have a lower rate of procedural&#xD;
      success, higher procedural costs, longer hospitalization and a higher clinical and&#xD;
      angiographic restenosis. Factors contributing to this adverse outcome include limitations of&#xD;
      angiography in assessment of side-branch (SB) disease severity and the lack of established&#xD;
      angiographic predictors of SB patency and lumen compromise. Better understanding of the&#xD;
      underlying plaque morphology and plaque composition may facilitate more effective treatment&#xD;
      of bifurcation lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravascular imaging has provided new understanding of mechanisms associated with SB&#xD;
      compromise following bifurcation PCI. Plaque shift has been traditionally considered as the&#xD;
      principal mechanism for side-branch compromise after main vessel intervention. Rotational&#xD;
      atherectomy(RA) has been advocated for the treatment of bifurcation lesions, since it can&#xD;
      effectively remove plaque with minimal injury to adjacent normal arterial segments and&#xD;
      potentially reduce plaque shifting, the &quot;snow plow&quot; effect. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)&#xD;
      has been used for guidance in bifurcation lesions, aiding the visualization of plaque&#xD;
      morphology at the main vessel and the side-branches and helping the selection of stent size&#xD;
      and length as well as the selection of stenting strategy. However, due to the low spatial&#xD;
      resolution of IVUS, all attempts for three-dimensional visualization have only focused on&#xD;
      visualization of the luminal contour and not on the vessel morphology or the vessel-stent&#xD;
      interaction. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has ~10 times higher resolution than IVUS,&#xD;
      which allows precise evaluation of the microstructure of the vessel wall including lipid&#xD;
      pool, fibrous cap, calcification, and thrombus. OCT has been shown to constitute a valuable&#xD;
      tool for PCI guidance and also the utility of three-dimensional (3D) renderings for assessing&#xD;
      the mechanism of side-branch compromise following intervention in bifurcation lesions. The&#xD;
      recent development of OCT with online 3D reconstruction allows the operator to obtain a 3D&#xD;
      visualization of the lesion and may provide a unique tool for guidance during complex&#xD;
      bifurcation PCI and potentially improve stenting results. 3D OCT has been used to visualize&#xD;
      jailed side branches after implantation of bioresorbable scaffolds in the main branch and&#xD;
      develop a new classification system based on the number of SB compartments. In addition, its&#xD;
      potential clinical application in guiding the rewiring of the distal compartment of the SB&#xD;
      ostium (jailed with stent struts after MB stenting) to minimize the risk of floating struts&#xD;
      was demonstrated It is important to note that while OCT, 3D-OCT, and 3D-QCA (such as that&#xD;
      used in the ORBID trial) are imaging modalities that can be used to answer important research&#xD;
      questions, their wide-spread adoption in daily clinical practice has been very limited.&#xD;
      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is used more frequently as part of a PCI guidance strategy in&#xD;
      daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a pressure-derived, lesion specific index used to determine&#xD;
      the functional significance of coronary artery stenosis. Several studies showed that FFR is a&#xD;
      safe and feasible method to assess the significance of an ostial SB stenosis after&#xD;
      provisional stenting. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) has been shown to be unreliable&#xD;
      in assessing the functional significance of SB after stent implantation in MV (the area under&#xD;
      the curve 0.64, 41.5% sensitivity and 83.1% specificity) suggesting that treatment decisions&#xD;
      for jailed SB should not be based on angiographic findings alone. A recent report&#xD;
      demonstrated a better ability of post-PCI 3D-OCT to predict the functional significance for&#xD;
      SB ostial lesions caused by a jailed SB outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study (ORBID) of 30 patients was done at Mount Sinai Hospital and aimed to&#xD;
      identify the predictors of side branch (SB) ostial stenosis developed after provisional&#xD;
      stenting of the main vessel (MV) using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The study Showed&#xD;
      that High lipid content of the MV lesion and a contralateral location of lipid in the&#xD;
      bifurcation area may contribute to SBOS after provisional stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to analyze the incidence of SB compromise after provisional&#xD;
      main vessel stenting in calcified bifurcation lesions of CAD patients, determine the&#xD;
      incidence and OCT predictors of functionally significant SB stenosis defined as FFR ≤ 0.8 and&#xD;
      to compare the FFR values with 3D-OCT measurements of jailed SB ostium after MV stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stable CAD patients with bifurcation lesions in whom provisional stenting strategy is&#xD;
      planned, who have moderate or severe calcification in the main vessel lesion identified by&#xD;
      angiography, SB stenosis 30-70% and SB reference diameter &gt; 2mm will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate calcification will be defined as radiopaque density observed only during the cardiac&#xD;
      cycle and typically involving only one side of the vascular wall, and severe calcification&#xD;
      will be defined as radiopaque density noted without cardiac motion prior to contrast&#xD;
      injection and involving both sides of the arterial wall. After completion of diagnostic&#xD;
      angiogram and confirmation of subject eligibility, subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      Rotational Atherectomy (RA) or Cutting Balloon Angioplasty (CBA)/Percutaneous Transluminal&#xD;
      Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) group in a 1:1 fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will undergo PCI with stent implantation according to current&#xD;
      standards of care. Lesion preparation including lesion pre-dilation, scoring or sculpting&#xD;
      balloon angioplasty, and use of atherectomy and protection devices will be performed at the&#xD;
      operator's discretion, followed by MV stenting. The operator will also decide in both groups&#xD;
      about the length and size of the implanted stent. Procedural optimization, such as&#xD;
      post-dilation or additional stent implantation will be performed based only on the&#xD;
      angiographic findings, according to the discretion of the operator.&#xD;
