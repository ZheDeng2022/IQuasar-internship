  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric obesity, a defining health problem of the century, leads to long-term health&#xD;
      disparities. This application evaluates strategies to prevent health disparities early in&#xD;
      life by developing environmental wellness-related interventions focused on child-care center&#xD;
      staff and families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Childcare centers provide an excellent opportunity to build healthy dietary and physical&#xD;
      activity lifestyle habits and avoid the rapid weight gain that leads to health disparities.&#xD;
      Building on a statewide survey among childcare centers and a pilot evaluation of an&#xD;
      environmental intervention, this 3-cell randomized trial evaluates the impact of a staff-led&#xD;
      wellness intervention and a staff-led and family-focused intervention, against a control&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention trial will be conducted in 48-55 childcare centers throughout Maryland,&#xD;
      enrolling 864 children age 30-54 months from childcare centers serving low-income families.&#xD;
      The aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to examine the impact of the wellness intervention individually and combined with the&#xD;
           family intervention versus control on BMI z-score, food preferences and knowledge, and&#xD;
           physical activity among children&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to examine the sustainability of the interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to examine whether changes in outcomes measures for children's BMI z-score, gross motor&#xD;
           skills, food preferences and knowledge, and physical activity are mediated by changes in&#xD;
           the childcare staff wellness-related attitudes and behaviors and/or parent&#xD;
           wellness-related attitudes and behaviors (exploratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from the trial will inform programs and policies in childcare centers to prevent&#xD;
      obesity and reduce disparities, and will be disseminated locally, regionally, and nationally&#xD;
      through conferences, information briefs, social media, and peer-reviewed journal articles.&#xD;
      The overall objective is to promote statewide strategies that reduce pediatric obesity and&#xD;
      the long-term health disparities.&#xD;
