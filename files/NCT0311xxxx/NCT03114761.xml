      Introduction: Morbid obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of over 40 kg/m2, is&#xD;
      globally an imminent health threat. Conservative therapies do often not yield the desired&#xD;
      result. Bariatric surgery includes several interventions that are performed on patients with&#xD;
      morbid obesity, like gastric bypass surgery. The number of bariatric surgeries annually is&#xD;
      estimated to be around 500,000 worldwide; about half of these are gastric bypass surgeries.&#xD;
      In the Netherlands, the most common performed bariatric intervention is the Roux-en-Y gastric&#xD;
      bypass (RYGB). An important long-term complication of this surgery is internal herniation, a&#xD;
      condition in which a part of the GI tract is herniated through an opening in the mesentery&#xD;
      made during RYGB surgery. Incidence of internal herniation is 1-5%. Conventional abdominal CT&#xD;
      examination is often not conclusive about the presence of internal herniation. When internal&#xD;
      herniation is clinically highly suspected after abdominal CT examination (but not necessarily&#xD;
      confirmed), the patient is subjected to diagnostic laparoscopic surgery. Unfortunately, a&#xD;
      negative abdominal CT scan does not exclude internal herniation in all patients. This pleads&#xD;
      for the development or exploitation of alternative techniques that might aid in the diagnosis&#xD;
      of complications after RYGB surgery. Since the anatomy of GI tract is altered when internal&#xD;
      herniation is present, visualizing the mesenteric vasculature may aid in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      this complication after RYGB surgery. This study aims to confirm the feasibility and&#xD;
      superiority of diagnosing internal herniation using CT examination of the mesenteric arteries&#xD;
      over conventional CT examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to determine whether abdominal arterial CT angiography&#xD;
      is a feasible technique for diagnosing internal herniation after RYGB surgery. Secondary, it&#xD;
      is examined whether arterial angiography of the mesentery is superior over conventional CT&#xD;
      examination with oral and IV contrast in the venous phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This study will be a prospective pilot study, in which the outcomes of both the&#xD;
      conventional CT examination and abdominal angiogram are compared to the outcome of diagnostic&#xD;
      laparoscopy as gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients will be included who underwent laparoscopic RYGB surgery at least&#xD;
      half a year earlier and have persisting abdominal pain. They should be highly suspected for&#xD;
      internal herniation by their doctor, based on several characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary study endpoints are the assessments of the arterial&#xD;
      abdominal angiogram and mesenteric arterial mapping in relation to the outcome of the&#xD;
      diagnostic laparoscopic surgery in 12 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: In this pilot study, study subjects will receive an additional effective&#xD;
      radiation dose of about 10 mSv. On average, an acute dose of 10 mSv leads to an additional&#xD;
      risk of cancer of about 1 in 1750 (~1 in 2000 for males, ~1 in 1500 for females) for a&#xD;
      50-year old subject, based on the linear no threshold model. However, when the mesenteric&#xD;
      artery mapping proves to be feasible and superior, many unnecessary diagnostic laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgeries will be prevented (along with their complications and risks).&#xD;
