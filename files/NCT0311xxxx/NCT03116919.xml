    <textblock>
      White potatoes have recently been allowed back in the cash value voucher of the government&#xD;
      food stamp program after it was stated that there were no known adverse health effects of&#xD;
      potatoes. However, the association of potatoes with heart health, especially elevated blood&#xD;
      pressure is not known. This study will examine the effects of potatoes on blood pressure in&#xD;
      different populations of adults and children, and assess, in a feeding trial, the effects of&#xD;
      an additional serving of potatoes per day on the possible mechanisms that link potatoes to&#xD;
      high blood pressure. The investigators will also analyze the intake of potatoes in&#xD;
      participants of the government food stamp program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Potatoes are one of the most consumed vegetables in the US and the world. In recent years,&#xD;
      several changes have been made to government sponsored food programs with respect to&#xD;
      potatoes, such as lifting the restriction on the number of servings of starchy vegetables&#xD;
      (including potatoes) established by the Healthy Hunger-Free Act, and re-allowing white&#xD;
      potatoes in the cash-value voucher for fruits and vegetables of the Special Supplemental&#xD;
      Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), after the Institute of Medicine&#xD;
      asserted that there was insufficient evidence that white potatoes had adverse health effects.&#xD;
      However, the investigators recently reported an increased incidence of hypertension with&#xD;
      increasing potato consumption in three large prospective US cohort studies after adjusting&#xD;
      for sodium intake and other potential confounders. The investigators also analyzed the&#xD;
      association of short-term potato intake from a 24-hr dietary recall with&#xD;
      endothelial-dependent vasodilation measured by brachial artery ultrasonography in the&#xD;
      Modifiable Effectors of Renin System Activation Treatment Evaluation (MODERATE) trial.&#xD;
      Participants who consumed one or more than one serving of boiled, baked or mashed potatoes&#xD;
      during the previous day had a 1.7% lower endothelial-dependent vasodilation when compared&#xD;
      with participants with no potato intake (p-value= 0.01) after adjusting for other factors.&#xD;
      This is a relevant difference in endothelial function - by comparison, every 10 year increase&#xD;
      in age was associated with a 1.2% lower endothelial function. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to analyze the effect of one serving of boiled, baked or mashed potato per day on&#xD;
      endothelial function in a crossover feeding trial of healthy adult men and women.&#xD;
