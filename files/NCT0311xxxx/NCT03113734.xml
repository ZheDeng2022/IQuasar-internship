      This study develops the construction and validation of a reliable functional screening score&#xD;
      in LCA ruptures in the immediate post-traumatic period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This score, realizable in an emergency, would be an early warning signal requiring an&#xD;
      emergency consultation with an orthopedic surgeon. It would be a tool for screening acute LCA&#xD;
      ruptures at a time when ligament testing maneuvers are too painful to be contributory to the&#xD;
      diagnosis. It would avoid a premature return to dangerous activity for the knee with a&#xD;
      rupture of the LCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other impact would be economical since it would avoid the realization of unnecessary MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, it will allow patients with LCA rupture to have faster access to MRI. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of the study is that a validated functional score would make it possible to sort&#xD;
      the patients in the emergencies and to prescribe the MRI only in the cases of effective&#xD;
      rupture of the LCA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A observational, Prospective, non-randomized, multi-centric study. The main objective of this&#xD;
      study will be to determine the diagnostic performance (sensitivity and specificity) of a&#xD;
      functional score for the detection of a rupture of the knee ACL in the immediate&#xD;
      post-traumatic period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will follow the methodology for the evaluation of a new diagnostic test according to the&#xD;
      STARD (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy) checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phases of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Build score This phase will quantify the weight of each item and sub-items of the&#xD;
           questionnaire already conceived from a statistical analysis adapted and thus to give a&#xD;
           value to each item then a maximum value to the score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validation of the score The score obtained will be validated in a different population&#xD;
           versus MRI to determine its performance parameters. This score will be called the ACL-TS&#xD;
           screening score (Tear Screening). An inter-evaluative reproducibility analysis of the&#xD;
           score will be carried out in the investigative centers which have an emergency&#xD;
           department&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planned sample size For phase 1, a logistic regression will be performed. Empirically,&#xD;
           there are 10 patients per variable for this questionnaire with 17 sub-items, 170&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase 2, the workforce was calculated on sensitivity because it is important to detect&#xD;
      LCA ruptures. To obtain a sensitivity of 98% with a 2% CI, and taking into account a 10% rate&#xD;
      of incomplete records, 210 patients should be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the inter-evaluative ancillary reproducibility study, to obtain a Pearson coefficient of&#xD;
      0.8 (strong correlation if coefficient greater than 0.5) with a confidence interval of 0.67&#xD;
      to 0.88 and a risk of first 60 patients should be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of normality of distributions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive statistics: mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and median&#xD;
           (quantitative variables); Frequency and percentage (qualitative variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparisons of means: Student or Mann-Whitney according to the normality of the&#xD;
           distributions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage comparisons: chi 2 or Fisher tests, idem&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The threshold of significance of the set of tests will be 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A bi-varied study will then be carried out for each of the factors taken individually&#xD;
           (search for an individual relationship, a rupture of the LCA confirmed by MRI vs the&#xD;
           factors to be taken into account). These analyzes will provide an OR, an 95% CI of the&#xD;
           OR, and a p-value measuring the severity of the association between the severe sprain&#xD;
           and the factor taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow a multivariate analysis (here logistic since the dependent variable will be&#xD;
           &quot;breaking ACL O / N&quot;). To carry out this logistic regression, all factors for which p&#xD;
           &lt;0.25 will be included in the model. A descending step-by-step method will arrive at the&#xD;
           final model which will contain only those factors whose p will be less than 5% and whose&#xD;
           95% CI of the OR will not contain 1. Possibly it will be possible to adjust The model on&#xD;
           certain parameters and to look for possible interactions. The ORs and IC95% obtained&#xD;
           will allow the gravity scores to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance parameters of the score with respect to the MRI: ROC curves with&#xD;
           determination of the optimal threshold value, calculation of the area under the curve&#xD;
           (AUC), Se, Sp, the likelihood ratios positive and negative and the proportion of&#xD;
           Subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the factors that can modify the sensitivity of the score (age, sex, sport&#xD;
           level, laxity, meniscal or cartilage lesions) by bi-varied analyzes between the group&#xD;
           correctly classified by the MRI and the score And on the other hand the group presenting&#xD;
           a discrepancy between the reference examination and the score. If several factors are&#xD;
           identified, these analyzes may be supplemented by a multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
           analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pearson correlation coefficient and intra-class correlation coefficient to evaluate all&#xD;
           correlations between quantitative variables (score reproducibility, differential score /&#xD;
           laxity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Model the diagnostic approach including the score by developing a decision tree&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion procedure The study will target 380 patients seen in an emergency. After a knee&#xD;
      sprain, patients usually go to hospital or a treatment center for medical consultation. For&#xD;
      the study, patients will be recruited either in the emergency department if the investigating&#xD;
      center has an emergency department or in the corresponding medical-surgical centers of the&#xD;
      investigating center. Investigating surgeons at the centers should inform physicians of the&#xD;
      initiation of the study and the modalities of implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually, patients are received by an emergency physician, orthopedic surgeon on duty or a&#xD;
      sports physician. A standard radiographic assessment will be performed to eliminate the&#xD;
      presence of a bone fracture. If the patient meets the test selection criteria, he / she will&#xD;
      be informed of the study and his / her right to oppose the collection of his / her medical&#xD;
      data. The patient will ask all the questions necessary for his understanding before&#xD;
      confirming his non-opposition. The questionnaire will then be completed by the physician with&#xD;
      the patient. In the centers where the reproducibility study will be carried out, a second&#xD;
      doctor will complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the consultation has been completed, the physician will issue prescriptions for the&#xD;
      usual medical treatment, laximetry prescription (GNRB) to be performed between 3 to 6 weeks&#xD;
      after the accident when the knee is indolent and the prescription of the MRI to be performed&#xD;
      between 7 days and 1 month after the accident. The physician will inform the patient that&#xD;
      they should consult with the investigator's orthopedic surgeon once the results of GNRB and&#xD;
      MRI are available within 6 weeks of the accident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this delayed consultation, the orthopedic surgeon will realize in this patient the&#xD;
      dynamic maneuvers of ligament testing. The study will end there for the patient. The surgeon&#xD;
      will then follow his usual diagnostic procedure to decide on the future care of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects Agreement will be sought from the local Ethics committee. All patients will&#xD;
      be fully informed and will be provided with an information form. The data will be entered&#xD;
      into an internet page and will be analysed anonymously.&#xD;

    <description>MRI will be used to determine whether the LCA is broken. The direct signs of complete LCA rupture are based on its morphological study, signal and spatial orientation.&#xD;
In the acute phase, haemarthrosis secondary to rupture appears as a T1-weighted hyposignal and a proton-density and T2 -weight hyper-signal. In the subacute phase, the proximal and distal stump retract and remain separated by a proton density and T2-weighted signaling area.&#xD;
AND / OR: Horizontalisation of the ACL, evaluated in relation to the plane of the tibial plateaus or the Blumensaat line, indicates the complete character of the ACL rupture with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 100%.&#xD;
AND / OR: The &quot;sign of the empty notch&quot; to be sought in the frontal and axial planes is pathognomonic of the complete rupture of the LCA at its high insertion. It is the most frequent form of rupture</description>
