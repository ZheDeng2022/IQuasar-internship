      The family has a primary prescription in the identification of the chewing disorder in&#xD;
      children to plan appropriate rehabilitation program and implementation of the training.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is very important to investigate the validity and reliability of classification&#xD;
      systems that can be applied by parents. The purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      validity and reliability of the reliability and validity of family report chewing evaluation.&#xD;

      Chewing is a function that is defined as the grinding of solid food and making them ready for&#xD;
      swallowing. Chewing begins with the acceptance of solid food with the lips. The rotational&#xD;
      and lateral movements of the tongue is also necessary during grinding the solid food in the&#xD;
      molar region. In the molar region, grinding is carried out with the help of salivary and&#xD;
      salivary enzymes. Chewing behavior is a learned function. The child begins to chew at 6&#xD;
      months and the coordinated movement to the 9th month continues to develop. Together with&#xD;
      experience, chewing activity continues to develop. The families have a primary role in&#xD;
      chewing training. In some children, the chewing function does not develop as desired. Many&#xD;
      children with developmental, medical, or oral motor problems have difficulty in grinding and&#xD;
      swallowing solid foods. Therefore, it is very important to assess the ability of the child's&#xD;
      chewing and determine the treatment goals. Assessment of the child's ability to chew should&#xD;
      begin by considering chewing as a function. For this reason, the Karaduman Chewing&#xD;
      Performance Scale (KCPS) was developed at the Hacettepe University, Faculty of Health&#xD;
      Sciences Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation. The chewing performance of the child&#xD;
      during chewing a biscuit is scored by the therapist between 0-4. 0 refers to normal chewing,&#xD;
      4 means no bite and chew. The family has a primary prescription in the identification of the&#xD;
      chewing disorder in children to plan appropriate rehabilitation program and implementation of&#xD;
      the training. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the validity and reliability of&#xD;
      classification systems that can be applied by parents. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the validity and reliability of the reliability and validity of family report&#xD;
      chewing evaluation (Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale-Family report).&#xD;
