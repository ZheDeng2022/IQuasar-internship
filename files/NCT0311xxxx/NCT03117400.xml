  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date there are no available data on the utility of the endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)&#xD;
      defect in stratifying the risk of immediate or delayed adverse outcomes, particularly&#xD;
      clinically significant post EMR bleeding (CSPEB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to analyse the data to determine if any of these EMR defect features&#xD;
      allow us to estimate the risk of CSPEB. This will help endoscopists to identify defects with&#xD;
      a high risk of adverse outcomes and may translate into improved patient outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CSPEB is the most frequent serious complication after wide-field EMR of laterally spreading&#xD;
      lesions ≥ 20mm (LSLs). There is no proven therapy for CSPEB and it remains a significant&#xD;
      drawback of EMR. Visible vessels within the post EMR defect (PED) present themselves as&#xD;
      logical targets for prophylactic treatment to prevent CSPEB. However, the clinical&#xD;
      significance of these vessels is largely unknown. In the majority of studies risk factors&#xD;
      identified for CSPEB include right colon location, lesion size and aspirin use. The&#xD;
      investigators aimed to systematically describe and evaluate the clinical significance of the&#xD;
      various endoscopic features of the post EMR defect PED including visible vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study of LSLs ≥ 20mm referred for EMR at a single tertiary referral center will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection includes patient, procedural and lesion characteristics. In all cases a&#xD;
      systematic description of the PED is undertaken. The data of particular interest to this&#xD;
      study includes: use of blood thinners, PED features including size, number and herniation of&#xD;
      visible vessels, submucosal haemorrhage, fibrosis, fat and exposed muscle and the rate of&#xD;
      CSPEB.These features were analysed for significant association with CSPEB. CSPEB was defined&#xD;
      as any bleeding occurring after the completion of the procedure necessitating emergency&#xD;
      department presentation, hospitalization or reintervention. CSPEB was compared to features of&#xD;
      the PED to detect significant associations, using chi2 or Fisher's exact tests. Significant&#xD;
      univariate variables will be taken forward for binomial logistic regression modelling.&#xD;

    <description>The defect after endoscopic mucosal resection of the colonic large laterally spreading lesion (20mm or more) is blue without any other defect features (as described in the second group, 'non bland blue defect'). The blue is the result of the submucosal injection of dye (indigo carmine), used to lift lesions before starting the resection.</description>
