  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to validate the uptake of novel, positron emitting&#xD;
      radiotracer, 68Gallium Citrate in hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). The investigators also aim&#xD;
      to evaluate the sensitivity of 68Gallium (68Ga)-citrate positron emission tomography/computed&#xD;
      tomography (PET/CT) for the identification of intrahepatic HCC lesions in comparison with&#xD;
      existing modalities: computed tomography (CT) alone and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The&#xD;
      investigators expect that 68Ga-citrate PET/CT will offer a sensitive functional imaging&#xD;
      modality for identification of HCC lesions in the liver. The investigators intend to use the&#xD;
      results of this preliminary study to fuel further studies in the utility of 68Ga-citrate&#xD;
      PET/CT for HCC treatment monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignancy of the liver with very high mortality.&#xD;
      Management of HCC often involves interventional and surgical therapies that distort&#xD;
      surrounding liver morphology. For this reason, current morphologic imaging techniques&#xD;
      following these therapies often fail to distinguish between residual tumor and&#xD;
      post-therapeutic morphologic changes. Therefore, there is the need for an effective imaging&#xD;
      technique in therapy monitoring for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional imaging techniques are commonly used in other cancers for effective therapy&#xD;
      monitoring. Functional imaging in HCC with single photon emitting gallium radioisotopes has&#xD;
      been explored in the past but have not been used routinely due to poor resolution of images.&#xD;
      68Gallium-citrate PET/CT can generate high resolution images that specifically target HCC&#xD;
      cells regardless of liver morphology. This makes 68Gallium-citrate PET/CT an ideal imaging&#xD;
      modality for HCC following therapies that distort liver morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before determining its efficacy in therapy monitoring, The investigators aim to demonstrate&#xD;
      the ability for 68Gallium-citrate PET/CT to localize known intrahepatic HCC lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, 18 subjects with newly diagnosed HCC will be recruited. Each subject&#xD;
      will undergo a 68Gallium-citrate PET/CT scan within 6 weeks of radiographic diagnosis. Foci&#xD;
      of abnormal radiotracer uptake on these scans will be tabulated and compared to&#xD;
      clinically-indicated morphologic imaging. The investigators expect that 68Gallium-citrate&#xD;
      PET/CT will offer a sensitive functional imaging modality for identification of HCC lesions&#xD;
      in the liver. The investigators intend to use the results of this preliminary study to form&#xD;
      the basis for grant applications to extra-mural funding agencies. These subsequent grant&#xD;
      applications will focus on further studies in the utility of 68Gallium-citrate PET/CT for HCC&#xD;
      therapy monitoring and metastatic work-up.&#xD;

    <description>For each subject, presence and location of abnormal radiotracer localization will be recorded. Tumor volume will be measured on CT, MRI, and PET/CT images using the MIM software. Region-of-interest (ROI) will be drawn around each area of morphologic abnormality on PET/CT images to calculate a mean standardized uptake value (SUV), a maximum SUV, and a target-to-background ratio.</description>
