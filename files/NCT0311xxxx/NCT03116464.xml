  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia impacts Veterans, their families, and other Veterans who serve as caregivers. One of&#xD;
      the most stressful aspects of caregiving is the management of behavioral problems (e.g.&#xD;
      wandering, agitation, and sleep difficulties), which exacerbate health issues for both&#xD;
      caregivers and persons with dementia (PWD). Existing VA caregiver treatments for caregiver&#xD;
      stress and behavioral problems are often ineffective. Many caregivers do not realize their&#xD;
      interactions with PWD contribute to behavioral problems and thus do not ask for help to&#xD;
      improve their interpersonal skills. The aim of this project is to develop an assessment of&#xD;
      interpersonal skills deficits and a related treatment strategy to assist family caregivers of&#xD;
      PWD who are challenged by a lack of interpersonal skills and are not helped by existing&#xD;
      family caregiver treatments. This project, will develop and test (1) a video assessment of&#xD;
      caregiver/PWD interaction that clinicians will use to identify interpersonal difficulties and&#xD;
      (2) a family therapy for the interpersonal difficulties clinicians identify in the&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

    <measure>Healthy Aging Brain Center Monitor (HABC Monitor):</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Treatment, an average of 12-18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 31-item caregiver assessment of dementia severity, caregiver stress, and mood. Contains three patient symptom domains (Cognitive, functional, behavioral/psychological) and a caregiver quality of life domain. Shown to have good internal consistency (0.73-0.92) and construct validity.</description>

    <measure>The Kansas Marital Conflict Scale (KMCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Treatment, an average of 12-18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 37-item self-report scale consisting of three subscales of how well partners are able to: (1) listen and understand each other's perspectives, (2) express his or her point of view , and (3) come to a mutually satisfactory compromise. It has been shown to have high internal consistency ( = .87 to .90) and test-retest reliability (r = .62 to .92). Although developed for marital relationships, all items are applicable or easily modified for a variety of interpersonal relationships.</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Treatment, an average of 12-18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 9-item self-report scale based on DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, has been shown to have good sensitivity and specificity and is predictive of health outcomes such as sick days, clinic visits, and symptom related difficulty. Internal reliability of the PHQ-9 is excellent ( = 0.89).</description>

    <description>A 12-item self-report scale shown to have acceptable indices of internal consistency for the two distinct factors of the scale - personal strain and role strain ( =0.88 and =0.78) and a good predictor of caregiver mental health outcomes.</description>
