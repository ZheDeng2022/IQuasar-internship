  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MinPAC aims to see if the drug Minnelide can slow down tumour growth in patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer that is not responding to treatment. Minnelide is designed to rapidly&#xD;
      release the anti-tumour molecule triptolide in the bloodstream and has been shown to slow&#xD;
      cancer cell growth and induce cancer cell death. Minnelide is currently being investigated in&#xD;
      other early phase trials and has shown promising response data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are strict eligibility criteria for this trial. Broadly speaking, patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer that has spread to other organs and has progressed on one or more&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens are eligible. Participants will receive Minnelide on days 1-21 of each&#xD;
      28 day cycle until their cancer stops responding to treatment. After that participants will&#xD;
      be followed up 3 monthly for the collection of disease status and survival data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MinPAC includes biological and imaging studies. Participants will be asked to donate tumour&#xD;
      and blood samples and will be asked to undergo additional PET Scans. The study is being&#xD;
      carried out in 4 sites in the UK and USA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MinPAC is an open label, international, multicentre phase II trial that aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of Minnelide treatment in patients with refractory pancreatic cancer. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will receive Minnelide until disease progression unless there is evidence of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or the patient requests to be withdrawn from the study treatment. Once&#xD;
      disease progression is documented, patients will enter a follow up phase during which data&#xD;
      will be collected on further disease and survival status. If patients are unable to attend&#xD;
      hospital visits during the follow up period then data will be collected either via telephone&#xD;
      or via national registries with the patient's consent. The efficacy of Minnelide will be&#xD;
      assessed on CT/MRI scan images and tumour and/or blood samples collected at baseline, during&#xD;
      treatment and on completion of treatment.&#xD;
