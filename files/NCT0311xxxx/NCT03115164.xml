  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Astrocytomas / infantile desmoplastic gangliogliomas (DIA / DIG) are rare brain tumors&#xD;
      usually affecting infants. They represent about 0.5% of all pediatric brain tumors. DIA / DIG&#xD;
      occurs mainly in the first 2 years of life, with a sex ratio M / F of 1.7 to 1. From a&#xD;
      histological point of view, DIA / DIG are neuroepithelial tumors. These tumors may have a&#xD;
      purely astrocytic differentiation (DIA) or be composed of tumor cells with astrocytic and&#xD;
      neuronal differentiation (DIG). The desmoplastic component is usually adjacent to the&#xD;
      meninges and is defined by the increase or modification of connective tissues related to the&#xD;
      presence of neoplastic cells with the formation of a collagen-rich extracellular matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to their benign biological behavior and favorable clinical course, they are classified in&#xD;
      benign tumors, ie grade I according to the WHO classification. However, all tumors called DIA&#xD;
      / DIG do not behave in a benign manner. Cases of metastatic cerebrospinal and malignant&#xD;
      disorders have been described. It appears that about 40% of DIG cases require additional&#xD;
      medical treatment such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and / or new surgery, and 15% of infants&#xD;
      and children with GIDD die from the disease. It is possible that what is grouped within the&#xD;
      DIA / DIG is a heterogeneous group of tumors, evolution and prognosis very variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytogenetic knowledge of DIA / DIG is very limited and is only available on small numbers&#xD;
      of cases. Cytogenetic analyzes of several cases of DIG showed normal karyotypes. More&#xD;
      recently, a CGH-Array study of 3 cases of DIA / DIG did not find any significant chromosomal&#xD;
      gains or losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown, however, that a mutation involving BRAF (BRAF rearrangement or BRAF V600E&#xD;
      mutations) was a recurrent element in low grade gliomas, particularly in pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also suggested that deregulation of BRAF activity in some DIA / DIG may indicate the&#xD;
      importance of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway in signaling pathways for&#xD;
      DIA / DIG development. However, data on the link between the BRAF gene and DIA / DIG remains&#xD;
      very limited. Thus, further studies are needed to study the other members of the MAPK pathway&#xD;
      in DIA / DIG (eg PI3K / AKT / mTOR). This could provide new therapeutic possibilities&#xD;
      involving targeted therapies specific to the MAPK signaling pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It appears that DIA / DIG does not all behave in a benign manner and some would undergo a&#xD;
      malignant transformation that could be due to chromosomal alterations such as, for example,&#xD;
      TP53, PI3K. In addition, because of the limited number of cases, it would be interesting to&#xD;
      study the characteristics of patients with DIA / DIG in order to study their characteristics&#xD;
      and whether there are clinical, pathological, cytogenetic and / Molecular forms between&#xD;
      benign and malignant forms.&#xD;
