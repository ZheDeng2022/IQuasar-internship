  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the clinical investigation is to assess the use of the the Visceral&#xD;
      Manifold Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysms (VTAAA) stent graft system to repair&#xD;
      thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in patients having appropriate anatomy. The primary intent&#xD;
      of the study is to assess safety (i.e. freedom from major adverse events (MAE) at 30 days)&#xD;
      and preliminary effectiveness (i.e., treatment success and technical success) of the device&#xD;
      (i.e., the proportion of treatment group subjects that achieve and maintain treatment success&#xD;
      at one year).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of this device as there are no or&#xD;
      very limited devices and clinical options available for this patient population. The primary&#xD;
      safety endpoint of this study is safety freedom from major adverse events (MAE) at 30 days or&#xD;
      during hospitalization if this exceeds 30 days. Major adverse events include death, bowel&#xD;
      ischemia, myocardial infarction, paraplegia, renal failure, respiratory failure, and stroke.&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint will be analyzed to determine statistical significance when&#xD;
      compared to a target performance goal. A literature review of outcomes of open surgical&#xD;
      repair was used to create the performance goal as there is not a comparable endovascular&#xD;
      option to use for analysis. The performance goal was selected based on the range of subjects&#xD;
      experiencing a major adverse event at 30 days. The range was calculated based on assumptions&#xD;
      of the minimum and maximum number of subjects experiencing at least one MAE in the historical&#xD;
      open surgical repair group . Based on the literature reviewed and the above assumptions the&#xD;
      range of subjects experiencing at least one MAE in the open surgical repair group is 30.5% to&#xD;
      77.4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary effectiveness endpoint is the proportion of the study subjects with treatment&#xD;
      success at 1 year. The data will be presented as quality outcomes with the number of study&#xD;
      subjects with treatment success compared to the overall patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, data outcomes from this study will be entered into a common vascular database&#xD;
      so that data can be pooled with other PS-IDEs. This would provide consistent reporting across&#xD;
      the PS-IDEs. Additionally, the PS-IDEs will be evaluating the same device and endpoints to&#xD;
      allow for a pool-ability of data across the sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pooled data will be separated into two separate study arms: primary study arm and&#xD;
      expanded selection arm.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Per the opinion of the Principal Investigator, with concurrence of the IRB,&#xD;
             alternatives therapies are unsatisfactory and the probable risk of using the&#xD;

             condition.&#xD;
