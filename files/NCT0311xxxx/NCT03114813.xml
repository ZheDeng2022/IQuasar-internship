      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if MRI can detect meaningful changes in portal pressure in the liver to assess&#xD;
      whether treatment with beta-blockers has worked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver Disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most people with liver disease do not have symptoms. Over time they develop 'cirrhosis' -&#xD;
      severe liver scarring. In the United Kingdom deaths due to cirrhosis have doubled over the&#xD;
      last decade, because of increasing rates of alcohol consumption and obesity, while heart,&#xD;
      kidney, lung diseases, strokes and cancer fatalities have fallen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Portal pressure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cirrhosis causes increased pressure within the liver and changes in the circulation leading&#xD;
      to the development of varicose veins in the gullet and stomach called 'varices'. Varices&#xD;
      bleed easily, leading to emergency situations that can be life threatening. However, if the&#xD;
      increased pressure within the liver (portal pressure) is detected early, then treatment can&#xD;
      prevent variceal bleeding. The only test we have to predict prognosis and treatment success&#xD;
      in someone with cirrhosis is by measuring the portal pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring portal pressure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the only existing test to measure portal pressure is to pass a pressure sensor&#xD;
      through a vein in the neck, down into the liver. This is called the hepatic venous pressure&#xD;
      gradient (HVPG) measurement. The HVPG measurement is disliked by patients because it is an&#xD;
      invasive procedure. It is also expensive and not widely available. Hence, patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis need to have regular camera tests (endoscopies) to look for varices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How can you treat varices?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two options;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. With tablets to lower the pressure (beta-blockers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endoscopy treatment (banding)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both have advantages and disadvantages;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beta-blockers only lower the portal pressure in about half of those that take them, with&#xD;
           some evidence they may also have a protective effect against infections from the bowel&#xD;
           by increasing the speed of bowel motion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treating the varices with endoscopy requires several endoscopies and can lead to&#xD;
           life-threatening bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients are therefore given beta-blockers and monitored closely to see if they work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why does it matter?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beta-blockers can cause side effects (e.g. fainting) that are unpleasant enough to make up to&#xD;
      one third of patients stop taking them. Beta-blockers only reduce the portal pressure in half&#xD;
      of patients. The remaining patients are exposed to potential side effects and possible harm&#xD;
      in those with the most advanced liver disease. These patients may still have a&#xD;
      life-threatening bleed as the varices have not been adequately treated. There is a desperate&#xD;
      need to discover whether the portal pressure changes with treatment (such as with&#xD;
      beta-blockers) without invasive tests across the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers in Nottingham have shown MRI can be used as an accurate marker of portal pressure&#xD;
      with just one scan. To be useful to patients, doctors and researchers, this study will&#xD;
      investigate whether MRI can detect meaningful changes in portal pressure after treatment with&#xD;
      beta-blockers. This study has been designed with patient and public involvement (PPI)&#xD;
      integrated throughout. A focus group shaped the study design and committed to collaborate in&#xD;
      developing patient materials, recruitment, retention and dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who have HVPG will be given information about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One hour MRI scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopy to identify varices&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If varices are present the patient will be started on beta-blockers and invited to&#xD;
                visit 2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If there are no varices, patients will return to regular follow up with the liver&#xD;
                team&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 2 (after one week)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess side effects, blood pressure and pulse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase dose of beta-blocker as appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 3 (after 4-12 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One hour MRI scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat HVPG measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment success is determined by the second HVPG measurement. If beta-blockers are working&#xD;
      they will be continued. If not, the patient will have treatment with endoscopy. This&#xD;
      represents the ideal pathway which is more personalised than current standard care.&#xD;
