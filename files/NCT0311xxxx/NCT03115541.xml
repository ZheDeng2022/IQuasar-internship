  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of post-operative venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing major esophageal resection for malignancy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) is a common post-operative complication that can result in&#xD;
      significant patient morbidity, mortality and health care resource utilization to treat the&#xD;
      resultant Pulmonary Embolus (PE) or Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) events. It is the third&#xD;
      leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. Due to the high burden of disease, VTE events are&#xD;
      actively prevented using mechanical and/or pharmaceutical prophylaxis interventions such as&#xD;
      compression stockings or a variety of anti-coagulants. Extensive literature identifies&#xD;
      incidence rates and provides guidelines regarding the use of prophylaxis measures in&#xD;
      orthopaedic and oncological surgery, but the literature in thoracic surgery is sparse at best&#xD;
      or conflicting with reported incidence of symptomatic events ranging from 5% to 14% after&#xD;
      esophagectomy. The current practice of VTE prophylaxis in thoracic surgery includes&#xD;
      administration of unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) starting in the&#xD;
      perioperative period and finishing at patient discharge, while prolonged thromboprophylaxis&#xD;
      in orthopaedic surgery beyond 10 to 14 days and up to 35 days has become the standard of&#xD;
      care. Such an approach has never been tested or validated in esophageal cancer patients&#xD;
      despite the substantial burden and high risk of VTE events in this population. There is a&#xD;
      clear need for well-designed studies aiming to define the extent of peri-operative VTE for&#xD;
      esophagectomy patients and additional contributing factors associated with VTE in those high&#xD;
      risk patients in order to inform best practice patterns. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      the incidence and clinical burden of perioperative VTE events in esophagectomy patients are&#xD;
      substantial, and that VTE significantly contributes to peri-and post-operative morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Hence, it will be beneficial to explore the true incidence of VTE events and&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of extended-duration, post-discharge prophylaxis for these&#xD;
      patients. The investigators also hypothesize that sub-groups of esophagectomy patients will&#xD;
      be at higher risk for VTE events and therefore might benefit more from extended-duration,&#xD;
      post-discharge prophylaxis, and perhaps from a more aggressive in-hospital regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective cohort study will involve patients undergoing major esophageal resection for&#xD;
      esophageal cancer at 9 tertiary care centres across Canada, 4 centres in the USA, and 1 site&#xD;
      in China. McMaster University at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton will serve as the&#xD;
      Coordinating Centre as well as a study site. Recruitment will commence at each site until 177&#xD;
      patients are enrolled via consecutive convenience sampling. After undergoing esophagectomy,&#xD;
      all patients will receive both a peri-operative dose followed by post-operative LMWH VTE&#xD;
      prophylaxis for the remainder of their hospital stay. As per current VTE prophylaxis&#xD;
      guidelines, prophylaxis will be discontinued upon hospital discharge. VTE outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed using Computed Tomography with pulmonary angiography protocol at 30 and 90 days and&#xD;
      bilateral venous Doppler ultrasounds at 30, 60 and 90 days after surgery. The role of D-Dimer&#xD;
      will be investigated peri-operatively up to post-operative day (POD) 3, at hospital discharge&#xD;
      or POD 10 (whichever is applicable), and at each imaging follow-up visit. A future second&#xD;
      phase study will be a randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the role of extended&#xD;
      duration thromboprophylaxis post-discharge in reducing the incidence of VTE in this patient&#xD;
      population. The proposed prospective cohort study to evaluate the incidence of VTE needs to&#xD;
      be conducted first, in order to optimize patient selection and determine the sample size for&#xD;
      the subsequent randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
