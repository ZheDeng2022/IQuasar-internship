      Design: Open-comparative prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population: two groups of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  first group: patients who are receiving diprospan in standard therapy of their existing&#xD;
           disease, or multiple times, but following the introduction of diprospan is planned no&#xD;
           earlier than 28 days after the first administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  second group: the control group of subjects for the study of pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
           diprospan and its metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intramuscular injection diprospan (suspension for injection) at a dose of 1 ml (7 mg) once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective of the study: to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters of Diprospan in the long&#xD;
      term when administered systemically in patients in routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to develop laboratory analytical method of quantifying the investigated substance&#xD;
           (betamethasone) in human urine sensitive, selective and precise method using high&#xD;
           performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass selective detection,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of quantitative content, evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters of diprospan&#xD;
           in the bioassay in patients with systemic intramuscular application in routine clinical&#xD;
           practice in the Russian Federation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of clinical patient data and pharmacokinetic parameters of study drug in the&#xD;
           urine of patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determination of minimum number of arbitration bioassay to store,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  preparation of recommendations for systemic use of glucocorticoids in athletes, in&#xD;
           accordance with the requirements of the all-Russian anti-doping rules and the&#xD;
           requirements of the anti-doping rules, approved by the international anti-doping&#xD;
           authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First group (patients receiving diprospan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: selection of study participants from a number of patients who are administered with&#xD;
      Diprospan&quot; at a dose of 1 ml (7 mg) intramuscularly as standard therapy of existing disease,&#xD;
      or multiple times, but following introduction of &quot;Diprospan&quot; drug is planned no earlier than&#xD;
      28 days after the first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: draw the original samples for pharmacokinetic studies, a single injection of the&#xD;
      study medication as part of routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: Sampling in dynamics for pharmacokinetic studies; assessment of clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters after a single administration of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 4: evaluation of clinical examination data and pharmacokinetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second group (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: selection of study participants from a number of patients or healthy volunteers who&#xD;
      had not received systemic or local corticosteroids in the last 12 weeks before the screening&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: drawing of samples for pharmacokinetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • betamethasone concentration in urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of articular status,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  overall assessment of the health status of the patient,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  overall assessment of disease activity, physician assessment of disease activity&#xD;
           criteria for SDAI, CDAI, DAS-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First group (the study of the pharmacokinetics of the drug &quot;Diprrospan&quot;): at least 20&#xD;
      patients (10 men and 10 women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group (control): at least 20 patients (10 men and 10 women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring In accordance with the order of the Health Ministry of Russia №757n&#xD;
      &quot;Approval of the Procedure for monitoring the safety of medicinal products for medical use,&#xD;
      registration of adverse events, serious adverse reactions, unexpected adverse reactions in&#xD;
