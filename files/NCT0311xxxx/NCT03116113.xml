    <measure>Part 1: Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs are defined as any of the following events considered to be related to AAV8-RPGR: Sustained decrease in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ≥30 letters on the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart compared to baseline (sustained is defined as lasting 48 hours or more until recovery, with recovery defined as visual acuity (VA) returning to within 10 letters of baseline VA. An exception is made for surgery-related events occurring in close temporal association {within &lt;24 hours} of the surgery); Vitreous inflammation, vitritis (&gt;Grade 3 using standardised Nussenblatt vitreous inflammation scale grading); Any clinically significant retinal damage observed that is not directly attributed to complications of surgery; Any clinically relevant suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction, with the exception of vision loss or vision threatening.</description>

    <measure>Part 1: Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <time_frame>Months 12</time_frame>
    <description>MAIA microperimetry assessment was measured in dB using a 10-2 grid of 68 points. Each point was labeled as '&lt; 0', '0', or a positive integer. The point labeled as '&lt; 0' was assigned a value of '-1' by MAIA in the calculation. Improvement in Retinal Sensitivity in center grid was defined as an increase from baseline of 7 or more decibels in any 5 or more points out of the 16 central points.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 3, 6, 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change in contrast sensitivity (CS) was assessed by Pelli-Robson chart which uses a single large letter size (20/60 optotype), with contrast varying across groups of letters. Chart uses letters (6 per line), arranged in groups whose contrast varies from high to low. Subjects read the letters, starting with the highest contrast, until they are unable to read two or three letters in a single group. Each group has three letters of the same contrast level, so there are three trials per contrast level. Subject is assigned a score based on the contrast of the last group in which two or three letters were correctly read. Score is a measure of the subject's log contrast sensitivity ranging from 0-2.25, with 0 being no letters read, and 2.25 being all letters read. Total CS score = [(total # letters correct - 3) x 0.05].</description>
