  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, single-blinded, two-arm study, randomized to include&#xD;
      approximately 134 subjects treated with Subchondroplasty (SCP) + Arthroscopy and 67 subjects&#xD;
      with arthroscopy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority of Subchondroplasty with&#xD;
      arthroscopy compared to arthroscopy alone for treatment of Bone Marrow Lesions (BMLs) in the&#xD;
      knee.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, single-blinded, two-arm, randomized study. Enrolled&#xD;
      subjects will have a single Bone Marrow Lesion of the tibia, single BML of the femur, or&#xD;
      adjoining Bone Marrow Lesions of tibia and femur. Subjects will also be surgical candidates&#xD;
      for knee arthroscopy due to mechanical symptoms, meniscus tear, loose body and/or synovitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stratified blocked randomization will be used to assign subjects to either Subchondroplasty&#xD;
      with arthroscopy or to arthroscopy alone in a 2:1 ratio. Individual sets of blocks will be&#xD;
      determined within study site and lesion polarity status (unipolar vs. bipolar).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled within 60 days prior to surgery and take part in follow-up visits&#xD;
      for two years following surgery. A preoperative visit will occur at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits were to initially occur at the study site at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12&#xD;
      months, and 24 months post-surgery. Telephone follow-up interviews to be be performed at 9&#xD;
      and 18 months post-surgery. Target enrollment was 201 subjects, to include 134 subjects in&#xD;
      the treatment group (Subchondroplasty + Arthroscopy) and 67 subjects in the control group&#xD;
      (Arthroscopy alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of October 2020, follow-up has been amended to be completed remotely, where all visits can&#xD;
      be performed electronically and/or via telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete the study at the 24 month follow-up visit. For the purposes of this&#xD;
      protocol, a revision will be defined as any partial or total joint arthroplasty or any bone&#xD;
      fixation, bone grafting or bone substitute procedure in the same compartment in the study&#xD;
      knee.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The surgeon will be blinded to the treatment group until the time of surgery to avoid potential selection bias during the screening process. The subject will be blinded to the treatment group. The research coordinator will consult the central randomization list to determine which group the subject is in. Subjects may be randomized prior to surgery to allow for OR set-up. However, randomization should be performed as close to the time of surgery as possible to reduce the risk of randomization failures due to cancelled procedures.</masking_description>

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether Subchondroplasty with arthroscopy is superior to arthroscopy alone for treatment of bone marrow lesions in the knee.&#xD;
Superiority will be evaluated in terms of Composite Clinical Success (CCS) requiring freedom from subsequent secondary surgical intervention (SSSI) and among those free from SSSI, a clinically meaningful reduction in self-reported pain based on a validated measure of subject-reported pain (improvement in KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) pain of at least 10 points at 12 months) .&#xD;
For the purpose of this study, SSSI will include any partial or total joint arthroplasty or any bone grafting or bone substitute procedure in the study knee.</description>

    <description>The Subchondroplasty® (SCP®) Procedure targets and fills bone defects with AccuFill® Bone Substitute Material utilizing an arthroscopic / percutaneous approach. Using intraoperative fluoroscopy, the bone defect is localized relative to MRI findings The appropriate AccuPort® Delivery Cannula is drilled to the bone defect. AccuFill® Bone Substitute Material is then injected into the subchondral bone defect. The calcium phosphate (CaP) fills the edematous void and hardens within the Bone Marrow Lesion. The CaP is resorbed over time and replaced with new bone during the healing process.</description>
