  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is an acute and fluctuating state of confusion and disorientation with&#xD;
      an incidence of 25-70% after cardiac surgery. Possible reasons for this multifactorial&#xD;
      complication are hypoperfusion, cerebral microembolization and inflammatory response, which&#xD;
      eventually lead to regional or global imbalance between cerebral oxygen demand and supply.&#xD;
      Adequate cerebral blood supply depends sufficient blood supply via the vertebral arteries and&#xD;
      the internal carotid arteries. The aim of this preliminary study is to investigate if&#xD;
      patients who develop delirium after open-heart surgery show differences in their cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in extracerebral arterial vessels compared to&#xD;
      those patients without delirium.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is an acute and fluctuating state of confusion and disorientation,&#xD;
      characterized by changes in attention, cognition, consciousness, and perception, with an&#xD;
      incidence of 25-70% after cardiac surgery. Possible reasons for this multifactorial&#xD;
      complication are hypoperfusion, cerebral microembolization and inflammatory response, which&#xD;
      eventually lead to regional or global imbalance between cerebral oxygen demand and supply.&#xD;
      This frequent cerebral injury has detrimental and long-lasting consequences and remains a&#xD;
      serious healthcare burden, particularly due to its association with higher medical costs,&#xD;
      increased morbidity, long-term cognitive deficits, and greater mortality. Progress in&#xD;
      reducing the incidence of delirium has been hindered by the lack of a full understanding of&#xD;
      its pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate cerebral blood supply depends sufficient blood supply via the vertebral arteries and&#xD;
      the internal carotid arteries. Whereby the blood supply of the brain by the carotid arteries&#xD;
      is two-thirds and is easily accessable for blood flow examination with Doppler ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this preliminary study is to investigate if patients who develop delirium after&#xD;
      open-heart surgery show differences in their cerebral blood flow during cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass (CPB) in extracerebral arterial vessels compared to those patients without delirium.&#xD;
      Additionally we want to investigate the influence of cerebral microembolisation and CPB&#xD;
      associated inflammation in those patients. As secondary outcome measure we also want to&#xD;
      determine differences in length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) as well as in&#xD;
      hospital LOS and 30-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elective cardiac surgical patients undergoing valve replacement/reconstruction surgery on&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled the day before surgery by one physician of the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia will be induced with propofol (1.0-1.5 mg/kg), fentanyl (3-10 μg/kg), and&#xD;
      cisatracurium (0.2 mg/kg). It will be maintained with sevoflurane (target BIS value 40-50)&#xD;
      11, and fentanyl (0.05-0.1 μg/kg/min). Patients will receive tranexamic acid (10 mg/kg after&#xD;
      anaesthesia induction plus the same dosage in the CPB prime), depending on their kidney&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation will be achieved with heparin (400 IE/kg) to an activated clotting time (ACT)&#xD;
      &gt;400 s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPB will be performed using non-pulsatile target flow of 100% calculated cardiac output. Mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure will be maintained between 60 to 70 mmHg throughout CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To standardize the intraoperative course of our patients we will limit the intraoperative&#xD;
      haematocrit to 22% and the PaCO2-concentration between 30 and 40 mmHg.12 Blood glucose levels&#xD;
      will be held between 80-150 mg/dl intra- and postoperatively. Sedation on ICU will be&#xD;
      performed using propofol until extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotis duplex sonography for perfusion flow will be evaluated at the following timepoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before induction of anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Before going on CBP&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During CPB, 5 min after aortic cross clamping&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After CPB&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 24 hours after CPB Blood flow will be derived from the product of the vessels'&#xD;
           cross-sectional area and the intensity-weighted mean blood flow velocity through the&#xD;
           vessel using a pulsed-wave Doppler in ml/min. Because the sample volume will be adjusted&#xD;
           to the width of the vessel at the point where the diameter width will be measured, the&#xD;
           measurement can be performed independent of flow conditions (laminary or pulsatile).&#xD;
           Imaging of the vessel will be performed in the longitudinal plane, the cross-sectional&#xD;
           area will be assumed to be circular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To diagnose postoperative delirium two delirium assessement tests will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confusion Assessment method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium Scores will be measured at the following timepoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Postoperative day (POD) 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. POD 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. POD 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAM-ICU will be assessed twice a day (in the morning and in the evening). The Confusion&#xD;
      Assessment Method (CAM) will be performed after discharge from the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) for detection and differentiation of high-intensity&#xD;
      transient signals (HITS) in both middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) into artefacts, solid, and&#xD;
      gaseous cerebral microemboli (CME) will be performed at the following timepoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During cannulation of the ascending aorta&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After aortic cross-clamp&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During decannulation All collected data will be saved password-protected in an&#xD;
           electronic database on the department's server after data collection has been finished.&#xD;
           Only studyteam-members will have access to this data. After completion of the study the&#xD;
           results are to be published according to GCP-standards.&#xD;
