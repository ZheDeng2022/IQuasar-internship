  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PARADOR is multisite, randomized, double-blind, phase IV clinical trial to compare the effect&#xD;
      of sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto™) to enalapril (Vasotec®) on blood vessel function in&#xD;
      subjects with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter study will enroll 204 adults with a documented diagnosis of heart failure&#xD;
      and a documented history of left ventricular ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a screening visit which will last about 2 hours where the following will&#xD;
      be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A review of medical history and medications to determine eligibility. An effort will be&#xD;
           made to keep doses of other concomitant medication consistent throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of demographic and contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A urine pregnancy test will be done for women of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood drawn by venipuncture for safety testing and general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A BART scan of the forearm. The brachial artery vascular reactivity test (BART) is&#xD;
           designed to look at the function of the endothelium (the blood vessel lining) using&#xD;
           high-resolution ultrasound. This is a non-invasive test. The test is performed with the&#xD;
           subject lying down. A blood pressure cuff is placed on the right forearm, just below the&#xD;
           bend in the elbow. This cuff is attached to an automatic cuff inflator. The sonographer&#xD;
           will hold an ultrasound transducer over the subject's left arm artery (brachial), their&#xD;
           upper arm, and measure the size and the blood flow in the artery at baseline. Then the&#xD;
           sonographer will inflate a blood pressure cuff over the lower arm for about 5 minutes.&#xD;
           After the cuff is released the sonographer will take a picture of the size and blood&#xD;
           flow in the artery for 2 minutes after the cuff is released. This test measures the&#xD;
           ability of the brachial artery to get bigger (dilate) when exposed to increased blood&#xD;
           flow; this ability is a measure of the health of the blood vessel lining. This test may&#xD;
           cause temporary numbness and tingling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be randomized to receive a 2 week supply of enalapril 5mg twice daily or&#xD;
           sacubitril/valsartan 49/51 mg twice daily. Subjects will be instructed to take one&#xD;
           tablet from each container (active one, one placebo) twice daily. Subjects will be&#xD;
           instructed to take their study medication on the day of their BART scan testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a subject is currently taking an ACE inhibitor, the study team will instruct the&#xD;
           subject to HOLD their ACE inhibitor the following day. The subject would then start the&#xD;
           study medication at least 36 hours after the missed dose of ACE inhibitor. For example,&#xD;
           if study visit is on day 1, subject will HOLD ACE inhibitor morning of day 2, and start&#xD;
           taking assigned study medication on study day 3 in the evening. Subjects will continue&#xD;
           on their current treatment for their heart condition except for their ACE inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of optional pharmacogenetic blood sample from those subjects agreeing to&#xD;
           participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (2 week post randomization to study drug), this visit may last 30 minutes where the&#xD;
      following will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A review of medications and changes in medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment for adverse events and tolerability of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate,), if SBP &gt; 105mmHg AND subject is tolerating&#xD;
           current study medication dose, titrate to higher study medication dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect information regarding changes to concomitant heart failure medications (beta&#xD;
           blockers, diuretics, potassium supplement, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, other&#xD;
           anti-hypertensives). An effort will be made to keep doses of other concomitant&#xD;
           medication consistent throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood drawn by venipuncture for safety testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess study drug adherence (perform a study drug pill count).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If tolerable, subjects will have their study drugs increased to allow for the target&#xD;
           doses of enalpril 10 mg twice daily or sacubitril/valsartan 97/103mg twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dispense 8 weeks of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;

           prior to Visit 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 (10 week post randomization to study drug and end of treatment), this visit may last&#xD;
      90 minutes where the following will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirm subject fasted and avoided exercise and tobacco for at least 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A review of medications and changes in medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of adverse events and tolerability of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect information regarding changes to concomitant heart failure medications (beta&#xD;
           blockers, diuretics, potassium supplement, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, other&#xD;
           anti-hypertensives). An effort will be made to keep doses of other concomitant&#xD;
           medication consistent throughout the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Blood drawn by venipuncture for safety testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect unused study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss the plan to transition from the study medication to standard of care treatment&#xD;
           per the discretion of heart heart failure provider and the subject. Information will be&#xD;
           given to the provider and patient regarding results of the PARADIGM-HF trial and updated&#xD;
           ACC/AHA/HFSA heart failure treatment guideline update. The study team will instruct the&#xD;
           subject to re-start their standard of care ACE inhibitor at least 36 hours after their&#xD;
           last dose of study medication. For example, if the subject takes their last dose of&#xD;
           study medication on day 70, the subject will wait one day (day 71) and then re-start&#xD;
           their standard of care ACE inhibitor day 72 in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Schedule visit 6 telephone follow up call&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6 (4 weeks after Visit 5) this visit is a follow-up phone call that may last about 10&#xD;
      minutes where the following will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A review of medications and changes in medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document subject study completion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Withdrawal Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect information regarding changes to concomitant heart failure medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss the plan to transition from the study medication to standard of care treatment&#xD;
           per the discretion of heart heart failure provider and the subject. The study team will&#xD;
           instruct the subject to re-start their standard of care ACE inhibitor at least 36 hours&#xD;
           after their last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some subjects may have additional visits as they may have to be re-schedule if they had not&#xD;
      fasted for 12 hours prior to their study visit or have a fever or due to availability of the&#xD;
      BART scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Pharmacogenomics Study All subjects enrolled in the study will be invited to donate&#xD;
      an optional DNA specimen for pharmacogenomics research. Specimens will be used to achieve the&#xD;
      following objectives: 1) predict which subjects are more likely to respond to specific drug&#xD;
      therapies; 2) predict which subjects are susceptible to developing adverse side effects; and&#xD;
      3) predict which subjects are likely to progress to more severe disease states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will involve the collection of an additional tube of blood (one approximately 10 mL&#xD;
      sample) for DNA isolation will be obtained at Visit 1. If, however, the blood sample is not&#xD;
      collected during Visit 1, it may be collected at any time (after randomization) during the&#xD;
      subject's participation in the study. The collection of the sample will occur after the blood&#xD;
      is drawn for safety testing and should not add to much additional (about 5 minutes )time to&#xD;
      the study visit. Subjects can still participate in the main study, if they choose not to&#xD;
      participate in this optional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject who participate in the optional pharmacogenomics study can choose whether or not to&#xD;
      allow their samples to be banked anonymously when the study ends for future unspecified&#xD;
      research. Samples will be banked at the UW-Madison School of Pharmacy until the samples are&#xD;
      used up. Subjects can withdraw their permission for banking while the study is active, but&#xD;
      the samples will be anonymized at the end of the study for banking and thus cannot be&#xD;
      withdrawn a that point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Use and Banking After the research study has been completed and the main results have&#xD;
      been published, directly identifiable information will removed and the keys linking codes to&#xD;
      subject identity will be destroyed, making data withdrawal impossible. The stored data will&#xD;
      not be sent to researchers outside of UW-Madison and will be used for future research about&#xD;
      blood vessel function and/or heart disease.&#xD;
