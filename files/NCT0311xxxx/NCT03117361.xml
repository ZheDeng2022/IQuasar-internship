      This is a multi-center, open-label, single arm, non-comparative phase II trial, designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of plitidepsin in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in&#xD;
      patients with MM double refractory to bortezomib and lenalidomide.The primary endpoint will&#xD;
      be overall response rate (ORR), including stringent complete response (sCR), complete&#xD;
      response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR) and partial response (PR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 64 evaluable patients will be needed for the evaluation of the primary&#xD;
      endpoint, ORR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An early futility analysis will be performed with the efficacy data collected from the first&#xD;
      20 evaluable patients. The futility analysis will commence once patient number 20 has&#xD;
      completed two full treatment cycles. Patient recruitment will not be halted during the&#xD;
      conduct of this futility analysis.&#xD;

Only 10 patients were treatedand 8 evaluable for the primary endpoint (ORR according to IMWG criteria).

PD also diagnosed when an increase size or new bone lesions.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is more than 60 days but less than or equal to 180 days from the time submitted to the sponsor for review.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>On 29052018 the Sponsor closed the recruitment of the study due to the slow patient accrual. Besides the negative opinion of the EMA recommending the refusal of the marketing authorization for plitidepsin for MM reinforced the decision.</limitations_and_caveats>
