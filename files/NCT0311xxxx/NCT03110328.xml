      eligible subjects will receive treatment beginning on Day 1 of each 3-week dosing cycle for&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. Treatment with pembrolizumab will continue until documented disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable adverse event(s),intercurrent illness that prevents further&#xD;
      administration of treatment, Investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject&#xD;
      withdraws consent, pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure&#xD;
      requirements, subject receives 24 months of pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons&#xD;
      requiring cessation of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-center, open-label trial of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in subjects&#xD;
      with metastatic biliary tract cancer as second-line treatment after failing to at least one&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 33 subjects will be enrollment to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will begin with all subjects without regard for PD-L1 expression status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluable specimen for PD-L1 status must be available and confirmed prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects will be evaluated every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) following the date of IP drug&#xD;
      adminstration for the first six months and every 12 weeks (+/- 7 days) thereafter until&#xD;
      progression of disease is documented with radiologic imaging (computed tomography or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR (objective response rate) per RECIST 1.1. If a subject&#xD;
      has progression of disease by RECIST 1.1, it is recommended that the subject be discontinued&#xD;
      from the study treatment unless, in the Investigator's opinion, the subject is deriving&#xD;
      benefit from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be monitored throughout the trial and graded in severity according to the&#xD;
      guidelines outlined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version&#xD;
      4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except as noted above, treatment with pembrolizumab will continue until documented disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further&#xD;
      administration of treatment, Investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject&#xD;
      withdraws consent, pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure&#xD;
      requirements, completion of 24 months of pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons requiring&#xD;
      the cessation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for adverse event&#xD;
      monitoring (serious adverse events and events of clinical interest will be collected for 90&#xD;
      days after the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject&#xD;
      initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier).Subjects who discontinue treatment&#xD;
      for reasons other than disease progression will have post-treatment follow-up for disease&#xD;
      status until disease progression, initiating a non-study cancer treatment, withdrawing&#xD;
      consent, or becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will be followed by telephone contact&#xD;
      for overall survival until death, withdrawal of consent or the end of the study, whichever&#xD;
      comes first.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Have histologically or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of biliary tract cancer&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Have metastatic disease or locally advanced, unresectable disease with feasible biopsy&#xD;
