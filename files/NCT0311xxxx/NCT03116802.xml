    <textblock>
      Since the 1st pandemic of the 21st century caused by SARS coronavirus, the world has&#xD;
      experienced outbreaks of swine origin H1N1 influenza, Ebola and Zika viruses, which have all&#xD;
      resulted in global health crises. Rapid mass vaccination with an effective vaccine such as a&#xD;
      live attenuated vaccine, of vulnerable immune-na√Øve populations to establish herd immunity is&#xD;
      an approach to control outbreaks. Such live attenuated vaccine had been used with great&#xD;
      success in sporadic yellow fever outbreaks and recently successfully employed in Ebola field&#xD;
      trial, both of these diseases have the potential for pandemic spread. Indeed, live attenuated&#xD;
      vaccines have proven especially effective in controlling childhood diseases and have even&#xD;
      succeeded in eradicating polio and measles from most parts of the world. However, deployment&#xD;
      of such vaccines for pandemic control cannot be limited to children but must include adults&#xD;
      in order to rapidly elevate herd immunity rates to halt transmission. Vaccinating adults may&#xD;
      produce efficacy rates significantly different to those observed in children due to the&#xD;
      prevalence of chronic diseases and their associated metabolic complications. Presently, there&#xD;
      are 1 billion people who are overweight, many suffer from concurrent metabolic disorders. As&#xD;
      activation of the adaptive immunity is reliant on a robust innate immune response to&#xD;
      vaccines, metabolic disorders and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy with interventions such&#xD;
      as statins may reduce vaccine immunogenicity resulting in suboptimal efficacy in this&#xD;
      subpopulation. This study would therefore test the hypothesis that statins reduce live&#xD;
      attenuated vaccine immunogenicity. We will combine a clinical trial with systems vaccinology&#xD;
      approaches to define the impact statins has on the innate immune, B and T-cell responses to&#xD;
      live attenuated vaccination. Our study will thus extend upon another recently completed trial&#xD;
      by us and will provide new insights into the determinants of vaccine efficacy in a rapidly&#xD;
      growing and aging population globally&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite successful control of many infectious diseases since the 19th century, viral diseases&#xD;
      remain an important and significant health burden in the 21st century. In fact, the turn of&#xD;
      the 21st century saw the emergence of not only new but also re-emergent pathogens such as&#xD;
      SARS, MERS, West Nile, Ebola, dengue and Zika viruses. In addition, the modern world is&#xD;
      highly mobile and interconnected. The spread of infectious diseases is imminently only a&#xD;
      flight away. It is thus of no surprise that epidemics in this century are happening at a much&#xD;
      faster pace and spreading quicker to cause disruption to human health, society and the&#xD;
      economy. Vaccination, particularly with a live attenuated vaccine (LAV), which has the most&#xD;
      successful track record among the various forms of vaccines, remains the most economical&#xD;
      public health tool available to prevent or stop the spread of infections and alleviate human&#xD;
      sufferings. Rapid mass vaccination of at risk populations to establish herd immunity has been&#xD;
      successfully employed to control sporadic YF outbreaks in Africa and South America. More&#xD;
      recently, a clinical trial showed that ring vaccination of contacts with Ebola patients&#xD;
      completely abrogated secondary virus spread. Vaccination in times of pandemics, however,&#xD;
      cannot be limited to children but must include adults in order to rapidly elevate herd&#xD;
      immunity rates to halt further transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of LAV in adults has several important challenges that have not been systematically&#xD;
      addressed. The population demographics in Singapore, like most developed countries have&#xD;
      changed drastically over the past 3 decades. Along with improved nutrition, populations are&#xD;
      now living longer but with increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as obesity and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia. Consequently, the anti-cholesterol group of drugs, with pleiotropic properties,&#xD;
      statins, are among the commonest drugs prescribed globally for the prevention of secondary&#xD;
      cardiovascular and major vascular complications. There is presently a mounting concern that&#xD;
      the anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory effects of statins could have a detrimental&#xD;
      effect on vaccine efficacy. Indeed, studies examining inactivated influenza vaccination in&#xD;
      older individuals had observed lower immunogenicity and overall efficacy with statin use.&#xD;
      Whether statins have a similar negative immunogenicity effect on LAV remains undefined. The&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects may dampen innate immune responses critical for triggering adaptive&#xD;
      immunity resulting in reduced immunogenicity. Conversely, the suppression of innate immune&#xD;
      responses could favor LAV infection and replication, allowing adaptive immune cells a longer&#xD;
      period to sense the antigen, become activated and differentiated for improved immune&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, an experimental medicine investigation that leverages on a recently completed&#xD;
      clinical trial that the PI led examining how cross-reactive antibodies altered the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of yellow fever (YF) vaccination. We will seek to clarify the effects of&#xD;
      statin on LAV immunogenicity. YF vaccine is an excellent LAV, which remains the WHO&#xD;
      recommended response to the ever-present threat of YF outbreak. It has also served as an&#xD;
      important model for studying human antiviral immunity. We propose to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      long term statins therapy alters YF LAV immunogenicity by coupling the power of a clinical&#xD;
      trial with comprehensive systems vaccinology to define the impact statins have on the&#xD;
      adaptive immune response to YF vaccination. This study will elucidate how statins modulate&#xD;
      the networks that drive immunity to vaccination in a fast growing population globally.&#xD;
      Knowledge on how statins impact LAV immunogenicity would inform public health authorities on&#xD;
      the size of the general population that should be vaccinated to compensate for alterations in&#xD;
      immunogenicity in this subpopulation to achieve sufficient herd immunity for epidemic and&#xD;
      pandemic control.&#xD;
