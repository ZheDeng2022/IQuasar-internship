  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mainstay for treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) focusses on re-establishing and&#xD;
      maintaining the patency of vessels following coronary plaque disruption, through the use of&#xD;
      anti-platelets and anticoagulants. Despite advances in management ACS still carries a high&#xD;
      risk of morbidity and mortality, thus future management is likely to target other pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies indicate that CD4+ T cells, and more specifically Treg cells, are important&#xD;
      for the control of post-ischemic immune responses and the promotion of myocardial healing.&#xD;
      The investigators therefore hypothesise that expansion of Treg cells in patients with ACS&#xD;
      dampens the activation of the immune response and promotes both plaque and myocardial&#xD;
      healing. The investigators hypothesise that this can be achieved through subcutaneous&#xD;
      administration of low doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 supplementation appears to be an&#xD;
      attractive therapeutic option playing a key role in Treg cell development, expansion,&#xD;
      survival and suppressive function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I/II trial will carefully examine the safety of low-dose IL-2 in cardiovascular&#xD;
      patients where it is currently contraindicated. The planned doses will be given to the trial&#xD;
      patients once a day, over five days as subcutaneous injections [ i) Part A : Repeated doses&#xD;
      will be given in the range of 0.3x10^6 IU up to a maximum of 3.0x10^6 IU (total of 25&#xD;
      completed patients across 5 groups: 3:2 randomisation IL-2:placebo) ii) Part B : Repeated&#xD;
      doses will be given at doses not exceeding the maximum dose used in Part A (total of 32&#xD;
      completed patients across 4 groups: 6:2 randomisation IL-2:placebo)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      These doses have been chosen on the basis of safety and tolerability data from published&#xD;
      clinical studies. In the low dose IL-2 studies evaluated, there were a low rate of adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) in all of the studies with the most commonly reported AEs being injection site&#xD;
      reactions, fatigue, fever, nausea and vomiting. A low percentage of serious adverse events&#xD;
      (SAEs) were recorded in a GVHD (graft-versus-host disease)-risk study and these SAEs included&#xD;
      haemorrhage (CNS), anorexia, and infection (colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental and clinical background in low-dose IL-2 therapy suggests a potential&#xD;
      clinical utility of Treg cell expansion in patients with ACS. Administration of low doses of&#xD;
      IL-2 in various clinical settings appears to be safe and remarkably efficacious at promoting&#xD;
      selective expansion of Treg cells with preserved suppressive function. This is the first&#xD;
      trial to assess the mechanism of action of IL-2 therapy in cardiovascular patients. The aim&#xD;
      of Part A of this clinical trial is to assess the safety of low-dose IL-2 as well as the&#xD;
      proof of mechanism in patients with stable ischaemic heart disease. Part B aims to assess the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of, and increase in Treg as a result of this drug supplementation, in the&#xD;
      setting of ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that low doses of IL-2 in patients with ACS can increase Treg&#xD;
      number and function, and ultimately promote plaque stabilisation and myocardial healing (this&#xD;
      will be further addressed in future studies). In this context, it may improve patient&#xD;
      recovery and limit the occurrence/recurrence of major clinical events.&#xD;
