    <textblock>
      To evaluate the performance characteristics of the Smart External Drain (SED) compared with&#xD;
      standard EVD drains in the hospital setting, specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number, type and duration of staff interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regulating and controlling ICP and CSF drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintaining system control with patient movement.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this two day clinical trial, subjects will be observed on Day 1 of study during their&#xD;
      routine treatment and using their already existing EVD. On Day 2 of study; subjects will be&#xD;
      switched to the Smart External Drain for monitoring and management of ICP and CSF&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. GCS &gt; 13 (minimum of E3V5M5) prior to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must be scheduled to have an EVD placed as part of routine management and for&#xD;
             a length of at least 48 hours. (e.g. in the setting of a tumor removal or treatment of&#xD;
             hydrocephalus)&#xD;
