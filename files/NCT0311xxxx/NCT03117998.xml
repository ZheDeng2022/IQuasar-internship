  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple doses of REMD-477 in subjects who have Type 1&#xD;
      diabetes and are currently receiving insulin treatment. This study will determine whether&#xD;
      REMD-477 can decrease daily insulin requirements and improve glycemic control after 12 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment in subjects diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes with fasting C-peptide &lt; 0.7 ng/mL at&#xD;
      Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at multiple sites in the United States. Approximately 150&#xD;
      subjects with type 1 diabetes on stable doses of insulin will be randomized in a 1:1:1&#xD;
      fashion into one of three treatment groups.&#xD;
