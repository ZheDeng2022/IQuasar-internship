  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a combination of evidence-based strategies&#xD;
      can improve intrapartum and newborn care in facilities to reduce mortality among preterm&#xD;
      infants. This will be a cluster randomized implementation science study across 23 facilities&#xD;
      in Eastern Uganda and Western Kenya. Selected interventions will be supported in facilities&#xD;
      to measure impact during the study period. These interventions are: a) data strengthening and&#xD;
      data use activities; b) implementation of a modified WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist with an&#xD;
      emphasis on preterm labor and preterm babies; c) simulation-based provider training and&#xD;
      mentoring on key existing evidence-based practices to improve newborn outcomes; d) support of&#xD;
      Quality Improvement (QI) cycles to identify and resolve facility-specific issues and&#xD;
      bottlenecks. A two-stage design will be used where all study facilities will receive some&#xD;
      aspects of the intervention initially, namely data strengthening and the modified checklist.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the remaining interventions (QI cycles and simulation training of providers)&#xD;
      will be rolled out to a randomly selected half of the facilities in the first stage. At a&#xD;
      second stage, the remaining half of the facilities will receive the remaining interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The randomized, controlled cluster trial (RCCT) will test whether the study intervention&#xD;
      reduces the combined incidence of fresh stillbirth and neonatal mortality by 30% compared&#xD;
      with the control group incidence of FSB+NMR. Given a Type I error of 0.05, power=80%, a&#xD;
      one-tailed test, a balanced (1 control :1 intervention) sample, and a baseline PTB NMR of&#xD;
      10%, the RCCT requires 1,133 PTBs in each study group. The sample size has been increased by&#xD;
      35% to account for a 25% design effect and a 10% loss to follow-up/missing information,&#xD;
      requires 1,530 PTBs in each study group. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using this&#xD;
      sample. The study randomized facilities to either the control or intervention group, matched&#xD;
      on various characteristics to improve the similarity of the study groups and minimize design&#xD;
      effect. This a priori hypothesis is proposed prior to analyzing the intervention period study&#xD;
      primary outcome, using the baseline PTB incidence of FSB+NMR, and an effect size previously&#xD;
      observed with PRONTO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This implementation science study includes a package of interventions. Control sites receive&#xD;
      only the limited package of data strengthening and implementation of the modified Safe&#xD;
      Childbirth Checklist. The randomly selected intervention facilities receive an enhanced&#xD;
      package which also includes provider training/mentoring using PRONTO simulation and teamwork&#xD;
      training, ongoing clinical mentoring, and support for Quality Improvement cycles (PDSA&#xD;
      cycles) using a Model for Improvement framework. More detail about the contents of the&#xD;
      intervention is included below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Strengthening Strategies: initial training focused on routinely collected data plus&#xD;
      ongoing refreshers and mentorship throughout study duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strengthen the MOH data collection system (birth registries, admission/discharge&#xD;
           registries), as well as introduction of expanded documentation to capture preterm birth&#xD;
           details&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform facility assessment to determine gaps in infrastructure, supplies as well as&#xD;
           skills and competencies of providers and data managers to accurately and consistently&#xD;
           report routine facility data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Support facilities to use standardized definitions of indicators currently collected for&#xD;
           antenatal and postnatal care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Support adherence to national guidelines on documentation in the registers and patient&#xD;
           charts through training, provision of registers/charts and motivation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Introduce expanded routine documentation of preterm births including improving the&#xD;
           register to capture data on preterm and still births, and implementation of the modified&#xD;
           WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist (see below)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Support periodic data quality assessment cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create a synchronized online data dashboard repository system representing key&#xD;
           indicators on an ongoing basis with selective access for health care providers and&#xD;
           national policy makers&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist modified to address identification of preterm labor and newborn&#xD;
      care for preterm babies: initial training plus ongoing refreshers and mentorship throughout&#xD;
      study duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Introduce expanded routine documentation of preterm births including the piloting and&#xD;
           use of a modified WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist (mSCC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Introduce and train on use of the mSCC to detect, manage and treat high risk&#xD;
           labor/babies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect routine facility data including register reviews (study staff will visit each&#xD;
           selected facility at least once per month)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct periodic audits of the mSCC to determine uptake and completeness, review for&#xD;
           phenotyping information, and/or review for additional service indicators on preterm&#xD;
           babies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures to strengthen, recommended intrapartum, postnatal and neonatal care in facilities&#xD;
      through PRONTO simulation-based provider training and mentorship: training of trainers and&#xD;
      initial trainings in Kenya and Uganda plus ongoing mentorship in Kenya and modular refreshers&#xD;
      in Uganda, throughout study duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve intrapartum, postnatal and neonatal management by using a customized PRONTO&#xD;
           curriculum that includes highly realistic simulation and focused team training to&#xD;
           address gaps in emergency obstetric and neonatal response. The training emphasizes&#xD;
           lifesaving response during labor, delivery, postnatal and neonatal periods with specific&#xD;
           emphasis on the care of preterm babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial 2-days modular PRONTO training will be followed by periodic modular refreshers&#xD;
           and supplemental mentoring. In Kenya, this involves 6 one-week mentoring sessions led by&#xD;
           trained preterm champions over a 9-12 month period. In Uganda, a modular training model&#xD;
           with intermittent refresher trainings and two-day clinical mentoring sessions will be&#xD;
           offered over a 9-12 month period. Special emphasis will be put on evidence-based&#xD;
           practices and the views gathered from Kenya and Uganda stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Promote close follow-up of preterm babies up to 28-days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures to strengthen Quality Improvement (QI) cycles: initial training with ongoing&#xD;
      mentorship; QI team meetings each week with quarterly cross-facility collaboration workshops&#xD;
      throughout study duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop tools for, introduce and institutionalize QI cycles and regular project&#xD;
           monitoring and evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reinforcement of accurate and timely documentation in charts and registers in the&#xD;
           facilities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reinforcement of use of the mSCC, including its use as a data source to track progress&#xD;
           of change efforts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Link system gaps or latent errors uncovered during simulation training and suggested&#xD;
           solutions with QI efforts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop and recommend some tools to improve data collection such as for triage,&#xD;
           discharge and referral&#xD;
