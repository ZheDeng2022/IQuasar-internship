    <textblock>
      The focus of the study is to evaluate the expanded version of PRISM 1.0 for a broad array of&#xD;
      seniors with different needs and circumstances. The aims of the study are to: 1) obtain&#xD;
      information on perceptions of the usefulness and usability of PRISM 2.0 and interface design&#xD;
      issues; 2) examine the impact of access to PRISM 2.0 on social connectivity, engagement,&#xD;
      social support, and perceived loneliness; 3) examine the impact of access to PRISM 2.0 on&#xD;
      perceived isolation, well-being, and quality of life; 4) examine the impact of access PRISM&#xD;
      2.0 on computer attitudes, self-efficacy, technology proficiency and technology uptake; 5)&#xD;
      gather data on usefulness of system features and if these vary by living condition; and 6)&#xD;
      examine, in our statistical models, the influence of factors such as age, cognitive&#xD;
      abilities, ethnicity, education on system use and outcomes.&#xD;

      This study is part of the CREATE center. The focus of the study is to evaluate the expanded&#xD;
      version of PRISM 1.0 for a broad array of seniors with different needs and circumstances. The&#xD;
      aims of the study are to: 1) obtain information on perceptions of the usefulness and&#xD;
      usability of PRISM 2.0 and interface design issues; 2) examine the impact of access to PRISM&#xD;
      2.0 on social connectivity, engagement, social support, and perceived loneliness; 3) examine&#xD;
      the impact of access to PRISM 2.0 on perceived isolation, wellbeing, and quality of life; 4)&#xD;
      examine the impact of access PRISM 2.0 on computer attitudes, self-efficacy, technology&#xD;
      proficiency and technology uptake; 5) gather data on usefulness of system features and if&#xD;
      these vary by living condition; and 6) examine, in our statistical models, the influence of&#xD;
      factors such as age, cognitive abilities, ethnicity, education on system use and outcomes.&#xD;
      The design of the PRISM 2.0 is well grounded and the chosen features will be based on: 1) the&#xD;
      findings from the PRISM 1.0 trial; 2) the cognitive, human factors and engineering; 3)&#xD;
      emerging findings in aging (e.g., findings related to technology acceptance, social&#xD;
      isolation, social networks, life engagement); 4) existing theories of aging (e.g.,&#xD;
      Stress-Process Model; Active Theory; Social Isolation/Engagement; 5) findings regarding the&#xD;
      benefits of technology for seniors; 6) findings from previous work from CREATE regarding&#xD;
      interface design, training, provision of environmental support, and the needs of older&#xD;
      adults; 7) recent findings regarding Internet use among older adults; 8) findings from our&#xD;
      prior focus groups on barriers to access of technology and technology preferences; 9)&#xD;
      findings from our technology-based community intervention programs with older adults; 10)&#xD;
      existing models of technology adoption and diffusion; 11) the literature on implementation&#xD;
      science our planned focus groups and pilot testing of PRISM 2.0.&#xD;
