  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's aims are twofold: First, to examine physiological correlates of fear of physical&#xD;
      activity (PA) and second, to examine correlates between fear of PA and interoceptive&#xD;
      abilities in patients with chronic heart failure and healthy persons. Patients' fear of PA&#xD;
      will be assessed via the &quot;Fear of Activity in Situations - Heart Failure&quot; (FActS-HF)&#xD;
      questionnaire. The patient group will be split into two subgroups: One with high fear of PA&#xD;
      and the second with low fear of PA based on FActS-HF scores. Fear of PA will be assessed via&#xD;
      an adapted version of FActS-HF in a sample of healthy persons (control group). Each member of&#xD;
      the high-fear-of-PA group will be individually age- and sex-matched with one member of the&#xD;
      low-fear-of-PA group and control group. The participants of all three groups undergo the same&#xD;
      experimental trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: The &quot;startle paradigm&quot; will be used to investigate the physiological component of fear&#xD;
      of PA. The startle paradigm is based on empirical observations that the startle reflex is&#xD;
      larger after the priming with unpleasant stimuli and inhibited after the priming with&#xD;
      pleasant stimuli. The participants will be primed with various words including those words&#xD;
      associated with physical activity that are expected to be unpleasant in patients with high&#xD;
      fear of PA. The startle reflex will be triggered by air puffs on the eyes (startle probes)&#xD;
      and measured via facial electromyography (EMG). We assume that startle responses primed with&#xD;
      PA related words are stronger in patients with high fear of PA compared to the other groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Interoceptive accuracy will be assessed via the &quot;Schandry test&quot; and interoceptive&#xD;
      awareness will be assessed via the &quot;Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness&quot;&#xD;
      (MAIA) questionnaire. During the Schandry test the participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      subjectively count their heart rate without any aid or tools. The heart rate will be&#xD;
      objectively measured at the same time via ECG. A high congruence of the objective and&#xD;
      subjective results indicates a high interoception ability, and is assumed to be correlated&#xD;
      with fear of physical activity. Additionally, we expect the MAIA and FActS scores to be&#xD;
      correlated.&#xD;

    <description>The startle reflex will be triggered by air puffs (startle probes) and its modulation in response to a set of verbal stimuli related to physical activity will be measured with the EMG during a time window of 30 minutes. Thereby physiological (EMG magnitude) correlates of fear of physical activity will be assessed.</description>

        The study population will consist of adult patients with diagnosed chronic heart failure of&#xD;
        all underlying diagnoses. Patients have to be outpatients at time of study participation.&#xD;
        They will be recruited in primary care clinics, and heart failure outpatient clinics in&#xD;
        Germany. For the control group healthy volunteers without a chronic heart failure are&#xD;
        recruited.&#xD;
