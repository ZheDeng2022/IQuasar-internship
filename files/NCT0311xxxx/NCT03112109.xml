  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Against the background of the European Innovation Partnership on Active &amp; Healthy Ageing,&#xD;
      SmartCare aims to define a common set of standard functional specifications for an open ICT&#xD;
      platform enabling the delivery of integrated care to older European citizens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of SmartCare, a total of 23 regions and their key stakeholders will define a&#xD;
      comprehensive set of integration building blocks around the challenges of data-sharing,&#xD;
      coordination and communication. Nine regions will then deploy integrated health &amp; social&#xD;
      services to combat a range of threats to independent living commonly faced by older people,&#xD;
      while the others will prepare for early adoption, possibly in the framework of new ICT PSP&#xD;
      projects. In a rigorous evaluation approach, the deployment sites will produce and document&#xD;
      much needed evidence on the impact of integrated care, developing a common framework suitable&#xD;
      for other regions in Europe. The organisational and legal ramifications of integrated care&#xD;
      will be analysed to support long term sustainability and upscaling of the services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SmartCare services will provide full support to cooperative delivery of care, integrated with&#xD;
      self-care and across organisational silos, including essential coordination tools such as&#xD;
      shared data access, care pathway design and execution, as well as real time communication&#xD;
      support to care teams and multi-organisation access to home platforms. In addition, they will&#xD;
      empower all older people according to their mental faculties to take part in effective&#xD;
      management of their health, wellness, and chronic conditions, and maintain their independence&#xD;
      despite increasing frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SmartCare services build on advanced ICT already deployed in the pioneer regions,&#xD;
      including high penetrations of telecare and telemonitoring home platforms. In SmartCare,&#xD;
      these platforms are to be opened to cross-sectorial care teams, improving the ability of&#xD;
      older people to better manage their chronic conditions at home and deal with their increasing&#xD;
      frailty. System integration will be based, whenever possible, on open standards' multivendor&#xD;
      interoperability will be strongly encouraged.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the functions and impacts of the SmartCare pilot services from the&#xD;
      point of view of the different principal roles/stakeholders, such as end users (care&#xD;
      recipients), voluntary and non-voluntary informal carers, formal care staff/professionals,&#xD;
      managers and fund-holders. Evaluation of integrated care service delivery processes (process&#xD;
      evaluation) will improve the current scientifically based knowledge base on barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators towards integrated care delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparators were chosen to be current delivery of health and social care processes ('normal&#xD;
      care'), as provided by pilot sites individually. The project uses local scenarios as the&#xD;
      comparator in order to enable the evidence generated to contribute to local decision making&#xD;
      on using the technologies. Thus, the control groups were as similar as possible to the&#xD;
      intervention groups (receiving 'new care'). In addition, a number of possible confounding&#xD;
      factors were measured for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the scientific studies carried out in SmartCare is: To identify the&#xD;
      differences induced by implementing ICT supported integrated health and social care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any impact that ICT supported integrated health and social care might have on all users will&#xD;
      be the subject of analyses according to the framework presented in the MAST model (Kidholm et&#xD;
      al. 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the objectives that will be tested in SmartCare are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in number of contacts to health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in number of contacts to social care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences in use of health care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences in use of social care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences in costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences in organisational aspects caused by implementing ICT supported integrated&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in end-user empowerment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in end-user satisfaction.&#xD;

        Interventions will be provided by a combination of health care, social care, volunteer&#xD;
        sector care providers, and informal carers to the population samples to be drawn either by&#xD;
        randomisation or consecutive inclusion of either intervention or control end-users&#xD;
        determined by geographical areas (pilot sites). Additionally, these inclusion criteria for&#xD;
        end users are applicable:&#xD;

        Thus, the professionals that are involved in providing any type of health and/or social&#xD;
