      Phase II trial of nivolumab in 120 treatment naïve patients with ccRCC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients with biopsiable (biopsied) disease will receive nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2&#xD;
      weeks x 6 doses then 360 mg every 3 weeks for up to 84 weeks. Tumor response will be assessed&#xD;
      at weeks 12, 18 and 24 and then every 12 weeks. For patients who experience RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      defined PD, but remain clinically stable (and asymptomatic), a confirmatory scan after 6&#xD;
      weeks (± 1 week) of additional therapy is suggested. Patients with persistent PD at&#xD;
      confirmatory scan will be evaluated for enrollment on Part B of this study. Symptomatic&#xD;
      patients may be evaluated for Part B immediately. Patients without confirmed PD can continue&#xD;
      on nivolumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience symptomatic or confirmed PD (or have best response of SD at 12&#xD;
      months) on nivolumab monotherapy will be eligible for consideration for Part B. Part B&#xD;
      involves the addition of ipilimumab for up to 4 doses while maintaining nivolumab therapy.&#xD;
      Dose of ipilimumab will be 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks together with nivolumab changed to 3 mg/kg&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses. Nivolumab will revert to 360 mg every 3 weeks after the&#xD;
      completion of treatment with ipilimumab (beginning week 13-19 of Part B) for up to 48 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed with serial imaging assessments weeks 12, 18 and 24 and then every&#xD;
      12 weeks after the initiation of ipilimumab. The tumor measurements at the time of ipilimumab&#xD;
      institution will be the new baseline. If unequivocal symptomatic or confirmed new PD (as&#xD;
      defined above) develops, treatment will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients for Part B must still meet the eligibility criteria for initial study enrollment.&#xD;
      Patients with Grade 3 toxicity on nivolumab monotherapy, serious symptomatic disease that in&#xD;
      the opinion of the site investigator requires immediate use of an alternative treatment&#xD;
      approach or continued PR/CR will be excluded from enrolling in Part B. It is estimated that&#xD;
      roughly half of the patients accrued to the first-line treatment will go on to enroll in Part&#xD;
      B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional biopsy will be performed of a metastatic lesion at time of confirmed PD in all&#xD;
      patients enrolling in Part B. Confirmation of tumor in the biopsy specimen must occur prior&#xD;
      to initiation of treatment on Part B. FFPE and frozen tissue will be stored from this sample&#xD;
      and used for correlative studies described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional cohort of 40 non-ccRCC patients will be enrolled and analyzed separately for&#xD;
      evidence of anti-tumor activity (CR, PR and SD and PFS at 1 year of nivolumab). These&#xD;
      patients will also be eligible for participation in Part B. We anticipate that the accrual of&#xD;
      these 40 patients will be able to be completed within the 1.5 years needed for accrual of the&#xD;
      ccRCC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Nivolumab Administration. Nivolumab will be given every 2 weeks x 6 at a dose of 240&#xD;
      mg Intravenously (IV) and then every 3 weeks at a dose of 360 mg IV until toxicity, complete&#xD;
      response, disease progression, SD at 12 months or a maximum of 96 total weeks (12 weeks&#xD;
      induction, 84 weeks maintenance) Patients with disease progression (at any time) or SD at 12&#xD;
      months will be eligible to be considered for participation in Part B of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Nivolumab + Ipilimumab. Patients with Grade 3 toxicity on nivolumab monotherapy,&#xD;
      (excluding endocrine toxicity), serious symptomatic disease that in the opinion of the site&#xD;
      investigator requires immediate use of an alternative treatment approach or continued PR/CR&#xD;
      will be excluded from enrolling in Part B. It is estimated that roughly half of the patients&#xD;
      accrued to the first line treatment will go on to enroll in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab will be given 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks together with nivolumab 240 mg every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 4 doses. Nivolumab will revert to 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks after the completion of&#xD;
      combination treatment with ipilimumab .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the first 4 doses of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab, nivolumab&#xD;
      monotherapy will again be given every 3 weeks at a dose of 360 mg for a maximum of 48 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients may be dosed no less than 18 days from the previous dose of drug; and dosed up to 3&#xD;
      days after the scheduled date, if necessary.&#xD;

             duct tumors and tumors originating from the renal pelvis or upper urinary tract are&#xD;
             considered of urothelial origin and are excluded from this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one measurable site of disease, per RECIST 1.1, that has&#xD;
             not been previously irradiated. If the patient has had previous radiation to the&#xD;
             marker lesion(s), there must be evidence of progression since the radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Archival tissue of a metastatic lesion obtained within 1 year prior to study&#xD;
             registration (within 4 weeks preferred) and tumor tissue from nephrectomy is required&#xD;

             patients must have at least one site of disease (not including bone metastases)&#xD;
             accessible for biopsy. If biopsy/resection of a new lesion or primary tumor and slow&#xD;
             freezing of fresh tissue for single cell RNAseq study (as specified in the CLM) is not&#xD;
             feasible, the subject is not eligible for the study. All biopsies must be core needle&#xD;
             or excisional. Fine needle aspirate is not acceptable. NOTE: The tissue collected from&#xD;
             a surgical resection or multiple core biopsies of either a metastatic lesion or&#xD;
             primary tumor for the slow freezing of fresh tissue after the patient has signed&#xD;
             consent for the study could also be used for collecting the FFPE specimens.&#xD;

             female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is&#xD;
             defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of&#xD;
             other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must&#xD;
             have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/ml.&#xD;
