  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two center, 2 arm, Phase II study evaluating the combination of Ribociclib and&#xD;
      Everolimus in patients with advanced DDL and LMS who have had at least 1 prior systemic&#xD;
      therapy. Patients will be enrolled by sarcoma histology into DDL (Arm A) and LMS (Arm B). The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the anti-tumor activity of this doublet therapy in&#xD;
      these patient cohorts. Ribociclib will be administered orally at 300 mg/day 3 weeks on/1 week&#xD;
      off. Everolimus will be administered 2.5 mg orally on a continuous 28 day cycle. Clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory assessments will be made on day 1, d15 of cycle 1 and 2, and day 1 of each&#xD;
      subsequent cycle. Tumor response will be assessed by RECIST 1.1 at (CT or MRI) at week 8, 16,&#xD;
      24 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Study drug administration will continue until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Patients will be followed until&#xD;
      death or are lost to follow-up for analysis of secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 1 step registration process for dedifferentiated liposarcoma patients while&#xD;
      patients with leiomyosarcoma will require a 2 step registration process. For step 1 of&#xD;
      registration, patients must meet all the eligibility criteria necessary for step 1. For step&#xD;
      2 registration, patients must meet the inclusion criteria necessary for step 2 to be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             throughout the study and for at least 3 months after completion of treatment. Highly&#xD;
             effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male&#xD;
                  partner should be the sole partner for that patient&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of 1 highly effective method of contraception, and 1 additional (barrier)&#xD;
                  method, at the same time&#xD;
&#xD;
        Highly effective methods: Intra-uterine devices (IUD), Hormonal (birth control pills/oral&#xD;
        contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, contraceptive patches, or contraceptive&#xD;
        implants) Other effective methods (barrier methods): Latex condom, Diaphragm with&#xD;
        spermicide; Cervical cap; Sponge&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the&#xD;
             drug and for 21 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this&#xD;
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent&#xD;
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria Step 2 (LMS patients only):&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Patients with leiomyosarcoma must have tumors with intact Rb as documented by protein&#xD;
        expression by IHC for study entry. Patients without sufficient archival tissue for testing&#xD;
        will not be eligible. Please see Section 9.0 for further details on testing and&#xD;
        interpretation of results. In the event that a patient has prior sequencing information&#xD;
        (i.e. through commercial testing) suggestive of intact Rb, the patient may be included into&#xD;
        the study on a case by case basis as determined by the principle investigators. The patient&#xD;
        will still be required to submit tissue for Rb determination by IHC, but will not need to&#xD;
        wait for these results for study entry.&#xD;
