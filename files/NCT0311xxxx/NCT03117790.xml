    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbances frequently occur in elderly patients after major surgery; and their&#xD;
      occurrence are associated with worse outcomes including increased incidence of delirium.&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that, for elderly patients admitted to the ICU after non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery, low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion improved to some degree the quality of sleep and&#xD;
      reduced the incidence of delirium. The investigators hypothesize that, for elderly patients&#xD;
      after major non-cardiac surgery, dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia can also improve the&#xD;
      sleep quality. The purpose of this randomized controlled pilot study is to investigate the&#xD;
      impact of dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia on the sleep quality in elderly patients&#xD;
      after major non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbances usually develop in elderly patients after major surgery, which are&#xD;
      manifested as prolonged sleep latencies, shortened sleep duration, frequent wake-up,&#xD;
      disordered circadian rhythm, abnormally increased stages 1 and 2 non-rapid eye movement (N1&#xD;
      and N2) sleep, and decreased or absent slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM)&#xD;
      sleep. Occurrence of sleep disturbances is harmful for the recovery of both physiological and&#xD;
      mental functions after surgery, and may even lead to the development of postoperative&#xD;
      complications. For example, study showed that postoperative sleep disturbances were&#xD;
      associated with increase risks of delirium, cardiovascular events and infections, prolonged&#xD;
      durations of stay in ICU and hospital, increased medical expenses and high mortality rate.&#xD;
      However, methods that may effectively improve the quality of postoperative sleep are still&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple factors are responsible for the development of sleep disturbances after surgery.&#xD;
      These include (1) environmental factors, such as noises, lights, medical and nursing&#xD;
      activities, etc.; (2) comorbid diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, inflammatory&#xD;
      reaction, infections, etc.; (3) stress response and pain stimulation provoked by surgery,&#xD;
      especially major surgery; (4) mechanical ventilation. Studies found significantly disordered&#xD;
      circadian rhythms, fragmented sleep and absent REM sleep in mechanically ventilated patients;&#xD;
      and (5) multiple medications, such as benzodiazepines, opioids, non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs, and glucocorticoids,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a high selective alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist which produces hypnosis and&#xD;
      sedation by activating the alpha 2 adrenoceptor in the locus coeruleus of the brain; it is&#xD;
      well known that the locus coeruleus is the key part to adjust sleep and awakening. The study&#xD;
      of Nelson et al. showed that dexmedetomidine induces the expression of c-Fos in the locus&#xD;
      coeruleus nucleus and ventral lateral nucleus in rats' brain, which is similar to the&#xD;
      expression of c-Fos during non-rapid eye movement sleep. They presumed that dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      activates the endogenous sleep-promoting pathway to produce sedative effects, which is&#xD;
      totally different from benzodiazepines and opiates on the mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study of the investigators showed that, in elderly patients who were admitted to the&#xD;
      ICU after surgery and did not require mechanical ventilation, low-dose dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      infusion (at a rate of 0.1 ug/kg/h, for 15 hours) prolonged the total sleep time, increased&#xD;
      the percentage of N2 sleep (and reduced the percentage of N1 sleep), increased the efficiency&#xD;
      of sleep and improved the subjective sleep quality. Another study of the investigators showed&#xD;
      that low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion in elderly patients who were admitted to the ICU after&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery improved the subjective sleep quality and reduced the daily prevalences&#xD;
      of delirium during the first 3 days after surgery. We hypothesize that dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      supplemented analgesia can improve the structure and circadian rhythm of sleep, and reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of delirium in elderly patients after major non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple randomization was performed. Random numbers were generated in a 1:1 ratio with a block&#xD;
      size of 4 using the SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute, USA). Study drugs (either 200 μg/2 ml&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine hydrochloride or 2 ml 0.9% saline) were provided as clear aqueous solution in&#xD;
      the same type of 3 ml volume ampules (manufactured by Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co, Ltd,&#xD;
      China) and encoded according to the randomization results before the study by a pharmacist&#xD;
      who did not participate in the rest of the study. The results of randomization were sealed in&#xD;
      sequentially numbered envelopes until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine was not permitted in either group. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam&#xD;
      (0.02-0.03 mg/kg), propofol, and sufentanil. Muscle relaxation was achieved using rocuronium,&#xD;
      under some special circumstances, using succinylcholine or awake intubation is feasible.&#xD;
      Anesthesia was maintained with a propofol infusion and sufentanil or remifentanil, as well as&#xD;
      cis-atracurium, rocuronium, with or without the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane or the&#xD;
      inhaled gas nitrous oxide. The Bispectral Index were adjusted between 40 and 60. The&#xD;
      Bispectral Index is an electroencephalographic measure of hypnotic depth, which ranging from&#xD;
      0 to 100, with values between 40 and 60 considered optimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequential randomization numbers were assigned to vials by a pharmacist who was otherwise not&#xD;
      involved in the trial. All investigators, clinicians, and patients were therefore completely&#xD;
      blinded to treatment allocation. But in case of emergency (such as unexpected, rapid&#xD;
      deterioration in a participant's clinical status), clinicians could adjust or stop drug&#xD;
      administration if deemed clinically necessary. Unmasking was not allowed unless clearly&#xD;
      needed for clinical purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia was provided with a patient-controlled intravenous analgesia of the&#xD;
      trial drug (either dexmedetomidine 200 μg or 0.9% saline) and 80 mg morphine, diluted with&#xD;
      0.9% saline to 160 ml. The patient-controlled pump was programmed to deliver 2-mL boluses&#xD;
      with a lockout interval of 8 minutes and a background infusion at 1 mL/h. We adopt this&#xD;
      dosing regimen because it has been safely used in our clinical practice and our previous&#xD;
      studies. Patient-controlled analgesia was continued for at least 24 h, but not longer than 72&#xD;
      h after surgery. Other analgesics including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,&#xD;
      acetaminophen, and opioids were administered when considered necessary. Open-label&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine was not allowed except for treatment of delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit and remained for at least 30 min,&#xD;
      monitoring non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and pulse oxygen saturation. Then&#xD;
      they were sent to a surgical ward. Non-invasive blood pressure and pulse oxygen saturation&#xD;
      were monitored intermittently until next morning. Non-invasive blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
      were then monitored once or twice daily until hospital discharge. Those who were unstable&#xD;
      were monitored more frequently and transferred to an intensive care unit for clinical&#xD;
      purposes. For postoperative patient who accidently came to the intensive care unit,&#xD;
      polysomnography monitoring would not be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polysomnography was performed with a SOMNO watch plus (SOMNO medics GmbH, Germany) from 9:00&#xD;
      PM on the day of surgery until 6:00 AM on the first day after surgery. Two qualified&#xD;
      investigators (Z.-F.Z. and X.-Q.M.) were responsible for attaching the electrodes to the&#xD;
      patients. The polysomnogram included six-channel electroencephalogram (F3, F4, C3, C4, O1,&#xD;
      O2), two-channel electrooculogram (EOG) and one-channel chin electromyogram (EMG). These data&#xD;
      were processed according to the American cademy of Sleep Medicine manual (AASM)automatically&#xD;
      and stored safely in a research computer disc. A qualified sleep physician who was blinded to&#xD;
      the study protocol and did not participate in data collection and patient care scored the&#xD;
      sleep architecture epoch by epoch by using the American cademy of Sleep Medicine manual.&#xD;
      Total sleep architecture was divided into wakefulness, NREM sleep (stage 1, stage 2, and&#xD;
      stage 3), and REM sleep. Total sleep time was defined as the sum of time spent in any sleep&#xD;
      stage during the monitoring period. Sleep efficiency was calculated as the ratio between the&#xD;
      total sleep time and the total recording time and expressed as percentage. The percentages of&#xD;
      each sleep stage were calculated as the durations of each sleep stage divided by the total&#xD;
      sleep time. Sleep fragmentation index was calculated as the average number of arousals and&#xD;
      awakenings per hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staffs were blind to randomization, and were not permitted to communicate with&#xD;
      either patients or their doctors about any group assignment or treatment. These who&#xD;
      responsible for postoperative assessments was not allowed to participate in anesthesia and&#xD;
      perioperative care of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data included demographic characteristics, surgical diagnosis, pre-operative&#xD;
      comorbidities, surgical history, smoking and alcohol consumption, and pre-operative&#xD;
      medications and laboratory test results and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Cognitive&#xD;
      function was evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), score ranges from 0 to&#xD;
      30, with higher score indicating better function. Sleep quality was evaluated with the&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, score ranges from 0 to 21, with higher score indicating worse&#xD;
      sleep quality. Subjective sleep quality (Refer to the Richards Campbell sleep scale, a&#xD;
      11-point scale where 0 indicates the best possible sleep and 10 indicates the worst possible&#xD;
      sleep) and Pain intensity (A 11-point scale where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates the&#xD;
      worst pain) were also evaluated. Routine intraoperative monitoring included&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide, volatile anesthetic concentration, and urine output. Intra-arterial pressure and&#xD;
      central venous pressure were monitored only if necessary. Postoperative data included, study&#xD;
      drug and morphine consumption during patient-controlled analgesia, supplemental analgesics&#xD;
      and hypnotics within 5 days, and other medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients were assessed twice daily, between 8:00-10:00 AM and 6:00-8:00 PM,&#xD;
      until the 5th postoperative day or hospital discharge or death, whichever occurred first.&#xD;
      Subjective sleep quality was recorded with Numeric Rating Scale (NRS, an 11-point scale where&#xD;
      0=the best sleep and 10=the worst sleep). Sedation level was assessed using the RASS&#xD;
      (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale), with scores ranging from -5 (unarousable) to +4&#xD;
      (combative) and 0 indicates alert and calm. If RASS score reached -4 or -5, which meant the&#xD;
      patients were extremely sedated or unconsciousness. Delirium was not assessed. Delirium was&#xD;
      assessed with CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit). Delirium was&#xD;
      classified into three motoric subtypes: (1) hyperactive (RASS score was consistently&#xD;
      positive, +1 to +4); (2) hypoactive (RASS score was consistently neutral or negative, -3 to&#xD;
      0); and, (3) mixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other prespecified outcomes included postoperative pain intensity both at rest and with&#xD;
      movement, which was assessed twice daily at the time of delirium with Numeric Rating Scale&#xD;
      (NRS, an 11-point scale where 0=no pain and 10=the worst pain) during the first 5&#xD;
      postoperative days; adverse events from the beginning of patient-controlled analgesia until&#xD;
      72 hours after surgery; postoperative complications within 30 days; 30-day mortality; 30 days&#xD;
      after surgery. By using Chinese version Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified&#xD;
      (TICS-m; scores ranging from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating better cognitive&#xD;
      function), the cognitive function was assessed. Quality-of-life was assessed with the World&#xD;
      Health Organization Quality of Life-brief version, (WHOQOL-BREF; a 24-item questionnaire that&#xD;
      provides assessments of the quality of life in physical, psychological, and social&#xD;
      relationship, and environmental domains. The score of each domain ranges from 0 to 100, with&#xD;
      higher score indicating better function).&#xD;
