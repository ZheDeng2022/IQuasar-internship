  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultra-thin bonded posterior occlusal veneers represent a conservative alternative to&#xD;
      traditional onlays and complete coverage crowns for the treatment of severe erosive lesions.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine whether ceramic and composite resin&#xD;
      ultrathin occlusal veneers (0.6 - 1.0 mm thick) are effective in the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      patients affected by moderate and severe dental erosion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Along with data collection, complete arch polyvinyl siloxane impressions are made to obtain&#xD;
      accurate diagnostic casts. The occlusal relationship is recorded either at the maximum&#xD;
      intercuspal position or centric relation (in cases occlusal space is needed for the&#xD;
      restoration of the palatal of upper anterior teeth). An additive waxing is carried out for&#xD;
      the eroded teeth. The waxed cast is then duplicated and poured with scannable stone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An average occlusal clearance of 0.4 to 0.6 mm (central groove) to 1.0 to 1.3 mm (cusp tips)&#xD;
      is generated by means of rotary diamond burs for the ultrathin occlusal veneers. A rubber dam&#xD;
      is placed, and all areas of dentin exposure are ground with a coarse diamond rotary&#xD;
      instrument at low speed (1500 rpm) and immediately sealed using a 3-step etch-and-rinse&#xD;
      dentin bonding agent. The additive wax replica is scanned first for correlation (Cerec&#xD;
      Bluecam; Sirona Dental Systems). The prepared teeth are then scanned in the same way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teeth are restored using Cerec AC with the Bluecam/MCXL CAD/CAM system (Sirona Dental&#xD;
      Systems). By using the design tools of the software set in Biogeneric Copy, the restorations&#xD;
      are designed by correlating the preparations with the anatomy of the additive waxing. The&#xD;
      ultrathin occlusal veneers are milled either from composite resin blocks (LAVA Ultimate; 3M&#xD;
      ESPE) or ceramic blocks (e.max CAD; Ivoclar Vivadent) and polished mechanically with silicon&#xD;
      carbide-impregnated brushes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restorations are then adhesively cemented. After being air-dried, the intaglio surfaces are&#xD;
      silanated and heat dried at 68 oC for 5 minutes (Calset; AdDent Inc). The tooth preparations&#xD;
      are airborne-particle abraded and etched for 30 seconds with 37.5% phosphoric acid, rinsed,&#xD;
      and dried. Adhesive resin (Optibond FL, bottle 2; Kerr Corp) is applied to both fitting&#xD;
      surfaces of the restoration. After the luting material (Filtek Z100; 3M ESPE), preheated to&#xD;
      68oC (in Calset; AdDent), is applied to the tooth, the restorations were individually seated,&#xD;
      followed by the elimination of excess composite resin and initial light polymerization. Each&#xD;
      surface is exposed at 1000 mW/cm2 for 1 minute (20 seconds per surface, repeated 3 times).&#xD;
      Margins are then covered with an air barrier and light polymerized for an additional 20&#xD;
      seconds. Margins are finished and polished at the following appointment with diamond ceramic&#xD;
      polishers and silicon impregnated rubber polishers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are called for a base line evaluation followed by additional evaluations after 1&#xD;
      year, 2 years and 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Registries:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' registries are made in paper forms and immediately digitalized for safety. The form&#xD;
      is stored inside an identified folder containing other patient's documents related to the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the registry all data is verified by a third person to check for&#xD;
      completeness, calibration and accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two researchers linked to the project perform patient recruitment (not the evaluators).&#xD;
      Patients are interviewed and seen for data collection. If eligibility criteria are meet, the&#xD;
      patient receives a comprehensive explanation (accessible language) about the protocol and an&#xD;
      invitation to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite evaluators were previously calibrated; detailed description of the criteria (based on&#xD;
      USPHS) is available to the evaluator at every data collection (follow-up appointments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are seen at clinic of the Department of Prosthodontics and Dental Materials of the&#xD;
      Dental School of UFRJ. During the follow-up appointments data is collected in sequence by two&#xD;
      calibrated evaluators. In case of divergence, a consensus is achieved. Intraoral evaluation&#xD;
      is performed with dental explorer and mouth mirror assisted by dental operatory light as well&#xD;
      as well as a LED transilluminator for crack chasing. In case of failure (cracks longer than 2&#xD;
      mm, lost fragments or bulk debondings) patients are assigned for repair or change of&#xD;
      restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of 5 patients for each group was based on the following formula: n = (Zα/2+Zβ)2 *&#xD;
      (p1(1-p1)+p2(1-p2)) / (p1-p2)2, with a confidence level of 95%, power of 80% and the survival&#xD;
      rates of 90% and 20% for composite and ceramic restorations, respectively (based on previous&#xD;
      published data of in vitro fatigue tests).&#xD;
