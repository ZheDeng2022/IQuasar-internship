  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In chordoma cell lines and patient biopsies, the p16 (CDKN2A) tumor suppressor is&#xD;
      consistently deleted. Thus, chordomas are an example of a tumor with universal activation of&#xD;
      the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) pathway, and experiments with patient-derived&#xD;
      chordoma cell lines demonstrate aberrant CDK4/6 activity downstream of p16 loss can be&#xD;
      efficiently inhibited by the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, resulting in reduced proliferation&#xD;
      and growth of neoplastic cells. The investigators aim to conduct a phase II clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of the small-molecule CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced/metastatic chordoma who are not candidates for standard therapy. The primary&#xD;
      objective is disease control in patients with chordoma treated with palbociclib as single&#xD;
      agent. The study design of this phase II study is based on a Simon two-stage design.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chordoma is a rare bone tumor with slow growth. The standard treatment is en bloc excision,&#xD;
      but the site of origin of the disease often prevents complete surgery. For these patients,&#xD;
      debulking surgery followed by radiation therapy (RT) or high-dose RT alone can be an&#xD;
      alternative. However, local relapses or more rarely metastatic disease frequently occur, and&#xD;
      there is no efficient standard systemic therapy available. Only very limited responses are&#xD;
      seen with chemotherapy or targeted agents, such as imatinib and lapatinib. In chordoma cell&#xD;
      lines and patient biopsies, the p16 (CDKN2A) tumor suppressor is consistently deleted. Thus,&#xD;
      chordomas are an example of a tumor with universal activation of the CDK4/6 pathway, and&#xD;
      experiments with patient-derived chordoma cell lines demonstrate aberrant CDK4/6 activity&#xD;
      downstream of p16 loss can be efficiently inhibited by the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib,&#xD;
      resulting in reduced proliferation and growth of neoplastic cells. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      conduct a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the small-molecule CDK4/6&#xD;
      inhibitor palbociclib in patients with locally advanced/metastatic chordoma who are not&#xD;
      candidates for standard therapy. The primary objective is disease control in patients with&#xD;
      chordoma treated with palbociclib as single agent. The study design of this phase II study is&#xD;
      based on a Simon two-stage design. This trial will establish whether the overreliance of&#xD;
      chordomas on the activation of the CDK4/6-Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) pathway can be exploited for&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit. Based on previous experience with 125 mg palbociclib once daily for 21&#xD;
      days followed by 7 days of rest in patients with breast cancer, liposarcoma, non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer, mantle-cell lymphoma, and&#xD;
      glioblastoma, this regimen is chosen. Based on a Simons optimal two-stage design the disease&#xD;
      control rate (DCR) will be the primary end-point, whereby response is defined as complete&#xD;
      response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1&#xD;
      criteria after six cycles. For sample size calculation the investigators estimate a poor&#xD;
      response with 10% and a good response with 25% (power, 80%; alpha, 5%) leading to a first&#xD;
      stage of 18 patients and, if three or more patients responded to a second stage with&#xD;
      additional 25 patients (total n=43).&#xD;

             to treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor e.g. imatinib, lapatinib, erlotinib,&#xD;
             sunitinib, sorafenib, etc.&#xD;

             serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 72 hours&#xD;
             prior to registration (WOCBP is defined as a sexually active mature woman who has not&#xD;
