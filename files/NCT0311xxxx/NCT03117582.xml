      Purpose: To study the changes in the microbiome and stool composition in patients with&#xD;
      Clostridium Difficile Infection (CDI) who undergo Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT),&#xD;
      along with changes in their clinical characteristics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, descriptive cohort study. Patients will receive current standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a potential subject is planned for FMT, they will be approached by study coordinators or&#xD;
      investigators for participation in the study. If they agree to participate in the study, then&#xD;
      patient health, medical and demographic information will be collected from the patient and/or&#xD;
      from the medical record and entered into the research database, and associated with a&#xD;
      research code with which the stool samples will also be labeled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will be responsible for ensuring completion of the study questionnaire,&#xD;
      which consists of pre- and post-FMT sections. The questionnaire will be attempted to be&#xD;
      administered in person by the physician or study coordinator at a clinic visit, but may on&#xD;
      occasion be completed at home and mailed in to the study coordinator or physician, or&#xD;
      completed over the phone with the study coordinator or physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool preparations will be obtained by a nonprofit third party, OpenBiome, with whom the&#xD;
      University of North Carolina has collaborated for over one year. Preparations include a 250mL&#xD;
      (milliliter) preparation for lower administration, a 30mL preparation for upper&#xD;
      administration, and frozen capsules (30 in one treatment) for oral delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual FMT procedure will be performed in the majority of cases by colonoscopy. Other&#xD;
      possible routes of administration are via nasogastric or nasoduodenal tube (with upper&#xD;
      formulation), enema and frozen oral tablets. The current preferred route of administration is&#xD;
      via colonoscopy, based on observation (no head-to-head) trials showing improved efficacy, but&#xD;
      standards of care may change in the future. In all cases, the route of administration will be&#xD;
      based on patient characteristics and preferences, not for purposes related to the study. In&#xD;
      all cases, informed consent for the treatment will be documented as guided by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA). The patient will stop all antibiotics (including vancomycin or&#xD;
      other antibiotics against C. diff) at least 2 days prior to FMT. For all administrations&#xD;
      other than oral capsules, patients will perform a bowel preparation with 4 liters of Golytely&#xD;
      or equivalent osmotic laxative split between the evening prior to the procedure and the&#xD;
      morning of the procedure. In a minority of instances, especially for pediatric patients, the&#xD;
      patient may be electively admitted to the hospital the night before, to monitor medical&#xD;
      stability during the preparation, facilitate bowel preparation, and provide intravenous&#xD;
      hydration. The bowel cleansing preparation is generally taken orally, though in rare&#xD;
      instances must be administered via nasogastric or nasoduodenal (NG/ND) tube. Hospital&#xD;
      admission and bowel preparation via NG/ND tube will only be performed if indicated as&#xD;
      standard-of-care, not for purposes specifically related to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For colonoscopic FMT, the procedure will be performed with anesthesia support at the UNC&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital endoscopy unit. Sedation will be at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      anesthesiologist in agreement with the endoscopist, but generally consists of intravenous&#xD;
      propofol, with monitored anesthesia care. For colonoscopic FMT, the patient is given two 2mg&#xD;
      doses of loperamide orally, two hours prior to FMT, and is then to take an additional two&#xD;
      capsules after recovery from anesthesia (recommended immediately upon arrival home, when an&#xD;
      outpatient procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor stool is obtained from OpenBiome, a third-party stool bank that screens donors for&#xD;
      medication use, allergies, and health-related conditions and prepares stool per a standard&#xD;
      protocol including suspension in normal saline. 250ml of donor stool is used for colonoscopic&#xD;
      FMT in patients with over one meter squared of body surface area. For small children this&#xD;
      quantity may be reduced proportionately. The entire 250ml's are placed into the ileum, cecum&#xD;
      and/or ascending colon, or at the extent reached by the colonoscope, via the operative&#xD;
      channel of the colonoscope. Patients are asked to maintain a right lateral recumbent position&#xD;
      as much as possible for the hour after infusion, to encourage permanence of the material in&#xD;
      the proximal colon. Of note, the FMT colonoscopy does not include meticulous mucosal&#xD;
      examination if not otherwise indicated, and as such is not a substitute for routine&#xD;
      colorectal cancer screening. Patients are monitored by post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)&#xD;
      personnel until ready for discharge, per standard unit protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For nasogastric or nasoduodenal administration, 30ml of donor stool is infused slowly over 1&#xD;
      hour. Before infusion, NG/ND tube placement is confirmed by X-ray per standard hospital&#xD;
      protocol, according to standard hospital consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In rare cases where procedural sedation, colonoscopy or NG/ND tube is contraindicated, frozen&#xD;
      oral capsules or enema may be used to administer FMT. With capsule administration, in&#xD;
      addition to stopping antibiotics two days prior to the procedure, the patient takes proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitor on the day before treatment and the day of treatment. There is no bowel&#xD;
      preparation. The patient takes the 30 capsules orally under direct physician supervision&#xD;
      within 90 minutes. Metoclopramide 5-10 mg x i may be taken one hour prior to the treatment.&#xD;
      With enema administration, bowel preparation will be performed prior to administration. Bowel&#xD;
      cleansing preparation, loperamide administration, and right lateral recumbency will be&#xD;
      attempted as per colonoscopic FMT. The enema will be administered under direct physician&#xD;
      supervision, as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study, subjects who are undergoing the above treatment per standard of care will be&#xD;
      asked to submit four (4) total stool samples. The first will be pre-FMT, at any time from 2&#xD;
      weeks prior to FMT (possibly at a clinic visit), up until directly before the pre-FMT bowel&#xD;
      preparation. Post-FMT stool samples at 2 weeks (range 1-3 weeks), 2 months (range 7-9 weeks)&#xD;
      and 6 months post-FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All stool samples will be collected according to the same protocol, described in a handout&#xD;
      (entitled &quot;Stool Collection Instructions&quot;) provided to participants. There are several&#xD;
      options for submitting the sample, basically according to patient convenience. If they can&#xD;
      produce a sample at a clinic visit, they can submit at that time. Alternatively, they will be&#xD;
      provided supplies to safely collect and then store samples they collect at home in their own&#xD;
      freezer. They will then have to deliver these samples to UNC (or possibly North Carolina&#xD;
      State University [(NCSU)] if that is more convenient for a particular subject), which can be&#xD;
      done at one visit with all of the samples, or in segments as they collect them. Before&#xD;
      submission to the biobank, the samples will be labeled with the research code and any other&#xD;
      identifying labels on the stool sample will be removed and destroyed. The de-identified stool&#xD;
      specimens will be aliquoted in the research laboratory for storage at -80Â° Celsius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be transported by the study coordinators from UNC to a storage unit at NCSU.&#xD;
      Research samples will be stored in a manner that will permit subsequent microbial DNA&#xD;
      extraction, microbial cultivation and metabolite analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also be asked to complete a post-FMT section of the questionnaire, from which the&#xD;
      main outcomes of FMT will be determined. They will be evaluated at two post-FMT clinic&#xD;
      visits, which may correspond to first two post-FMT stool samples, where evidence for any&#xD;
      possible adverse events or recurrences will be personally queried and evaluated. If patients&#xD;
      do not attend any scheduled post-FMT visits, the study coordinator will attempt to contact&#xD;
      them by phone and then by mail, both to encourage them to reschedule their clinic visit, of&#xD;
      if this is not possible, then to at least obtain the questionnaire data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim (clinical outcomes): Descriptive statistics of the clinical outcomes, such as&#xD;
      mean and median number of days of symptom duration, primary cure rate, percentage of subjects&#xD;
      with resolution of diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, etc will be calculated. Standard&#xD;
      deviations and/or confidence intervals will be provided where appropriate. If statistical&#xD;
      power allows, multivariate logistic regression models may be used to identify patient-level&#xD;
      risk factors predictive of primary cure (such as sex, age, independent-living status, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims: Differences in pre-and post-FMT stool composition, and between early and late&#xD;
      post-FMT samples, will be calculated with McNemar's test for significant differences in&#xD;
      proportions of rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) sequences pertaining to the relevant&#xD;
      bacterial phyla (Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria), and paired t-tests and&#xD;
      ANOVA's (or their non-parametric counterparts) for significant differences in Shannon&#xD;
      diversity indices (a measure of bacterial diversity) and in concentrations of multiple bile&#xD;
      acids. If these measures are different from pre- to post-FMT samples, then the relationship&#xD;
      of percent differences in each stool parameter to clinical outcome will be evaluated using&#xD;
      logistic regression with primary outcome of &quot;primary cure&quot; within two months of FMT, and a&#xD;
      Cox proportional hazards model with the time variable as &quot;days to primary cure&quot; and the&#xD;
      censor variable as &quot;primary cure.&quot; Secondary analyses may be conducted with &quot;any cure&quot; as the&#xD;
      outcome variable if repeat FMT is frequently needed. The investigators will also compare a&#xD;
      sample of donor stool to the post-FMT samples with the same statistical tests, under the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the closer that post-FMT stool resembles donor stool (and the more durable&#xD;
      this resemblance), the better the clinical response. All statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      performed at an alpha of 0.05.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. As subjects must meet standard clinical criteria for candidacy for FMT, all patients&#xD;
             will have suffered symptomatic diarrhea and have documented stool c. difficile toxin&#xD;
             positivity. Almost all patients will have failed standard therapy for CDI, which&#xD;
             includes at least one course of treatment with a primary agent (metronidazole,&#xD;
             vancomycin or fidaxomicin), as well as an extended vancomycin taper following either&#xD;
             the second or third recurrence. There may be extenuating circumstances that could&#xD;
             justify FMT for CDI outside of these parameters, such as severe allergy to multiple of&#xD;
             the above agents, though this would be expected to be exceedingly rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All patients must be able to tolerate either colonoscopy (including anesthesia and&#xD;
             sedation) or placement of a nasogastric/nasoduodenal tube, without a contraindication&#xD;
             to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prisoners (for concerns of vulnerability and logistics)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Adult patients who are themselves unconsentable at time of FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Life expectancy judged to be &lt;3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Need for extended antibiotics at baseline, for an indication other than treatment for&#xD;
             CDI&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any patient who the clinician judges to be a poor candidate for FMT, for reasons of&#xD;
             comorbidities or not being able to tolerate the procedure for administration, would by&#xD;
             definition be excluded from the study.&#xD;
