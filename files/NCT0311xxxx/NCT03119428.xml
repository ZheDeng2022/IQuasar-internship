  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OMP-31M32 as a single&#xD;
      agent or in combination with nivolumab. OMP-313M32 is an experimental anti-TIGIT antibody&#xD;
      that was developed to block TIGIT from binding PVR allowing the body's T-cells to destroy&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1a/b dose escalation study of OMP-31M32 administered as a single&#xD;
      agent or in combination with nivolumab to evaluate the safety, tolerability pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study&#xD;
      consists of a screening period, a treatment period and a post-treatment follow-up period in&#xD;
      which patients will be followed for survival for up to 2 years. Subjects will be enrolled in&#xD;
      two stages in the Phase 1a (dose escalation and expansion) and one stage in the Phase 1b&#xD;
      (dose escalation).&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiotherapy, within&#xD;
