      This phase II trial studies how well modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53&#xD;
      (p53MVA) and pembrolizumab work in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or&#xD;
      fallopian tube cancer that has come back (recurrent). Vaccines made from a gene-modified&#xD;
      virus may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack&#xD;
      the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      p53MVA and pembrolizumab together may work better in treating patients with ovarian, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess response rate (complete responses and partial responses) after treatment with&#xD;
      p53MVA and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess median progression free survival (PFS), clinical benefit (complete response,&#xD;
      partial response lasting &gt; 6 months), overall survival (OS), safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate if the CD8+ T cell signal exceeds that detected in the single agent p53MVA trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing&#xD;
      p53.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3 weeks and modified&#xD;
      vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53 subcutaneously (SC) every 3 weeks for up to 3&#xD;
      vaccines. Cycles with pembrolizumab repeat every 3 weeks for up to 49 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1-3 weeks and every 12 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A patient is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breast-feeding, and&#xD;
             at least one of the following conditions applies: a.) Not a woman of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (WOCBP) OR b.) A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance&#xD;
             during the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written&#xD;
             informed consent for the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1., or detectable disease; lesions situated&#xD;
             in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been&#xD;
             demonstrated in such lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured&#xD;
             in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded); each lesion must be&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), positron&#xD;
             emission tomography (PET)/CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); lymph nodes must be&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT, PET/CT, or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Detectable disease in a patients is defined as one who does not have measurable&#xD;
                  disease, but has at least one of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Baseline values of CA-125 at least 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Ascites and/ or pleural effusion attributed to tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Solid and/ or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet&#xD;

                       lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose ovarian cancer recurs/progresses within 0-6 months following&#xD;
             platinum-based chemotherapy have platinum resistant or refractory disease; these&#xD;
             patients are not considered to benefit from additional platinum-based therapy and are&#xD;
             treated with other sequential single agents; such patients are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with documented disease recurrence/progression within 6-12 months of&#xD;
             completing platinum-based therapy, are considered to have 'borderline' platinum&#xD;
             sensitivity; these patients will not be eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who relapse more than 12 months after completion of platinum-based treatment&#xD;
             are considered 'platinum sensitive' and will not be eligible for this trial, since&#xD;
             they have a favorable (33-59%) chance of responding to further rounds of platinum&#xD;
             based chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with confirmed p53 mutation by molecular analysis and/or evidence of p53&#xD;
             overexpression by immunohistochemistry (&gt;= 10% of cells within tumor staining&#xD;

             Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) approved pathology core pathologist, using CLIA&#xD;
             approved mutational analysis or immuno-histochemistry techniques on formalin-fixed&#xD;
             paraffin-embedded tissue; in the case of equivocal immunohistochemistry (IHC) results,&#xD;
             p53 involvement may be confirmed by detection of p53 molecular analysis on tumor&#xD;
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); patients on whom molecular analysis of p53 mutations is&#xD;
             already available, will not require IHC analysis; molecular analysis may be performed&#xD;
             as an additional research procedure at the end of the study (distinct from eligibility&#xD;
             determination) if the principal investigator (PI) deems it of scientific value and&#xD;
             research funding is available to cover the cost; patients are not required to have&#xD;
             PD-L1 positive ovarian tumors and PD-L1 testing is not mandatory on this study;&#xD;
