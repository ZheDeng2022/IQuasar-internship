    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether combination of obinutuzumab, lenalidomide,&#xD;
      and high dose methylprednisolone in the treatment of Richter's Syndrome. The study will&#xD;
      evaluate whether this regimen can reduce the amount of cancerous cells in your body. All of&#xD;
      these agents are approved by the FDA Obinutuzumab is a protein molecule manufactured from a&#xD;
      single cell population, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of CLL of SLL. Lenalidomide is for the treatment of patients with other blood&#xD;
      cancers. Methylprednisolone is a type of steroid, and it is used in a wide variety of medical&#xD;
      conditions. These agents and the combination of these agents are not approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of Richter's Syndrome and are considered experimental.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of&#xD;
      obinutuzumab, lenalidomide, and HDMP for patients with RS. There is not a standard of care&#xD;
      for patients with Richter's Syndrome (RS). Ten patients will be enrolled with RS diagnosed by&#xD;
      histology or flow cytometry and CLL, regardless of prior treatment for either condition.&#xD;
