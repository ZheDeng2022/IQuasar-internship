      This study is the clinical study of Apatinib combined with Capecitabine compared with&#xD;
      Apatinib in the treatment of advanced non-resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma, the object is&#xD;
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,its purpose is to observe and evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Apatinib Mesylate Tablets combined with Capecitabine in the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, its main primary endpoint is TTP (time to&#xD;
      progression) while the secondary endpoint is OS (overall survival), ORR (objective response&#xD;
      rate), DCR (disease control rate), serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and quality of life.&#xD;
      170 patients will be enrolled and 1:1 randomized into two groups: Apatinib combined&#xD;
      Capecitabine and Apatinib alone. Major safety indicators are Vital signs, laboratory&#xD;
      indicators, adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), drug-related AE and SAE, and&#xD;
      specific AE (such as hypertension, proteinuria, and hand-foot syndrome), according to&#xD;
      NCI-CTCAE.&#xD;
