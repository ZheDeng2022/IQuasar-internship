  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a clinical suspicion of rumination syndrome and/or supra-gastric belching are&#xD;
      randomized into baclofen or placebo for 2 weeks (10mg, tid). thereafter, they undergo a high&#xD;
      resolution impedance manometry measurement, were they receive a solid meal, and recordings&#xD;
      continue for another hour. Thereafter, they will receive the alternative treatment, after&#xD;
      which they will undergo a second high resolution impedance manometry measurement. Patients&#xD;
      are asked to fill out questionnaires during the entire study period.&#xD;

    <measure>objective measurement of rumination / supra-gastric belching, using high resolution impedance manometry monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks treatment</time_frame>
    <description>High Resolution impedance Manometry monitoring will be performed, with a meal. We will look at the number of times patients push an event marker, the number of time patients ruminate or have supra-gastric belching or have reflux episodes, or have transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, both before and after the meal. And we will compare these outcomes between placebo and baclofen.</description>

After 2 weeks of treatment, patients will undergo a High Resolution Impedance Manometry (HRiM) measurement, with meal. We will record for in total 2 hours. Patients are asked to fill out questionnaires concerning their overall wellbeing.</description>
