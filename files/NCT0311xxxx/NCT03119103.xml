      Apnea, a cessation in breathing is critical condition that affects the person regardless of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In infants, an apneic state occurs when there is an absence of respirations for 20 seconds&#xD;
      (Alvaro &amp; Rigatto, 2012). In adults, there is a correlation between sleep apnea with&#xD;
      increased risks of cardiovascular health problems (Wimms, Woehrle, Ketheeswaran, Ramanan, &amp;&#xD;
      Armitstead, 2016; Wu, Yuan, Wang, Sun, Liu, and Wei, 2016; Hao, Xiandao, Li, Jingwu, Jinghua,&#xD;
      &amp; Yongxiang, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this proposed study is to investigate the reliability of a smart bed sheet's&#xD;
      ability to detect physiological signals such as respiratory patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's goals are two-fold: 1) to determine the sensors' ability to detect patterns with&#xD;
      regards to input signals, and 2) to evaluate the efficacy of pressure sensor signals&#xD;
      collected in relaying respiratory rate and respiratory patterns to monitor different&#xD;
      thresholds of respiration rate and pattern which may include critical parameters dangerously&#xD;
      outside of life sustaining norms.&#xD;

      Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is one of the leading causes of death in infants (Hospital for&#xD;
      Sick Children, 2016; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 2016). The first few years are&#xD;
      crucial as many factors contribute to infants' healthy development and much of the critical&#xD;
      growth period occurs during sleep. Newborns spend the majority of a day sleeping, up to 16&#xD;
      hours (Parmelee, Shulz, &amp; Disbrow, 1961). Infants generally breathe irregularly with&#xD;
      significant breath-to-breath variability and periodic breathing characterizing regular and&#xD;
      apneic states (Alvaro &amp; Rigatto, 2012). However, when an abnormal rhythm or apneic period&#xD;
      arises, the situation becomes critical with a limited window of opportunity to save the life&#xD;
      of a newborn (e.g., Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or Bradycardia). An apneic state occurs when&#xD;
      there is an absence of respirations for 20 seconds (Alvaro &amp; Rigatto, 2012). The&#xD;
      characterization of apnea can be divided into different states such as obstructive apnea,&#xD;
      central apnea, and mixed apnea. Emerging literature in adults indicate a correlation between&#xD;
      sleep apnea with increased risks of cardiovascular health problems (Wimms, Woehrle,&#xD;
      Ketheeswaran, Ramanan, &amp; Armitstead, 2016; Wu, Yuan, Wang, Sun, Liu, and Wei, 2016; Hao,&#xD;
      Xiandao, Li, Jingwu, Jinghua, &amp; Yongxiang, 2016). With the ultimate goal of early detection&#xD;
      of changes in respiratory rates and patterns, improved methods of monitoring and detection&#xD;
      along with sounding an alarm will allow for early intervention and potential prevention of&#xD;
      death or critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves evaluating the sensor effectiveness on healthy human participants. The&#xD;
      participants will spend one night sleeping on the functional bed sheet in the Nursing&#xD;
      Simulation Centre at York University. Pressure signals will will be recorded during the&#xD;
      night, and later evaluated for the respiration rate and patterns. Hourly during sleep, the&#xD;
      researcher will assess and document participants' respiratory rates and patterns, and pulse&#xD;
      oximeter readings (which includes the oxygen saturation reading and heart rate). Audio-visual&#xD;
      recording of the participants during their sleep will be captured for support of the&#xD;
      interpretation of signal anomalies. The data collected from the functional bed sheet will be&#xD;
      compared to clinical grade hourly manual monitoring of the respiratory rates and patterns by&#xD;
      reseachers and registered nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paricipants will complete a pre-screening form prior to settling in for the night. When ready&#xD;
      for sleep, participants will be directed to position themselves on the bed sheet and through&#xD;
      a variety of different sleeping positions (back, front, right side, left side) to establish a&#xD;
      baseline. During sleep, the sensors on the functional bed sheet will capture participants'&#xD;
      movement and respiratory indicators. Hourly, the researcher will obtain the physiological&#xD;
      findings of respiratory rate and rhythm (obtained through observation), and heart rate and&#xD;
      oxygen saturation level (obtained from the pulse oximeter)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be followed by a pre-clinical study conducted with infant and adult high&#xD;
      technology mannequins. The pre-clinical study evaluates the efficacy of the functional bed&#xD;
      sheet sensors to detect pressure variations, respiratory rates and patterns both within&#xD;
      normal and abnormal limits. Researchers will evaluate sensor data looking for signal&#xD;
      deviances. This phase is fundamental and will provide evidence to support the clinical study&#xD;
      that evaluates the effectiveness of the device on human participants.&#xD;
