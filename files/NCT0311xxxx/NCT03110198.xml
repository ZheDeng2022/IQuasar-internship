      The research aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of that mesalazine with hydrocortisone&#xD;
      sodium succinate for the induction of clinical remission during a 4-week double-blind&#xD;
      treatment period in active UC (define as total Mayo score of greater than or equal to 4 and&#xD;
      less than or equal to 10). A total of 528 patients will be randomly divided into three group,&#xD;
      one will receive mesalazine 4g with hydrocortisone sodium succinate 100mg enema, and the&#xD;
      other two group will respectively to receive mesalazine 4g and hydrocortisone sodium 100mg&#xD;
      one times daily for 4 weeks. The end of the study for every patient is the improvement of&#xD;
      main symptoms.The primary endpoint is the clinical remission after 2 and 4 weeks double-blind&#xD;
      treatment, defined on the basis of a total Mayo score ≤ 2 points, with no subscore &gt; 1 point.&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint are endoscopic mucosal healing at week 2 and 4 of double-blind period,&#xD;
      defined as an absolute subscore for endoscopy portion of the Mayo score of 0 point and the&#xD;
      change from baseline in Quality of Life at week 4 of double-blind period based on the IBDQ.&#xD;
