  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a staged registry study of early treatment strategy management of acute aneurysmal&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage(aSAH) among different economic development levels areas in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First stage, the study will investigate and register the basic information of emergency&#xD;
      treatment management for the acute aSAH in 20 different grade centers located in different&#xD;
      economic levels districts including Northeast part, Northern, Eastern, South-central,&#xD;
      Northwest, Southwest and Qinghai-Tibet of China. Comparing the the outcome of acute aSAH to&#xD;
      find the critical factors to affect it by statistical analysis. Then,the investigators will&#xD;
      offer some suggestions to adjust the measures to improve the efficacy of emergency medical&#xD;
      service for acute SAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second stage, to evaluate the outcome after applying the new suggestion of self-control&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis that there is an appropriate green pathway in different&#xD;
      districts to shorten the rescuing time, improve the curative effects.&#xD;

      For this study, the investigators consulted and hired professionals and experts about data&#xD;
      collection, data analysis and methodology. So it has an intact systematic Project Steering&#xD;
      Committee for the whole project, including Data Monitoring Committee, Data Management&#xD;
      Committee, Project Academic Committee, Executive Group, Project Manager, Project&#xD;
      Statistician,Technical Support Center. Also the project have a scientific regulations system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steering Committee: To monitor and supervise the progress of the Registry Study for Emergency&#xD;
      Medical Service of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage With Different Economic Development&#xD;
      Levels Areas in China toward its interim and overall objectives.To consider recommendations&#xD;
      of the data monitoring committee and local ethics committees. To promote the publicity and&#xD;
      presentation of all aspects of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Manager and Executive Group: To ensure the successfully implementation of this&#xD;
      project, including charging the daily operations of the study in 20 different research&#xD;
      hospitals, organizing the monthly meeting to consider issues raised during the monthly&#xD;
      progress of the study, liaising with the steering committee,the data management centre and&#xD;
      statistical centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management Committee: To be responsible for setting up and maintain the Electronic Data&#xD;
      Capture (EDC) System according to the paper Case Report Form(pCRF) designed by principal&#xD;
      investigators. To collect and save the pCRF coming from sub-centers. To entry the data into&#xD;
      EDC system and keep the same with CRF. To organize training for the investigators about the&#xD;
      rules in filling the EDC and pCRF.To determine the frequency of the Data Management Report&#xD;
      and to fed it back to the steering committee every three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring Committee: To determine the frequency of the data monitoring including the&#xD;
      source data(Medical records) accuracy, completeness and representativeness comparing the&#xD;
      external data(EDC, pCRF) in 20 centers. To report the results after the monitoring back to&#xD;
      the steering committee about the missing data, non-reported and other problems about the&#xD;
      study. To make a Standard Operation Procedure(SOP) from getting data to using data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Academic Committee: To supervise the academic issues including patient recruitment, protocol&#xD;
      deviation, adverse events evaluating. To settle down the question and problem in the process&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Statistician: The investigators cooperate with the statisticians of Medical Research&#xD;
      &amp; Biometrics Center National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, China to get the&#xD;
      professional statistical report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical Support Center: To provide technical support during the process of the study.&#xD;
