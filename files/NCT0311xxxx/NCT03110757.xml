      The study will be conducted as a randomized, controlled, double blind Phase 1b&#xD;
      dose-escalating clinical trial in up to 60 healthy adult males and non-pregnant females&#xD;
      living in the S. mansoni-endemic area of Americaninhas, Brazil. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      trial is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of ascending doses of Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel(R)&#xD;
      (10mcg, 30mcg, or 100mcg) vaccine with or without AP 10-701 given as three doses administered&#xD;
      on Days 1, 57, and 113.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted as a randomized, controlled, double blind Phase 1b&#xD;
      dose-escalating clinical trial in up to 60 healthy adult males and non-pregnant females&#xD;
      living in the S. mansoni-endemic area of Americaninhas, Brazil. The study will recruit up to&#xD;
      60 healthy adult males and non-pregnant females to test two formulations of Sm-TSP-2 vaccine&#xD;
      (adjuvanted with Alhydrogel(R) only, or with Alhydrogel(R) plus AP 10-701), each at 3&#xD;
      different doses of antigen: 10mcg, 30mcg, and 100mcg. The study will use a dose-escalation&#xD;
      cohort design, in which escalation to the next dose cohort will be determined based on&#xD;
      evaluation of pre-defined escalation criteria requiring 7 day safety data to be examined&#xD;
      after all subjects in the current cohort have received their first dose of vaccine. Cohorts&#xD;
      will be enrolled sequentially. For each Cohort (1-3), an initial 5 subjects (2&#xD;
      Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel(R), 2 Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel(R)/AP 10-701, and 1 Euvax B Hepatitis B&#xD;
      vaccine) will be enrolled, randomized, vaccinated, and have completed Visit 02 (Day 2),&#xD;
      before enrolling the rest of the cohort. As with dose-escalation decisions, evidence of&#xD;
      significant reactogenicity will require further review prior to proceeding. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this trial is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of ascending doses of&#xD;
      Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel(R) (10mcg, 30mcg, or 100mcg) vaccine with or without AP 10-701 given as&#xD;
      three doses administered on Days 1, 57, and 113. The secondary objectives used to evaluate&#xD;
      the immunogenicity are: (1) to assess the IgG antibody response to Sm-TSP-2 using an indirect&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at Day 127, (2) to assess the IgG antibody response&#xD;
      to Sm-TSP-2 using an indirect ELISA at 14 days after dose one and two and Days 203, 293, and&#xD;
      478 (3, 6, and 12 months after the third dose) of Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel(R) (10mcg, 30mcg, or&#xD;
      100mcg) with or without AP 10-701, and (3) to assess the duration of the IgG antibody&#xD;
      response to Sm-TSP-2 using an indirect ELISA following receipt of three doses of&#xD;
      Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel(R) (10mcg, 30mcg, or 100mcg) with or without AP 10-701.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all&#xD;
             study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or non-pregnant female aged 18 to 50, inclusive at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Are in good health, as determined by vital signs (oral temperature, pulse, and blood&#xD;
             pressure), medical history, and brief physical examination at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Existing medical diagnoses or conditions (except those in the Subject Exclusion&#xD;
             Criteria) must be deemed as stable chronic medical conditions. A stable chronic&#xD;
             medical condition is defined as no change in prescription medication, dose, or&#xD;
             frequency of medication in the last 3 months (90 days) and health outcomes of the&#xD;
             specific disease are considered to be within acceptable limits in the last 6 months&#xD;
             (180 days). Any change due to change of health care provider, or that is done for&#xD;
             financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered&#xD;
             a violation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to&#xD;
             improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or&#xD;
             appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion&#xD;
             criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed medications if, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no&#xD;
             additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity.&#xD;
             Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception of corticosteroids as&#xD;
             outlined in the Subjects Exclusion Criteria), vitamins, and contraceptives are&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Vital signs (oral temperature, pulse, and blood pressure) are all within normal&#xD;
             protocol-defined ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -The normal protocol-defined ranges for vital signs include (a) oral temperature less&#xD;
             than 38.0 degrees celsius, (b) pulse 50 to 100 bpm, inclusive, (c) systolic blood&#xD;
             pressure 85 to 150 mmHg, inclusive, and (d) diastolic blood pressure 55 to 90 mmHg,&#xD;
             inclusive. Pulse rate &lt;50 is acceptable for 2nd and 3rd vaccinations if the subject is&#xD;
             otherwise healthy with documented sinus bradycardia at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Laboratory tests (alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, white blood cell count,&#xD;
             hemoglobin, and platelets) are all within protocol-defined reference ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -The protocol-defined ranges for laboratory tests include (a) alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
             (ALT) of less than 1.25-times the upper reference limit, (b) creatinine less than 1.25&#xD;
             times the upper reference limit (c) white blood cells (WBC) between 3.3 x10^3/uL and&#xD;
             10.4 x10^3/uL, inclusive, (d) hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL or greater for females or 12.1 g/dL&#xD;
             or greater for males, (e) platelets greater than 130 x10^3/uL. Laboratory test results&#xD;
             for 2nd and 3rd vaccinations may be at Grade 1 if considered unrelated to study&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Urinalysis with no greater than trace protein and negative for glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to practice highly effective&#xD;
             contraception for a minimum of 30 days prior to study product exposure and for 30 days&#xD;
             after last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female subjects who are surgically sterile via tubal sterilization, bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy or hysterectomy or who have been postmenopausal for greater than 1&#xD;
                  year are not considered to be of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Highly effective methods of contraception are defined as having low failure rates&#xD;
                  (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly and may&#xD;
                  include, but are not limited to, abstinence from intercourse with a male partner,&#xD;
                  monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner, male condoms or diaphragm&#xD;
                  with spermicide, intrauterine devices, and licensed hormonal methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to study vaccination.&#xD;
