  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is controversial for soft tissue sarcoma that has not yet metastasized. Surgery&#xD;
      and radiation are effective for local control, but there are no highly effective&#xD;
      interventions to prevent metastatic spread of soft tissue sarcoma. Immunotherapy has shown&#xD;
      promise in other types of cancer. Combining two types of immunotherapy agents with&#xD;
      preoperative radiation may help the immune system recognize the sarcoma and stimulate an&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune response.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purposes of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      Durvalumab and Tremelimumab in combination with radiation prior to surgical resection of&#xD;
      high-risk soft tissue sarcoma in the pelvis and extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive the same radiation therapy and surgical care they would receive&#xD;
      normally and with no change in timing or duration of each treatment. They will also receive&#xD;
      two immunotherapy agents, Durvalumab and Tremelimumab, during radiation prior to surgery, and&#xD;
      a single agent, Durvalumab, after surgery.&#xD;
