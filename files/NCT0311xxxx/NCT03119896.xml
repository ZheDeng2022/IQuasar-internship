      Does the Navigator Tool Intervention improve communication regarding self-management during&#xD;
      consultations between healthcare professionals and people with chronic pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is usually no cure for chronic pain, healthcare professionals are increasingly&#xD;
      turning to methods of treatment that emphasise management of symptoms rather than elimination&#xD;
      of pain. However, as Pain Concern's previous research has shown, there are several barriers&#xD;
      to self-management that both healthcare professionals and people with pain face in their&#xD;
      consultations in primary care. The Navigator Tool Intervention has been designed to overcome&#xD;
      the majority of these barriers through improving the quality of communication regarding&#xD;
      self-management during consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the House of Care Model, where care relies on engaged and informed patients,&#xD;
      healthcare professionals committed to partnership working, and organisational processes that&#xD;
      support this, our intervention prepares both the healthcare professionals and patients for&#xD;
      their consultation. By providing a training session for the healthcare professionals in how&#xD;
      supported self-management can be brought into the consultation room, and by providing the&#xD;
      patients with a paper-based tool that allows them to organise their concerns and questions&#xD;
      prior to the consultation, the intervention aims to steer the conversation toward the aspects&#xD;
      that the patient needs to discuss in order to better manage their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will launch the intervention and evaluate its effectiveness in improving&#xD;
      self-management support through conversation. It will be launched over a 3 month period in 4&#xD;
      sites across Scotland; 24 patients will be using the tool with a trained healthcare&#xD;
      professional and 24 will act as a control group, receiving standard care without the tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires assessing the satisfaction with the consultation(s) and communication, as well&#xD;
      as confidence in managing one's pain, will be analysed and compared between the two groups.&#xD;
      Interviews will be carried out with healthcare professionals and a sample of patients having&#xD;
      used the tool to gain a deeper understanding of the usefulness of the intervention and how it&#xD;
      may be improved in the future.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve 4 primary care sites across Scotland, 4-8 healthcare professionals&#xD;
      (HCPs) who will administer the intervention, and 48 patient participants (1-2 HCPs and 12&#xD;
      patients at each site). Half of the patient participants will act as the control group and&#xD;
      receive no intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 sites within primary care will be recruited through Pain Concern's current network of&#xD;
      healthcare professionals. The sites will consists of general practitioners, physiotherapists&#xD;
      and pharmacists, to ensure that the study reflects the usefulness of the intervention across&#xD;
      primary care. Each site will nominate 1-2 healthcare professionals who will undergo a&#xD;
      training session to learn about supported self-management and how to use the paper-based&#xD;
      Navigator Tool effectively. This training will be developed as a collaboration between Pain&#xD;
      Concern and the Thistle Foundation, an organisation specializing in supporting&#xD;
      self-management for people living with chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each site will identify 12 patients from their practice who will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      the study. With their consent, the patient's contact details will be passed to the researcher&#xD;
      who will contact them over the phone and inform them of what the study entails. Prior to this&#xD;
      phone call, the patients will have received a written information and a consent sheet through&#xD;
      email, post or in person at their practice. The signed consent sheet can be returned the in&#xD;
      same way. Once recruited, the participants will be randomly allocated to either the&#xD;
      intervention group (24 patients) or the control group (24 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once allocated to a group, the participant will be sent a pre-intervention pack. There will&#xD;
      be two versions of this pack, one for the intervention group and one for the control group.&#xD;
      Both packs will contain a Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ), and the pack for the&#xD;
      intervention group will contain a copy of the Navigator Tool. The participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to fill out the questionnaire straight away and return it to the researcher&#xD;
      through email or post.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the active research period (3months), the intervention group will have 2-3&#xD;
      consultations using the tool with a healthcare professional who has undergone the training&#xD;
      session. The control group will receive &quot;standard care&quot;, i.e. they will not have access to&#xD;
      the paper-based tool, and they will be allocated whatever healthcare professional they would&#xD;
      have seen if they had not been in the study. There will be no regulation of how many&#xD;
      consultations these control participants will have during the research period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 3 month active research period, all patient participants be sent a&#xD;
      post-intervention pack. The intervention and control group will be sent identical packs,&#xD;
      consisting of a demographics questionnaire, another PSEQ, and a Consultation Quality Index -2&#xD;
      (CQI-2) (which includes the CARE measure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scores will be compared between the control and active group and indicate the effect&#xD;
      intervention has on our outcome measures. The two most important outcome measures are&#xD;
      improvement in communication (measured by CQI-2) and improvement in confidence of pain&#xD;
      management (PSEQ). Other outcome measures include engagement with the intervention, perceived&#xD;
      participation in decision making, consultations and relational satisfaction and&#xD;
      patient-centeredness, extent to which GP was enabling to the patients and perceived efficacy&#xD;
      for self-management, scores of which will also be derived from the above questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more in-depth follow-up interview will be conducted with all HCPs and a sample of patient&#xD;
      participants (8 patients) spread out over the 4 sites. These interviews will provide a more&#xD;
      specific, nuanced and individual understanding of the patients' and healthcare professionals'&#xD;
      satisfaction with the intervention and quality of consultations. Possible topics include ease&#xD;
      of use, impact on consultation length, effectiveness of communication, required changes to&#xD;
      the intervention, and extent to which the intervention achieved aims. These interviews will&#xD;
      take place 1-2 months after the last consultation with the tool has taken place, last for&#xD;
      around 30-45 minutes, and will be conducted in a venue close to the primary care site the&#xD;
      participant was recruited from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be recorded and the researcher will then transcribe the interviews and&#xD;
      code them using N-vivo. Themes will be elicited and cross-compared between the participants&#xD;
      to establish prevalent experiences, views and attitudes.&#xD;
