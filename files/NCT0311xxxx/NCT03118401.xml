  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As they age, the intestinal elimination function can be altered by external factors. Sleeping&#xD;
      is also a vital need for maintaining health. Sleep time varies with age (from 18h / day for&#xD;
      an infant to 7h30 on average for an adult) and sleep disorders increase with age (INSERM&#xD;
      source). In our study, the night is from 9 pm to 7 am, corresponding to the working hours of&#xD;
      the night shift. Between 42% and 50% of episodes of wakefulness of more than 4 minutes in&#xD;
      EHPAD are due to noise, light or the practice of care related to incontinence. 87% of all&#xD;
      incontinence care practices have been associated with wake-up episodes. A personalized day&#xD;
      care program would allow residents to improve the quality of their sleep by minimizing stools&#xD;
      at night and therefore interventions by caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ritual of stools, can be defined as the set of rules to observe to defecate in good&#xD;
      physiological, physical conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be in a suitable place for intestinal elimination: personal bathroom preferably on the&#xD;
           toilet or on a pierced chair that will perhaps be more secure and comfortable with the&#xD;
           armrests. The position to be taken is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Propose a small bench to put under the feet to raise the knees higher than the hips and&#xD;
           increase the abdominal pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preserve the visual and auditory intimacy of the resident at the time of defecation.&#xD;
           Failure to do so may result in the person repressing his desire to defecate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allow the resident the time needed on the toilets the doorbell at hand and with the&#xD;
           assurance that the caregiver will come back in a short time. Do not press it and do not&#xD;
           forget it, privilege the autonomy and check that there is toilet paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The establishment of the stool ritual is not intended to reduce the amount of stool by day,&#xD;
      but it aims to postpone the nighttime exemption on the day, and does not prevent the stool&#xD;
      emission to other times of the day or night.&#xD;
