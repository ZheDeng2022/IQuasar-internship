  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we are going to compare dimensional accuracy of maxillary complete denture base&#xD;
      fabricated by using rapid prototyping method and conventional method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that both techniques do not significantly differ from each other&#xD;

      The study will be carried out in the department of prosthodontics, Faculty of Oral and Dental&#xD;
      Medicine, Cairo University. Fourteen patients will be selected from the out-patient clinic&#xD;
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the participants will be divided randomly&#xD;
      into two equal groups. The clinical procedures on denture fabrication for both groups will be&#xD;
      carried out by TS. The laboratory steps will be carried out by one well trained dental&#xD;
      technician (MA). The set of dentures will be fabricated according to the conventional method&#xD;
      (Group C) as follow: First appointment: preliminary impression will be obtained by using&#xD;
      irreversible hydrocolloid (alginate, cavex, normal set) in stainless steel stock trays. Trays&#xD;
      will be augmented with warm utility wax strips (cavex) and shaped by tongue movements and&#xD;
      manipulation of labial and buccal tissues. A special tray will be prepared with self-cured&#xD;
      acrylic resin (Acrostone-Egypt) over the study cast poured from preliminary impression.&#xD;
      Second appointment: A secondary impression will be made with putty rubber base as a border&#xD;
      molding material and the final impression will be made with medium rubber base impression&#xD;
      material. The final impressions will be poured with type 4 Hydrocal dental stone (Hydrocal&#xD;
      Dental stone, Moldano, Bayer Leverkusen, and Germany) to obtain the master cast which will be&#xD;
      used for constructing self-cured acrylic resin trial denture bases that will carry a wax&#xD;
      occlusion rim. Third appointment: A face bow record will be made to transfer the relation of&#xD;
      the maxilla to the temporomandibular joint. Maxilla-mandibular relationship will be recorded&#xD;
      using maxillary and mandibular occlusion rims formed over the master cast. Fourth&#xD;
      appointment: Setting of artificial teeth will be performed and trial dentures will be tried&#xD;
      in inside patients' mouth. Fifth appointment: The finished and polished dentures will be&#xD;
      delivered immediately after the necessary adjustments and instructions regarding hygiene and&#xD;
      maintenance. The other set of dentures (Group R) will be fabricated according to the rapid&#xD;
      prototyping Stereo lithography (SLA) method. The detailed procedures are the same as&#xD;
      described for the conventional method (Group C) except for that master casts will be scanned&#xD;
      to fabricate the denture bases. The obtained master casts will be used to attach three&#xD;
      stainless steel pins before fabrication of the denture bases to assess the linear dimensional&#xD;
      changes at the following positions; A: pin at the incisive papilla B: pin at the right second&#xD;
      molar area C: pin at the left second molar area Digital caliper will be used to measure&#xD;
      distance between the points (AB, BC and CA) and each measurement will be repeated five times.&#xD;
      The mean of five readings will be taken as a single reading to decrease the percentage of&#xD;
      error. For Conventional Methods: Self-cured acrylic resin trial denture bases will be&#xD;
      constructed on the obtained master casts, then processing of the final denture bases by&#xD;
      conventional clamping method cured by long curing cycle (74ยบ C for 8 hours) using heat-cured&#xD;
      poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) resin material. The position of the pins will be recorded&#xD;
      into the denture bases so that the linear changes could be measured. For Rapid Prototyping&#xD;
      Method: the master casts will be scanned using DENTAL WINGS eco-scan 3, using laser&#xD;
      technology for scanning, after spraying the stainless steel pins with scanning spray to be&#xD;
      recorded into the denture base. Virtual model will be obtained for fabrication of denture&#xD;
      bases. Denture base will be designed and modified on the virtual model, then it will be&#xD;
      printed using ZENITH-3D Printer using Urethane acrylate oligomer based photo-polymerized&#xD;
      resin. After finishing and polishing of the conventional denture bases and printing of rapid&#xD;
      prototyped denture bases, evaluation of linear dimensional changes will be carried out&#xD;
      through recording five reading for each of the three dimensions and a mean value will be&#xD;
      calculated using digital caliper. This value will be calculated for the master model. The&#xD;
      same procedure will be repeated for the two experimental groups (A&amp;B). The dimensional&#xD;
      changes will be determined based on the difference between the two values for each method and&#xD;
      all records will be tabulated and analysis will be done for the differences between records.&#xD;
