      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examine the feasibility of a dyadic yoga program in 40 Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) patients&#xD;
      undergoing radiotherapy (RT) and their family caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Establish the initial efficacy of the yoga program in patients and their caregivers&#xD;
      regarding quality of life (QOL) outcomes (i.e., fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, and overall QOL) and objective performance outcomes (i.e, sit to stand test and&#xD;
      grip strength).&#xD;

      Caregiver:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age, sex,&#xD;
      and race) will be recorded at your first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your first visit, you and the patient will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. You will&#xD;
      either automatically be assigned to Group 1 if you are in the first 10 couples to join the&#xD;
      study, or you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of dice) to Group 1 or Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This random assignment is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same,&#xD;
      or worse than the other group. You have about an equal chance of being assigned to each&#xD;
      group. However, the assignment is also based on other factors such as age and disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will take part in the partner-based yoga program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you will not take part in the partner-based yoga program but will&#xD;
      complete the same questionnaires as Group 1. After the study has been completed, you and the&#xD;
      patient will be offered the opportunity to take part in the partner-based yoga program. This&#xD;
      will be offered outside the study and will be offered at no cost to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - Yoga Sessions and Alternate Caregiver Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will take part in up to 15 sessions of yoga over the course of the&#xD;
      patient's radiation therapy. Each 45- to 60-minute session will be guided by an instructor&#xD;
      either face-to-face or by videoconferencing (FaceTime). You should attend each session&#xD;
      together as partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you do not have access to a personal handheld device (such as an iPhone or iPad), an iPad&#xD;
      will be assigned to you. You will be asked to complete an iPad agreement form and return the&#xD;
      iPad on the date that is noted in the agreement. If the device breaks, please tell the study&#xD;
      staff right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the yoga sessions, you will be asked to do deep-breathing exercises and perform&#xD;
      different stretching and movement exercises. The movements are designed not to be difficult,&#xD;
      and you will sit on the floor or in a chair while you do them. You can move through the&#xD;
      exercises at your own pace. The instructor will be available to answer any questions you may&#xD;
      have about the practice of yoga.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The yoga sessions may be audio- and video-recorded. This is so the researchers can keep track&#xD;
      of the quality of the sessions. Only the study staff will be able to review this tape. The&#xD;
      audio and video files are digital and will be destroyed after 7 years. If you do not allow&#xD;
      the sessions to be audio- or video-recorded, you cannot take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At your fifth session, you will be given a DVD and instructions for practicing yoga at home.&#xD;
      While the patient is receiving radiation therapy, you will be asked to practice at home 1&#xD;
      time a day either with the patient or alone on the days you do not have a session at the&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each week of radiation therapy, you will also complete a questionnaire on your&#xD;
      feelings about the yoga sessions. You will be asked to list what you liked or disliked, what&#xD;
      you found most and least useful, and how you would rate the instructor. You will also be&#xD;
      asked about how often you practice yoga outside of class and if you think you are benefitting&#xD;
      from the yoga program. It should take about 5 minutes to answer this questionnaire. Your&#xD;
      answers to the questions will not be shared with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are an alternate caregiver, you will complete a quality-of-life questionnaire at your&#xD;
      first yoga session and at the end of the patient's treatment. The questionnaire at the end of&#xD;
      treatment can be completed by mail, over the phone with the study staff, or at a clinic&#xD;
      session. Completing the questionnaire should take less than 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 1 and 2 - Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete about 12 questionnaires before the patient's first radiation treatment) and&#xD;
      again 3 months later. The questionnaires ask about your health, any symptoms you may be&#xD;
      having, your mood, fatigue level, sleeping habits, relationship, health care, work&#xD;
      productivity, and quality of life. It should take about 55 minutes to complete these&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last week of the patient's radiation therapy, you will complete about 8&#xD;
      questionnaires. The questionnaires ask about your health, any symptoms you may be having,&#xD;
      your mood, fatigue level, sleeping habits, relationship, and quality of life. It should take&#xD;
      about 45 minutes to complete these questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over when you have completed the last&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, your medical history and demographic information&#xD;
      (such as your age, sex, and race) will be recorded at your first visit. Additional medical&#xD;
      information will be collected from your medical record, such as current/past nicotine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you sign this consent, your caregiver will be approached to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your first visit, you and your caregiver will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. You will&#xD;
      either automatically be assigned to Group 1 if you are in the first 10 couples to join the&#xD;
      study, or you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of dice) to Group 1 or Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This random assignment is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same,&#xD;
      or worse than the other group. You have about an equal chance of being assigned to each&#xD;

      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will take part in the partner-based yoga program.&#xD;
&#xD;
