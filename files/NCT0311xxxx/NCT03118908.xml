      1. To evaluate effectiveness of combined use of dietary supplements Amberen and Smart B (vs&#xD;
           placebo) by women with a typical (without complications) form of climacteric syndrome,&#xD;
           with mild to moderate vegetative symptoms during perimenopause and menopause in regards&#xD;
           to vasomotor, endocrine-metabolic, and neuro-psychological dysfunctions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate safety of combined use of dietary supplements Amberen and Smart B (vs&#xD;
           placebo) by women with a typical (without complications) form of climacteric syndrome,&#xD;
           with mild to moderate vegetative symptoms during perimenopause and menopause, lasting no&#xD;
           less than 1 year in regards to vasomotor, endocrine-metabolic, and neuro-psychological&#xD;
           dysfunctions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To develop recommendations for combined use of dietary supplements Amberen and Smart B&#xD;
           for women with a typical (without complications) form of climacteric syndrome, with mild&#xD;
           to moderate vegetative symptoms during perimenopause and menopause (menopausal for at&#xD;
