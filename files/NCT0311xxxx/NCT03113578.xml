  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational registry study collecting data on the clinical performance of the&#xD;
      study device (DiLumen™ ) for its intended use. The primary objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      functional outcomes of the DiLumen device in humans. The secondary objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      safety characteristics of the DiLumen device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DiLumen™ Endolumenal Interventional Platform is a non-sterile, single-use, close-fitting&#xD;
      sleeve that fits securely over a standard endoscope to stabilize it in the large intestine,&#xD;
      and facilitates use of the endoscope for optical visualization, diagnosis, and treatment. It&#xD;
      was developed by MINT (Minimally Invasive New Technology) at Weill Cornell. The technology&#xD;
      has been licensed to Lumendi for commercialization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DiLumen Endolumenal Interventional Platform (&quot;DiLumen&quot; or &quot;the device&quot;) is an accessory&#xD;
      to an endoscope. The DiLumen dual balloon accessory is intended for use with any standard&#xD;
      endoscope that has a distal tip outer diameter of 12.5 - 14.3 mm and a working length of 1680&#xD;
      mm or greater. The device is indicated to ensure complete positioning of an endoscope in the&#xD;
      large intestine and assist with optical visualization, diagnosis, and endoscopic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device received 510k clearance on Dec 6, 2016. The device is fully disposable, and&#xD;
      consists of six major components that form its primary mechanical structure: (1) Fore&#xD;
      Balloon; (2) Aft Balloon; (3) Sleeve; (4) Base; (5) Push Rod Mechanism; and (6) Inflation&#xD;
      System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DiLumen utilizes two balloons to position and stabilize the endoscope within a patient's&#xD;
      large intestine. After the device is installed over the endoscope, the endoscope/DiLumen are&#xD;
      navigated to the target zone with the balloons deflated. The first balloon, the Aft balloon,&#xD;
      is attached to the DiLumen sleeve. Once the clinician is at the target site, the Aft Balloon&#xD;
      will be inflated until it contacts the intestinal wall near the proximal end of the&#xD;
      articulating section of an endoscope. The second balloon, the Fore Balloon, is also attached&#xD;
      to the sleeve via two flexible extension Push Rods and is deployed at the distal end of the&#xD;
      endoscope at a variable distance. Once extended and inflated, the Fore Balloon contacts the&#xD;
      patient's intestinal wall, and in combination with the Aft Balloon, creates an isolated&#xD;
      diagnostic or therapeutic zone within a patient's large intestine. Both balloons are inflated&#xD;
      or deflated with ambient air independently using an Inflation Handle with a squeeze bulb. The&#xD;
      balloons assist with accessing and visualization of lesions behind folds and turns in the&#xD;
      intestine, stabilizing the endoscope distal tip and establishing a Therapeutic Zone (TZ).&#xD;
      Required insufflation within the therapeutic zone is minimized compared to typical colorectal&#xD;
      endoscopic procedures, because the balloons enclose only a small portion (approximately 23&#xD;
      cm) of the large intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The balloons and sleeve are designed to permit the usage of any standard endoscopic tool&#xD;
      (such as biopsy forceps, snare, needle, etc.) through the endoscope working channel. The&#xD;
      endoscope flexibility, maneuverability and functionalities (such as visualization, suction,&#xD;
      insufflations, etc.) are unaffected by the presence of the DiLumen.&#xD;
