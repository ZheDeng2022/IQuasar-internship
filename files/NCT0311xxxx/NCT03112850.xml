  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensorineural type of hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit among older adults.&#xD;
      Some of the psychosocial consequences of this condition include difficulty in understanding&#xD;
      speech, depression and social isolation. Studies have shown that older adults with hearing&#xD;
      loss show some age-related cognitive decline. There is no clinically proven method to predict&#xD;
      the onset of this condition, as its occurrence is slow and progressive, affecting both ears&#xD;
      equally. Although hearing aid use and auditory training have been proven as successful&#xD;
      interventions to alleviate sensorineural hearing loss, no research has been designed to look&#xD;
      at the effect of both hearing aid use coupled with auditory training on cognitive performance&#xD;
      in older adults. This study will investigate whether wearing hearing aids will improve the&#xD;
      impact of auditory training on cognition, mood and social interaction for older adults with&#xD;
      sensorineural hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a crossover trial targeting older adults between 50 and 90 years with either mild or&#xD;
      moderate symmetric sensorineural hearing loss. Consented, willing participants will undergo a&#xD;
      six month intensive auditory training program (active control), as a rigorous means of&#xD;
      examining the impact hearing aid use has on a person's cognition, mood and social&#xD;
      interaction. Participants will be assigned in random order to receive hearing aid&#xD;
      (intervention) for either the first three or last three months of the six month auditory&#xD;
      training program. Each participant will be tested at baseline, three and six months on a&#xD;
      battery of computer based cognitive assessments, together with mood, and social engagement&#xD;
      measures. Effectiveness of hearing aids and auditory training will be evaluated using an&#xD;
      online speech perception test (SPT) and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit&#xD;
      (APHAB) Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate whether using a hearing aid coupled with auditory training can&#xD;
      improve a person's cognition and learning abilities, relationships with family and friends,&#xD;
      and quality of life. Results from the study will inform strategies for aural rehabilitation,&#xD;
      hearing aid delivery and future hearing loss intervention trials.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensorineural hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit among older adults. There is no&#xD;
      clinically proven method to predict the onset of this condition, as its occurrence is&#xD;
      generally slow and progressive, affecting both ears equally. Recent studies have documented&#xD;
      that hearing loss in older adults is independently associated with reduced cognitive&#xD;
      functioning, mood and social interaction, and that hearing aid use and auditory training&#xD;
      could improve cognitive abilities, social, emotional, psychological, and physical well-being&#xD;
      of people. Despite the high prevalence of hearing loss in older adults, and the consequences&#xD;
      for health outcomes, people are generally slow to acquire hearing aids, and almost two-thirds&#xD;
      of older adults with hearing impairment do not use hearing aids. The popularity of auditory&#xD;
      training has also declined in recent years and the focus of research has been shifted to only&#xD;
      improving wearable amplification such as hearing aids. No research has been designed to&#xD;
      specifically look at the effect of both hearing aid use coupled with auditory training on&#xD;
      cognitive performance in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to investigate the impact of hearing aid use coupled with&#xD;
      auditory training on mood, social relationships and cognitive functioning in a crossover&#xD;
      intervention trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this study objective is based on the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: In older adults with sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids in combination with&#xD;
      auditory training will be more effective for improving cognition than auditory training on&#xD;
      its own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: In older adults with sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids in combination with&#xD;
      auditory training will be more effective for improving mood and social interaction than&#xD;
      auditory training on its own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crossover design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised crossover trial with a total of 40 participants randomized into two&#xD;
      equal groups (20 each) to carry out separate crossover experiments. All participants will&#xD;
      undergo individualised auditory training for a period of 6 months, and will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to one of the following groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants who will be fitted with hearing aids only for the first 3 months of the&#xD;
           auditory training program - Group A&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants who will be fitted with hearing aids only for the last 3 months of the&#xD;
           auditory training program - Group B Participants will be tested at baseline, and at&#xD;
           three and six months in terms of cognition, mood and social engagement. The primary&#xD;
           outcome measure will be changes in cognitive performance as measured by the Swinburne&#xD;
           University Computerized Assessment Battery (SUCCAB). Secondary outcome measures will&#xD;
           include changes in mood and social engagement scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting of the study This study is set in Victoria, Australia. It will be conducted in&#xD;
      independent living aged care facilities across Melbourne. These residents live in their own&#xD;
      unit or similar accommodation, and are generally capable of caring for themselves in all&#xD;
      aspects of daily living. In addition, elderly participants from the Swinburne University of&#xD;
      Technology's Centre for Human Psychopharmacology (CHP) database who live independently will&#xD;
      be recruited to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent living aged care facilities will be contacted by telephone to explain the study.&#xD;
      If an aged care facility shows interest in the study, researchers will visit the facility to&#xD;
      provide the facility manager with more detailed written and oral information. If the facility&#xD;
      manager consents for their facility to participate in the study, the study will be advertised&#xD;
      at the facility and flyers will be distributed to all the residents inviting them to an&#xD;
      information session. Participants from the Swinburne University of Technology's CHP database&#xD;
      will be contacted by telephone and email to explain the study and participants who express&#xD;
      interest will be invited to attend an information session. At the information session,&#xD;
      researchers will explain the purpose and significance of the study. At the same time, a&#xD;
      pre-selection screening will be conducted to identify participants who are cognitively&#xD;
      healthy, likely to benefit from hearing rehabilitation, and who will be able to participate&#xD;
      in the cognition battery testing (reasonable sight and not colour blind). Selected&#xD;
      participants will be sent a Participant Information and Consent Form package that includes&#xD;
      detailed information on the study procedure, a consent form and a return pre-paid envelope.&#xD;
      Once written consent is received, participants will be invited to complete baseline measures&#xD;
      and to confirm their eligibility before enrolment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline cohort will consist of forty (40) older adults with either a mild or moderate&#xD;
      symmetric sensorineural hearing loss. All participants will be first time hearing aid users,&#xD;
      having never worn hearing aids previously. Participants will be screened for adequate&#xD;
      cognitive functioning using the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Participants must have&#xD;
      a global cognitive impairment as determined by a score greater than 24 on the (MMSE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analyses were conducted to determine the sample size required. Previous research and&#xD;
      the results of the power analysis suggest that a total sample size of 36 is sufficient to&#xD;
      detect a moderate size effect (f=0.25), with power of 80% and a significance level of 5%.&#xD;
      Therefore, a total sample size of 40 participants will be recruited to provide a definitive&#xD;
      test of the hypotheses, while allowing for 10% attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments selected for this study are categorized as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hearing Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Otoscopy and tympanometry: Following otoscopy, all participants will undergo&#xD;
                tympanometry and acoustic reflex testing to assess the status of the middle ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pure tone audiometry in each ear: To understand the degree of hearing impairment,&#xD;
                hearing ability will be measured at threshold frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 kHz in&#xD;
                both ears. An online Speech Perception Test will be used in addition to the&#xD;
                standard audiograms for the purpose of measuring hearing loss and hearing aid&#xD;
                fitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Paper-based Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a paper-based questionnaire which will be structured in the&#xD;
      following sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics: Information on a variety of demographic variables will be collected in&#xD;
           order to describe the characteristics of the study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS): To assess mood, the short version of the GDS will&#xD;
           be used to detect the depressive symptoms in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social Engagement Measure: The Berkman-Syme Social Network Index will be used to measure&#xD;
           participants' social engagement and connections with families, friends, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Questionnaire: The MMSE will be used as a&#xD;
           screening criterion to assess cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Cognitive Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Swinburne University Computerized Assessment Battery (SUCCAB) will be used as a&#xD;
           primary measure to assess cognitive performance. Reliability and validity testing of&#xD;
           this battery has demonstrated that the SUCCAB is sensitive to ageing, and has been shown&#xD;
           to be particularly effective for measuring short-term changes in cognition for the&#xD;
           elderly. The SUCCAB correlates strongly with memory subsets in the Wechsler Adult&#xD;
           Intelligence Scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who will be enrolled into the study will complete these assessments again at&#xD;
      3 months and at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fitting of hearing aids for Group A and Group B participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be fitted with two Blamey Saunders hearing aids known as the LOF for a&#xD;
      period of 3 months. The hearing aids will be fitted according to the manufacturer's protocol,&#xD;
      and explanation of the hearing aid usage, insertion of the aids and batteries along with a&#xD;
      step-by-step guide on how to use the hearing aid will be given. A data logging function in&#xD;
      the hearing aids will be used to assess hours of hearing aid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months (with wearing their hearing aids)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB), a self-assessment&#xD;
      inventory, will be carried out with the assistance of the researcher to assess hearing aid&#xD;
      benefit. Four scales of the APHAB will be assessed namely:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ease of communication (EC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effects of background noise (BN)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effects of reverberation (RV), such as listening to sounds across a large room&#xD;
           Aversiveness (AV), which will look at uncomfortable loudness of background sounds such&#xD;
           as traffic and alarm bells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditory training:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants enrolled into the study will undergo weekly auditory training for a period&#xD;
      of 6 months. Over the 6 month period, each participant will undergo a two 12-week&#xD;
      individualised speech tracking program, called the Continuous Discourse Speech Tracking, with&#xD;
      and without hearing aids. Each test session will last for approximately 15 minutes. The&#xD;
      procedure will be timed and scored in number of words per minute (wpm) transmitted. Tracking&#xD;
      rate will be calculated as the number of words correctly repeated divided by the time&#xD;
      elapsed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working Alliance Inventory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 6 month period after all examinations have been completed, Group A and B&#xD;
      participants will complete a working alliance inventory, in order to evaluate the following:&#xD;
      the quality of participant-researcher relationship, the collaborative nature of agreeing on&#xD;
      tasks and goals of both auditory training and hearing aid compliance, and the outcome&#xD;
      measures from auditory training provided to participants. Some randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      have demonstrated that this evaluation is crucial for engaging, retaining and improving&#xD;
      positive outcomes for study participants, and is vital for relationship-building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline comparison of the two groups in terms of demographics, cognition, mood, social&#xD;
           engagement, hearing loss and hearing satisfaction using appropriate chi-square test,&#xD;
           t-test and non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of the two groups in terms of changes in cognition, mood, social engagement&#xD;
           from baseline to 3 months and 6 months, using a crossover analysis and multi-level&#xD;
           models, allowing for any carry-over effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The analysis of speech perception test results with and without hearing aids as a&#xD;
           measure of the effectiveness of hearing aids and auditory training with and without&#xD;
           hearing aids using multi-level models and again allowing for carry-over effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The speech tracking rates from the two 12-week programs of speech tracking will be&#xD;
           analysed for each participant using a learning model. This analysis will yield learning&#xD;
           and forgetting rates with and without hearing aids. These learning and forgetting rates&#xD;
           are valid measures of cognitive processes that are likely to be affected by the use of&#xD;
           hearing and hearing aids. This data will also be analysed using multi-level models and&#xD;
           again allowing for carry-over effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contingency Plan: For participants who decide to discontinue auditory training because&#xD;
      hearing aids have been beneficial, or decide to drop out entirely in the course of the&#xD;
      auditory training program, they will be retained in the study as a third group, with a&#xD;
      suitable modification to the analysis.&#xD;
