  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is designed to identify the mechanisms that can accelerate loss of&#xD;
      muscle size, strength and physical function in type 2 diabetes and with hospitalization in&#xD;
      older persons. About ⅓ of older Americans have type 2 diabetes, and about ⅓ of the&#xD;
      hospitalizations in the USA involve persons older than 65 year of age. The proposed research&#xD;
      is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to development of the fundamental&#xD;
      knowledge that will improve health and reduce the burdens of disability, because this work&#xD;
      will provide the fundamental evidence to identify new targets for the development of&#xD;
      innovative treatments to slow down muscle loss and disability in our aging society.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a major contributor to frailty and increases the risk of falls, physical&#xD;
      dependence, disability and mortality in older adults. It advances slowly with healthy aging.&#xD;
      However, diseases or other insults and injuries can accelerate sarcopenia and lead to&#xD;
      catastrophic declines in mobility and independence. For example, chronic diseases such as&#xD;
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are associated with accelerated loss of muscle mass and&#xD;
      function in seniors; hospitalization with bed rest inactivity acutely accelerates sarcopenia.&#xD;
      What it is not know is how concurrent diseases, inactivity or other insults and injuries&#xD;
      accelerate sarcopenia in older adults. This knowledge gap hinders the development of&#xD;
      innovative, targeted treatments for this disabling condition. The objective of this research&#xD;
      is to examine the basic mechanisms that underlie accelerated sarcopenia in older adults and&#xD;
      identify potential targets for interventions. The central hypothesis is that a global and&#xD;
      fundamental mechanism of acute or chronic acceleration of sarcopenia is a reduction in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle amino acid transport, which decreases muscle protein anabolism, and can be&#xD;
      reversed by activation of the mammalian/mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1)&#xD;
      signaling with a non-amino acid stimulus, such as exercise. Amino acid transport is an active&#xD;
      process that controls intracellular amino acid availability and the activation of protein&#xD;
      synthesis in skeletal muscle. It is regulated by amino acid concentrations and non-amino acid&#xD;
      stimuli that activate mTORC1 signaling, such as resistance exercise and insulin.The central&#xD;
      hypothesis will be tested with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of T2DM&#xD;
      on the sensitivity of skeletal muscle amino acid transport to dietary amino acids. 2)&#xD;
      Determine the effect of short-term bed rest inactivity on the sensitivity of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      amino acid transport to dietary amino acids. 3) Determine the effect of resistance exercise&#xD;
      on the sensitivity of amino acid transport to dietary amino acids in acute and chronic&#xD;
      accelerated sarcopenia induced by inactivity or T2DM. Amino acid transport and protein&#xD;
      metabolism in muscle will be measured using integrative molecular, imaging and stable isotope&#xD;
      methodologies, identifying specific upstream regulators involved in the anabolic resistance&#xD;
      of accelerated sarcopenia that can be targeted with novel treatments to reduce sarcopenia and&#xD;
      improve independence in older adults.&#xD;
