  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital arrest can occur from multiple etiologies. In patients without an obvious&#xD;
      reason for the sudden-death event, diagnostic evaluation is not clear. This study is to&#xD;
      determine if early imaging with a head-to-pelvis CT scan may improve diagnostic accuracy,&#xD;
      speed of diagnosis and potentially clinical outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Best practices for survivors of out-of-hospital sudden death are underdeveloped and untested.&#xD;
      Early diagnosis in sudden death survivors is challenging due to patient intubation and&#xD;
      obtundation, limited history, and imprecise standard of care testing. Sudden death without an&#xD;
      obvious cause (termed &quot;idiopathic sudden death&quot;) is primarily caused by cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease although a large number of cases result from non-cardiac disease. Improvements in&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) technologies provides a means to identify up to 86% of idiopathic&#xD;
      causes of sudden death, including cardiovascular and coronary artery disease, cerebral&#xD;
      disease, pulmonary embolism and abdominal catastrophe4 as well as secondary injury from&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation. To date, use of early CT scans on consecutive sudden death&#xD;
      survivors has not been reported. The innovation of this pilot trial is to be first to test&#xD;
      whether a comprehensive head-to-pelvis, ECG-gated contrast CT scan (CT-First) can identify&#xD;
      the majority of causes for idiopathic sudden death. The significance of CT-First approach is&#xD;
      potentially reducing diagnostic errors, treatment delays and inappropriate treatments to&#xD;
      potentially improve clinical outcomes in this very high risk population. The expertise of the&#xD;
      medical centers involved, combined with the highly respected Medic One service, provide an&#xD;
      unusual opportunity to test this diagnostic paradigm with cutting edge CT technologies. The&#xD;
      data generated from this study will be used to plan larger randomized trials of early&#xD;
      contrast CT scanning versus invasive coronary angiography in sudden death survivors and may&#xD;
      be extrapolated to other patient populations such as possible acute coronary syndrome or&#xD;
      after trauma.&#xD;
