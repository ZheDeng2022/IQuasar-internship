  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for diagnosis of AML, BPDCN&#xD;
      and high-risk MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SL-401&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Azacitidine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved azacitidine and venetoclax as a&#xD;
      treatment option for AML. However, the combination of these two drugs with SL-401 has not&#xD;
      been FDA approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of SL-401, azacitidine and venetoclax has not been FDA approved for BPDCN.&#xD;
      However, SL-401 has been FDA approved for BPDCN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of SL-401 and azacitidine has not been FDA approved for BPDCN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the study drug SL-401 will be combined with the standard dose of&#xD;
      azacitidine (for MDS patients) or azacitidine/venetoclax (for AML and BPDCN patients). The&#xD;
      goal of this research study is to try and determine the safest, highest dose of study drug,&#xD;
      SL-401, in combination with azacitidine or azacitidine/venetoclax that can be given to&#xD;
      patients with AML, BPDCN or high-risk MDS. SL-401 works by stopping or slowing the growth of&#xD;
      cancer stem cells, which are the undeveloped cells which can develop into cancer cells. The&#xD;
      goals of this research study are to look at if this combination works to help treat your&#xD;
      cancer and if there is any lasting effect of this combination. This study will also look at&#xD;
      how the SL-401, in combination with azacitidine or azacitidine/venetoclax, affects certain&#xD;
      proteins in your blood and bone marrow. SL-401 has been given to patients with AML, and MDS&#xD;
      in the past, but this is the first time it will be given in combination with another drug.&#xD;

    <description>Venetoclax is a BH3-mimetic. Venetoclax blocks the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein, leading to programmed cell death of CLL cells. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in some lymphoid malignancies has sometimes shown to be linked with increased resistance to chemotherapy.</description>
