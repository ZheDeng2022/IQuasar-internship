    <textblock>
      Pain is a common experience in youth and influences youth long after the painful situations&#xD;
      are over. Youth memory of pain after surgery can affect painful experiences in the future.&#xD;
      Negative memories and feelings of pain, like remembering more pain than the actual level of&#xD;
      pain experienced are linked to anxiety for future surgery. Research has found that children's&#xD;
      memories of pain is linked to anxiety, pain-related fear, and confidence. Children's memories&#xD;
      for pain can be altered after a visit to the hospital, but only a couple of studies have look&#xD;
      at this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be one of the first to look at how well a parent-led memory reframing&#xD;
      intervention to reduce youth's negative memories of surgery. We want to look at how a&#xD;
      parent-led memory reframing session on youth's post-surgical pain memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 90 youth who have a chest wall surgery or a spinal fusion surgery at&#xD;
      the Alberta Children's Hospital. They will be recruited at the Alberta Children's Hospital.&#xD;
      There will be pain tests in the form of surveys 1-3 weeks before surgery, pain monitoring in&#xD;
      the hospital for a couple of days, pain monitoring 1-2 weeks after surgery, a clinic visit&#xD;
      2-4 weeks after surgery for a memory reframing session, and pain monitoring 6 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery in the form of a telephone interview.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children's pain memories are a powerful mechanism underlying subsequent pain experiences.&#xD;
      Pain is ubiquitous in childhood. Healthy children who are compliant with medical care undergo&#xD;
      up to 20 painful procedures by the age of 5. Moreover, millions of children undergo surgery&#xD;
      (e.g., tonsillectomies) each year, which is commonly linked to pain and distress. Pain from,&#xD;
      and fear of, medical experiences are neither short lasting or benign. Poorly managed pain can&#xD;
      result in negatively biased pain memories, fears, and for some children, phobias that persist&#xD;
      into adulthood. We have demonstrated that children's pain memories are a more important&#xD;
      predictor of subsequent pain than their initial experience of pain itself. Indeed, children's&#xD;
      pain memories fully mediated the relation between an initial and a subsequent laboratory pain&#xD;
      experience. Our most recent data indicates that children's pain memories 2 months after&#xD;
      surgery predict higher levels of post-surgical pain 4-6 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child and parent factors predict children's pain memory development. Existing research has&#xD;
      implicated a number of factors in the development of negatively biased memories in children.&#xD;
      Child sleep and language abilities have been shown to influence memory development following&#xD;
      stressful and painful events. Children who are more anxious and who experience greater pain&#xD;
      are more likely to develop negatively biased pain memories, which then leads to greater fear&#xD;
      and pain at subsequent pain experiences. Parents and adolescents who think in more&#xD;
      catastrophic ways about child pain prior to surgery tend to develop more negatively biased&#xD;
      pain memories months later. Parent and child anxiety are thought to lead to memory biases&#xD;
      because of the ways in which parents and children talk about pain following painful events.&#xD;
      However, the influence of parent-child language-based interactions on pain memories has not&#xD;
      been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of parents on children's pain memories is greatest in early childhood. To guide&#xD;
      future research on children's pain memory development, I published a conceptual developmental&#xD;
      framework in the journal PAIN11 outlining the cognitive and social factors that are thought&#xD;
      to influence children's pain memory development. Of particular importance is early childhood&#xD;
      (ages 4-7 years) when children are most susceptible to memory biases due to suggestibility&#xD;
      effects. It is also during this time that parents are most influential in shaping children's&#xD;
      cognitions, emotions, and behaviors. Our model posits that the socio-linguistic context (e.g.&#xD;
      parent-child narratives about pain) in which pain memories develop is most important in early&#xD;
      childhood and sets the stage for future pain experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent-child reminiscing influences children's memory development. Although surprisingly&#xD;
      understudied in the field of pediatric pain, parent-child language-based interactions about&#xD;
      past negative events, play a powerful role in how autobiographical memories of those events&#xD;
      are subsequently retrieved and reframed. Parent-child narrative style also influences&#xD;
      children's coping and psychological functioning. Young children whose parents are&#xD;
      topic-extending and elaborative (e.g., who ask open-ended questions to pull for richer, more&#xD;
      detailed accounts of the past) and who use emotional language, have children who are more&#xD;
      accurate and detailed in recalling their pasts, which is adaptive. Similarly, our recent data&#xD;
      provides strong evidence that parents who reminisce with their children about a recent&#xD;
      surgery using a particular style (i.e., more elaborative, less topic-switching) and content&#xD;
      (less content about pain, fear, medical procedures; more explanations) have children who&#xD;
      later remember pain a more accurate/positively biased way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memory reframing interventions lead to children remembering pain in more&#xD;
      accurate/positively-biased ways. To date, there have been three trials of memory reframing&#xD;
      interventions, all of which were administered by a researcher to children undergoing needle&#xD;
      procedures (vaccine injections, dental anesthetic injections, lumbar punctures) within 15&#xD;
      minutes. Our recent systematic review revealed that these interventions were efficacious in&#xD;
      altering children's memories of pain to be more accurate/positively biased. Emphasizing and&#xD;
      rehearsing positive aspects of a pain memory have also been shown to lead to an enhanced&#xD;
      ability of children to forget its negative aspects. However, research has not yet implemented&#xD;
      parent-led memory reframing interventions for children's pain; however, we have argued that&#xD;
      parents are potentially the most powerful and accessible agents of change. Indeed, our recent&#xD;
      data provides strong evidence that the language parents use when reminiscing with children&#xD;
      following tonsillectomies influences children's pain memory biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data from our lab provides compelling evidence that parents who reminisce with their&#xD;
      children about surgery using a particular style (e.g., more elaborative, less&#xD;
      topic-switching) and content (e.g., less content about pain, fear, medical procedures; more&#xD;
      explanations) have children who later remember post-surgical pain a more accurate and&#xD;
      positively biased way. Parental reminiscing style and content have been effectively targeted&#xD;
      in interventions to improve children's memory development, albeit, not yet in the context of&#xD;
      pain.To date, research has not examined if memory reframing techniques implemented by parents&#xD;
      can alter children's recall of post-surgical pain. Thus, the goal of this research is to&#xD;
      conduct a pilot study to examine the preliminary efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of&#xD;
      a brief parent-led memory reframing intervention following pediatric surgery to foster more&#xD;
      adaptive (i.e., less negatively biased) pain memories. The intervention will draw from our&#xD;
      recent data and extant memory reframing and narrative-based intervention techniques to&#xD;
      promote more accurate/positive pain memories by teaching parents more adaptive styles of&#xD;
      reminiscing with their children about a past surgery. We will accomplish our aims by&#xD;
      extending our existing program of research on post-surgical pain memory development of&#xD;
      children (aged 4-7 years) and randomly assigning parents to receive a memory reframing&#xD;
      intervention or attention control following surgery and subsequently assessing children's&#xD;
      memories for pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims and hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.) To examine the preliminary efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a parent-led&#xD;
      memory reframing intervention on children's post-surgical pain memories. Hypothesis 1.)&#xD;
      Children in the intervention group will go on to recall post-surgical pain in a more accurate&#xD;
      or positively biased way as compared to the control group who will remember pain in a more&#xD;
      negatively biased way. The intervention will be judged by parents to be feasible and&#xD;
      acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2.) To examine the influence of baseline individual child and parent characteristics on&#xD;
      children's pain memories. Hypothesis 2.) Children who are more anxious, less&#xD;
      self-efficacious, have worse sleep quality, and whose parents are more anxious and&#xD;
      catastrophize more about child pain prior to surgery will subsequently remember pain in a&#xD;
      more negatively biased way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first to develop and pilot test a brief, parent-led intervention aimed&#xD;
      at changing the way children recall their pain after surgery, thereby extending&#xD;
      memory-reframing techniques to the post-surgical pain context. Given the integral role of&#xD;
      pain memories in shaping future pain experiences and the need for interventions in the&#xD;
      pediatric surgery context, this study has great potential to contribute an accessible and&#xD;
      feasible post-surgical pediatric pain management intervention and foster more adaptive pain&#xD;
      trajectories and medical experiences in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include 90 adolescents scheduled for a pectus repair or spinal fusion,&#xD;
      surgeries associated with high levels of post-surgical pain,2 and their parents. They will be&#xD;
      recruited at the Alberta Children's Hospital (ACH). We will use a recruitment strategy that&#xD;
      is consistent with our studies with clinical samples. Specifically, the recruitment pool will&#xD;
      be generated as follows: 1) clinic staff will identify the patients scheduled for pectus&#xD;
      repair or spinal fusion surgeries; 2) upon booking of the pre-op clinic visit, the admin&#xD;
      staff will obtain permission to contact for research purposes from parents along with contact&#xD;
      details; 3) clinic staff will pass on the contact information to the research study team via&#xD;
      a secure electronic transfer; 4) the study staff will contact eligible families and screen&#xD;
      interested parents and youth for eligibility and address any questions they might have and&#xD;
      then set up a time to conduct a consent conference call with parent and child. This consent&#xD;
      call will involve a discussion with the parent and child who will participate in the study&#xD;
      and a researcher. The researcher will explain the information included in the consent form&#xD;
      and provide the opportunity for potential participants to ask questions and clarify&#xD;
      understanding. At this time, we will also clearly outline our limits to confidentiality&#xD;
      regarding disclosure of abuse, neglect, suicidal ideation and intent, and potential to a&#xD;
      minor. These are described on the consent form; however, the consent conference is an&#xD;
      excellent opportunity to reiterate and clarify these procedures and issues. For this consent&#xD;
      conference, a researcher will email these forms to participants (using REDCap, a secure&#xD;
      online web-based application) who can complete them on a computer device. To increase&#xD;
      participation, we will also distribute the posters (see Recruitment Poster) within ACH, so&#xD;
      that potential participants will have the opportunity to contact us directly to indicate&#xD;
      interest in the study. Screening for eligibility and consent procedures will be as described&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week before surgery, youth will complete measures of pain, sleep (Adolescent Sleep Wake&#xD;
      Scale; ASWS), pain catastrophizing (PCS - Child version), anxiety and depression symptoms&#xD;
      (PROMIS-25), quality of life (PedsQL), PTSD symptoms (CPSS-5), sensitivity to pain&#xD;
      traumatization (SPTS-Child version), self-efficacy about pain, expectancies about pain and&#xD;
      pain-related fear (Numerical Rating Scales; NRS). Parents will complete measures of sleep&#xD;
      (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), pain catastrophizing (PCS-Parent version), measures of&#xD;
      anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms (PROMIS-29 and PCL-5), sensitivity to pain&#xD;
      traumatization (SPTS-Parent version), self-efficacy about pain, parent responses to child&#xD;
      pain (ARCS), expectancies about pain and pain-related fear (NRS), a socio-demographic survey&#xD;
      (parent education, child age, household income), preparation that they/their child received&#xD;
      about the surgery and what this entailed (e.g., coping skills, pain management), and family&#xD;
      history of surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery and every day after the surgery (until discharge), both youth and&#xD;
      parents will report pain characteristics (pain intensity [NRS], pain-related fear [NRS], pain&#xD;
      interference [PROMIS], pain unpleasantness [a Likert scale], pain catastrophizing [state]),&#xD;
      state anxiety (NRS), overall affect (NRS), and sleep quality (NRS). Parents will also&#xD;
      complete a measure of parent responses to child pain (ARCS). Information regarding analgesic&#xD;
      and anesthetic agents administered on the day of surgery will be collected via medical chart&#xD;
      review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 2-weeks post-surgery, parents and youth will complete the baseline assessment measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 4-weeks post-surgery following their clinic visit, parent-child dyads will be randomized&#xD;
      into three groups: an attention control group, a normal reminiscing group, and an&#xD;
      intervention group. Randomization will be conducted by an external statistician using a&#xD;
      computer random number generator. Allocation concealment will be achieved using sequentially&#xD;
      numbered, opaque, and sealed envelopes. Group allocation will be revealed by a researcher at&#xD;
      the outset of the lab visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention Control Group: Parents and youth in the attention control group will watch a&#xD;
      neutral 20-minute video that is not related to surgery (Planet Earth). Importantly, they will&#xD;
      not talk about pain or the past surgery experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal Reminiscing: Parents and youth in the normal reminiscing group will be instructed to&#xD;
      reminisce with their children about the in-hospital and post-surgery periods as they normally&#xD;
      would.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group: Parents and youth in the intervention group will receive instructions&#xD;
      about adaptive ways of reminiscing about the in-hospital and post-surgery periods. The&#xD;
      intervention will draw from existing narrative-based interventions that have taught parents&#xD;
      to reminisce with their children about past negative events in more elaborative and&#xD;
      emotion-rich ways (e.g., using more open-ended questions, to follow in on children's answers&#xD;
      by providing new details about the event, to talk more about emotions, and to praise&#xD;
      children's answers). We will also include elements of past pain memory reframing&#xD;
      interventions and findings from our recent data. Specifically, parents will be taught to&#xD;
      reminisce with their children about the in-hospital and post-surgery periods by providing&#xD;
      more explanations for events, using less utterances about pain, fear, and medical procedures,&#xD;
      emphasizing positive aspects of the child's surgery memory (e.g., when children used coping&#xD;
      methods such as deep breathing, when they got a treat), and enhancing children's&#xD;
      self-efficacy regarding their ability to cope with pain. Researchers will also provide&#xD;
      suggestions for specific questions and remarks to make while reminiscing. Parents, youth, and&#xD;
      researchers will engage in brief role-plays to solidify the techniques, which will be&#xD;
      followed by researcher feedback. After this training period, parents in the intervention&#xD;
      group will be instructed to reminisce with their children about the in-hospital and&#xD;
      post-surgery periods using the intervention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6-weeks post-surgery, youth and parent will complete a telephone pain memory interview to&#xD;
      assess youth's recall of the in-hospital and post-surgery periods.Then, parents in the&#xD;
      intervention group will complete a brief semi-structured telephone interview to assess&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 weeks post-operative (for spinal instrumentation surgeries) - 6 weeks post operative (for pectus chest wall surgeries)</time_frame>
    <description>Youth and parents will complete telephone memory interviews to assess their pain memories. Specifically, youth will be asked to remember the levels of sensory (pain intensity) and affective (unpleasantness, anxiety) pain experienced after the surgery. Parents will be asked to remember the levels of sensory (pain intensity) and affective (unpleasantness, anxiety) pain they think their children experienced after the surgery. At the beginning of the memory interviews, children and parents will be asked to freely recall anything that they can remember about the pain task. Telephone interviews to assess children's memory for pain have been effectively conducted with youth. Positively biased pain memories will be defined as recalled pain level that is less than the initial pain report. Accurate memories reflect no difference between recalled and experienced pain. Free recall will be coded for both content and tone.</description>

    <description>The 10-item short-form of the Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale (ASWS) will be used to assess sleep quality in youth. The ASWS assesses sleep quality along 3 dimensions: Falling asleep and reinitiating sleep, returning to wakefulness, and going to bed. This measure has good reliability and validity in youth with chronic pain. Post-surgical sleep quality will be assessed using an NRS (0 = extremely poor sleep, 10 = extremely good sleep).</description>

    <description>Parent quality of sleep over the last month will be assessed using a well-validated and widely used Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Nineteen items comprise seven &quot;component&quot; scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The component scores are summed to yields the global score. The PSQI is reliable and valid.</description>

    <description>Youth will rate their pain intensity an 11-point NRS (0 - no pain; 10 - worst pain possible). NRSs are a valid and reliable tool to assess pain intensity in youth.35,36 Average pain scores will be computed for each assessment period. The NRS will be included in the memory interviews but framed in terms of recall of pain. Parents will use the same scale to assess their child's pain.</description>

    <description>The 7-item Pain Questionnaire assesses pain frequency, location, duration, intensity, distress, and interference. The pain unpleasantness item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale assessing how much pain bothered the child. Pain interference will be measured using the pain interference subscale of the PROMIS-25 Profile. The subscale's four items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale and assess the extent of everyday impairment due to pain. The scale has excellent psychometric properties and has been used in youth with chronic pain.</description>
