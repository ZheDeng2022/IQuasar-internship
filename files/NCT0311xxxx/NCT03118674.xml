  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the medical literature there case reports that Harvoni improves symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      PCT. However, this has never been systematically tested. Therefore, the purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to assess whether Harvoni alone is an effective therapy of active PCT in patients with&#xD;
      Chronic Hepatitis C.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial, which means its purpose is to study an intervention or treatment.&#xD;
      In this study all patients with PCT will be given a standard dose of Harvoni and monitored&#xD;
      for two years. Currently there are two standard therapies for PCT, phlebotomies (removing&#xD;
      certain amounts of blood at specific intervals), or low dose hydroxychloroquine (an oral&#xD;
      pill). These treatments are used for patients with PCT whether or not they also have HCV. For&#xD;
      patients with HCV however, we do not know whether treating the HCV first will also resolve&#xD;
      the PCT symptoms. There will be an initial visit to determine whether participants are&#xD;
      eligible to be in the study. If a participant is found to be eligible, he/she will be asked&#xD;
      come to the study site once every month over the course of one year, and then once every 3&#xD;
      months for an additional year. There will be approximately 17 visits over the course of the&#xD;
      whole study. At these visits the study doctors will check in with the participant and some&#xD;
      blood and urine samples will be taken. Participants will not be charged for any of the lab&#xD;
      tests that are being done as a part of this study alone. All participants in this study will&#xD;
      receive the Harvoni pills at no cost to them.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Willing and able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ≥18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Symptoms and signs consistent with PCT and well documented biochemical diagnosis&#xD;
             (urinary total porphyrin excretion &gt; 500 mcg/g Creatinine with HPLC pattern typical of&#xD;
             PCT-predominance of 8- and 7-carboxyl porphyrins)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinical diagnosis of PCT established by a study PI&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Chronic hepatitis C: HCV RNA positive and quantifiable in serum detected within 90&#xD;
             days of enrollment, and documented HCV genotypes 1,4, 5, or 6 for which Harvoni is an&#xD;
             approved therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
