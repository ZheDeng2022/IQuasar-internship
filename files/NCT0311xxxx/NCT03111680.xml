      This is a cluster randomized study of an environmental level intervention to improve&#xD;
      nutrition and physical activity, among public housing residents. Followup was one year post&#xD;
      baseline&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Purpose and design The purpose of this study was to test the effects of a environmental-level&#xD;
      package of interventions on public housing residents' obesity and obesity-related behaviors.&#xD;
      The design of the study and its intervention have been previously published . Simply, this&#xD;
      was a cluster randomized trial, with public housing developments (PHDs) serving as the unit&#xD;
      of randomization and analysis. This document describes the patterns of change in the main&#xD;
      behavioral and weight outcomes for adult women before and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Public housing in Boston is administered by the Boston Housing Authority (BHA),&#xD;
      a public agency that provides subsidized housing to low- and moderate-income individuals and&#xD;
      families, disabled individuals, and elderly individuals. There are 64 public housing&#xD;
      developments, 37 are designated as elderly/disabled developments and 27 are designated as&#xD;
      family developments. Approximately 27,000 people are housed under the public housing program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family (vs. elderly) designated PHDs with more than 200 residents which were not undergoing&#xD;
      renovations requiring residents to move out of the development for a period of time in the&#xD;
      City of Boston were eligible to participate in this study (n=24). The investigators recruited&#xD;
      10 developments to participate in the Healthy Families study; 5 serving as intervention PHDs&#xD;
      and 5 serving as control PHDs. PHDs were randomly assigned to either condition, in matched&#xD;
      pairs for size of development and existence of health activities in the development. PHDs&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention group received all intervention components (see Intervention&#xD;
      section below) and developments randomized to the control group did not receive any&#xD;
      intervention components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection In both intervention and control group PHDs, a randomly sampled group of&#xD;
      female residents and their daughters ages 8-16 were recruited into an evaluation cohort to&#xD;
      examine study outcomes. The investigators selected mothers because in the family developments&#xD;
      over 80% of heads of household (per aggregate data compiled from tenant agreements) were&#xD;
      women. The investigators selected daughters aged 8-15 as development of obesity often occurs&#xD;
      during this time period for females. To be eligible for this study, participants were&#xD;
      required to be female, age 18-72, live in one of the recruited PHD, and planning to remain so&#xD;
      for two years, had responsibility for a girl age 8-15 (also living in the public housing&#xD;
      residence), were English or Spanish speaking, and were able to make changes to their diet and&#xD;
      physical activity habits if desired. Exclusion criteria included: the adult was not able to&#xD;
      complete the survey tools or was not interested in participating. All study materials were&#xD;
      available and used in both English and Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey assistants approached randomly selected apartment units within each of the 10 housing&#xD;
      developments. Using a standardized protocol, survey assistants assessed individual's interest&#xD;
      in participating and eligibility. If interested and eligible, the participant provided their&#xD;
      written informed consent to participate, girls aged 12-15 provided written assent, and girls&#xD;
      aged 8-11 gave verbal assent. The survey assistant then administered the baseline survey and&#xD;
      recorded the (adult) participant's responses. After completing the survey, the women and&#xD;
      girl's height and weight were measured and recorded. Project staff returned to re-assess the&#xD;
      original evaluation cohort at one- year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Baseline survey. Dietary intake is difficult and time consuming to measure, and so&#xD;
      in the interest of minimizing participant burden we decided to measure key single behaviors&#xD;
      related to obesity for which there were existing measures. Following evidenced-based&#xD;
      guidelines for health promotion and weight management, we assessed three nutrition behaviors:&#xD;
      fruits and vegetables (&quot;How many servings of fruits and vegetables do you eat each day?&quot; with&#xD;
      12 responses ranging from 0 to 11 or more, which was prefaced with pictures representing&#xD;
      portion sizes); soda (&quot;How often do you drink soft drinks or soda pop (regular or diet)?&quot;&#xD;
      with 6 responses ranging from never to 2 or more times per day); mindless eating (&quot;How often&#xD;
      do you eat food (meals or snacks) while doing another activity, for example, watching TV,&#xD;
      working at a computer, reading, driving, playing video games?&quot; with 5 responses ranging from&#xD;
      never to always). The same measurement difficulties exist for physical activity, and so&#xD;
      investigators used the same strategy to select key single items that have been used before in&#xD;
      research studies and compared well with longer measures. We assessed physical activity in the&#xD;
      form of walking for leisure, transport, or exercise during the past week with the following&#xD;
      question: &quot;During the last 7 days, on how many days did you walk for at least 10 minutes at a&#xD;
      time in your neighborhood?&quot; with responses ranging from no walking for more than 10 minutes&#xD;
      at a time or the option to fill in number of days per week and number of minutes per day.&#xD;
      Number of days/week was multiplied by minutes/day to calculate minutes of walking per week.&#xD;
      To assess walking on a typical day, we then asked: &quot;On a typical day how many minutes do you&#xD;
      walk in your neighborhood?&quot; with the option to fill in minutes per day. Finally, the survey&#xD;
      assistant measured the height and weight of both the mother and daughter using a scale. This&#xD;
      was used to calculate body mass index (BMI, kg/m2). Both body weight and survey variables&#xD;
      were planned to occur annually for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants completed standard questions about socio-demographics (e.g., age,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, highest level of education completed, self-rated health), psychosocial, and&#xD;
      behavioral variables. To assess self-efficacy to eat more healthfully, surveys asked &quot;On a&#xD;
      scale of 0 to 10, how sure are you that you will eat less sugar and fat during the next&#xD;
      year?&quot; with 11 responses ranging from 0 (not sure) to 10 (very sure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The Healthy Families intervention was developed using the conceptual model&#xD;
      depicting the mother-daughter pairs who are at the center of our intervention surrounded by&#xD;
      three main environmental-level categories of influence: community, organizational, and&#xD;
      consumer nutrition and physical activity environments. The main emphasis of the model is on&#xD;
      various environmental influences, with individual-level factors, socio-demographics and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors, influencing eating and physical activity patterns. Healthy Families&#xD;
      contained multiple intervention components: lay health advisors, health screenings, walking&#xD;
      groups, nutrition and cooking demonstrations, healthy purchasing options, and neighborhood&#xD;
      resource maps. Investigators chose these components to comprise our intervention since they&#xD;
      could be implemented within a short period of time, could be sustained by the developments at&#xD;
      the conclusion of our project, and were built on research already conducted by the Partners&#xD;
      in Health and Housing=Prevention Research Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lay Health Advisors. The intervention components were coordinated by residents of public&#xD;
      housing who had completed a 14-week training in community health outreach, a long-standing&#xD;
      program (12+ years) provided by the PHH-PRC. Upon completion, these lay health advisors&#xD;
      complete a six month paid internship in their public housing development, distributing health&#xD;
      information on a variety of topics of concern to residents and helping to link residents to&#xD;
      neighborhood health- and clinical-related resources. From the pool of approximately 100 lay&#xD;
      health advisors, a subset was selected to be trained in obesity-specific knowledge and&#xD;
      procedures to serve in the Healthy Families intervention. They completed an additional 3-day&#xD;
      training covering research processes (e.g., protecting participant privacy), study-specific&#xD;
      protocols, and obesity management (e.g., health implications of obesity, effective approaches&#xD;
      to supporting weight loss) and passed a post-training assessment to demonstrate their&#xD;
      knowledge. Upon completion, these trained residents, called Healthy Living Advocates (HLAs)&#xD;
      (n=5), served to coordinate the Healthy Family activities, described below, in the 5&#xD;
      intervention developments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health screenings. Screening for risk factors for chronic disease is one of the most widely&#xD;
      used strategies to prevent mortality and morbidity for chronic disease in modern&#xD;
      industrialized countries. Identification of risk factors, measured in blood or other body&#xD;
      fluids, or by body function, like blood pressure, offers information about a person's overall&#xD;
      risk for development of chronic diseases, like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Among&#xD;
      public housing residents, we found in previous work that both rates of participation in&#xD;
      screenings and the rates of positive screens for chronic disease was high among residents&#xD;
      when the screenings were held inside the housing developments. Therefore, the study offered&#xD;
      monthly screenings for blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes risk for individuals to learn&#xD;
      about their chronic disease risk and be referred to a program within the Healthy Families&#xD;
      intervention, to their own provider, or given information about how to obtain a provider if&#xD;
      they did not have one. Due to expanded public insurance options, 94-97% of non-elderly adults&#xD;
      in Massachusetts had health insurance at the time of this project, removing this classic&#xD;
      barrier to care. The screenings were 3-4 hours in duration, held in a shared space in the&#xD;
      development, were advertised for 2 weeks prior, and were administered by research study&#xD;
      staff. HLAs attended all screenings to assist with linking residents to the primary care&#xD;
      system as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to healthy food. Increasing access to healthy foods is a key component of improving&#xD;
      the food environment, yet, adding supermarkets or changing the existing store resources&#xD;
      (e.g., adding refrigerated units to accommodate fruits and vegetables) can takes years to&#xD;
      perform and are often expensive. Additional options, such as farmer's markets and urban&#xD;
      gardening, can be limited by their seasonal nature and may have differential patterns of use&#xD;
      in different areas of the U.S. To provide immediate, affordable, and easy access to healthy&#xD;
      choices, we selected providing access in the form of a van (Fresh Truck) that sold fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables to residents of public housing. The van visited each intervention housing&#xD;
      development weekly. HLAs at each development promoted the van's offerings and were present&#xD;
      while the Fresh Truck was parked on-site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking groups. Research suggests that the built environment is a powerful influence on&#xD;
      behaviors. Significant environmental barriers to walking, particularly among multi-cultural&#xD;
      low-income women, have been well-documented and include lack of sense of safety and lack of&#xD;
      places to exercise. Pilot work indicates that walking groups are well-accepted by public&#xD;
      housing residents, with about 20% of residents participating across 4 housing complexes,&#xD;
      reporting self-reported increases in days of walking and social cohesion. Walking groups were&#xD;
      held weekly, with HLAs serving as walk group leaders and promoting the groups in the&#xD;
      developments via flyers and word of mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cooking demonstration. Numerous successful multi-component interventions with the aim of&#xD;
      reducing overweight and obesity have used cooking demonstrations as part of their&#xD;
      programming. These cooking demonstrations offered residents the opportunity to obtain&#xD;
      nutrition education as well as to shape social norms around healthful food practices among&#xD;
      friends/family/neighbors. A common theme of our cooking demonstrations was tailoring recipes&#xD;
      to fit the targeted cultural context. Prior to the Healthy Families project, nearly all&#xD;
      residents and management at targeted developments reported a desire to bring cooking classes&#xD;
      to their neighborhoods as they were thought of as family-friendly activities and positive&#xD;
      social functions in which neighbors could get together and work towards a common goal. The&#xD;
      cooking demonstrations were held four times per development, led by a Registered Dietitian,&#xD;
      and promoted beforehand by the HLAs using flyers and word of mouth, as well as via social&#xD;
      media. The dietitian compiled a number of culturally diverse recipes which included foods&#xD;
      that were available for purchase from the Fresh Food Truck and were SNAP eligible and WIC&#xD;
      approved. At each demonstration, the dietitian prepared two recipes and provided nutrition&#xD;
      education on a number of topics such as whole grains and sodium reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resource maps. Maps listing local health related resources (such as local gyms, walking&#xD;
      parks, and healthy buying and eating establishments) were made available to development&#xD;
      leaders and to all interested participants at health screenings, food van session, walking&#xD;
      groups, and cooking demonstrations.&#xD;
