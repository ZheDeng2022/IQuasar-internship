  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of food on the&#xD;
      catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) activity after repeated doses of opicapone (OPC,&#xD;
      development code BIA 9-1067) in healthy subjects and to characterize the effects of food on&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) and tolerability of OPC after repeated doses.&#xD;

      Single-centre, open-label, single-arm study in 28 healthy subjects. Subjects received a&#xD;
      single-dose of 50 mg OPC once-daily (QD) in the evening for 12 days. On Day 1 (D1), 50 mg OPC&#xD;
      was orally administered in the evening (reference hour for all other administrations) after a&#xD;
      minimum of 6 hours fast. From D2 to D8 subjects were in ambulatory and received 50 mg OPC&#xD;
      once-daily (evening administration after 2 hours fast). On D9, 50 mg OPC was orally&#xD;
      administered in the evening after a minimum of 6 hours fast. On D10, 50 mg OPC was orally&#xD;
      administered in the evening, thirty minutes after the start of a moderate meal (with a&#xD;
      previous 6 hours fast). On D11 and D12 subjects received the last doses of 50 mg OPC (evening&#xD;
      administration after 2 hours fast).&#xD;
