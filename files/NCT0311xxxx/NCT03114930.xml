  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the HAS recommendations of March 2014, the &quot;mother - newborn&quot; couple was discharged&#xD;
      from the maternity home at 4 days after delivery by AVB and 5 days after caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stay in maternity allowed a follow-up of the newborn whose weight gain and the occurrence&#xD;
      of a jaundice; And monitoring of the mother whose milky ascent and psychological feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March 2014, the HAS published new recommendations on maternity leave arrangements for the&#xD;
      &quot;mother - newborn&quot; couple, the organization of postpartum follow - up for the mother and&#xD;
      pediatric follow - up for the newborn. The HAS then defines so-called &quot;optimal&quot; conditions&#xD;
      for so-called &quot;standard&quot; outputs, with 9 criteria to respect respectively for the mother and&#xD;
      the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the mother-to-newborn couple respects these so-called optimal conditions and is eligible&#xD;
      according to the respective criteria, the latter leaves at home after 72 hours and before 96&#xD;
      hours for an AVB and after 96 completed hours and Before 120 hours for caesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As no pediatric discharge was done in the afternoons at the maternity hospital of Amiens, an&#xD;
      arbitrary choice was made to allow a &quot;standard&quot; release to the &quot;mother-newborn&quot; couple only&#xD;
      if the child was born between 00H00 and 11H59 so that his clinical examination of exit is&#xD;
      carried out at 72 hours of the birth as recommended by the recommendations of the HAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These recommendations being recent (2014), no study has studied the impact and consequences&#xD;
      on the triad &quot;father / mother-newborn&quot; of these exits including the occurrence of possible&#xD;
      complications or events: re-hospitalizations again The early termination of breastfeeding,&#xD;
      and whether the follow-up procedures advocated by the HAS are being followed.&#xD;
