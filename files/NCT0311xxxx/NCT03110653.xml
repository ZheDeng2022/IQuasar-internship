    <textblock>
      Modern anesthesia has made a lot of progress, however, postoperative pain remains one of the&#xD;
      major problems associated with patient discomfort, prolonged hospital stay and increased&#xD;
      health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remifentanil is an ultra-short-acting phenylpiperidine opioid analgesic with high lipid&#xD;
      solubility and a rapid onset of effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, opioid use has also been associated with postoperative opioid-induced hyperalgesia&#xD;
      or acute opioid tolerance. An immediate discontinuation of remifentanil has been associated&#xD;
      to increased postoperative pain levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to investigate whether a gradual post-operative withdrawal of remifentanil is&#xD;
      indeed associated with less immediate pain compared to after an abrupt withdrawal in surgical&#xD;
      patients undergoing minor surgery.&#xD;

      Modern anesthesia has made a lot of progress, however, postoperative pain remains one of the&#xD;
      major problems associated with patient discomfort, prolonged hospital stay and increased&#xD;
      health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remifentanil is an ultra-short-acting phenylpiperidine opioid analgesic with high lipid&#xD;
      solubility and a rapid onset of effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is rapidly metabolized by non-specific blood and tissue esterases, which also ensures&#xD;
      rapid recovery. Remifentanil can be given in high doses and is easily titratable. Due to its&#xD;
      rapid elimination, a bridge to post-operative analgesia is a necessity when using this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, opioid use has also been associated with postoperative opioid-induced hyperalgesia&#xD;
      or acute opioid tolerance. An immediate discontinuation of remifentanil after digestive&#xD;
      surgery has been associated to increased postoperative pain levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have been done to investigate this phenomenon. Gradual withdrawal of remifentanil&#xD;
      seems to be associated with less pain in a rodent population. (4) A recent study by Norwegian&#xD;
      colleagues in a human population evaluating two types of pain stimuli seems to confirm this&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers. (5) The investigators would like to investigate whether a gradual&#xD;
      post-operative withdrawal of remifentanil is indeed associated with less immediate pain&#xD;
      compared to after an abrupt withdrawal in surgical patients undergoing minor surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and materials Sample size The primary outcome of the study is to compare the first&#xD;
      post-operative demand of analgesic drugs (mins).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between both groups, we considered a difference of first demand of post-operative analgesia&#xD;
      at 35 minutes or more to be of clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and power of 90% (Standard deviation 27), the study&#xD;
      needs to be conducted on 26 patients, each group consisting of 13 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As data is always lost, the study will be conducted on 30 patients (15 in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done using Mann-Whitney U test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding procedure and data collection The study is 'double' blinded. Patients, the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist and an external observer will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neutral observer will collect data pre-operatively and post-operatively (first 24 hours&#xD;
      post-operation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concretely, the observer will pre-operatively collect an informed consent form of the patient&#xD;
      and, at the same time, asses the patient's state via QoR-40. Both groups will have a&#xD;
      remifentanil infusion upon arrival in the PACU. A nurse, independent to the study, will&#xD;
      prepare the adequate post-operative syringe (remifentanil diluted at 20 µg/ml or NaCl 0.9%)&#xD;
      and will change the syringe according to pre-operative randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, in the PACU, the quantity of morphine used as well as NRS at several times&#xD;
      post-operative will be written down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is at the ward, the observer verifies NRS 24 hours post-operatively and, at&#xD;
      the same time, patient comfort at 24 hours post-operative will be evaluated through QoR-40&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Protocol Premedication: each group receives alprazolam (0.5 mg) one hour&#xD;
      pre-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring In both groups, hemodynamic stability will be evaluated by monitoring ECG, heart&#xD;
      rhythm, pulse oximetry and (noninvasive) blood pressure, BIS levels, NMT (TOF ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case blood pressure drops 20% or more from initial measurement, a bolus of ephedrine will&#xD;
      be given in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total quantity of each drug used will be written down. All drugs are administered&#xD;
      intravenously. Different timings will be written down (induction time, incision time, end of&#xD;
      surgery time, extubation time).&#xD;
