  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI&#xD;
      685509 given alone under fasted conditions (Reference, R) compared to the intake after a high&#xD;
      fat, high caloric breakfast (Test 1, T1), to combined administration with itraconazole under&#xD;
      fasted conditions (Test 2, T2) and to combined administration with rifampin under fasted&#xD;
      conditions (Test 3, T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is the evaluation and comparison of several pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters between the treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BI 685509 is a substrate of the drug transporters P-gp and Organic anion transporting&#xD;
      polypeptide 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1/OATP1B3). Inhibition of these transport proteins may result&#xD;
      in an increased drug exposure which might impact the safety of the patients. Therefore this&#xD;
      trial should investigate whether and to what extent the inhibition of P-gp (mediated by&#xD;
      itraconazole) and the inhibition of OATP1B1/OATP1B3 (mediated by rifampin) affects kinetics&#xD;
      of BI 685509. Itraconazole and rifampin are recommended probe drugs to test in-vivo&#xD;
      inhibition of P-gp and OATP1B1/OATP1B3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore the food effect will be investigated in this study.&#xD;
