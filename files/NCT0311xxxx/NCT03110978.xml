  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without&#xD;
      nivolumab works in treating patients with stage I-IIA non-small cell lung cancer or cancer&#xD;
      that has come back. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a&#xD;
      patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells&#xD;
      with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy and nivolumab may work better at treating non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Event-free survival (EFS), with events defined as local recurrence, regional recurrence,&#xD;
      distant metastasis, secondary malignancy (including lung cancer), and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Overall survival (OS). II. Toxicity related to stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      (stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy [SABR]) and immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Exploratory analyses of potential predictive markers and immunologic mechanisms of&#xD;
      action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY/TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify candidate tumor-associated antigens or genes that elicit cellular and humoral&#xD;
      immune responses in serum samples (with Immunotherapy Platform).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess PDL1 expression in tumor biopsy specimens (with Department of Pathology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Identify potential radiomics features from positron emission tomography (PET)/computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that may predict treatment response&#xD;
      and toxicity (with Department of Radiation Physics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy over 1-2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy over 1-2 weeks. Beginning within&#xD;
      36 hours before or after the first fraction of stereotactic body radiation therapy, patients&#xD;
      also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles with nivolumab&#xD;
      repeat every 4 weeks for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      every 6 months for up to 3 years, then annually thereafter.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by either biopsy or&#xD;
             cytology is required for the primary diagnosis and is recommended for recurrent&#xD;
             disease. The following primary cancer types are eligible: squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma (with or without bronchioloalveolar carcinoma features), large cell&#xD;
             carcinoma (with or without neuroendocrine features), neuroendocrine carcinoma (either&#xD;
             NSCLC with neuroendocrine features or atypical carcinoids, but not small cell lung&#xD;
             carcinoma), bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, or non-small cell carcinoma not&#xD;
             otherwise specified&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage I or selected stage IIa according to the 7th version of the International&#xD;
             Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) system: stage I (T1 or T2a [tumor&#xD;
             size =&lt; 5 cm] N0M0) stage IIa (T2 [tumor size &gt; 5 cm but =&lt; 7 cm] N0M0)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with multiple primary lung tumors (defined below) are eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Synchronous tumors (diagnosed within 6 months [mo]),&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Different histology,&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Same histology,&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Second tumor in different lobed or lung;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metachronous tumors (diagnosed &gt; 6 mo apart),&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Different histology,&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Same histology,&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Second tumor in different lobe or lung,&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Tumor-free interval of at least 4 years (y)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with multiple primary lung tumors who will receive multiple courses of&#xD;
             stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) (50Gy in 4Fx or 70Gy in 10Fx) are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with isolated lung parenchymal recurrent/persistent NSCLC (histology as&#xD;
             defined in eligibility criterion 1) after prior definitive surgery or&#xD;
             radiotherapy/chemotherapy, when the lesion or lesions are suitable for SABR, are also&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a single metastatic focus in the lung parenchyma with no other&#xD;
                  lesions are also eligible, because this presentation is challenging to&#xD;
                  distinguish from recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recurrent disease can be in the same lobe or a different lobe but should not&#xD;
                  invade critical structures (esophagus, brachial plexus, major vessels, heart,&#xD;
                  spinal cord); should not involve any lymph node; and should not include any other&#xD;
                  suspicious lesions in the lung or any other locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any prior therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic) must have been completed&#xD;
                  at least 12 weeks before administration of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tumors should be =&lt; 7 cm (measured by CT imaging in the lung window setting) with&#xD;
                  N0M0; PET) imaging is required for restaging (per eligibility criterion) and any&#xD;
                  lymph node suspected of harboring tumor should be confirmed by biopsy (per&#xD;
                  eligibility criterion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both Chest CT and PET/CT are required within 16 weeks and at least one of them needs&#xD;
             to be done within 12 weeks (plus/minus 1 week). Any lymph node suspected of harboring&#xD;
             disease based on its shape, size, or PET standardized uptake value (SUV) should be&#xD;
             discussed by treating physician and diagnostic radiologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with medically inoperable stage I disease (T1 or T2a [tumor size =&lt; 5 cm]&#xD;
             N0M0) or selected stage IIa disease (T2 [tumor size &gt; 5 cm but =&lt; 7 cm] N0M0) who have&#xD;
             poor lung function or other significant cardiovascular or other comorbidity such as&#xD;
             diabetes are eligible. Patients with operable disease who choose to have SABR are also&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The standard justification for medical inoperability is based on pulmonary&#xD;
                  function and can include any of the following: baseline forced expiratory volume&#xD;
                  in 1 second (FEV1) &lt; 50% of predicted value; diffusion capacity &lt; 50% of&#xD;
                  predicted value; baseline hypoxemia or hypercapnia; exercise oxygen consumption &lt;&#xD;
                  50% of predicted value; severe pulmonary hypertension; severe cerebral, cardiac,&#xD;
                  or peripheral vascular disease; and severe chronic heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status score of 0-2 (2 is included here&#xD;
             because such patients are typically &gt; 70 years old and cannot tolerate surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following mandatory staging studies must be done within 12 weeks before study&#xD;
             registration:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chest CT or PET/CT scans of both lungs, the mediastinum, adrenal glands and rest&#xD;
                  of the body; primary tumor dimension will be measured on diagnostic CT and again&#xD;
                  on simulation CT using the lung window setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mediastinoscopy or endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mediastinal&#xD;
                  lymph nodes is recommended and required for any patients with PET/CT or CT&#xD;
                  findings suggesting lymph node involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scan if symptoms or signs suggest&#xD;
                  brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Invasive mediastinal staging: For all patients with CT or PET evidence of hilar&#xD;
                  involvement (level 10) or with mediastinal lymph nodes &gt; 1.0 cm in the shortest&#xD;
                  diameter or clinically suspicious by treating physician and/or radiologist,&#xD;
                  disease must be staged by cervical mediastinoscopy, esophageal endoscopic&#xD;
                  ultrasound-guided biopsy, or endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with left-sided tumors and enlarged nodes (&gt; 1.0 cm in the shortest&#xD;
             diameter) on the aortopulmonary window setting, the aortopulmonary nodes must be&#xD;
             biopsied by extended mediastinoscopy, Chamberlain procedure, video-assisted&#xD;
             thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach, or ultrasound-guided biopsy to ensure that the&#xD;
             patient does not have N2 disease. At the time of cervical mediastinoscopy, esophageal&#xD;
             endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy, or endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy, the&#xD;
             following nodal stations must be examined and biopsied, if present:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ipsilateral nodal station 4&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Contralateral nodal station level 4, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subcarinal nodes (level 7) For left-sided tumors, any lymph node in the superior&#xD;
                  or anterior mediastinum &gt; 1.0 cm in the shortest axis on CT or positive on PET&#xD;
                  must be identified and biopsied. Eligibility requires that any PET-positive&#xD;
                  mediastinal or distant sites must be biopsy-negative. However, if the treating&#xD;
                  physician and diagnostic radiologist strongly suspect PET positivity, the patient&#xD;
                  should not be enrolled even if the biopsy is negative (to exclude patients with&#xD;
                  false-negative biopsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must sign a study-specific consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients (men &amp; women) of childbearing potential should use a method of birth&#xD;

                  negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent&#xD;
                  units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours before the start of&#xD;
                  nivolumab; and must not be breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Men who are sexually active with women of childbearing potential must use a&#xD;
                  contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year; men receiving&#xD;
                  nivolumab will be instructed to use contraception for 7 months after the last&#xD;
                  dose of nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e. are postmenopausal or&#xD;
                  surgically sterile) &amp; azoospermic men do not require contraception&#xD;
