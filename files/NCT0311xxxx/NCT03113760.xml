  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 study to assess the safety and efficacy of Tadekinig alfa in patients with&#xD;
      monogenic, interleukin-18 (IL 18) driven autoinflammation due to Nucleotide-binding&#xD;
      oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and caspase recruiting domain (CARD domain)&#xD;
      containing 4 (NLRC4) - Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) mutation (NLRC4-MAS mutation) or&#xD;
      X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency. Because of the likelihood for pathogenic&#xD;
      IL-18 in certain monogenic diseases, patients known to harbor deleterious mutations in&#xD;
      NLRC4-MAS or XIAP and who have a history of ongoing inflammation will be enrolled if they&#xD;
      have ferritin ≥ 500 ng/mL or persistent C reactive protein (CRP) elevation ≥ 2 times the&#xD;
      upper limit of normal (ULN) and the patients should have a Modified Autoinflammatory Disease&#xD;
      Activity Index (mAIDAI) ≥ 4.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed with single-arm, open-label phase (SAOL) of Tadekinig alfa treatment&#xD;
      duration for 18-week followed by an 8-week Randomized Withdrawal (RW) period for efficacy and&#xD;
      safety evaluation, with no interruption between the two phases of treatment. The screening&#xD;
      period will occur before the SAOL phase and before the first dose of Investigational&#xD;
      Medicinal Product (IMP)&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Initial phase of 18 weeks is a single arm, open-label (SAOL) period where Tadekinig alfa is administered in addition to the standard of care treatment used for the control of flares. The SAOL period will be followed by an 8-week randomized withdrawal phase (RW). All patients who completed the study without an ongoing flare at the end of the SAOL phase will be enrollled in the RW phase. In the RW phase patients will be randomized to either Tadekinig alfa or placebo.</intervention_model_description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with genetic diagnosis of NLRC4-MAS mutation or XIAP deficiency (caused by&#xD;
             BIRC4 gene mutation) as confirmed by analysis performed at the central genetics&#xD;
             laboratory. If possible, flow cytometry assay will be performed in parallel to confirm&#xD;
             diagnosis of XIAP deficiency. (Note: Previous flow cytometry assay results will be&#xD;
             permitted for confirmation of XIAP deficiency diagnosis.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with XIAP deficiency and a previous bone marrow transplantation are allowed,&#xD;
             if they show evidence of primary or secondary graft failure, or failure to achieve&#xD;
             phenotypic correction with evidence of XIAP-related disease recurrence or clinically&#xD;
             significant mixed chimerism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ferritin ≥ 500 ng/mL or persistent elevation of CRP ≥ 2x ULN and mAIDAI ≥4&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients receiving stable doses of corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
             drugs (NSAIDs) or disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and/or IL-1&#xD;
             blockade for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment are allowed into the study. Patients&#xD;
             not receiving any of these treatments before start of therapy are also allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women of childbearing potential with negative urine pregnancy test (UPT) at all visits&#xD;
             (if UPT is positive, a blood test for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to be&#xD;
             performed) and who agree to follow highly effective birth control recommendations&#xD;
             during the study and until 1 month after the end of the treatment. Birth control&#xD;
             methods considered highly effective are: combined (estrogen and progestogen&#xD;
             containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation,&#xD;
             progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation,&#xD;
             intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral&#xD;
             tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner or sexual abstinence. In each case of delayed&#xD;
             menstrual period (over one month between menstruations, confirmation of absence of&#xD;
             pregnancy is strongly recommended. This recommendation also applies to women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycles. A post-study&#xD;
             contraception duration of 4 weeks is recommended taking into account the median&#xD;
             half-life of Tadekinig alfa of almost 40h and 5 half-lives representing a duration of&#xD;
             200 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with life-threatening co-morbidities not associated with the underlying&#xD;
             NLRC4-mutation or XIAP deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Positive test for or prior history of HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C (serology)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of active infections or a history of pulmonary TB infection with or without&#xD;
             documented adequate therapy&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Oncologic causes of symptoms; current or previous history of malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;

             increased intracranial pressure, chronic papilledema, loss of vision, other&#xD;
             sensorineural deficiencies, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients suffering from biallelic mutations in any of the following genes:&#xD;
             PRF1/Perforin, UNC13D/Munc 13-4, STX11/Syntaxin11, STXB2/Munc 18-2, RAB27A/Rab27a&#xD;
             (Griscelli syndrome type 2), LYST (Chediak-Higashi syndrome), AP3B1, ADTB3A, HPS2&#xD;
             mutations (Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 2) and X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome&#xD;
             (XLP)-1 with SH2D1A mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who are pregnant or nursing, women of childbearing potential who are&#xD;
             unwilling to use highly effective birth control methods (see definition in Inclusion&#xD;
             Criteria above) through 4 weeks after the end of their participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Concomitant use of immunosuppression therapies excluded by the protocol. Note: NSAIDs,&#xD;
             glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab,&#xD;
             or rilonacept, or others) are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients and/or parents (or legal representative, if applicable) not willing to sign&#xD;
             assent/informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or one of the excipients of the&#xD;
             investigational product&#xD;
