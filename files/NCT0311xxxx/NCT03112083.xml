  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to systematically collect data on safety and tolerability of krill&#xD;
      powder in humans and simultaneously gain efficacy data by measuring the risk factors for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled intervention study with&#xD;
      slightly obese subjects with mildly or moderately elevated blood pressure. Study was&#xD;
      conducted at two study sites in Central (Tampere) and Northern Finland (Oulu). In total 35&#xD;
      subjects were randomised according to randomisation list to two groups (krill powder or&#xD;
      placebo) in a balanced manner (1:1), separately for both gender and site. Concealed&#xD;
      allocation was used to keep both subjects and staff blinded. The study consisted of a&#xD;
      pre-screening, Day -7-(-14) screening visit, Day 0 baseline (Randomization visit) and 8-week&#xD;
      safety and tolerance follow-up period with three follow-up visits on Day 14, Day 28 and Day&#xD;
      56.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a primary endpoint of the study, the total number of reported adverse events were compared&#xD;
      in the study subject groups taking 8 capsules (4 g) krill oil powder or 8 capsules (4 g) of&#xD;
      placebo for the 8-week follow-up period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Krill powder is a food supplement rich in active ingredients such as fatty acids,&#xD;
      phospholipids, protein and antioxidants like astaxanthin. It is considered to be more&#xD;
      effective in lowering triglyceride values than fish oils and it may have positive effect on&#xD;
      cholesterol values as well. Krill proteins may have positive effect on blood pressure and&#xD;
      astaxanthin has anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, krill powder has a lot&#xD;
      of potential in improving lipid values and having other positive health effects on&#xD;
      cardiovascular system. However, there haven't been many clinical studies done with krill&#xD;
      powder and thus systematic data on human safety is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to systematically collect data on safety and tolerability of krill&#xD;
      powder in humans and simultaneously gain efficacy data by measuring the risk factors for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled intervention study with&#xD;
      slightly obese subjects with mildly or moderately elevated blood pressure. Study was&#xD;
      conducted at two study sites in Central (Tampere) and Northern Finland (Oulu). In total 35&#xD;
      subjects were randomised according to randomisation list to two groups (krill powder or&#xD;
      placebo) in a balanced manner (1:1), separately for both gender and site. Concealed&#xD;
      allocation was used to keep both subjects and staff blinded. The study consisted of a&#xD;
      pre-screening, Day -7-(-14) screening visit, Day 0 baseline (Randomization visit) and 8-week&#xD;
      safety and tolerance follow-up period with three follow-up visits on Day 14, Day 28 and Day&#xD;
      56.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 6 study visits were included. At pre-screening visit the study subjects were&#xD;
      requested to sign pre-screening visit informed consent form. A structured interview on&#xD;
      demographics (age, sex, ethnicity), previous and current diseases, current medication,&#xD;
      alcohol and tobacco consumption and use of dietary supplements (especially fish oil and other&#xD;
      n-3 fatty acid (FA) supplements, plant sterols and cholesterol lowering fiber supplements&#xD;
      (guar gum, glucomannan, oat fiber etc.) and use of fish foods was carried out at the&#xD;
      screening visit and replicated at the day 56 visit. Study included one test product: krill&#xD;
      powder derived from antarctic krill (Euphausia Superba) (Rimfrost PristineÂ®, Rimfrost AS, PO&#xD;
      box 234, 6099 Fosnavaag, Norway) and placebo product and both were given in capsule form, 4&#xD;
      capsules in the morning and 4 in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional counselling regarding the consumption of fish, omega-3 and -6 fatty acids, food&#xD;
      supplements and investigational product for the duration of the study were given for the&#xD;
      study subjects at the screening visit by a study nurse or registered dietitian and compliance&#xD;
      was followed throughout the study. The subjects were advised to keep their medication,&#xD;
      lifestyle, background diet and body weight constant during the study and deviation were&#xD;
      recorded into the diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a primary endpoint of the study, the total number of reported adverse events were compared&#xD;
      in the study subject groups taking 8 capsules (4 g) krill oil powder or 8 capsules (4 g) of&#xD;
      placebo for the 8-week follow-up period. Any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom or&#xD;
      medical complaint and worsening of a pre-existing condition was regarded as adverse event&#xD;
      (AE). Study subjects kept diary for the whole duration of the study and were requested to&#xD;
      write down all unfavourable symptoms and medical complaints not existing at baseline or&#xD;
      significantly worsened from baseline situation. Completeness of diaries was checked at each&#xD;
      study visit. All reported adverse events were recorded, coded and analysed carefully to&#xD;
      determine severity, possible relation to study products, onset and outcome of the event. In&#xD;
      addition, safety laboratory values, cholesterol and triglyceride values and blood pressure&#xD;
      was measured.&#xD;
