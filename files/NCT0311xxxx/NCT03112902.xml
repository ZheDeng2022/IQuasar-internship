  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of slow wave sleep (SWS) is common in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, and is thought to worsen thinking, memory and brain degeneration. Initial studies&#xD;
      suggest that correction of sleep deterioration may slow the progression of brain damage in&#xD;
      mild cognitive impairment, and might be able to stop the development of Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
      Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) uses electrodes to deliver very small&#xD;
      amounts of electricity through the brain, with direct effects on brain cell function.&#xD;
      Transcranial electric stimulation has been demonstrated to enhance slow wave sleep and to&#xD;
      improve memory when applied during sleep in healthy adults. The purpose of this research is&#xD;
      to investigate tACS to modulate sleep, thinking/memory, mood, and quality of life among&#xD;
      normal healthy adults, older adults, as well as individuals with MCI.&#xD;

    <limitations_and_caveats>During this trial we made compelling discoveries into the nature of slow wave sleep that undermined the rationale and data analysis plan for this trial. Problems and new insights related to the study's design were encountered during data collection that fundamentally affected the rationale and feasibility of the trial. Trial was terminated before sufficient data could be collected and analyzed.</limitations_and_caveats>
