      Background Diabetic eye disease is the most frequent complication among the 320,000 Danes&#xD;
      with diabetes. The formation of new vessels (PDR) in the inner part of the eye (retina) is a&#xD;
      feared complication and a leading cause of blindness, since these vessels are fragile and&#xD;
      often cause bleeding within the eye. Peripheral retinal laser treatment (PRP) halves the risk&#xD;
      of blindness, but often comes with a high prize. The peripheral part of the retina is&#xD;
      responsible for the visual field and the night vision, and PRP limits these abilities (i.e.&#xD;
      loss of driving license).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of PRP has principally been the same for the past 40 years with standard&#xD;
      treatment given for all patients. With this one size fits all approach, a substantial number&#xD;
      of patients will either be treated too much or too little. Too little treatment is&#xD;
      inefficient, and disease progression may occur. Excessive treatment may cause side effects&#xD;
      like loss of visual fields and decreased night vision. Therefore, it is important to test if&#xD;
      treatment can be applied on an individual basis to give high efficacy treatment with minimal&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPETUS 2018 - TREAT is the second of two studies aimed at making an individual design for&#xD;
      retinal laser treatment. In IMPETUS 2018 - DETECT the investigators demonstrated that&#xD;
      non-invasive examinations of the oxygen level and measurements of the retinal vascular tree&#xD;
      provide important information of individual treatment response. For instance, if standard PRP&#xD;
      led to three per cent higher retinal oxygen saturation, there was a 4-fold risk of disease&#xD;
      progression despite treatment. Hence, such a patient would benefit from more treatment to&#xD;
      avoid blindness. With these observations at hand, the investigators want to compare a less&#xD;
      invasive treatment (individualized laser treatment) against the standard PRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another essential aspect in the treatment of PDR is to be able to give the right diagnosis&#xD;
      and to evaluate the efficacy of laser treatment. So far, this has been performed by&#xD;
      fluorescein angiography. However, this examination are highly person-dependent and unpleasant&#xD;
      to patients, and a more objective approach is needed. Optical coherent tomography angiography&#xD;
      (OCT-A) is a quick, noninvasive scanning of the retina which is ideal to visualize moving&#xD;
      objects like blood within the retinal vessels. The method has been successfully implemented&#xD;
      in a number of retinal diseases, but it has never been validated in PDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard PRP is often performed in 3-4 sessions. However, it may be painful, and patients&#xD;
      sometimes choose not to complete all sessions after the initial treatment has been given.&#xD;
      There is insufficient knowledge of the patient-barriers to treatment, and it is important to&#xD;
      address these in an individualized treatment design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim In this 6-month 1:1 randomized, prospective study the investigators want to investigate&#xD;
      1) whether individualized retinal laser treatment compared with standard PRP has the same&#xD;
      efficacy but less side effects, 2) whether OCT-A can be used as an objective marker for&#xD;
      disease activity, and 3) to obtain a better understanding of patient-reported barriers to&#xD;
      standard laser treatment PRP and whether these can be addressed with personalized retinal&#xD;
      laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setup Fifty eight consecutively recruited patients (1 May 2017 - 30 April 2018) with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed PDR referred to the Department of Ophthalmology, OUH, and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      standard PRP (n=29) or individualized laser treatment (n=29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Standard laser treatment is performed in all four quadrants of the retina.&#xD;
      Individualized laser treatment is only performed in the part(s) of the retina with&#xD;
      proliferation(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatments are carried out at baseline (BL), and additional treatment is given at month&#xD;
      three (M3) and/or (M6), if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations Retinal digital images, fluorescein angiography, OCT-A (BL, M3, M6). Test of&#xD;
      visual fields, dark adaptation and quality of life (BL, M6). Semi-structured interview will&#xD;
      be performed with five patients who have received PRP in one eye and individualized laser&#xD;
      treatment in the other eye. This will address treatment experience, potential barriers to&#xD;
      treatment, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What to measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in need for retreatment, night blindness, visual fields, visual acuity, bleeding&#xD;
      in the eye, surgery, and quality of life between the groups.&#xD;

      Introduction Diabetes mellitus is an epidemic disorder, which in Denmark alone is affecting&#xD;
      320,000 patients. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent long term complication to&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (1) and a feared cause of severe vision loss and blindness (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the major cause of severe visual loss. Lack of&#xD;
      oxygen to the retina (retinal ischemia) results in up-regulation of, in particular, the&#xD;
      growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (3) followed by compensatory retinal&#xD;
      proliferations. The neovasculature is fragile and often leads to vitreous hemorrhages or&#xD;
      retinal detachment which makes the patient at high risk of irreversible vision loss (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1976 it was shown that patients with severe PDR can halve the risk of severe vision loss&#xD;
      by peripheral retinal laser treatment (photocoagulation panretinal, PRP) (5). This treatment&#xD;
      reduces the retina's oxygen demand, which makes the VEGF concentration decrease and the&#xD;
      proliferations shrink (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRP has largely been the same for the last 40 years. The standard treatment is basically the&#xD;
      same for all patients (4 + 6), which leads to some patients being either over or under&#xD;
      treated. If treatment is inadequate, patients are in risk of disease progression and thus&#xD;
      difficult vision loss (7). On the other hand, the treatment may cause side effects in the&#xD;
      form of loss of visual field (8-9), night vision loss (10) and accumulation of fluid in the&#xD;
      eye's macula (diabetic macular edema) (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a continuum of the clinical project IMPETUS 2018 - DETECT, which aimed to&#xD;
      identify the factors that were important for a successful PRP treatment of PDR. In the study&#xD;
      the investigators prospectively followed 65 patients with newly diagnosed PDR. All patients&#xD;
      received baseline navigated PRP, as in Scandinavia only offered at Odense University Hospital&#xD;
      (OUH). Navigated panretinal laser with a NavilasÂ® laser ensures optimized treatment (12),&#xD;
      shorter treatment (13) and increased patient comfort (12-14). Treatment effect was&#xD;
      investigated at month three and six, and if necessary, treatment was supplied. All the&#xD;
      patients venous retinal oxygen saturation was measured to study whether this had any&#xD;
      therapeutic value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators observed that the retinal oxygen saturation was a strong predictor of&#xD;
      treatment response. Compared to patients whose disease was slowed down after treatment,&#xD;
      patients with progression three months after PRP had an increase in the venous retinal oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (+ 4.1% vs. -1.8%, p = 0.02). Patients with an increase of at least 3.0% in venous&#xD;
      retinal oxygen saturation had 4.0 times greater risk of disease progression than patients who&#xD;
      were below this threshold (15). This observation is in line with another Danish study, which&#xD;
      demonstrated that worsening of DR causes increased venous retinal oxygen saturation (16). By&#xD;
      measuring if this increase in venous retinal oxygen saturation has slowed down, one can&#xD;
      assess whether PRP treatment is sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDR is traditionally perceived as an ischemic disease, which initially affects the entire&#xD;
      retina. In our above mentioned study the investigators were able to confirm the results&#xD;
      regarding the venous retinal oxygen saturation in the affected segment of the retina, in 24&#xD;
      of the patients in the study, who had only one peripheral proliferation. In these patients&#xD;
      the oxygen saturation was increased with disease progression (+ 3.9% vs. -1.5%, p = 0.04).&#xD;
      This indicates that the focal hypoxia are more important than previously thought, and thus&#xD;
      the local treatment of the diseased area may be a treatment option that reduces the&#xD;
      processing volume, thereby minimizing potential side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal proliferations are fragile and often leak contrast fluid. When initiating the study,&#xD;
      the investigators expected the leakage of fluorescein over time would be the optimal method&#xD;
      to assess disease activity, but had to realize that this method was difficult to objectify&#xD;
      (17). As an alternative to this objective evaluation, it is possible to observe the&#xD;
      structural conditions at the interface between the retina and vitreous body (18), but&#xD;
      technological limitations have so far prevented the possibility of repeated evaluations of&#xD;
      the same lesion over time. Optical coherency tomography (OCT)-angiography is, however, a new&#xD;
      method that can visualize retinal structures and potential development of these in detail&#xD;
      (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose In a six-month randomized, prospective study of patients with newly diagnosed PDR the&#xD;
      investigators want to investigate 1) whether individualized PRP compared with standard PRP&#xD;
      has the same efficacy but less side effects and 2) whether OCT angiography can be used as a&#xD;
      marker for disease activity in PDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators expect that 1) individualized PDR provides the same effect but&#xD;
      fewer side effects and better quality of life than traditional PDR, and 2) OCT angiography&#xD;
      has better sensitivity and specificity than wide field fluorescein angiography (FA) for the&#xD;
      evaluation of disease activity by PDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
