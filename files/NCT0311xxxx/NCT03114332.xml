      A randomized controlled trial that aimed at studying the values (if any) of subcutaneous&#xD;
      drains use in lean women during Cesarean section.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean section (CS) is one of the most common operative procedures performed in modern&#xD;
      obstetrics. Despite being that, common, surgical techniques and steps do widely vary. These&#xD;
      variations depend on many factors including surgeons preferences, patient s characteristics&#xD;
      and available facilities and circumstances .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common complications of Cesarean section are superficial surgical site complications&#xD;
      including sepsis, seroma formation and breakdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the common, yet debatable, practices in Cesarean section is to use a subcutaneous&#xD;
      drain for the wound .The advantage of such a practice is to drain any blood or serous fluid&#xD;
      that may accumulate in the subcutaneous space, which cause post-operative pain or provide a&#xD;
      good medium for microbial growth and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it is assumed that drains can reduce the burden of surgical site infection. Some&#xD;
      surgeons, however, have raised much argument about the value of subcutaneous drains and&#xD;
      emerging evidence raised concerns about its effectiveness. Despite this, it is evident that&#xD;
      it is still widely used in the clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most randomized controlled trials on this issue, from which we draw the current evidence,&#xD;
      were conducted in the developed countries, mainly the United States, with readily available&#xD;
      facilities and optimum level of care. This fact raises concerns about how this evidence can&#xD;
      be applicable in developing countries with weak health care systems and low level of&#xD;
      awareness. In addition, Cesarean section rates are greatly higher in developing countries due&#xD;
      to its abuse, which emphasize how the current evidence can't be applicable and in need for&#xD;
      further updates .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current gap between the current practice and lack of evidence has to be filled. In this&#xD;
      study, investigators aim at providing answers for this critical issue, thus investigators can&#xD;
      ensure women's health and provide the best quality of care following Cesarean section.&#xD;
