  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The socioeconomic gradient in health is well known and is partially explained by differences&#xD;
      in health-related behaviours across socioeconomic groups. There is reason to believe that the&#xD;
      current economic crisis has been contributing to the observed rapid decrease in the adherence&#xD;
      to the Mediterranean diet, thus reducing a protective factor against the development of major&#xD;
      chronic diseases. This project aims at investigating whether the economic crisis could&#xD;
      account for the shifting from the Mediterranean diet. Additionally, it will address&#xD;
      variations in inflammation biomarkers (possibly dietary-related) or metabolic phenotypes as&#xD;
      useful biological accounts for the decline in the adherence to Mediterranean diet. This&#xD;
      project will also test whether for economically weakest people cultural resources could&#xD;
      somehow attenuate the impact of material circumstances on lifestyle changes attributable to&#xD;
      the economic crisis.&#xD;

      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To identify population groups differently affected by the economic crisis within the&#xD;
      population-based cohort of the MOLI-SANI study recruited in the years 2005-2006 (before&#xD;
      economic crisis). This aim will be achieved by a new assessment of self-reported economic&#xD;
      difficulties possibly emerged after the recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To estimate possible changes in dietary and health-related behaviours (with particular&#xD;
      focus on the adherence to the Mediterranean diet) in subjects identified in the previous aim&#xD;
      as highly or poorly affected by the economic crisis. Inflammatory status and metabolic&#xD;
      phenotypes will be assessed in the two groups, recalled in a suitable proportion, to&#xD;
      establish a possible link between shifting from the Mediterranean diet and adverse health&#xD;
      outcomes. Quality of life and stress status will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To evaluate in the group more affected by economic constraints whether nutrition&#xD;
      knowledge and mass media exposure would account for the decline in the adherence to the&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet and consequent changes in inflammatory status and/ or metabolic&#xD;
      phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design Aim 1: Aim 1 will identify two groups of subjects as being most or less&#xD;
      affected by the economic crisis. This aim will be reached by recall of 7,000 individuals from&#xD;
      the Moli-sani cohort recruited in the years 2005-2006. Subjects will be administered a&#xD;
      questionnaire to assess economic constraints likely occurred after the economic crisis onset.&#xD;
      The questionnaire will update socioeconomic position and estimate economic constraints, food&#xD;
      quality and food expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design Aim 2: Within the two groups identified in aim 1, aim 2 will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Perform a dietary follow up by administering the Italian version of the EPIC&#xD;
           questionnaire (9), already used at baseline, to estimate the changes in dietary habits.&#xD;
           Lifestyle follow up will be obtained by a validated questionnaire used at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess changes in inflammatory status by measurements of the following biomarkers:&#xD;
           High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-18, Tumor necrosis&#xD;
           factor, Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, VCAM, ICAM, P-selectin, E-selectin,&#xD;
           L-selectin, CD40L, adiponectin, platelet and leukocyte counts, lipids, triglycerides,&#xD;
           glucose, insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Estimate variations in the metabolic phenotypes (prevalence of hypertension, diabetes,&#xD;
           obesity, metabolic syndrome, and levels of blood pressure, hip and waist&#xD;
           circumferences).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design Aim 3: A validated questionnaire on nutrition knowledge and exposure to&#xD;
      mass media will be administered. This will allow to retrospectively identify additional&#xD;
      subgroups differently exposed to information in order to estimate the role of cultural&#xD;
      resources in health-related behavioural changes.&#xD;
