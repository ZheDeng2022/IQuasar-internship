      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Diagnosing liver cancer usually&#xD;
      requires a liver sample. Getting the best sample helps determine whether cancer is present&#xD;
      and what kind of cancer it is. But sampling can be difficult. This study will look at&#xD;
      combining two devices to provide better liver samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if combining fusion imaging and optical imaging can better sample areas of concern in&#xD;
      the liver and determine the presence of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who need a liver biopsy as part of diagnosis or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood test results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a dye injected into a vein 24 hours before their biopsy. They will be&#xD;
      monitored for 30 minutes for any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the biopsy, participants skin will be numbed. They may have stickers placed on their&#xD;
      belly to help guide the needle. They will have a CT scan to plan the needle s pathway. For&#xD;
      the scan, they will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. A small camera will be&#xD;
      placed near the needle to take pictures of the liver. A medical GPS tracking system will be&#xD;
      used. This will guide the needle into the area of the participant s liver where the biopsy&#xD;
      will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the biopsy, participants will recover in the hospital for 4 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, researchers will take the participants biopsy tissue and look at it to&#xD;
      try to compare new ways to picture the sample.&#xD;

      -  Pilot study to evaluate the combination of optical molecular imaging (OMI) and EM&#xD;
           tracking in localizing intrahepatic lesions and assess the concordance between&#xD;
           fluorescence ICG and histopathology for the diagnosis of liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the 3rd most common cause of cancer globally with an&#xD;
           increasing incidence worldwide. Percutaneous sampling of focal hepatic lesions is a&#xD;
           cornerstone in management of patients with hepatic pathology. In a retrospective study&#xD;
           of patients with small hepatic lesions, up to 45% of the lesions biopsied were&#xD;
           insufficiently visualized and resulted to a false negative rate (defined as patients&#xD;
           with benign biopsies who were subsequently found to have malignant lesions at the&#xD;
           attempted site of biopsy). Thirty seven percent of those were for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EM navigation and fusion of real-time images with pre-acquired scans has been used in&#xD;
           hepatic biopsies at the NIH for more than 15 years. NIH / NCI clinical trials have&#xD;
           performed fusion biopsies with EM tracking in &gt; 2000 patients, &gt; 40,000 biopsies over&#xD;
           the past 12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indocyanine green (ICG) is an FDA approved optical molecular imaging fluorescent dye&#xD;
           used for visualization of cells and tissues. ICG has been used for decades in&#xD;
           ophthalmology for imaging retinal blood vessels. ICG was FDA cleared in 1959 and has&#xD;
           been widely used to assess liver function perioperatively. ICG is administered as an&#xD;
           injection. Adverse effects are rare and most often minor.&#xD;
