    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized controlled, phase II clinical trial, aiming at&#xD;
      giving a comparison of Sintilimab and Pembrolizumab in stage IIIB-IV NSCLC patients at&#xD;
      first-line treatment setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial has been set up with two arms. Screened patients would be included into one of the&#xD;
      arms based on tumor PD-L1 expression. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      the approved checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab and home-made drug Sintilimab in patients&#xD;
      with advanced NSCLC whose tumor have high PD-L1 expression and low or negative expression.&#xD;

Patients with PD-L1 low or negative expression (TPS&lt;50%) receive Sintilimab injection 200mg i.v. in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy every three weeks (Q3W) for 4 cycles.

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age≥18 years. Signed Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Stage IV NSCLC confirmed by histology/ cytology or Stage IIIB-IIIC NSCLC that could&#xD;
             not be treated with radical radiation therapy (8th edition of IASLC Lung Cancer&#xD;
             Staging System).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Fresh tumor tissue or paraffin tissue within 6 months is adequate for PD-L1 expression&#xD;
             (TPS) testing in the central laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Tumor tissue without EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement must be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Per RECIST 1.1 the efficacy evaluation criteria for solid tumors, at least one&#xD;
             radiologically measurable lesion which was not treated with radiotherapy or had&#xD;
             obvious disease progression after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who received no systemic chemotherapy or any other systemic treatment for&#xD;
             advanced NSCLC. For patients who received preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy or&#xD;
             postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or radical chemoradiotherapy, if the disease&#xD;
             progresses occurred one six months after the last treatment, they can be enrolled.&#xD;
             Patients who received targeted therapy or immunotherapy can not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             HBV-DNA copy number is larger than the upper limit of normal value in the laboratory&#xD;
             of the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Currently or prior clinically active interstitial lung disease. Currently active&#xD;
             pneumonia. Current radiation pneumonitis for which corticosteroid treatment is&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known HIV antibody positive, or other acquired or congenital immunodeficiency&#xD;
             diseases, or history of organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Fever and the body temperature is above 38°C or clinically significant infection&#xD;
             within 1 week prior to the enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active tuberculosis. Evidence of severe or uncontrollable systemic diseases (such as&#xD;
             severe mental, neurological diseases, seizure, or dementia, unstable or&#xD;
             non-compensatory respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal diseases, and&#xD;
             uncontrolled hypertension [CTCAE Grade 2 hypertension or above after drug treatment]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with active bleeding or new thrombotic diseases who are orally taking with&#xD;
             anticoagulant drugs or have bleeding tendency.&#xD;
