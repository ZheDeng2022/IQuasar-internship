    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in many cases is completely&#xD;
      unforeseen by the patient, who often faces a disease that is already at an advanced stage,&#xD;
      with poor prognosis. The clinical visit during which the diagnosis is communicated together&#xD;
      with the first information regarding the planned treatments is of paramount importance. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the clarity of such information is able to influence patients's engagement&#xD;
      and thus the compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS: The aim of this study is to collect quantitative data on the level of PDAC patient&#xD;
      engagement and the rate of understanding of the information received from the doctor, and&#xD;
      investigate the possible association between these two variables and with the patient's level&#xD;
      of compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This is a single-center, observational, cross-sectional cohort study focused on&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with PDAC, approved by the Ethics Committee of the San Raffaele Hospital.&#xD;
      As no preliminary data are available on the association between PDAC patient's understanding&#xD;
      rate and their level of engagement and of compliance no power calculation is possible. This&#xD;
      is a pilot study, aimed at enrolling at least 45 PDAC patients during a 3 months frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSION: COMMUNI.CARE will be the first study specifically investigating whether there is&#xD;
      a relation between PDAC patients' rate of understanding, their engagement and compliance at&#xD;
      time of diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of PDAC in most cases is completely unforeseen for the patient, who faces with&#xD;
      the disease already at an advanced stage and without a progressive approach to it. The&#xD;
      clinical interview in which the diagnosis and the first information regarding treatment&#xD;
      options and prognosis are communicated assumes a strong relevance, since it is an unexpected&#xD;
      diagnosis with a poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctor-patient communication is an integral part of the care itself and poses the basis for&#xD;
      the construction of the therapeutic alliance, an essential condition for compliance of the&#xD;
      patient with reference to the treatments proposed by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many recent studies claim that a good level of patient engagement is an essential condition&#xD;
      for building a solid therapeutic alliance; in this regard, objective measurement scales of&#xD;
      the patient engagement level have been developed, and have been demonstrated to be useful for&#xD;
      quantifying the patient's involvement within the care process Among them is the Patient&#xD;
      Health Engagement Scale (PHE-S®)-Scale, a recently validated assessment scale of simple and&#xD;
      non-invasive use, that requires only the administration of a questionnaire to the previously&#xD;
      informed patient who gives his consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that the clarity of the communication between the treating&#xD;
      physician and the patient, and the level of understanding by the patient of the information&#xD;
      conveyed by the doctor, in particular at the time of diagnosis largely influences the&#xD;
      construction of a solid therapeutic alliance between the treating physician and PDAC patients&#xD;
      and consequently the patient's engagement and compliance in the care process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the clarity of the communication between the treating physician and&#xD;
      the patient and the degree of comprehension by the patient, especially during the first&#xD;
      phases of the cure, are associated with the level of engagement and consequently with the&#xD;
      compliance of patients with PDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the present pilot study will support the initial hypothesis, further action to improve the&#xD;
      clarity of the clinical communication will be promoted.&#xD;
