  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Our purpose was to investigate the laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) induced changes&#xD;
      in corneal densitometry in acute primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) cases during the&#xD;
      post-laser 1 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: This prospective study included 21 eyes of 21 cases with first acute&#xD;
      attack of PACG. All the eyes underwent LPI with neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd: YAG)&#xD;
      laser after the intraocular pressure (IOP) decreased to normal levels with maximal systemic&#xD;
      and topical anti-glaucoma treatment and complete regression of clinically significant corneal&#xD;
      edema. Central corneal thickness (CCT) and corneal density values were measured by&#xD;
      densitometry software of Pentacam HR-Scheimpflug corneal topography over a 12-mm diameter of&#xD;
      the cornea just before LPI and at the first week and the first month after LPI. Kolmogorov&#xD;
      smirnov and paired-t tests were used for statistical analysis.&#xD;

      This prospective study included 21 eyes of 21 cases with first acute attack of PACG who had&#xD;
      applied to emergency department of Ulucanlar Eye Research Hospital between March 2018 and&#xD;
      January 2019. All the eyes underwent LPI with neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd: YAG)&#xD;
      laser after the IOP decreased to normal levels with maximal systemic and topical&#xD;
      anti-glaucoma treatment and complete regression of clinically significant corneal edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the acute attack ocular examination was performed at the emergency department&#xD;
      including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with Snellen charts, slit-lamb examination,&#xD;
      fundus examination by +90 D lens, IOP measurements with Goldmann applanation tonometry,&#xD;
      gonioscopy of the fellow eye with Goldmann three-mirror lens. Gonioscopy and fundus&#xD;
      examinations were performed for the eyes with acute PACG after the regression of corneal&#xD;
      edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the cases had intravenous infusion of mannitol 20% (250-300 cc) at the emergency&#xD;
      department. Oral acetazolamide 250 mg (3 times daily), oral potassium supplement, topical&#xD;
      fixed-combination of beta-blocker and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (twice daily) and&#xD;
      brimonidine (twice daily). LPI procedures were performed within the first day of the attack&#xD;
      (after 12-24 hours) by the same experienced physician (OA) with neodymium:&#xD;
      yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd: YAG) laser under topical anesthesia with proparacain %0.5.&#xD;
      Superior-nasal position (1 or 11 o'clock) was focused and 1 or more shots were performed (1-3&#xD;
      pulses per shot with 3-8 mJ energy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central corneal thickness (CCT) and CD values were measured by densitometry software of&#xD;
      Pentacam HR-Scheimpflug corneal topography just before LPI and at the first week and the&#xD;
      first month after LPI. All the measurements were performed by the same experienced clinician&#xD;
      between 9 am and 2 pm under standard dim-light conditions without pupil dilatation.&#xD;

    <description>The measurements were done between 9 am and 2 pm under standard dim-light conditions without pupil dilatation. The CD values of anterior layer (anterior 120 µm), central (between anterior layer and posterior 60 µm), posterior layer (posterior 60 µm) of 4 annular concentric zones as 0-2 mm zone, 2-6 mm zone, 6-10 mm zone and 10-12 mm zone were measured. The CD values were expressed in grayscale units (GSC) as 0 for maximum transparency and 100 for total corneal opacity. Measurement were done just before laser treatment and repeated at the first week and month.</description>
