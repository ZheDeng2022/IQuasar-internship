      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in pain management advoctes the use of multimodal approach for post-operative&#xD;
      pain therapy, as it reduces the side effects of individual drugs and attenuate pain responses&#xD;
      at various sites in painpathways.. 6 if pain is not sufficiently managed, it can lead to&#xD;
      various post-surgical complications and chronic pain..4 opiods are one of the commonly used&#xD;
      drugs for provision of balanced anaesthesia as well as analgesia in the post surgical period.&#xD;
      The use of opioids lead to various side effects, acute tolerance and hefty financial&#xD;
      constraints if used in larger doses. In Pakistan, easy availability of narcotics also cause&#xD;
      difficulty in choice of analgesics in post-operative pain.3 Ketamine , a phencyclidine&#xD;
      derivative and dissociative anesthetic agent can cause significant analgesia when used in&#xD;
      subanesthetic doses..1 it possess centrally mediated analgesic potential without any&#xD;
      significant effect on patient's wakefulness and perception in dose of ≤0.3 mg/kg IV.2&#xD;
      Consensus guidelines on the use of intravenous ketamine for acute pain management from the&#xD;
      American Society of Regional Anaesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain&#xD;
      Medicine and the American Society of Anaesthesiologists 2018 supports the use of sub&#xD;
      anesthetic bolus dose of ketamine up to 0.35 mg/kg and infusions up to 1 mg/kg/hour for acute&#xD;
      pain as adjuncts to opioids for perioperative analgesia.1 Low-dose IV ketamine infusion&#xD;
      decrease opioid requirement by 40%. It also decreases pain scores, but these findings are&#xD;
      less clear. No significant adverse effects have been reported with low-dose IV infusion of&#xD;
      ketamine when used up to 48 hours after surgery5 We conducted this study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of perioperative sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion, when continued in the&#xD;
      post-operative period for 24 hours, on post-operative pain and sedation scores, overall&#xD;
      narcotic and analgesics comsumptions and side effects in patients undergoing spine surgery in&#xD;
      local population. Literature review did not show any such study conducted in Pakistan till&#xD;
      date, results of this study can help innovate strategies of multimodel analgesia In local&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Onjective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to compare the effects of perioperative low dose ketamine&#xD;
      infusion on postoperative pain , sedation score, adverse effects and total analgesics&#xD;
      consumption in a placebo-controlled design Hypothesis Perioperative low dose ketamine&#xD;
      infusion decreases the visual analogue score and total analgesic consumption without profound&#xD;
      side effects in the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: single blind prospective randomized control trial. Setting: After approval from&#xD;
      ethical committee, this study will be conducted at the Department Of Anesthesiology and&#xD;
      Surgical Intensive Care Uni t , services Hospital Lahore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: The proposed study will be completed in six months after approval of&#xD;
      synopsis from services institute of medical sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is calculated by taking mean numeric pain rating score at 24 hours7 For ketamine&#xD;
      group value NPRS is : 2.7±0.5 For control group NPRS value is : 3.1±1.0 Taking 95% Confidence&#xD;
      interval level, 80 percent power of study and 5% alpha error sample size is calculated to be&#xD;
      60, taking 30 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at services hospital lahore after institutional review board&#xD;
      approval. After taking approval from review board, written informed consent will be taken&#xD;
      from all the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 adult patients aged between 18 and 60 years old with American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status I-II scheduled for elective spine surgery will be&#xD;
      allocated into two groups of 30 patients each. Regarding provision to maintain privacy, all&#xD;
      participants' names will be concealed and replaced by code numbers to maintain privacy.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria included patients with ASA class I or II. Exclusion criteria included the&#xD;
      following: BMI more than 40 kg/m2; poorly controlled arterial hypertension (blood pressure&#xD;
      higher than 140/90 mmHg); respiratory, liver or kidney disease; and heart disease (heart&#xD;
      block or myocardial ischemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During preanesthesia assessment, patients will be explained about the visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) of 0-10 with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 being &quot;worst possible pain&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly divided into two groups of 30 each by a sealed envelope technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will be administered a bolus of intravenous ketamine of 0.25 mg/kg followed by an&#xD;
      infusion of ketamine at a rate of 0.15 mg/kg/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B will be given a normal saline bolus and infusion at the same volume and rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of bolus dose followed by infusion of both ketamine or saline will be&#xD;
      started before the skin incision. The infusion (Mindray SK-500, Germany) will be continued&#xD;
      intraoperatively and will be stopped after the skin closure but before the extubation of the&#xD;
      patient. In order to avoid bias the medical staff who will not be involved in anesthetizing&#xD;
      the patients will prepare the study drugs. The drugs will be prepared in 20 mL syringe&#xD;
      (concentration of ketamine was 10 mg/ml), the saline syringes will also be labelled like&#xD;
      ketamine syringes. Preoperatively the patients will be kept nil per oral for 6 hours before&#xD;
      the surgery. Continuous monitoring of pulse, oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      noninvasive blood pressure and end tidal carbon dioxide will be done perioperatively (Operon&#xD;
      OM-12, Germany). The anesthesiologist administering anesthesia will not be aware of the group&#xD;
      to which the patients belonged. The blood pressure will be monitored every 3 minutes. An 18 G&#xD;
      IV line will be secured for drug administration and IV fluid management. IV glycopyrrolate&#xD;
      200 µg and IV metaclopramide 10 mg will given to all the patients as a premedication. IV&#xD;
      induction will be done with propofol 2mg/kg and nalbuphine 0.1mg/kg. IV atracurium 0.5mg/kg&#xD;
      will be used for endotracheal intubation. Maintenance of anesthesia will continue with&#xD;
      sevoflurane and 100% oxygen. Fluid management will be done with IV ringer lactate. The&#xD;
      reversal of the residual neuromuscular blockade will be done with IV neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg&#xD;
      and glycopyrrolate 0.02 mg/kg. Endotracheal tube will be removed on complete recovery of the&#xD;
      airway reflexes. The individual involved in data collection of pain scores will not be aware&#xD;
      of the group to which the patient belonged. Similarly, the staff who provided the&#xD;
      postoperative care in the hospital were unaware of the patient group. The patients will&#xD;
      transferred to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) and pain scores and sedation score will&#xD;
      be noted on arrival, 1hr,3hr,6hr,8hr,12hr and 24 hr postoperatively using VAS and ramsey&#xD;
      sedation scores respectively. The patients will be kept in post anesthesia care unit for 3 h.&#xD;
      Patients will be shifted to the ward and will be given IV ketorolac 30 mg 12 hourly. All the&#xD;
      patients who complained of pain score of VAS 4 or above will be provided provided rescue&#xD;
      analgesia of IV nalbuphine bolus 0.1 mg/kg and time will be noted. The total amount of&#xD;
      nalbuphine given in 24 h will be noted for both the groups. Side effects of ketamine and&#xD;
      nalbuphine such as hallucination, sedation, nausea, vomiting and respiratory depression will&#xD;
      be recorded. For hallucination IV haloperidol 5mg, for nausea and vomiting IV metoclopramide&#xD;
      10 mg and for respiratory depression (respiratory rate less than 9/min) IV naloxone will be&#xD;
      given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: The results will be analyzed using SPSS version 25.0.0 software (IBM. Results&#xD;
      will be presented as mean ± standard deviation or as number of patients. Statistical&#xD;
      significance of comparison of gender between two groups will be analyzed with Chi-square&#xD;
      test. Statistical significance of age, weight, duration of surgery, VAS and nalbuphine&#xD;
      consumption between two groups will be tested with independent sample t-test.&#xD;
