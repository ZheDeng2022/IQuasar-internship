  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed of this randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study is to assess the&#xD;
      effect of SAMe compared to placebo in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis Child Class A and B.&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to test relationship between SAMe&#xD;
      (S-adenosylmethionine) supplement on liver function. The hypothesis is that SAMe supplement&#xD;
      will improve liver function in patients with alcoholic liver disease. The improvement in&#xD;
      liver function will lead to the reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with alcoholic&#xD;
      cirrhosis in those who receive SAMe supplement when compared to those receiving placebo.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have had alcohol consumption averaging at least 80 grams per day (for&#xD;
             men) or 50 grams per day (for women), for at least 10 years. These criteria are based&#xD;
             on epidemiological evidence of the alcohol-cirrhosis relationship. The cutoff was set&#xD;
             at a relatively high level so as to minimize the chance that cirrhosis was caused by&#xD;
             factors other than alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Evidence of cirrhosis as per clinical signs and/or noninvasive transient elastography&#xD;
             (FibroscanÂ®), computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging including MRI&#xD;
             elastography compatible with cirrhosis and/or histopathology by biopsy and&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. subjects with clinical presentation either in Child Class A or B at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for healthy control :&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. individuals 18 to 70 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. subjects do not consume any alcohol or those who drink &lt; 50 grams per day on average&#xD;
             in women and &lt; 80 grams per day on average in men and do not consume any alcohol&#xD;
             within 3 months before the study and&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. subjects are healthy without underlying acute or chronic medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active infection as evidenced by positive urine culture, blood culture, or pneumonia,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known co-existing infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, or HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Significant systemic or major illness including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, and renal failure that in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             would preclude the patient from participating in and completing the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Gastrointestinal bleeding within the prior 28 days3&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participation in another investigational drug, biologic, or medical device trial&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women who are pregnant, may become pregnant, or nursing&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Presence of any other disease or condition that is interfering with the absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of SAMe such as those with gastric bypass&#xD;
             surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with history of/diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Members from the same family of study participant. This is based on the recent paper&#xD;
             on the non-random sampling in randomized controlled trials4. We acknowledge that if we&#xD;
             assign family members to identical treatment, randomization would not be totally&#xD;
             correct; but if properly randomized, there is a chance that the members of the family&#xD;
             might mix the pills. To avoid this issue and maintain the integrity of randomized&#xD;
             blinded fashion, we will not include members from the same family into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with psychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorders as SAMe may interfere&#xD;
             with the levels of anti-psychotic drugs and&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Systemic antibiotic use or use of rifaximin for 10 days or more in last 2 months&#xD;
             before the enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for all healthy control participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. individuals under the age of 18 or over the age of 70&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. not able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. subjects who consume any alcohol or those who drink &gt; 50 grams per day on average in&#xD;
             women and &gt; 80 grams per day on average in men and consume any alcohol within 3 months&#xD;
             before the study and&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. subjects that are unhealthy with underlying acute or chronic medical conditions.&#xD;
