  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, single-center phase I study to evaluate first signs of efficacy and to confirm&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of a decitabine safe-dose treatment in two strata of patients&#xD;
      with HPV induced anogenital and head and neck cancers (Stratum 1: patients with high rist for&#xD;
      disease recurrence; Stratum 2: patients with failure of standard therapy). The study is&#xD;
      expected to enroll 18 patients overall (9 patients in each stratum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the trial for each patient is expected to be 6 months (two 28 day cycles of&#xD;
      study treatment plus four months of additional follow-up). The overall duration of the trial&#xD;
      is expected to be approximately 42 months.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of decitabine treatment in two strata of patients with HPV-induced anogenital and head and neck cancer. Primary endpoint is the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) during the first two cycles of study treatment (up to day 56). DLT will be assessed and managed independently for both strata.</description>
