  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and chronic lung disease that occurs in preterm&#xD;
      infants following ventilator and oxygen therapy and is associated with long-term health&#xD;
      consequences. Preclinical research shows that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can modify a&#xD;
      number of pathophysiological processes that are central to the progression of BPD and thus&#xD;
      present as a promising new treatment option. The main purpose of this Phase I study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs in extremely preterm infants&#xD;
      at risk of developing BPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complications of extreme preterm birth are the primary cause of mortality in children under&#xD;
      the age of five. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease that follows&#xD;
      ventilator and oxygen therapy for acute respiratory failure, is the most common complication&#xD;
      of extreme prematurity and contributes to life-long respiratory and neurological impairment.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no effective treatment for BPD. The multi-factorial nature of BPD makes&#xD;
      it challenging for traditional pharmacological therapies targeting a single pathway to have a&#xD;
      major impact on outcome. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new&#xD;
      treatment avenue due to their pleiotropic effects that may prevent neonatal lung injury while&#xD;
      promoting lung (and other organ) growth. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all&#xD;
      preclinical studies testing MSCs in neonatal lung injury models provides strong evidence for&#xD;
      the lung protective effect of MSCs. Additionally, studies in a large preclinical model of&#xD;
      extreme prematurity and chronic lung injury suggest feasibility, safety and short-term&#xD;
      hemodynamic benefit of intravenously delivered human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs&#xD;
      (uc-MSC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to establish the safety, maximum feasible dose and feasibility of&#xD;
      intravenously delivered allogeneic uc-MSCs in preterm infants at risk of developing BPD. This&#xD;
      will be a Phase 1, open-label, single center, dose-escalating trial using a 3+3+3 design.&#xD;
