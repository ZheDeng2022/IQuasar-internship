    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of education and tele-consultancy intervention&#xD;
      based on Watson's Human Care Theory on self-efficacy and quality of life of individuals with&#xD;
      COPD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A total of 74 individuals, including 37 individuals and 37 control groups, who applied to&#xD;
      Akdeniz University Chest Diseases Polyclinic for examination and follow-up, meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, will be conducted between September 2019 - January 2022. Information Form&#xD;
      Based on Watson Human Care Theory in Collecting Data, COPD Self-efficacy Scale, St. George&#xD;
      Quality of Life Scale, Pulmonary Function Test Form will be used. Individuals in the&#xD;
      enterprise group will be provided with training and consultancy based on Watson Human Care&#xD;
      Theory, and an educational booklet prepared with current guides and expert opinions.&#xD;
      Telephone counseling will be provided in the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th weeks after the&#xD;
      first intervention. Routine follow-up of individuals in the control group will continue. The&#xD;
      data of the scales in the intervention and control groups will be collected as&#xD;
      pre-intervention and post-test in the 12th week. Statistical analysis of the data will be&#xD;
      done with SAS 9.4 software package.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline and at the end of the third months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure self-efficacy in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Wigal et al. (1991) developed The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Self-Efficacy Scale. The total score is calculated by the score of each of the answers given. There are 34 items in the total of the subtitles, a minimum of 34 points and a maximum of 170 points. High scores indicate that the level of self-efficacy is high. To find the overall score of the subscales, the total score is divided by the number of items that make up the subscale. In comparison, if there is an increase in score in the posttest compared to the pretest, it is interpreted that the degree of confidence in managing breathing difficulties or avoiding increased. By translating the scale into Turkish, Kara and Mirici (2002) tested its validity and reliability. Cronbach's alpha value in the original version of the scale is 0.95; Cronbach's alpha value of the Turkish version was found to be 0.94.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline and at the end of the third months</time_frame>
    <description>St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is known to be associated with the most commonly used scales in respiratory diseases. SGRQ is a 50-item scale under three main titles developed in 2001: symptoms (8 items), activities (16 items), effects of the disease (26 items).&#xD;
It is a scale that investigates the relationship between dyspnea, sputum, cough, respiratory status, and daily activity, especially in individuals with COPD. Its highest score is 100 and it expresses the highest level of negative status. Cronbach's alpha value of SGRQ was calculated as 0.88 for the whole scale, and it was found in the validity analysis that it correlated significantly with similar scales (p &lt;0.0001). The SGRQ scale was translated into Turkish by PolatlÄ± et al. (2013) and its validity and reliability study was conducted. Correlation of Turkish version Cronbach's alpha value was found to be 0.90.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pulmonary function tests</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline and at the end of the third months</time_frame>
    <description>It is known that spirometry is the best method in the evaluation of airway obstruction and COPD. After spirometry, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1 / FVC ratio values are obtained. Normal values of the FEV1 / FVC ratio between 0.7-0.8 and less than 0.65 are indicative of airway obstruction. After spirometry, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1 / FVC ratio. Normal values of the FEV1 / FVC ratio between 0.7-0.8 and less than 0.65 are indicative of airway obstruction.</description>

    <description>Informed Consent Form will be taken in written from those who agree to participate in the research.&#xD;
In the first intervention, Information Form Based on Watson's Human Care Theory, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Self-efficacy Scale, St. George Quality of Life Scale, Respiratory Function Test Form data will be collected. Subsequently, education, counseling nursing care and education booklet based on Watson's Human Care Theory will be given.&#xD;
