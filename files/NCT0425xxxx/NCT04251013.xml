      The aim of this study is to compare, during an ERCP for VBP stenosis, the sensitivity of two&#xD;
      biliary brushes: the INFINITY® vs the RX Cytology Brush®&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main objective: Comparison of the rates of positive diagnosis of biliary brushing in&#xD;
           cases of adenocarcinoma stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objective (s):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Comparison of the quantification of the cellular material obtained (acellular,&#xD;
                weak, or abundant), and the presence of cellular cupboards unhooked by the brush&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Comparison of the 2 brushes false negative rates, and negative predictive value for&#xD;
                the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation of the variation in the profitability of brushing and other sampling&#xD;
                techniques (intra-biliary biopsies, puncture, aspiration of bile) according to the&#xD;
                presence of a tumor mass syndrome of more than 1 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation of the variation in the profitability of brushing and other sampling&#xD;
                techniques (intra-biliary biopsies, puncture, aspiration of bile) according to the&#xD;
                site of the stenosis (distal vs proximal BPV: common bile duct or intrahepatic&#xD;
                duct), with the cost effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Technical failure rate of brushing and other samples (intra-biliary biopsies, bile&#xD;
                aspiration)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study concerns adult subjects with stenosis of the main bile duct (common bile duct or&#xD;
      common hepatic duct).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deep catheterization of the biliary duct (whatever the access technique: by the papilla&#xD;
           or by precut) and cross stenosis by the guide wire, then biliary dilation (6 to 8mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization if the inclusion criteria are met&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biliary brushing successively with the 2 brushes in the order designated by&#xD;
           randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Performing a dozen back and forth movements in the stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Aspiration, if possible of bile by the catheter of the brush for cytological&#xD;
                analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The contents of the brush will be spread over 3 blades (numbered) then sectioned&#xD;
                and placed in cytolit with the contents of the tubing of the brush flushed with a&#xD;
                few cc of cytolit. Each brush in a numbered pot. Blades 1,2 and 3 +/- bile 1 joined&#xD;
                to pot n ° 1; blades 4,5 and 6 +/- bile 2 joined to pot 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the event of technical failure (impossibility of accessing the stenosis with the&#xD;
           first or second brush, impossibility of removing the brush), the patient will be&#xD;
           considered to have failed for this brush (absence of pathological material brought back)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All possible sampling methods will also be taken to obtain the anatomopathological diagnosis:&#xD;
      intra-biliary biopsies with adult or pediatric forceps, wire-guided or not, biopsy samples&#xD;
      guided by choledochoscopy, puncture under endo-ultrasonography, bile aspiration after release&#xD;
      of the biliary stent, according to the physician's habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFECTIVE The total number of subjects required: 50 (25 patients per group) Duration of the&#xD;
      inclusion period: 2 years Duration of participation for each subject: from 7 days to 12&#xD;
      months (in case of negative initial withdrawal) Total duration of the study: 3 years&#xD;
