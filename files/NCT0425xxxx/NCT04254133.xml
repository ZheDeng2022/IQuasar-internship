      This research study invites men with prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the&#xD;
      body (metastatic prostate cancer) identified through the Washington State Cancer Registry to&#xD;
      complete genetic testing looking for inherited genetic mutations in about 30 cancer-risk&#xD;
      genes. Participants also fill out a survey on their health history and family history of&#xD;
      cancer. After receiving their test results, participants who are found to have genetic&#xD;
      mutations predisposing to higher cancer risk receive genetic counseling, and their adult male&#xD;
      relatives are invited to complete genetic testing as well. The researchers seek to learn&#xD;
      about factors that might predict a higher likelihood of having a mutation, to learn how best&#xD;
      to facilitate &quot;cascade&quot; genetic testing for at-risk male relatives of men with metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer who are found to have concerning genetic mutations, and finally, to identify&#xD;
      men without a prostate cancer diagnosis but with high risk genetic mutations who may benefit&#xD;
      from a more focused screening protocol for prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine clinical, pathologic, and molecular predictors of germline DNA repair gene&#xD;
      (gDRG) mutation carriers in a population-based cohort of men diagnosed with metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer (mPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize stepwise cascade genetic testing for at-risk male relatives of mPC cases&#xD;
      with gDRG mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify a cohort of men with gDRG mutations without a prostate cancer diagnosis who&#xD;
      may benefit from an early detection protocol for prostate cancer. (Note: An early detection&#xD;
      study for men with gDRG mutations without a prostate cancer diagnosis will be conducted as a&#xD;
      separate trial.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with mPC identified through the Washington State Cancer Registry receive mail&#xD;
      and phone invitations to participate. Participants complete a web-based or hard copy&#xD;
      questionnaire on their health history and family history of cancer and are mailed a saliva&#xD;
      collection kit. Saliva samples are mailed back to Color Genomics for genetic testing, and&#xD;
      results are provided both to participants and to study researchers. Participants who are&#xD;
      identified to have an inherited mutation in a DNA repair gene receive phone-based genetic&#xD;
      counseling, and are also asked for permission to contact their adult male relatives. If&#xD;
      permission is granted, those relatives receive mail and phone invitations to complete genetic&#xD;
      testing in a similar fashion.&#xD;
