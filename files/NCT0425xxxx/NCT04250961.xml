  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Time of showering after surgery is still a controversial issue for surgical patients and&#xD;
      health professionals. It has been reported that patients should not shower until sutures are&#xD;
      removed since traditionally showering is thought to cause infections after surgery. However,&#xD;
      not showering after surgery not only has a negative effect on patient comfort but also brings&#xD;
      about the risk of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sternal wound infections after coronary artery bypass graft surgery through median sternotomy&#xD;
      are one of the important, life-threatening complications. For this reasons, the investigators&#xD;
      researched the advantages and disadvantages of showering for postoperative sternal wound&#xD;
      infections, pain due to sternotomy and patient comfort and satisfaction.&#xD;

      Sternal wound infections after coronary artery bypass graft surgery through median sternotomy&#xD;
      are one of the important, life-threatening complications increasing length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality and difficult to treat. In addition to adopting asepsis and&#xD;
      antisepsis, meeting hygiene needs, an important nursing intervention, plays a role in&#xD;
      prevention of sternal wound infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Showering is an important hygiene practice. It has been reported that patients should not&#xD;
      shower until sutures are removed since traditionally showering is thought to cause infections&#xD;
      after surgery. However, not showering after surgery not only has a negative effect on patient&#xD;
      comfort but also brings about the risk of infections. Guidelines for prevention of surgical&#xD;
      site infections do not involve recommendations about early showering after surgery or keeping&#xD;
      surgical wounds closed and dry for a long time after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, it has been reported that keeping postsurgical wounds closed and dry is&#xD;
      unnecessary and that showering before removal of sutures is not harmful. There have been&#xD;
      studies which reveal showering early after surgery does not increase the risk of infections,&#xD;
      even decreases pain and has a positive influence on patient comfort and satisfaction. It is&#xD;
      thought that postsurgical showering can quicken wound healing by cleaning sweat, dirt,&#xD;
      microorganisms and debris and thus can reduce the risk of infections. However, at present,&#xD;
      whether showering before removal of sutures affects wound healing is debatable. Despite&#xD;
      presence of studies about effects of postsurgical showering on wound healing, there have not&#xD;
      been any studies on the impact of showering after CABG surgery through median sternotomy.&#xD;
      Lack of evidence about this issue causes difficulty in relevant nursing practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was performed to evaluate effects of showering in 48-72 hours after median&#xD;
      sternotomy on sternal wound infections, sternotomy related pain and patient comfort and&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design and Setting This is a randomized controlled study carried&#xD;
      out to evaluate effects of showering in 48-72 hours after median sternotomy on sternal wound&#xD;
      infections, pain due to sternotomy and patient comfort and satisfaction. The study was&#xD;
      conducted in the cardiovascular surgery clinic with 30 beds at a university hospital in&#xD;
      Aegean region, Turkey, between 21 December 2016 and 30 September 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria were age of over 18 years, having CABG&#xD;
      surgery through median sternotomy, removal of the chest tube, having sutures in place and&#xD;
      accepting to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were having reoperation, removal of&#xD;
      the chest tube 72 hours after surgery, developing complications including cardiac tamponade,&#xD;
      pleural effusion and pneumonia after surgery and going to another hospital for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was based on a power analysis made with PS Software Version 3.0.43.17 Since&#xD;
      there was not a study about effects of showering in the early postoperative period after&#xD;
      sternotomy, the power of the study based on the mean effect size (alpha=0.50), the confidence&#xD;
      interval (CI) of 95% and the significance level of P &lt; .05 was determined as 80%.18 The&#xD;
      sample size was found to be 50 patients, of whom 25 assigned the intervention group (shower&#xD;
      group) and other assigned the control group. Taking account of possible losses, a higher&#xD;
      number of subjects at the rate of 20% was planned to include in the study. As a result, each&#xD;
      group included 30 subjects. However, four patients, of whom one decided not to shower, one&#xD;
      developed sternal instability, one died of aspiration pneumonia on the tenth day of surgery&#xD;
      and one went to another hospital for follow-up, were excluded from the shower group. Five&#xD;
      patients, of whom one had reoperation on the 13th day due to cardiac tamponade, one died of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary arrest on the 14th day and three went to another hospital for postoperative&#xD;
      follow-up, were excluded from the control group. The study was completed with 51 patients, of&#xD;
      whom 26 were in the shower group and 25 were in the control group.&#xD;
