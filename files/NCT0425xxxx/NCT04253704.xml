  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a placebo-controlled double-blinded trial to compare effects of 2% IDL lotion to&#xD;
      placebo in female subjects with dry skin. Primary endpoints were skin hydration (NovaMeter)&#xD;
      and transepidermal water loss (VapoMeter).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of two topically applied test materials and the&#xD;
           ability to increase hydration and decrease the transepidermal water loss of the skin.&#xD;
           Efficacy was evaluated instrumentally using the NovaMeter and VapoMeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test Material Description: On January 4, 2017, two test samples labeled Hydrating Lotion&#xD;
           HydraSynol IDL RC-02-38, 12/21/16 and Hydrating Lotion Control RC-02-38A, 12/21/16 were&#xD;
           received from Sytheon Ltd. and assigned CR Lab Nos.: P0104-B1 and P0104-B2,&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test Material Handling: Upon arrival at Cantor Research Laboratories, Inc., the test&#xD;
           materials were assigned a unique laboratory code number and entered into a daily log&#xD;
           identifying the lot number, sample description, sponsor, date received and tests&#xD;
           requested. Samples are retained for a period of three months beyond submission of final&#xD;
           report unless otherwise specified by the sponsor or if sample is known to be in support&#xD;
           of governmental applications, in which case retained samples are kept two years beyond&#xD;
           final report submission. Sample disposal is conducted in compliance with appropriate&#xD;
           federal, state and local ordinances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recruitment: Panel selection was accomplished by advertisements in local periodicals,&#xD;
           community bulletin boards, phone solicitation, electronic media or any combination&#xD;
           thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Informed Consent: In compliance with 21 CFR Ch.1 Part 50, Subpart B, informed consent&#xD;
           was obtained from each volunteer prior to the commencement of the study. The consent&#xD;
           form described the procedures, possible adverse effects, associated risks, and potential&#xD;
           benefits of the study and the limits of liability. Panelists signed and dated the&#xD;
           informed consent document to indicate their authorization to proceed and acknowledge&#xD;
           their understanding of the contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. NovaMeter: The Novameter is a multifunctional electronic laboratory instrument that&#xD;
           measures skin impedance. It is designed to provide non-invasive, objective, reproducible&#xD;
           method of measurement to quantify biophysical characteristics and relative hydration of&#xD;
           the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. VapoMeter: The VapoMeter is a fully portable instrument for measureing TEWL&#xD;
           (transepidermal water loss) values and evaporation rates. TEWL is an indicator of the&#xD;
           skin's barrier function. The core of the VapoMeter is a sensitive humidity sensor that&#xD;
           is inside a cylindrical measurement chamber. This chamber is closed by the skin or other&#xD;
           measurement surface during the measurement period and is unaffected by ambient airflows.&#xD;
           The sensor monitors the increase of relative humidity (RH) inside the chamber during the&#xD;
           measurement. The evaporation rate value (g/m²h) is automatically calculated from the RH&#xD;
           increase. The chamber is passively ventilated between measurements and the ventilation&#xD;
           time is automatically controlled. The VapoMeter is widely accepted and an efficient&#xD;
           instrument for TEWL measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Washout period: Five days prior to the study the panelists were told to not use any&#xD;
           moisturizers or treatment products on their arms and refrain from using any other&#xD;
           products during the course of the study. They were asked to wash their arms with only&#xD;
           ivory soap and pat dry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Baseline: The panelists arrived at the lab with their arms washed by water alone (if&#xD;
           forearm skin was not dry, the panelist was asked to wash their arms with only ivory soap&#xD;
           and pat dry). Panelists with Skin Dryness Grade of 6 and 7 were inducted in the study. A&#xD;
           trained technician examined the test areas (left and right volar arms) for any&#xD;
           abnormalities that would obstruct the measurements. The left arm was used for the test&#xD;
           material Hydrating Lotion HydraSynol IDL RC-02-38, 12/21/16 (CR Lab No. P0104-B1). The&#xD;
           right arm was used for Hydrating Lotion Control RC-02-38A, 12/21/16 (CR Lab No.&#xD;
           P0104-B2). The panelists were required to equilibrate to the controlled environment with&#xD;
           a constant temperature of 70 degrees F and humidity of 30% Rh for half hour.&#xD;
           Measurements on each arm (left and right volar arms) were taken using the NovaMeter and&#xD;
           VapoMeter. A trained technician then applied each test material to the respective volar&#xD;
           arm in order for the panelist to observe the manner in which the products should be&#xD;
           applied for two weeks. The test materials were allowed to dry before the dismissal of&#xD;
           the panelist. The panelists were then given the pre weighed test materials as well as a&#xD;
           study diary in order to list the time of each application, the date and any subjective&#xD;
           comments that they might have about the test materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Week 2: The panelists arrived at the lab with their arms applied with the test materials&#xD;
           at least five hours prior. A trained technician examined the test areas (left and right&#xD;
           volar arms) for any abnormalities that would obstruct the measurements. The panelists&#xD;
           were allowed to equilibrate to the controlled environment with a constant temperature of&#xD;
           70 degrees F and humidity of 30% Rh for a half hour. Measurements on each arm (left and&#xD;
           right volar arms) were taken again using the NovaMeter and VapoMeter. The test materials&#xD;
           were weighed and diaries collected to check for compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Day 18 (after 4 days regression): The panelists arrived at the lab. A trained technician&#xD;
           examined the test areas (left and right volar arms) for any abnormalities that would&#xD;
           obstruct the measurements. The panelists were allowed to equilibrate to the controlled&#xD;
           environment with a constant temperature of 70 degrees F and humidity of 30% Rh for a&#xD;
           half hour. Measurements on each arm (left and right volar arms) were taken again using&#xD;
           the NovaMeter and VapoMeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Adverse reactions: Subjects were instructed to report any delayed reactions which might&#xD;
           occur after the final reading. Clients are notified immediately in the case of an&#xD;
           adverse reaction and a determination is made as to a treatment program if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Statistical Analysis: All of the data was tabulated in a Microsoft® Excel spreadsheet.&#xD;
           Using the t-Test, the statistical significance of the net change from baseline&#xD;
           (pre-application) to each subsequent time point was assessed. Statistical significance&#xD;
           was defined at the p=0.05 or less level (corresponding to a 95% or greater confidence&#xD;
           level).&#xD;
