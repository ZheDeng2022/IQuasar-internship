  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will highlight the potential benefit of endovascular therapy on post thrombotic&#xD;
      syndrome reduction after proximal iliac DVT. There is actually not real standard of care for&#xD;
      the treatment of this pathology. A clear evidence of efficacy of endovascular therapy will be&#xD;
      of great benefit for both the patients and the healthcare system, and will provide new data&#xD;
      for further international guidelines&#xD;

      Benefit(s) for the individual:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the experimental arm of the study will attempt to a strong reduction of&#xD;
      PTS. In addition, all patients of the study will benefit from a careful follow-up thanks to&#xD;
      the availability of physicians involved in the study, optimization of quality of compression&#xD;
      therapy and anticoagulant treatment, and will be strongly encouraged to regular physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group(s) Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 100 000 to 150 000 persons develop VTE each year in France, among which about 5% will&#xD;
      develop severe and disabling PTS. Validation of interventional therapy may provide a major&#xD;
      clinical improvement for these patients in terms of morbidity and quality of life. The&#xD;
      economic impact is likely to be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk(s) to the individual(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first risk is related to interventional treatment, i.e. haemorrhages or early DVT&#xD;
      recurrence. The use of endovascular approach will reduce the haemorrhagic risk compared to&#xD;
      open surgery, and the risk of recurrence will be controlled by anticoagulant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second risk is related to antithrombotic treatment, i.e. combination of aspirin plus&#xD;
      anticoagulant, then anticoagulant alone. The combined therapy will be used during a short&#xD;
      one-month treatment reducing the risk, and the patients are already trained to anticoagulant&#xD;
      treatment. Moreover, it is attempted, regarding the characteristics of patients eligible to&#xD;
      interventional procedure that these patients are at low risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2 Benefit/risk balance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit/risk balance will be positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the experimental arm of the study will attempt to a strong reduction of&#xD;
      PTS, although the procedure is mastered with limited risk. The fact that investigators&#xD;
      already practice this procedure in everyday practice contributes to reducing this risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the control group will be treated according to the current clinical&#xD;
      practice and national and international recommendations. In case of non-resolution of&#xD;
      symptoms, they will be invited to interventional procedure 6 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, all patients of the study will benefit from a careful follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be supervised to control the benefit/risk balance between the two arms.&#xD;
      Moreover, the choice to propose a delayed endovascular procedure for control group's patients&#xD;
      is primordial because even if the medical treatment is the current clinical practice and&#xD;
      national and international recommendations, endovascular procedure has emerged like key&#xD;
      treatment. So, to avoid the risk that patients refuse study or leave the study if they are&#xD;
      randomized in medical treatment, we propose a 6 months delayed intervention for these&#xD;
      patients. This delay of 6 months is reasonable for the adherence of patients to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these patients, we will have access to results of endovascular procedure at 6 months&#xD;
      after delayed intervention, increasing the pool of data on the effect of endovascular&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Expected Impact&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will highlight the potential benefit of endovascular therapy on post thrombotic&#xD;
      syndrome reduction after proximal iliac DVT. There is actually not real standard of care for&#xD;
      the treatment of this pathology. A clear evidence of efficacy of endovascular therapy will be&#xD;
      of great benefit for both the patients and the healthcare system, and will provide new data&#xD;
      for further international guidelines&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient age ≥ 18 years' old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with disabling PTS defined as a Villalta score ≥ 10, more than 6 months after&#xD;
             unilateral proximal deep vein thrombosis (first or recurrent episode) involving at&#xD;
             least iliac vein. A contralateral distal or superficial vein thrombosis was not&#xD;
             considered as bilateral thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rational for main inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients would be screened more than 6 months after the index DVT event to be sure that&#xD;
        symptoms were related to chronic phase of PTS and not to the acute DVT event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Although endovascular therapy has actually matured to propose a systematic evaluation, the&#xD;
        procedure remains experimental with potential risks. Therefore, the study must focus on&#xD;
        patients with advanced PTS and iliofemoral obstruction, since this population appears to&#xD;
        have the greatest attempted benefit.&#xD;
