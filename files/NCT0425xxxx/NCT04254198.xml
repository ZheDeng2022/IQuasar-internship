  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a multi-level, community-engaged approach to implement &quot;TERTULIAS&quot;&#xD;
      (&quot;conversational gatherings&quot; in Spanish). The intervention uses an innovative, culturally and&#xD;
      contextually situated peer support group design that was developed by the investigators to&#xD;
      improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities for FMI participants in Albuquerque,&#xD;
      New Mexico. The study will use a rigorous, transdisciplinary, QUAL⇒QUANT, mixed-method&#xD;
      research design. The investigators will document results of the intervention on the primary&#xD;
      hypotheses of a decrease in depression, and increases in resilience and social support, as&#xD;
      well as on the secondary hypotheses of decreased stress (including the use of innovative&#xD;
      testing of hair cortisol as a biomarker for chronic stress), and an increase in social&#xD;
      connectedness and positive assessment of knowledge and empowerment gained through the&#xD;
      TERTULIAS intervention.&#xD;

      Specific Aims. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial with 240 FMIs.&#xD;
      Intervention participants will attend a weekly peer group session over 12 months. Control&#xD;
      group participants will receive a bimonthly check-in call. All will be surveyed using&#xD;
      validated instruments and give hair samples gathered at baseline and 12 months. A subset will&#xD;
      be interviewed, and group sessions will be documented. Data will be triangulated using&#xD;
      different methods with a QUAL⇒QUAN simultaneous data collection and analysis approach to&#xD;
      integrate, converge, and elaborate findings in a way that would not be feasible using only&#xD;
      one method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To measure whether a culturally situated peer group intervention will reduce&#xD;
      depression and stress associated with the experience of immigration. Question: Does an&#xD;
      intervention design that reproduces culturally important interactions, activities, and&#xD;
      constructs lost through immigration result in decreased participant depression and stress?&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Incorporating peer-to-peer social interaction, food sharing, and storytelling&#xD;
      into the design of a nonclinical peer support group intervention will leverage positive&#xD;
      aspects of participant culture and create an experiential context that will (a) decrease&#xD;
      participant depression scores by at least 6.5 points more on the Center for Epidemiologic&#xD;
      Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) as compared to controls (effect size Cohen's d = 0.43), and&#xD;
      (b) lower stress scores in participants more than in controls with d ≥ 0.5 as measured by the&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The investigators will also assess stress using a cutting-edge&#xD;
      biological assessment of hair cortisol as a biomarker for chronic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To test whether an intervention using a &quot;women's funds of knowledge&quot; approach results&#xD;
      in improved resilience, knowledge and empowerment. Question: Does an intervention design that&#xD;
      encourages participants to share knowledge they developed through life experience and that&#xD;
      values this knowledge as a form of expertise nurture protective factors (resilience and&#xD;
      knowledge/empowerment) to help FMIs adapt to the immigration context and disrupt the&#xD;
      mechanisms that produce health disparities? Hypothesis: Incorporating, valuing and validating&#xD;
      women's knowledge and experience in the design of a peer support group intervention will&#xD;
      improve participant capacity to adapt to the immigrant context and provide participants with&#xD;
      empowering knowledge to deal with new situations. Intervention participants will have higher&#xD;
      scores at 12 months and have a larger increase over time as compared to controls (d = 0.5) on&#xD;
      the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-25 (CD-RISC 25). Knowledge and empowerment will be&#xD;
      assessed at 12 months and expect to find high scores with the Trauma-Informed Practice (TIP)&#xD;
      Scale (which is designed for post-use).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To investigate whether a culturally situated peer group intervention using a women's&#xD;
      funds of knowledge approach can give participants' a sense and experience of social and&#xD;
      physical connection (&quot;emplacement&quot;) that is lost in the process of immigration. Question: Can&#xD;
      the proposed peer support group intervention recreate social and physical connections lost&#xD;
      through immigration and strengthen participant social networks? Hypothesis: The peer group&#xD;
      will create a culturally appropriate context for establishing interpersonal connections&#xD;
      between group members and will give participants a sense of belonging within a social and&#xD;
      contextual milieu. At study end, (a) experimental participants will have a marked increase in&#xD;
      social support scores v.s. the control group using the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support&#xD;
      Survey (MOS SSS) (d ≥ 0.5), and (b) stronger, more dense social connections as described by a&#xD;
      social network analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Outcomes. This intervention with FMIs will test an innovative intervention to reduce&#xD;
      social isolation as a mechanism for reducing depression by leveraging positive cultural&#xD;
      dynamics and women's funds of knowledge to nurture social connectedness, knowledge, and&#xD;
      resiliency factors in the lives of participants in a transformative way. Generalizability.&#xD;
      This trial of TERTULIAS will create a replicable, scalable model for culturally appropriate&#xD;
      health promotion with FMIs that has implications for health promotion work with other women&#xD;
      from recent and first generation immigrant populations.&#xD;

    <description>Results from the following social network analyses (SNA) of the Intervention arm will be &quot;mapped&quot; using UCINET SNA software: 1.) Construct participants' social networks using answers to questions modeled after the General Social Survey. Baseline and 12-month networks will be compared and changes in network density and characteristics will be described. 2.) The level of inclusion of other study participants in individual social networks from baseline to 12 months will be assessed. 3.) Using questions about local resources (e.g., the health insurance exchange, health navigation programs, public food/benefit/clothing programs and charities, free legal assistance programs, low-cost ESL/GED programs, domestic violence programs, transportation/utilities assistance programs, etc.), changes in each study participant's awareness of, knowledge about, and likelihood of accessing resources will be assessed.</description>

    <description>TERTULIAS will involve structured dialogue groups using the model developed and tested by the investigators through their preliminary research. Each group will have 10 women and will meet weekly for two hours over a 12-month period. Group meetings will be conducted in Spanish, led by a team of two FMI facilitators. Facilitation will use the structured dialogue approach. In the last two months of each cohort, participants will be invited to write their own stories or recipes, or produce poetry or art representing their experience to share with the group. These contributions will be gathered and reproduced in &quot;booklet&quot; form and each participant will receive a copy.</description>
