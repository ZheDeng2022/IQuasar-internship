  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation patients with risk factors for stroke and systemic embolism require&#xD;
      long-term anticoagulant therapy. Recently, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC)&#xD;
      has shown their excellent safety and efficacy, and thus are widely accepted in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Meanwhile, after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using the drug-eluting&#xD;
      stents due to coronary artery disease, the administration of one or more antiplatelets is&#xD;
      essential to prevent the recurrence of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction. Combined&#xD;
      administration of anticoagulants and antiplatelets significantly lowers the incidence of&#xD;
      ischemic events such as stroke and myocardial infarction, however, it also significantly&#xD;
      increases the likelihood of bleeding leading to hospitalization, and or even death, thereby&#xD;
      significantly affecting the clinical course of the AF patients who underwent PCI.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, due to the very high mortality rate of stent thrombosis, the current standard&#xD;
      of care guidelines recommend triple therapy with anticoagulants and double antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy (DAPT) in patients with atrial fibrillation for 1 month after coronary intervention,&#xD;
      followed by co-administration of NOAC with single antiplatelet agent for 1 year. However,&#xD;
      little is known after the optimal therapeutic strategy after 1 year. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to compare the clinical results of single anticoagulant and clopidogrel combination&#xD;
      therapy for maintenance therapy after 1 year in patients with atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

      Atrial fibrillation(AF) patients who had undergone PCI with DES implantation at 12-18 months&#xD;
      ago will be enrolled in this study. Decision for the antiplatelet agent discontinuation would&#xD;
      be determined by randomization. Apixaban would be prescribed to reduced the risk stroke or&#xD;
      systemic embolism evoked by AF, and the administration of Warfarin, a vitamin-K dependent&#xD;
      anticoagulant, would also be allowed according to attending physician's decision. The&#xD;
      following criteria should be followed for the reduction of dosages according to the patient's&#xD;
      renal function and other systemic conditions. Warfarin is administered to patients with&#xD;
      creatinine clearance of 15 ml / min or dialysis. The drugs used in this study correspond to&#xD;
      the international treatment guidelines after coronary intervention in patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation.NOAC and antiplatelet agents would be prescribed upon an outpatient visit.&#xD;
      Clinical outcome would be followed for 2 years after study enrollment and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline Serum AST/ALT level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine clearance (mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concurrent administration of CYP3A4 agents: Ketoconazole, Itraconazole,&#xD;
           Iopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir/ritonavir, conivaptan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose reduction (patients meeting both criteria would be prescribed with Apixaban 2.5 mb bid)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 mL/min â‰¤ eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ESRD patients under 60 kg of bodyweight or age over 80 years old.&#xD;
