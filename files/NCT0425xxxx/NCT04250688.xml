  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of mobility training using the Ekso&#xD;
      robotic exoskeleton with functional electrical stimulation (FES) in persons affected by&#xD;
      spinal cord injury; designated AIS classification A, B, C, or D. Traditionally, a person with&#xD;
      an American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) &quot;A&quot; injury, walking training is&#xD;
      not performed. Even with AIS B, C and D injuries, although walking training may be&#xD;
      appropriate, a person may not walk as much as needed to see an improvement due to&#xD;
      environmental and staff limitations. The Ekso is a tool to give walking training to patients.&#xD;
      The investigators aim to see if utilizing these technologies will affect recovery;&#xD;
      specifically in sensation and muscle activity below the level of the injury as well as the&#xD;
      ability to walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ekso is a wearable, battery- operated exoskeleton that assists with walking. The Ekso has&#xD;
      motors at the hip and knee joints to provide assistance that may be needed with walking. All&#xD;
      motion is initiated either through body weight shifts or the use of an external controller.&#xD;
      The Ekso robotic exoskeleton has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a&#xD;
      powered exercise device for rehabilitative purposes such as this study. Currently, the Ekso&#xD;
      is approved for people with spinal cord injuries from T4-L5 given bilateral arm strength of&#xD;
      4/5. With injuries from C7-T3, individuals must have AIS classification of D with bilateral&#xD;
      arm strength of 4/5. For this study, it is possible that Ekso GT will be used outside of the&#xD;
      current FDA approval if the injury level is C7-T3 and the person is classified as an AIS A, B&#xD;
      or C injury level. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) will be used in conjunction with&#xD;
      the robotic exoskeleton. FES involves using surface electrodes placed on the skin like a&#xD;
      sticker over key leg muscles that will be stimulated in the normal walking pattern as a&#xD;
      person walks in the device.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of mobility training using the Ekso&#xD;
      robotic exoskeleton with functional electrical stimulation (FES) on neural recovery in&#xD;
      individuals with acute spinal cord injury with American Spinal Injury Association Impairment&#xD;
      Scale (AIS) neurologic classification A, B, C or D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, individuals with acute SCI in the inpatient rehabilitation setting improve&#xD;
      their AIS score after mobility training with the Ekso-FES compared to a control intervention&#xD;
      period?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will analyze the influence of training performed early or&#xD;
      later in acute rehabilitation phase on muscle properties, neural recovery and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational clinical study trialing the efficacy of the Ekso device with FES&#xD;
      in the acute SCI population. Participants with a diagnosis of spinal cord injury classified&#xD;
      as AIS A, B, C or D will be included. Up to ten participants will be recruited to participate&#xD;
      in this study. This number was arbitrarily chosen as this is an investigational study and&#xD;
      there is no previous data on the Ekso device to specifically select subject number based on a&#xD;
      power analysis. Participants will be recruited from inpatient units at The Shirley Ryan&#xD;
      AbilityLab. Following screening, all subjects will be required to receive medical clearance&#xD;
      from their attending inpatient physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to which order they receive the Ekso intervention (A) and control&#xD;
      (B) period (A then B or B then A). The device will be used in the lab and there will be no&#xD;
      charge associated with use of the Ekso device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants involved in the investigational study/training will be screened according to&#xD;
      general inclusion/exclusion criteria after obtaining informed consent and before using the&#xD;
      Ekso device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Range of Motion (ROM): Range of motion of the joints of the upper and lower extremities&#xD;
           will be measured using a goniometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle strength testing: upper and lower extremity manual muscle testing to determine&#xD;
           qualification for study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS): The Modified Ashworth Scale is a 6 point ordinal scale&#xD;
           used to grade the amount of hypertonicity in individuals with neurological diagnoses. A&#xD;
           score of 0 on the scale indicates no increase in tone while a score of 4 indicates&#xD;
           rigidity. Tone is scored by passively moving the individual's limb and assessing the&#xD;
           amount of resistance to movement felt by the examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper and lower leg length and hip measurements will be performed to determine safe fit&#xD;
           in the exoskeleton device.&#xD;

    <description>The goal is to cover as much ground as possible over 6 minutes, the distance is measured with a measuring wheel. The minimum score is zero feet walked, there is no maximum score and the participant will be scored by how far they can walk in 6 minutes. The farther they walk, the better the score. The instructions are &quot;Walk continuously if possible, but do not be concerned if you need to slow down or stop to rest.&quot; At the end of 6 minutes the participant is asked to rate their exertion level on a Borg Scale of 6 - 20 points.</description>
