  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is cross-sectional using a self-completion questionnaire in an English&#xD;
      speaking multi-ethic population within Leicester and Leicestershire. The study will adopt a&#xD;
      convenient and purposive sampling recruitment strategy across a variety of settings within&#xD;
      Leicestershire to facilitate recruitment of a wide range of participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well reported that lifestyle behaviours can play a significant role in health,&#xD;
      contributing towards chronic disease and mortality. The World Health Organisation (WHO)&#xD;
      describes behavioural risk factors as 'the epidemic of the 21st Century', defining a&#xD;
      strategic objective to not only promote health and development, but to prevent and reduce&#xD;
      health conditions associated with behavioural risk factors such as smoking, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, unhealthy diets and poor physical activity (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In England, reports by the Department of Health (DoH) have identified significant concerns in&#xD;
      national attitudes towards health stating that 60% of the adult population hold a negative or&#xD;
      fatalistic attitude towards their own health, and that these attitudes are particularly&#xD;
      prominent in disadvantaged groups (2). This has been corroborated in recent statistics&#xD;
      published this year by Public Health England (PHE) comparing the health status in local&#xD;
      authorities with that of the wider population, reporting that in the total for England, 15.5%&#xD;
      of the population are active smokers, 35.1% are not physically active (a figure likely to be&#xD;
      much higher with the use of objective measures), and 64.8% demonstrate excessive body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When comparing Leicester (reported as one of the 20% most deprived districts in the UK) with&#xD;
      this national average, smoking and weight statistics are seen as on par with the wider&#xD;
      population benchmark, with significantly lower levels of physical activity (50%),&#xD;
      significantly higher rates of reported diabetes (8.9%), and significantly lower life&#xD;
      expectancy in both men and women (77.1 and 81.6 years) (3). Leicester is an ethnically&#xD;
      diverse city, with a high population of South Asians, who have been shown to be substantially&#xD;
      less physically active compared to the national average (4-6), which may contribute to the&#xD;
      statistics seen in the city's public health profile. When looking at the same health report&#xD;
      for Leicestershire county, reported as one of the 20% least deprived counties in England, the&#xD;
      statistics demonstrate that the health of people is proportionally better than that of the&#xD;
      wider population average, with only recorded diabetes shown as below the England average, and&#xD;
      all other factors reported as either the same or significantly better in comparison,&#xD;
      highlighting the potential impact of socioeconomic disparity in health outcomes (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important lifestyle behaviour that is can often be discounted when considering health&#xD;
      statistics is sleep and chronotype. Insufficient sleep has been shown to have significant&#xD;
      impacts on physical health with multiple large meta-analyses demonstrating associations with&#xD;
      obesity and cardiometabolic disease (8-11). These findings have been corroborated by large UK&#xD;
      surveys demonstrating that inadequate sleep is associated with increased BMI and poor&#xD;
      metabolic profiles (12), as well as increased cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (13). A longitudinal study in the UK also demonstrated links between insufficient sleep with&#xD;
      psychological health problems including depression, anxiety and increased experiences of pain&#xD;
      (14). An individual's chronotype, understood as a behavioural trait determined by their&#xD;
      circadian rhythm to be either morning- or evening orientated, has shown a number of&#xD;
      associated health implications. Research has shown that being a &quot;night owl&quot;, as opposed to an&#xD;
      &quot;early bird&quot;, increases the likelihood of a number of physical and psychological health&#xD;
      concerns including mood and anxiety disorders, personality disorders, substance misuse,&#xD;
      insomnia, sleep apnoea, arterial hypertension, bronchial asthma, type 2 diabetes, and&#xD;
      infertility, with an overall lower mortality (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there has been extensive data on the impact of single lifestyle behaviours on disease&#xD;
      related outcomes and mortality, the evidence on combined effects of lifestyle behaviours has&#xD;
      not received the same attention, although the available data is compelling. In a systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis exploring lifestyle factors related to all-cause mortality&#xD;
      comprising of 531,804 participants spanning 13.24 years, it was shown that the relative risk&#xD;
      was proportionally reduced by 66% with at least four or more healthy lifestyle behaviours&#xD;
      (16). In a large UK study exploring the impact of combined health behaviours on mortality, it&#xD;
      was shown that smoking status, dietary intake, alcohol consumption and physical activity,&#xD;
      when combined, increased risk of mortality four-fold, with demonstrable trends seen as&#xD;
      strongest in cardiovascular causes (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tendency for behaviours to cumulatively increase or decrease risk has important&#xD;
      implications for health promotion and prevention strategies with further exploration needed&#xD;
      to understand and define these. It is also important to examine these factors within a&#xD;
      multiethnic population, so as to be able to ensure that any data collected is reflective of&#xD;
      the diversity in society and that any conclusions made have validity to appropriate inform&#xD;
      health reform, as per the DoH's Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care&#xD;
      (18). The current study aims to explore the clustering of lifestyle behaviours in a&#xD;
      multi-ethnic population within Leicester City and Leicestershire County, in both primary and&#xD;
      secondary care settings, to understand how lifestyle behaviours present, cumulate, impact&#xD;
      upon, and associate with other behaviours and socio-demographic factors in both a healthy&#xD;
      population and those with long-term conditions (LTCs).&#xD;
