  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction. Shoulder injury is the pathology that causes the longest downtime in rugby&#xD;
      players, representing 66% of upper limb injuries in this discipline. The lack of strength,&#xD;
      and instability are factors that predispose the athlete to suffer this type of dysfunction.&#xD;
      The intervention of the study consists of a training program that counteract these&#xD;
      dysfunctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. Assess the effectiveness of a program using plyometric, proprioceptive and strength&#xD;
      exercises on 18-45-year-old rugby players to improve strength and stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. Clinical randomized, prospective, single-blind and trackable. Methods. The&#xD;
      subjects included in two study groups, experimental and control, will be attributed a random&#xD;
      order. The treatment will last 4 weeks, with 2 weekly sessions, of approximately 25 minutes&#xD;
      each. The study variables will be strength, stability and functionality. A descriptive&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be carried out calculating the main statistical characteristics.&#xD;
      Through of a Kolmogorov analysis the normality of the sample will be assessed. A t-Student&#xD;
      test for paired samples will be performed for the difference between the means of the&#xD;
      dependent and independent variables. An analysis if variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures&#xD;
      will be used to compare the means and checked to what extent the intra-subjects factors&#xD;
      influence the dependent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. Improved shoulder strength, stability and functionality for the subjects on&#xD;
      which the study is carried out.&#xD;

    <description>The strength assessment will be carried out with a dynamometer. The subject will stand up and the examiner will indicate when the movement should begin. The dynamometer will be positioned to measure the strength of the shoulder abductors and rotators in the position of 90º of abduction and 90º of external rotation. The unit of measure is the Newton</description>

    <description>It will be assessed with the Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test. The initial position of the test is a push-up position with the upper extremities perpendicular to the ground. We will use two strips of 3.80 cm tape stuck on the floor and separated 91.44cm apart. The subjects will carry one of the hands until they touch the other strip of tape and return to the initial position. The touches will be counted every time one of the tape strips is touched in a total time of 15 seconds. Each subject will perform a warm-up, followed by 3 attempts with a break between attempts, of 45 seconds, averaging the 3 data obtained.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after one month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment will be carried out with the Simple Shoulder Test. This test is a questionnaire of 12 questions, with two answer options: yes (when the subject is able to perform the task) and no (when he is not able to do it). The results obtained have a scoring range from 0 to 12, with 0 being the lowest functionality and 12 being the highest.</description>

    <description>Exercise 1 with medicine ball. Standing player with 90º shoulder abduction and elbow flexion. He will receive the ball with an external rotation returning it with internal rotation. Exercise 2 with elastic band. From standing, he will fix the elastic band with his foot and perform a shoulder flexion with his contralateral limb. Exercise 3 of iron with support of the hands on the floor and shoulder, elbow and wrist aligned. You should perform a scapula approach and separation without altering its initial position. Exercise 4 BodyBlade ©. From standing with 90º of 90 ° shoulder abduction and elbow flexion. It will perform an anteroposterior thrust, causing a wave effect to stabilize the shoulder joint for 30 seconds.&#xD;
Athletes will do 15 repetitions of each exercise.</description>
