    <textblock>
      This study will test the effects of a sedentary behavior intervention on pain processing,&#xD;
      blood bio-markers and pain symptoms in individuals with chronic low back pain. The behavioral&#xD;
      intervention will include a wrist-worn activity monitor that will notify participants when&#xD;
      they have been sedentary for too long, motivational interviewing, and habit development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a prevalent and costly condition that is associated with&#xD;
      substantial individual and societal burden. Exercise is a recommended behavioral treatment&#xD;
      but adherence to regular exercise is frequently low in individuals with cLBP, so research of&#xD;
      the utility of other behavioral treatments is needed. Previous research suggests that&#xD;
      reducing sitting time (or sedentary time) may improve symptoms of back pain and be beneficial&#xD;
      in treating chronic low back pain. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the utility&#xD;
      of a theory-based intervention to reduce sedentary time (Sedentary-intervention Utilizing&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing and Technology, or 'SUMIT') in individuals with cLBP. Specifically,&#xD;
      the primary aim of this study is to examine the utility of SUMIT on sedentary behaviors in&#xD;
      individuals with cLBP and elevated symptoms of depression. Secondary aims are to determine&#xD;
      how SUMIT influences mood, pain symptoms, and pain psychophysics, and to quantify cytokine&#xD;
      and endocannabinoid responses to acute exercise across the intervention. To test this,&#xD;
      individuals with cLBP will either be randomized into an intervention group (n=20) or a&#xD;
      wait-list control group (n=20). Additionally, healthy adults (n=20) without cLBP will be&#xD;
      enrolled to serve as a pain-free control group and will not receive the intervention. All&#xD;
      participants will complete baseline assessments, enroll in an 8-week intervention period,&#xD;
      return for final assessments and a 3-month follow up. Over the intervention period, those in&#xD;
      the intervention group will be provided with a wrist-worn activity monitor that vibrates&#xD;
      after prolonged sedentariness and a behavioral intervention utilizing motivational&#xD;
      interviewing and education surrounding sitting habits and strategies for new habit&#xD;
      development. Individuals in the cLBP wait-list control group and pain-free control group will&#xD;
      be asked to maintain current physical activity levels, sedentary behaviors, and medication&#xD;
      and/or treatment for low back pain during this period. The investigators hypothesize that 1)&#xD;
      objectively-monitored prolonged sedentary behavior will decrease across SUMIT and be&#xD;
      maintained at follow-up, 2) cLBP symptoms, mood-related symptoms, and pain psychophysics (e.g&#xD;
      pain regulation and modulation) will improve across SUMIT with maintenance of changes at&#xD;
      follow-up, and 3) in response to acute exercise, cytokine and endocannabinoid responses&#xD;
      post-SUMIT will become more similar to those of controls. If effective, this scalable&#xD;
      intervention could be implemented as a behavioral treatment for cLBP.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline monitor-assessed sedentary time at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and immediately following intervention (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Average daily sedentary time in bouts longer than 60 minutes assessed using thigh worn activPAL monitors. The activPAL classifies time into sedentary, upright and stepping, has been validated for measuring free-living sedentary behaviors and is sensitive to changes in these behaviors.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, immediately following intervention (8 weeks), and 3-months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), consisting of 9 questions, will be used for participants to report the presence and severity of depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks. PHQ-9 total score for the nine items ranges from 0 to 27. Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent cutpoints for mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression, respectively.</description>

    <description>The Minimal Dataset for Low Back Pain will be used for participants to report current symptoms of low back pain and impact on daily life. On this questionnaire, for each item a score of 1 is least severe and 5 most severe, with the exception of the single item on pain intensity, which ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Total scores range from 8 (least impact) to 50 (most impact).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) scores at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, immediately following intervention, and 3-months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a patient health and quality of life questionnaire consisting of 36 questions with the following sections: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health.The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability, so a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Profile of Mood States Short Form scores at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, immediately following intervention, and 3-months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This measure asks 36 questions and assesses different dimensions of mood, including: tension, anger, vigor, fatigue, depression, and confusion. Participants rate the extent to which adjectives describe them during the past week using a 1-5 Likert scale. Totals are created for each subscale (Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue, Confusion, and Vigor), with higher ratings indicating greater levels of that subscale. Total Mood Disturbance is calculated by adding the first 5 subscales and then subtracting Vigor, with higher scores indicating greater mood disturbance.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline self-reported sedentary time at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, immediately following intervention, and 3-months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SIT Q 7d will be used for participants to recall their sedentary time over the past 7 days in different domains, including eating meals, transportation, occupation, screen-time, and other. Participants report levels of sitting in each domain, with higher amounts indicated great total sedentary time.</description>
