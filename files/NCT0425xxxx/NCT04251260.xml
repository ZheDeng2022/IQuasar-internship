      Introduction: When babies are born prematurely, they are deprived of their usual space limits&#xD;
      (uterus walls). This along with the action of gravity to which they are exposed after birth,&#xD;
      makes the neonates have a low muscle tone, acquire a posture of extension, being more&#xD;
      irritable and having difficulties with their alertness-sleep cycle. There are few studies&#xD;
      that have assessed the effectiveness of positioning of premature neonates. However, none of&#xD;
      these studies has focused on exploring the effects of positioning on the patterns of movement&#xD;
      and gross motor function of the pre-term neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of positioning on the patterns of&#xD;
      movement, gross motor development and physiological clinical outcomes of pre-term neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A sample of pre-term neonates of ≤ 32 weeks of gestation from the Neonatal Intensive&#xD;
      Care Unit (NICU) of the General University Hospital of Patras will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      two groups. The intervention group will receive positioning with Snuggle up (Philips, USA),&#xD;
      while the control group will receive usual care. Outcomes will be assessed with the general&#xD;
      movements of Prechtl and the Denver II scale at baseline and at term-age of each neonate.&#xD;
      Physiological outcomes will be also assessed such as heart rate, respiratory rate, weight&#xD;
      gained from baseline to term-age, days to achieve full oral feeding, days on the ventilator,&#xD;
      days on oxygen, and duration of stay in the NICU. Basic characteristics of the neonates will&#xD;
      be obtained from their medical record, i.e. weeks of gestation at birth, gender, type of&#xD;
      birth (normal or Caesarian), weight at birth, and Αpgar score and will be used to compare the&#xD;
      2 groups for similarities at the baseline of the trial.&#xD;

      Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NICU provides a sensory overload through excessive handling, noisy environment, neglected&#xD;
      cry, prolonged sleep state and social interactions of the newborns with the professionals.&#xD;
      All these make difficult the internal organization of the preterm neonate (Pereira et al,&#xD;
      2013). Also, when babies are born prematurely, their muscles have not yet acquired the&#xD;
      appropriate tone which is normally low compared to the muscle tone of full-term neonates.&#xD;
      With the deprivation of their usual space limits (uterus walls) and the action of gravity to&#xD;
      which the neonates are exposed after birth, the preterm neonates acquire a posture of&#xD;
      extension, which is contrary to the flexion they usually adopt in the uterus. This extension&#xD;
      position does not help the flexion of their limbs and makes the hand-mouth activities and&#xD;
      meeting the middle line difficult. Further, the deprivation of the physical rhythms of the&#xD;
      neonates' usual space creates insecurity, irritability, increased extensive motor activity&#xD;
      and difficulties with respiration and alertness-sleep cycle (Toso et al, 2015; Zarem et al,&#xD;
      2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that investigated the effectiveness of&#xD;
      positioning on the general condition and ability to be fed of 100 neonates (≤ 32 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation). This study compared a positioning using the Dandle Roo (DandleLion Medical) with&#xD;
      traditional or other positioning (e.g. rolls of sheets, snuggle up) (Madlinger-Lewis et al,&#xD;
      2013). At term-age, a significant difference was found between the two groups, favoring the&#xD;
      Dandle Roo positioning, in the movements symmetry as assessed with the NICU Network&#xD;
      Neurobehavioral Scale (mean difference: 0.90, 95% confidence intervals: 0.05 to 1.75). No&#xD;
      other significant differences were observed at rest of outcomes. Another RCT including 56&#xD;
      preterm neonates (27-32 weeks of gestation) explored the effects of positioning with the&#xD;
      Snuggle up and Bendy Pumpers (Philips, USA) in comparison to traditional positioning (rolls&#xD;
      of soft fabric). The results showed a significant difference between the two groups, favoring&#xD;
      the intervention group, in respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, score of cardiovascular&#xD;
      stability, and weight gain (p&lt;0.5) (Sathish et al, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, none of these previous studies has investigated any differences in the patterns of&#xD;
      movement of the pre-term neonates after a positioning intervention. For example, no study has&#xD;
      assessed the gross motor function of the pre-term neonates using the general movements of&#xD;
      Prechtl after a positioning intervention, although this assessment is considered important&#xD;
      for the prognosis of the motor development and ability for independence of these children&#xD;
      (Einspieler et al, 2016). No previous study has also assessed the effect of positioning in&#xD;
      the long-term neuro-developmental progress of pre-term children with scales such as the&#xD;
      Denver II scale, which scale is also important for the prognosis of the development of the&#xD;
      neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trial aims at exploring the effectiveness of positioning in a &quot;flexion&quot; position&#xD;
      on the movement and clinical outcome of neonates (≤32 weeks of gestation), which group of&#xD;
      neonates is a high-risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: neonates of 32 weeks of gestation or less. Exclusion criteria: neonates&#xD;
      with congenital deformities, genetic anomalies, or neurological deficits detected at 1st week&#xD;
      post-natal, neonates of multiple birth (triplets and over) or breech deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of neonates will be randomly assigned using a concealed method (sealed envelopes)&#xD;
      either to positioning (intervention group) or to usual care (control group). In order to&#xD;
      maintain similar gestational ages throughout the two groups, participants will be stratified&#xD;
      by gestational age (≤28 weeks and &gt;28 weeks). Each stratum will have an independent&#xD;
      randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will be positioned in flexion (lower limbs in flexion, hands in&#xD;
      midline) with a positioning aid, the Snuggle up (Philips, USA). With positioning, the&#xD;
      neonates bottom is tucked down in the snuggle up pocket, legs are aligned and gently flexed&#xD;
      and hands are placed towards midline and near the face. The control group will not receive&#xD;
      any positioning in flexion and the neonates will lie as usually. This study has been approved&#xD;
      by the Research Committee of the General University General Hospital of Patra (decision: 246,&#xD;
      date: 09/04/2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors that may affect the neonates' condition should be controlled, and be similar to both&#xD;
      groups of neonates. Such factors are light, noise, temperature of room (incubator), touching&#xD;
      from nursing staff or others etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive positioning during day and night throughout the&#xD;
      intervention period. Neonates may be removed from positioning when a nurse or mother needs to&#xD;
      feed them, that is a period that will not last more than 1 hour/day. The principal&#xD;
      investigator (TB) will demonstrate the positioning to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)&#xD;
      nursing staff, and will check each week during the intervention period the positioning of the&#xD;
      neonates as well as will reply to any questions of the staff. The physiological status&#xD;
      (normal functioning) of the neonates will be checked regularly by the neonatologist in charge&#xD;
      and the nurses of the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Assessments of the 2 groups (intervention and control group) will take place at&#xD;
      baseline and again at term-age of each neonate. For assessment, the General Movements (GM's)&#xD;
      of Prechtl (Einspieler et al, 2016) using 5-minute video observations of each neonate will be&#xD;
      used. The GM's assessment is a non-invasive assessment and can be used from birth up to 5&#xD;
      months. In this study, the detailed GM's assessment will be conducted by two pediatric&#xD;
      physiotherapists, independently. The two assessors have a long-lasting experience in&#xD;
      assessing/treating small children and infants and will be blind to which group the neonates&#xD;
      will be assigned. There is evidence that the GM's (total score) demonstrate high test-retest&#xD;
      reliability with Intra-class Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) or Pearson coefficients&#xD;
      exceeding 0.84 (Yeh et al, 2016), while there were lower correlation coefficients during the&#xD;
      initial period of writhing movements (6-8 weeks post-natal). A significant amount of&#xD;
      test-retest reliability was also found for each sub-category of the Detailed GM's assessment&#xD;
      with ICCS exceeding 0.80, except for the assessment of &quot;speed&quot; (ICC: 0.51) (Yeh et al, 2016).&#xD;
      Evidence of moderate to good intra-tester reliability has also been demonstrated (kappa&#xD;
      coefficient: 0.44-0.63) (Bernhardt et al, 2011), and 97-100% agreement between raters for the&#xD;
      GM's total score. Assessment will also be performed with the Denver II scale (at term-age and&#xD;
      4 months of corrected age). This scale has shown a significant amount of validity for&#xD;
      assessing the neuro-developmental progress of babies and infants. The assessment with the&#xD;
      Denver II scale will be performed by a neonatologist of the NICU, who will be blind to the&#xD;
      neonates' assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator will film all the videos at baseline and at post-intervention (at&#xD;
      term-age for each neonate). Video recording will follow a typical method of observation of&#xD;
      the GM's, and each video will have a 5-minute duration for a more reliable observation of the&#xD;
      movement of each neonate. Video recording will take place at least 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      neonate is fed and during periods in which the neonate is awake and is moving. Other&#xD;
      parameters that will be examined at baseline and post-intervention are the heart rate,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, weight gained from baseline to post-intervention, days to achieve full oral&#xD;
      feeding, days on the ventilator, days on oxygen, and duration of stay in the NICU.&#xD;
      Demographics and basic characteristics of the neonates will be recorded such as weeks of&#xD;
      gestation at birth, gender, type of birth (normal or Caesarian), weight at birth, and Αpgar&#xD;
      score to compare the 2 groups for similarities at the baseline of the trial. These data will&#xD;
      be obtained from the neonates' medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written information about the study will be provided to the neonates' parents and written&#xD;
      consent will be asked from either the mother or father (or the guardian of the neonate)&#xD;
      before the neonate enters the trial. Detailed information will be also provided to all the&#xD;
      staff of the NICU involved in the study. A code number will be given to each neonate to&#xD;
      maintain his/her anonymity, during data analysis and dissemination of results. Babies videos&#xD;
      needed for assessment will not be accessible from internet or other sharing mediums.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video recording The neonate will lie on his/her back in the incubator, with no clothes and&#xD;
      dressed only with a diaper. The surface of the incubator should be flat and of plain color&#xD;
      (e.g. white) with no patterns etc. to avoid interference with accurate scoring in movement&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neonate should be in a calm state, not irritated and not sleeping either. If the baby is&#xD;
      crying and is unsettled it will be difficult to film, therefore, in this case the filming&#xD;
      will be postponed and completed at an alternative time. It is best that the neonate cannot&#xD;
      see the nurse or other person except for the person filming as this may attract the baby's&#xD;
      attention. No dummies or toys should be used and no interaction with the neonate by talking&#xD;
      or touching throughout the video recording period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple camera on a tripod (height 1.5 meters), will be placed next to the incubator and&#xD;
      above the neonate at an angle so that the neonate can be seen in the frame (including his/her&#xD;
      feet and hands). As afore-mentioned, 5-minute videos will be recorded twice (at the beginning&#xD;
      and at term-age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will initially be presented using mean and standard deviation (descriptive data). For&#xD;
      comparisons between the intervention and control group, the ANOVA and independent t-test will&#xD;
      be used (SPSS). Differences will be considered statistically significant when p value is&#xD;
      &lt;0.5.&#xD;
