  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will look at a drug called SEA-TGT (also known as SGN-TGT) to find out whether it&#xD;
      is safe for patients with solid tumors and lymphomas. It will study SEA-TGT to find out what&#xD;
      its side effects are. A side effect is anything the drug does besides treating cancer. It&#xD;
      will also study whether SEA-TGT works to treat solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have three parts. Part A of the study will find out how much SEA-TGT should be&#xD;
      given to patients. Part B will use the dose found in Part A to find out how safe SEA-TGT is&#xD;
      and if it works to treat solid tumors and lymphomas. Part C will study how well SEA-TGT with&#xD;
      sasanlimab works to treat solid tumors.&#xD;
