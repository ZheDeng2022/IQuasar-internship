  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to identify the optimal exercise intensity of the&#xD;
      high-intensity phase during a bout of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) to increase&#xD;
      glucose clearance in a prediabetic population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a within-subjects randomised crossover design with participants attending the&#xD;
      laboratory on seven occasions over a two week period. The first visit will be to perform&#xD;
      medical screening and to obtain informed consent. The second visit will be to collect&#xD;
      baseline measures, select meal plans, to collect an activity tracker and to complete a ramped&#xD;
      exercise test to establish exercise intensity thresholds. The third visit will be to fit an&#xD;
      interstitial glucose sensor and to collect the standardised meals which will be provided to&#xD;
      each participant. Visits four, five, and six will be the experimental trials. The seventh&#xD;
      visit will be to remove the interstitial glucose sensor and return the activity tracker.&#xD;

      Recruitment Recruitment 12 men will be recruited through Church and Borth GP Surgeries in&#xD;
      Aberystwyth. Patients attending GP appointments who are considered to be at risk of&#xD;
      developing diabetes will have a blood sample taken as part of usual care, this sample will be&#xD;
      analysed for HbA1c. If the HbA1c value is between 42 and 47 mmol·mol-1 the patient is&#xD;
      considered to be prediabetic. Usual care for this group would be to inform the newly&#xD;
      diagnosed patient by letter of the test result and provide information on diet and exercise&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of developing T2DM. Patients who have had an HbA1c value of between 42 and&#xD;
      47 mmol·mol-1 during the previous 12 months will be identified by the surgery who will then&#xD;
      contact the patient by post with details of the study, including contact information for the&#xD;
      research team. The research team will have no contact with the patient unless they make&#xD;
      contact to request more information. Additionally, posters will be placed around Aberystwyth&#xD;
      University campus, Aberystwyth town, and an email will be sent to IBERS and university staff,&#xD;
      as well as using social media networks including the WARU (https://waru.org.uk/cms/) Facebook&#xD;
      and Twitter accounts. Potential participants, not recruited through their GP surgery, but who&#xD;
      have been diagnosed with prediabetes can contact the research team to express their interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following contact expressing an interest in participation, the research team will provide the&#xD;
      individual with the participant information sheet via email or post. If having received, and&#xD;
      read, the participant information the individual is still interested in becoming involved in&#xD;
      the study there contact details will also be passed onto the Cardiology Department of&#xD;
      Bronglais General Hospital. Consent will be obtained prior to contact information being&#xD;
      shared. An appointment will then be arranged between the cardiologist and participant for the&#xD;
      first visit, the chief investigator will also attend this first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit One On arrival at the local hospital, participants will be given a detailed verbal&#xD;
      explanation of the study protocol by the chief investigator, which will explain the purpose&#xD;
      of the study and explicitly state what is required of them. The participant will also have&#xD;
      the opportunity to ask questions about the study and will be informed of their right to&#xD;
      withdraw without the need of an explanation. They will then give written informed consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Once consent has been given, participants will then be asked to&#xD;
      complete a health screening questionnaire. Following this, the participant will complete an&#xD;
      exercise stress test with continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, using the 'Bruce&#xD;
      protocol', which will be examined for an indication of cardiovascular disease. If the&#xD;
      participant is excluded from the study based on their ECG results, they will be informed by&#xD;
      the cardiologist who will then inform their GP. If the participant is not excluded at this&#xD;
      stage, a date and time for the second visit will be arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit Two On arrival the participant will be given the opportunity to ask for clarification&#xD;
      on any aspect of the study and their involvement, they will also be reminded of the right to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study. The participant will sit for 10 minutes before blood pressure (Omron&#xD;
      M2 Basic, Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor, Milton Keynes, UK) height (Harpenden Stadiometer,&#xD;
      Holtain Ltd; Crymych, UK) body mass (Tanita, Body Composition Analyzer, DC-430MA, Amsterdam,&#xD;
      Netherlands) and waist circumference (Rollfix, Hoechstmass, West Germany) are recorded and&#xD;
      Body Mass Index (BMI) calculated. A fingertip blood sample will be taken and analysed for&#xD;
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood lipid profile (Alere Afinion AS100, Abbott, Cheshire,&#xD;
      UK). Participants will then complete a maximal exercise test which will involve completion of&#xD;
      a 'ramp' test performed on a cycle ergometer (Lode Excaliber sport V2, Lode BV, Gronigen,&#xD;
      Netherlands) to determine VO2peak and Gas Exchange Threshold (GET). The ergometer will be&#xD;
      adjusted so that each subject is comfortable, and the settings will be recorded and&#xD;
      replicated during all subsequent exercise tests. The test will involve three minutes of&#xD;
      pedaling at 0 W, followed by a continuous ramped increase in work rate of 15 W·min-1.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to maintain a cadence of 65 ± 5 r.p.m. throughout the test.&#xD;
      When the participant can no longer maintain ≥ 55 r.p.m., despite verbal encouragement, the&#xD;
      test will be terminated. Throughout the test, heart rate (HR) will be recorded via short wave&#xD;
      telemetry (Polar, S610i, Kempele, Finland). Pulmonary gas exchange and ventilation will be&#xD;
      measured breath-by-breath, (COSMED Quark CPET, COSMED srl, Rome; Italy). The gas analysers&#xD;
      will be calibrated before each test with gases of known concentration, and the turbine volume&#xD;
      transducer will be calibrated using a three-liter syringe. VO2peak will be determined as the&#xD;
      highest VO2 measured over 30 seconds and GET will be determined using the V-slope method&#xD;
      (Beaver et al. 1986) as the first disproportionate increase in carbon dioxide output (VCO2)&#xD;
      relative to VO2. The work rate corresponding to 105% of VO2peak, and 50%∆ of GET, which is&#xD;
      50% of the difference between GET and VO2peak, will be calculated using linear regression of&#xD;
      VO2 versus work rate with account taken of the lag in VO2 relative to work rate that exists&#xD;
      during ramp incremental exercise (Whipp et al. 1981). On the completion of exercise, the&#xD;
      participants will be provided with a menu from which they will choose five meals (two&#xD;
      breakfasts, one lunch and two dinners) to eat prior to and following each of the three&#xD;
      experimental trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, participants will be given an ActiGraph activity tracker and instructions on its&#xD;
      use. The tracker will be worn by the participant for a two and a half day period during each&#xD;
      of the three experimental trials; the day before a trial from waking, the day of the trial&#xD;
      until retiring to bed, and the day following the trial from waking until two-hour post second&#xD;
      carbohydrate (CHO) load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit Three Visit three will take place the day before the first experimental trial. The&#xD;
      participant will arrive prior to 2:00 pm to collect their meals. While participants can vary&#xD;
      the content of the meals either side of a trial, the meals will be duplicated in content and&#xD;
      time of consumption for each of the three experimental trials. To aid the participant a&#xD;
      schedule of meals and trials will be completed and provided with the meals. This schedule&#xD;
      will be used for participants to record any additional food intake, including snacks, that&#xD;
      are consumed prior to and following the first experimental trial so that they can be&#xD;
      replicated for the subsequent trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit the participant will also be fitted with a FreeStyle Libre sensor&#xD;
      (FreeStyle Libre Sensor, Flash Glucose Monitoring System, Abbott Laboratories LTD.,&#xD;
      Maidenhead; Berkshire), and will be shown how to use the reader. The FreeStyle Libre sensor&#xD;
      is a 14-day continuous personal glucose monitoring system which logs interstitial glucose&#xD;
      levels, the sensor is fitted to the non-dominant upper arm for the duration of the study. The&#xD;
      sensor consists of a small disc, approximately the size of a £2 coin, 5 mm in height and 35&#xD;
      mm in diameter (Abbott, 2018), with an adhesive to attach the sensor to the participant,&#xD;
      there is also a small filament, approximately 0.4 mm thick and 5mm in height, which measures&#xD;
      the interstitial glucose levels (FreeStyle, 2016). Participants will be instructed to scan&#xD;
      the sensor either before each meal or every eight-hours, and also before they fall asleep and&#xD;
      as soon as they wake up. Once the sensor is scanned, the data are transferred onto the reader&#xD;
      and shows the trend of the interstitial glucose levels for the past eight-hours, and will&#xD;
      store these data for up to 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits Four - Six Participants will attend the laboratory on each of these occasions at the&#xD;
      same time of day to minimise diurnal variation. The participants will have consumed the&#xD;
      provided breakfast at least an hour prior to arriving at the laboratory. On arrival&#xD;
      participants will be seated for 10 min before blood pressure is recorded and a venous blood&#xD;
      sample drawn from the antecubital vein using a 21-gauge precision needle (Becton-Dickinson,&#xD;
      Oxford, UK). Blood will be collected into a 6 mL K2EDTA-treated vacutainer tube (BD&#xD;
      Vacutainer Systems, Plymouth, UK). 1.5 µl of whole blood will be transferred directly from&#xD;
      the vacutainer into a lipid test cartridge and assayed immediately on the Alere Afinion AS100&#xD;
      POC analyser (Abbott, Illinois, United States). A further 1.0 µl of whole blood will be&#xD;
      assayed immediately for glucose and lactate (2300 Stat Plus, YSI, Yellow Springs, USA). The&#xD;
      remaining blood will be centrifuged at 1500xg for 10 min at 4°C, the plasma will be pipetted&#xD;
      into polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) before being stored at&#xD;
      -80°C for later analysis (insulin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform each of the three different conditions once over the duration of&#xD;
      the study. The experimental conditions will be performed in random order, determined by&#xD;
      WinPepi for Windows, with each of the experimental trials being separated by five days. The&#xD;
      three conditions are; completing ten intervals at a work rate which equates to 105% of&#xD;
      VO2peak with a 1:1 work rest ratio, completing ten intervals at a work rate which equates to&#xD;
      50% ∆ GET, with a 1:1 work rest ratio, and a Control (CON) session with no exercise. Recovery&#xD;
      in each of the exercise trials will involve free cycling against no resistance. The duration&#xD;
      of the interval and recovery periods will vary between trials so that the total work done&#xD;
      during each trial, excluding CON, will be the same, the duration of intervals will be&#xD;
      determined by the 50% ∆ trial which will be set at 60 s for work and recovery intervals. Each&#xD;
      of the exercise trials will be preceded and followed by a five-minute warm-up and cool-down&#xD;
      at a workload of 30 W. Participants will be able to drink tap water ad libitum before, during&#xD;
      and after the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the exercise trials, the participants will be asked to report their Rating Perceived&#xD;
      Exertion (RPE) from Borg's RPE scale (Borg, 1982) during each of the recovery intervals.&#xD;
      Throughout the trial pulmonary gas exchange and ventilation will be measured breath-by-breath&#xD;
      and hear rate recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On completion of the cool-down participants will be seated and blood pressure recorded. The&#xD;
      participants will be required to consume a CHO load of 75 g of CHO in the form of glucose&#xD;
      monohydrate in 200 mL of water following the five-minute recovery period. Participants are&#xD;
      then free to shower and change before a final blood sample and blood pressure measurement is&#xD;
      taken, one hour post completion of the exercise. Participants will be provided with a bottle&#xD;
      containing 75 g of CHO in the form of glucose monohydrate in 200 mL of water, they will be&#xD;
      asked to drink this the following day of the trial, at the same time as the first CHO load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits Seven Participants will attend the laboratory for the removal the glucose sensor, and&#xD;
      to return the interstitial glucose reader and activity tracker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Effects Any adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), or suspected&#xD;
      unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) will be reported to the study sponsor via&#xD;
      standard Aberystwyth University reporting mechanisms. Potential AE would include; muscle&#xD;
      soreness/damage, nausea, and cardiovascular events. The risk of each of these will be&#xD;
      minimised by appropriate warm-up and cool-down exercises, and cardiovascular screening.&#xD;
