    <textblock>
      This study include cancer patients who had received chemotherapy that include cisplatin.&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to either a mannitol 20 g intravenous single dose after&#xD;
      cisplatin or a placebo (saline). The primary outcome was to compare acute kidney injury&#xD;
      (AKI), which was defined as increase creatinine 0.3 mg/dl in 48 hours by KDIGO criteria using&#xD;
      serum creatinine and 24 hour urine creatinine to calculated.&#xD;
