      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the combination of LD-TSEBT and&#xD;
      mogamulizumab in patients with MF and SS. And to evaluate the secondary measures of clinical&#xD;
      benefit of the combination therapy and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      combination in patients with MF and SS.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response to treatment will be assessed as the number and proportion of participants who achieve either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), and maintain a response for 6 months. The outcome is reported as numbers without dispersion. Clinical response will be assessed as follows.&#xD;
CR: Complete disappearance of all clinical evidence of disease&#xD;
PR: Decrease in size or amount of measurable disease lesions&#xD;
Progressive disease (PD): Worsening of lesions; appearance of new lesions; or recurrence of lesions&#xD;
Stable disease (SD): Disease status that is neither CR, PR, nor PD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time-to-Next Significant Treatment (TTNT)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time-to-next significant treatment (TTNT) will be assessed as the amount of time from starting study treatment through the initiation of any non study systemic therapy. The outcome will be reported as the median TTNT with standard deviation.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (DOR) will be assessed in those participants who achieve either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), and with duration as time to progressive disease or the initiation of a non-study systemic therapy.&#xD;
CR: Complete disappearance of all clinical evidence of disease&#xD;
PR: Decrease in size or amount of measurable disease lesions&#xD;
Progressive disease (PD): Worsening of lesions; appearance of new lesions; or recurrence of lesions&#xD;
Stable disease (SD): Disease status that is neither CR, PR, nor PD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient reported Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Skindex 29 survey was used to evaluate the effect of skin conditions on participant's quality of life (QoL). Surveys were administered at the beginning of every treatment cycle and continuing through up to 3 years of treatment. The survey is a 30 item questionnaire with possible answers scored as 1 to 5, with a score of 1 indicating no negative effect, and a score of 5 indicating a constant (&quot;all the time&quot;) negative effect. Response ranges are from 30 to 150. The outcome will be reported as the median QoL score with standard deviation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment-related Adverse Events ≥ Grade 3</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity will be assessed as adverse events that are severe or greater (≥ Grade 3), and possibly, probably, or definitely related to mogamulizumab or low dose total skin electron beam therapy (LD TSEBT), and occurring within 12 months of starting treatment. The outcome will be reported as the total number of qualifying events, a number without dispersion.</description>
