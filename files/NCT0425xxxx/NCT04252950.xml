  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether a community-based structured&#xD;
      exercise therapy (CB-SET) intervention, which could be accessible and easily disseminated,&#xD;
      adds benefit to peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients undergoing revascularization&#xD;
      (REVASC) to improve their function and cardiovascular health.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Training (T): Patients assigned to the control group will receive verbal advice to exercise&#xD;
      but will receive no other training following their revascularization and outcome assessments.&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will receive supervised SET in the exercise physiology&#xD;
      laboratory for one week (3 sessions) following their REVASC and outcome assessments. Patients&#xD;
      will then receive 11 weeks of community-based structured exercise therapy (CB-SET) with&#xD;
      training, monitoring, and coaching (TMC) and public health elements at home or in the place&#xD;
      of their choosing. Patients will be visited by study staff where walking exercise will take&#xD;
      place (1 visit per month, 3 total community visits). The purpose of the initial supervised&#xD;
      SET is to educate patients about how to exercise and to address any questions they may have&#xD;
      (part of the training component of TMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring (M): Participants will be monitored with a piezoelectric accelerometer over the&#xD;
      duration of the 12 total weeks to determine total volume of activity. Participants in both&#xD;
      groups will be asked to wear the monitors continuously for 7 days per week over a 10 hour&#xD;
      period for each day. This amount of activity monitoring has been successfully used in&#xD;
      previous studies (minimal user burden, low profile devices). Additionally, participants in&#xD;
      both groups will be reminded to wear the monitor during any walking sessions they perform&#xD;
      with intent of exercise. The investigators will determine exercise compliance separately for&#xD;
      both groups, and participants in the intervention group will be asked to record details about&#xD;
      the CB-SET sessions in a provided exercise log (as conducted in a pilot studies). Data from&#xD;
      the piezoelectric accelerometers, which are capable of collecting and storing data for ~6&#xD;
      weeks, will be downloaded and reset at the community visits (1 per month). Control&#xD;
      participants will be mailed a new device every 4 weeks (with pre-paid mailers given to&#xD;
      control participants for return and subsequent download by staff) or will exchange the device&#xD;
      during optional once per month visits to the exercise laboratory. At these visits, control&#xD;
      pariticipants will have resting heart rate and blood pressure assessed but no CB-SET program&#xD;
      will be applied to ensure these participants receive the standard of care regarding home&#xD;
      exercise (upfront advice to walk). Participants in the intervention group will also be given&#xD;
      commercially available piezoelectric hip pedometers (Omron), which have an interface to track&#xD;
      steps, to monitor their own activity. Weekly phone calls (telehealth) will be conducted by&#xD;
      study staff with specific prompting to gain a better evaluation of how much and how often&#xD;
      intervention group participants are walking (a feasible process evaluation used in the&#xD;
      preliminary studies). Questions included to assist in determining treatment fidelity&#xD;
      (ensuring the intervention is delivered as intended) during phone calls and from the exercise&#xD;
      log: 1) date and start/end times of walking exercise for each session, 2) number of rest&#xD;
      stops needed while walking (and reasons for stopping), 3) questions regarding usage of the&#xD;
      piezoelectric accelerometer (instructions for use given to participants), 4) number of steps&#xD;
      measured from the hip pedometer, 5) what route the participant chose to use for walking as&#xD;
      initially defined by the environmental audit (see section below for more details), and 6)&#xD;
      what barriers or facilitators the participant encountered during the session (&quot;Any problems&#xD;
      while walking around your neighborhood?&quot;). Additionally, participants will be strongly&#xD;
      encouraged to walk with family, friends, and pets to increase walking activity. Participants&#xD;
      in both groups will receive a smartphone with an application called Daynamica, which will&#xD;
      allow users to indicate and store the location where they complete their community-based&#xD;
      activities and to annotate specific exercise sessions or other physical activity episodes.&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will receive monthly phone calls only to assess the&#xD;
      occurrence of any adverse events and to schedule the optional in-hospital visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coaching (C): The investigators will employ an operational coaching model that will provide&#xD;
      training guidance and help addressing local barriers to exercise training in the community&#xD;
      setting as well as promoting or reinforcing facilitators for each individual participant in&#xD;
      the CB-SET intervention group. This will include: 1) educational print materials and 2)&#xD;
      environmental auditing. Educational materials developed by Vascular Cures will include&#xD;
      informational outreach activities that have been cited as strategies to promote walking by&#xD;
      the Task Force Community Preventive Services. Additionally, in providing control participants&#xD;
      with the accelerometers, the investigators are in essence providing them &quot;attention&quot;, in&#xD;
      addition to the monthly phone calls and optional in-hospital &quot;check-ups&quot; with controls. This&#xD;
      attention-control design is meant to provide definitive findings that the substantive aspects&#xD;
      of the CB-SET program are efficacious and not the result of simply increased contact time&#xD;
      with intervention group participants.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) Distance Subcategory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In the Walking Impairment Questionnaire distance subcategory, participants are asked to rate the degree of difficulty walking specific distances on a scale from 0 to 4. A score of 0 indicates the inability to walk the distance specified by the question while a score of 4 represents no difficulty. The graded sub-score is multiplied by a pre-specified weight for each sub-category: distance, speed, and number of flights of stairs. The products of these subscores are summed and divided by the maximum possible score to obtain a percent score, ranging from 0 (inability to perform item) to 100 (no difficulty in performing item).</description>

A score of 0 indicates the inability to walk the distance specified by the question while a score of 4 represents no difficulty. The graded sub-score is multiplied by a pre-specified weight for each sub-category: distance, speed, and number of flights of stairs.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Peripheral Artery Disease Quality of Life (PADQOL) is a 38-item survey assessing 5 quality of life factors of PAD patients: Social relationships and interactions; Self-concept and feelings; Symptoms and limitations in physical functioning; Fear and uncertainty; and Positive adaptation. Items are scored on a scale of 1 (strongly agree) to 6 (strongly disagree). 5 factor scores are calculated by summing all items in that factor. These factor scores are labeled F1- F5. The factor totals are then transformed into percentiles using the formula: [(sum of scores on factor items - # of factor items) / (5 * # of factor items)]*100 = factor percentile. Total factor scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating greater quality of life.</description>
