    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study to determine the safety, PK, and antitumor&#xD;
      activity of BZ019 in adult subjects with R/R large CD19+B cell lymphoma. The safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of a single dose of different target doses of BZ019 will be evaluated in the&#xD;
      dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the safety and tolerance of single infusion of BZ019 in adult patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, and to determine the maximum tolerable dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and phase II recommended dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives：&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and survival of BZ019 in the peripheral blood of adult&#xD;
           patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the Pharmacodynamic characteristics of BZ019 in adult patients with relapsed&#xD;
           or refractory large B-cell lymphoma;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective response rate (ORR), Overall survival, progression free survival, event free&#xD;
           survival, and tumor progression time were used to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of&#xD;
           BZ019 in the treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
