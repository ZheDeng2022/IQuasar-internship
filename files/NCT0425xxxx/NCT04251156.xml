  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the change in body weight from the start to the end of the study. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to compare the effect on body weight in people taking semaglutide (a&#xD;
      new medicine) and people taking &quot;dummy&quot; medicine. In addition to taking the medicine&#xD;
      participants will have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how to be more&#xD;
      physically active and what else they can do to lose weight. Participants will either get&#xD;
      semaglutide or &quot;dummy medicine&quot; - which treatment is decided by chance. Participants will&#xD;
      need to take 1 injection once a week. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a&#xD;
      skinfold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm.â€¢ The study will last for about 1 year.&#xD;
      Participants will have 11 clinic visits and 8 phone calls with the study doctor. Participants&#xD;
      will have 3 clinic visits where they cannot eat and drink (water is allowed) for up to 8&#xD;
      hours before the visit and 1 clinic visit where they cannot eat and drink for up to 2 hours&#xD;
      before the visit. (4 visits and 1 visit, respectively, if they have type 2 diabetes (T2D)).&#xD;
      Participants will have 4 clinic visits where they will have blood samples taken. (5 visits if&#xD;
      they have T2D). For China: Participants will have 9 clinic visits where they will have blood&#xD;
      samples taken. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become&#xD;
      pregnant during the study period.&#xD;
