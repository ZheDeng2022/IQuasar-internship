    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a group of autoimmune inflammatory&#xD;
      demyelinating disease of the central nervous system primarily characterized with recurrent&#xD;
      optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, leading to blindness and&#xD;
      paralysis. Incremental disability due to clinical attacks make it essential to prevent&#xD;
      relapses with immunosuppressive therapy. Since the serological pathogenic marker&#xD;
      anti-aquaporin 4 immunoglobulin G (anti-AQP4 IgG) has been identified, NMOSD has unveiled its&#xD;
      autoimmune features with close connections to B cell-mediated humoral immunity. Rituximab, a&#xD;
      chimeric monoclonal antibody directly against human CD20 molecular on the surface of B cells,&#xD;
      has been reported to deplete peripheral CD20+ B cells and to be highly effective for treating&#xD;
      NMOSD, and therefore been recommended as first-line therapy for this disorder. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      there are still no consensus statements on dosing and follow-up regimens, which needs&#xD;
      investigations to explore the efficacy and safety of different rituximab strategies. Previous&#xD;
      studies have provided pilot evidence supporting the use of low-dose rituximab in preventing&#xD;
      relapses in Chinese patients with NMO/NMOSD, however, prospective multicenter studies are&#xD;
      still needed to determine the effectiveness of the modified strategy in treating NMOSD.&#xD;
