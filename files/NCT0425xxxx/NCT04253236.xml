    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, non-randomized, sequential, open-label study to investigate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy of RVT-1401 (680 mg/weekly and 340 mg/weekly) in patients&#xD;
      with Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia that is worsening or refractory in spite of therapy&#xD;
      with steroids and or immunosuppressants or worsening with steroid or immunosuppressant taper.&#xD;
      Two cohorts of participants will be enrolled in a non-randomized sequential approach.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled into Cohort 1 (680 mg/weekly) first followed by Cohort 2 (340&#xD;
      mg/weekly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the initial dose at the Baseline Visit (Week 1, Day 1), study visits will occur&#xD;
      weekly throughout the treatment period. Following the final dose at Week 12, visits will&#xD;
      occur weekly through Week 14 and then at Week 16 and Week 20. Safety, PK, PD, and clinical&#xD;
      assessments will be collected throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will participate in the study for up to approximately 24 weeks: up to a&#xD;
      4-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and an 8-week follow up period.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of primary or secondary WAIHA as documented by a positive direct&#xD;
             antiglobulin test (DAT) specific for anti-IgG alone or anti-IgG plus C3d.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Secondary WAIHA may only include Stage 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in which&#xD;
             separate treatment is not indicated, nor anticipated to require active management for&#xD;
             the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have failed or not tolerated at least one prior WAIHA treatment regimen as per local&#xD;
             standards (e.g., steroids, rituximab, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine,&#xD;
             mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), danazol, or vincristine). Failure is defined as worsening&#xD;
             or refractory disease despite steroids and or immunosuppressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants with splenectomy ≥3 months from Day 1 who are up to date on vaccinations&#xD;
             (based on age and local guidance) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. At Screening and Baseline, subject's hemoglobin level must be &lt;10 g/dL and the subject&#xD;
             must have documented symptoms related to anemia (e.g., weakness, dizziness, fatigue,&#xD;
             shortness of breath, chest pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject's concurrent treatment for WAIHA may consist only of steroids (stable dose for&#xD;
             at least two weeks prior to Day 1), immunosuppressant therapy (azathioprine, MMF, or&#xD;
             cyclosporine) that has been at a stable dose for at least four weeks prior to Day 1,&#xD;
             or erythropoietin (stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to Day 1). [Note: starting&#xD;
             doses of WAIHA therapy must be maintained throughout the study except in the case of a&#xD;
             rescue medication as per local standards for safety. Steroid taper down to 10 mg/day&#xD;
             will be allowed for participants who achieve response for at least 2 weeks.]&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
                  bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) or&#xD;

                  label or Principal Investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently&#xD;
                  minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female participants must agree to&#xD;
                  use contraception until 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male participants must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the&#xD;
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment until 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Willing and capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with&#xD;
             the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;

          4. Immunoglobulins given by SC, IV (IVIG), or intramuscular route, or&#xD;
             plasmapheresis/plasma exchange (PE) within 60 days before Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Total IgG level &lt;6 g/L (at Screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 cells/mm3(at Screening).&#xD;
