      Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is frequently observed in children after&#xD;
      open-heart surgery and has been associated with both cardiopulmonary bypass and surgical&#xD;
      trauma. Children with congenital cyanotic heart disease (CCHD) have complex changes in all&#xD;
      blood values and clotting profiles due to chronic hypoxemia. Increased erythrocyte count&#xD;
      decreases plasma and coagulation factors, platelet count and function. Therefore, blood and&#xD;
      blood products transfusion may increase during intraoperative and postoperative periods. In&#xD;
      addition, durations of cardiopulmonary bypass may prolong due to the complex defects of&#xD;
      children with CCHD. The aim of this study is to investigate postoperative SIRS rates and risk&#xD;
      factors in cyanotic and acyanotic children undergoing open heart surgery for congenital heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in adults has been defined as a non-specific&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory process in the absence of infection, following incidents such as&#xD;
      trauma, burns, pancreatitis, or major surgery. For children, age-specific SIRS criteria were&#xD;
      established by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference in 2005. SIRS was&#xD;
      defined as presence of at least two out of four parameters, one of which must be an abnormal&#xD;
      temperature or leukocyte count. The two other criteria consist of either an elevated heart&#xD;
      rate or respiratory rate. SIRS is frequently observed in children after open-heart surgery&#xD;
      and has been associated with both cardiopulmonary bypass and surgical trauma. Following&#xD;
      cardiac surgery the pathophysiological mechanisms of SIRS involve a cytokine-mediated general&#xD;
      capillary leakage followed by intravascular volume depletion, generalized edema, circulatory&#xD;
      compromise, and altered microcirculation. The inflammatory process may further impair the&#xD;
      function of the lung, myocardium, kidney, liver, intestine, and brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with congenital cyanotic heart disease (CCHD) have complex changes in all blood&#xD;
      values and clotting profiles due to chronic hypoxemia. Increased erythrocyte count decreases&#xD;
      plasma and coagulation factors, platelet count and function. Therefore, blood and blood&#xD;
      products transfusion may increase during intraoperative and postoperative periods. In&#xD;
      addition, durations of cardiopulmonary bypass may prolong due to the complex defects of&#xD;
      children with CCHD. Previous studies have reported that the duration of CPB and the amount of&#xD;
      fresh frozen plasma transfusion increase SIRS formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate postoperative SIRS rates and risk factors in cyanotic&#xD;
      and acyanotic children undergoing open heart surgery for congenital heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged between 0-16 years and undergoing open heart surgery for cyanotic and acyanotic&#xD;
      congenital heart disease will be included in the study. Patients with preoperative renal&#xD;
      failure or hepatic disease will be excluded. Patient's age, weight, comorbidities, details of&#xD;
      previous operation will be recorded. Preoperative hematocrit value, white blood cell and&#xD;
      platelet counts, biochemical parameters (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolyte&#xD;
      values), diagnosis of CCHD, RACHS1 (risk adjustment for surgery for congenital heart disease)&#xD;
      will be recorded. In intraoperative period; operation time, CPB time, aortic cross-clamp&#xD;
      time, circulatory arrest time, body temperature and lowest body temperature reached during&#xD;
      CPB, cardioplegia amount, The ACT (activated coagulation time), urine amount will be&#xD;
      recorded. Intraoperative blood gas values, lactate, mean arterial pressure, glucose values&#xD;
      will be recorded at 30 min intervals. The amount of crystalloid and colloid, erythrocyte,&#xD;
      fresh frozen plasma, platelet and cryoprecipitate used in intraoperative period will be&#xD;
      recorded. Heparin and protamine doses administered will be recorded. Vasoactive agents&#xD;
      (dopamine, dobutamine, adrenaline, nitroglycerine) used in intraoperative period will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the postoperative intensive care period; arterial blood gases and lactate, hematocrit,&#xD;
      liquid (crystalloid and colloid) and blood products administered will be monitored at 6th,&#xD;
      24th and 48th hours. The vasoactive agents used, the inotropic score, the amount of urine and&#xD;
      the use of diuretics will be recorded. Length of stay ICU, duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, length of stay hospital will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of SIRS; in the postoperative period, the age-specific SIRS criteria determined by&#xD;
      the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference will be used. Patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated for the diagnosis of SIRS at postoperative 6th, 12th, 24th and 48th hours. SIRS&#xD;
      rates and risk factors in cyanotic and acyanotic patients will be determined.&#xD;
