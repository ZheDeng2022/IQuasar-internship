      The aim of this study is to estimate the effect of periodontal phenotype on the outcome of&#xD;
      isolated gingival recession by laterally positioned flap.The primary objective of study is to&#xD;
      assess the changes in gingival margin in the donor tooth after laterally positioned flap over&#xD;
      a period of 6 months and to assess the influence of periodontal phenotype on the stability of&#xD;
      results of root coverage achieved through laterally positioned flap. The secondary objective&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate root coverage by laterally positioned flap in thick periodontal&#xD;
      phenotype and to evaluate root coverage by laterally positioned flap in thin periodontal&#xD;
      phenotype.&#xD;

      A variety of surgical techniques have been proposed to achieve successful and predictable&#xD;
      root coverage. These include coronally advanced flap, lateral positioned flap (LPF) free&#xD;
      gingival graft, free connective tissue graft, and guided tissue regeneration. LPF, originally&#xD;
      described by Grupe and Warren in 1964 is one of the most commonly performed root coverage&#xD;
      technique.The procedure has undergone various modification over the years .Staffileno and&#xD;
      pfeifer and Heller advocated the use of split-thickness flap to minimize the potential risk&#xD;
      for the development of recession in the donor tooth.Wood et al used re-entry procedures to&#xD;
      compare crestal radicular bone responses to full and partial thickness flaps. They concluded&#xD;
      that regardless of the flap procedure, loss of crestal bone depended on the periodontal&#xD;
      phenotype.The term periodontal phenotype refers to phenotypic characteristic of bone and soft&#xD;
      tissue that make up the periodontium. Periodontal phenotype is typically used to describe the&#xD;
      buccolingual tissue thickness and gingival morphology. It is divided into thick flat and thin&#xD;
      scalloped type. However there is a paucity of studies in the literature studying the effect&#xD;
      periodontal phenotype on the root coverage obtained and its stability over time after LPF.&#xD;
      Furthermore the impact of periodontal phenotype on the donor area in this procedure has not&#xD;
      been explored. Therefore the present study is designed with the aim to evaluate the influence&#xD;
      of periodontal phenotype on the outcome of root coverage by LPF.&#xD;
