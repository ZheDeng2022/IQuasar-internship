  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will be conducted to assess the bioavailability and PK of oral single&#xD;
      doses of CT-044 following administration with and without food and to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of CT-044 when given with and without food.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The food effect study will be an open-label, 2-sequence, balanced crossover design in 12&#xD;
      subjects previously untreated with CT-044.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Trial Unit on the day prior to dosing and&#xD;
      remain in house until Day 3. Each subject will receive CT-044 single oral dose once under fed&#xD;
      conditions (i.e., a high fat meal per FDA recommendations) and once in the fasted state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 Subjects will return to the Clinical Trial Unit on an outpatient basis for follow-up.&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the Clinical Trial Unit to be treated by the second sequence after a&#xD;
      washout period of at least 7 days, but no more than 14 days. All procedures will be repeated&#xD;
      for the second treatment sequence. When possible, the procedures conducted at the 144-hour&#xD;
      follow-up visit for the first sequence may serve as baseline for the second sequence of the&#xD;
      crossover.&#xD;
