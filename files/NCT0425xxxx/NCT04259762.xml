  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are continued disparities in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival between American&#xD;
      Indians (AIs) and Whites on cancers responsive to early screening (i.e., breast, colorectal,&#xD;
      and cervical) in the US. In New Mexico (NM), AIs compared with other racial/ethnic&#xD;
      populations are significantly less likely to adhere to recommended screening guidelines. The&#xD;
      purpose of this trial is to develop and pilot test multilevel/multicomponent intervention&#xD;
      strategies to enhance screening for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are continued disparities in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival between American&#xD;
      Indians (AIs) and Whites on cancers responsive to early screening (i.e., breast, colorectal,&#xD;
      and cervical) in the US. Between 1990-2009, based on data from Contract Health Service&#xD;
      Delivery Area Counties across the US, the mortality-to-incidence ratios for these cancers&#xD;
      were significantly higher for American Indian/Alaska Natives compared to Whites (breast:&#xD;
      1.22, colorectal: 1.16, cervix: 1.36), indicating poorer survival. New Mexico (NM) AIs also&#xD;
      experience substantial cancer disparities. Between 2010-2014, AIs compared to Whites had&#xD;
      higher incidence (per 100,000) for cervical (7.9 vs. 6.9) and colorectal (male: 46.5 vs.&#xD;
      35.2; female: 29.2 vs. 28.2) cancers, and higher mortality for cervical (3.7 vs. 1.3) and&#xD;
      colorectal (males only; 18.9 vs. 15.6) cancers. AIs were more likely to receive a late-stage&#xD;
      (i.e., regional or distant) cancer diagnosis for all 3 screen detectable cancers. AIs have&#xD;
      some of the lowest cancer screening rates compared with other racial/ethnic groups. In NM,&#xD;
      AIs listed in the Indian Health Service (IHS) Albuquerque Area have substantially lower&#xD;
      screening rates than the state's White population do. AIs had screening rates of: breast&#xD;
      (58.5%, women ages 52-64), colorectal (41.9%, ages 50-75), and cervical (63.9%, women ages&#xD;
      24-64) cancers; whereas, screening rates for Whites were: breast (70.0%, ages 50-74),&#xD;
      colorectal (69.2%, ages 50-75), and cervical (77.8%, women 21-65).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Community Prevention Services Task Force's Guide to Community Preventive Services (&quot;The&#xD;
      Community Guide&quot;) recommends evidence-based strategies for multicomponent interventions to&#xD;
      promote breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening. Multicomponent interventions&#xD;
      combine approaches to enhance community demand for and access to, and provider delivery of&#xD;
      screening services. Evidence suggests that interventions that combine approaches from the 3&#xD;
      strategies or that combine approaches to increase community demand and access result in the&#xD;
      largest increases in screening rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to develop and pilot test culturally and linguistically appropriate&#xD;
      interventions to enhance age- and risk-appropriate breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening in concordance with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended guidelines.&#xD;
      The aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Continue to foster a sustainable multi-directional, participatory collaboration&#xD;
      (&quot;community collaborative&quot; through a Tribal Advisory Panel (TAP)) between the Zuni's tribal&#xD;
      leadership, stakeholders, Zuni Indian Health Service Comprehensive Health Center, and UNM&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Center (UNMCCC) researchers to enhance community-engaged cancer control&#xD;
      training, education, and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Using participatory approaches by engaging the TAP, finalize multilevel/multicomponent&#xD;
      intervention strategies to increase provider delivery of, community access to, and community&#xD;
      demand for screening for the screen-detectable cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Pilot test (using a stepped-wedge trial design and qualitative methods) the&#xD;
      multilevel/multicomponent culturally and linguistically appropriate intervention strategies&#xD;
      on outcomes such as: impact on screening practices; feasibility of implementation and&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention; and cost effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. Disseminate findings appropriately tailored to the needs of targeted non-scientific&#xD;
      and scientific audiences (i.e., TAP, tribal leaders, Zuni community, Zuni IHS healthcare&#xD;
      providers; annual NM Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Networks of Biomedical Research&#xD;
      Excellence symposium and national conference attendees, and peer-reviewed publications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol A. Aim 1-Foster a Community Collaborative (TAP) Procedure-Fostering the Community&#xD;
      Collaborative: The 9-member community collaborative, Tribal Advisory Panel, represents the&#xD;
      Zuni tribal leadership, Zuni stakeholders and local organizations (i.e., Health and Wellness&#xD;
      program directors, Community Health Representatives [CHRs], cancer survivors), healthcare&#xD;
      providers (i.e., Zuni IHS Comprehensive Health Center, hereafter &quot;health center&quot;), and UNMCCC&#xD;
      researchers. The TAP ensures active community engagement and a non-hierarchical partnership&#xD;
      model. The TAP brings expertise in tribal health priorities and policies, cultural and&#xD;
      linguistic sensitivities, development and delivery of intervention, education and training&#xD;
      needs for students and CHRs, and delivery of healthcare services. The TAP will meet&#xD;
      quarterly, or more often if necessitated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Aim 2-Finalize the Multilevel/Multicomponent Intervention Strategies&#xD;
      Procedure-Finalization of Intervention Strategies: To finalize the intervention, the&#xD;
      investigators will: (a) map data collected through on-going research with The Community&#xD;
      Guide's recommendations of evidence-based strategies to enhance cancer screening; (b) develop&#xD;
      small media for the 3 screen-detectable cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B1. Data mapping and participatory engagement of the TAP: The investigators will map and&#xD;
      present data, along with evidence-based recommendations from The Community Guide, to the TAP&#xD;
      for participatory input on appropriate multilevel/multicomponent intervention strategies that&#xD;
      can enhance screening. These data were collected through prior research and consist of&#xD;
      environmental scans of resources available to offer screening services, and&#xD;
      structural/system-level promoters and barriers to providing screening and qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative assessments of cancer related knowledge, attitudes, screening practices, and&#xD;
      screening barriers in the Zuni Pueblo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall focus of the intervention model, per The Community Guide, is on intervention&#xD;
      strategies that fall into 3 categories. First, increase community access by reducing&#xD;
      structural/systemic barriers (e.g., reduce administrative barriers, patient navigation,&#xD;
      assist in appointment scheduling, set up alternative screening sites, and modify screening&#xD;
      clinic hours). Second, increase community demand using culturally, linguistically, and health&#xD;
      literacy appropriate group education, 1-on-1 education, client reminders and incentives, mass&#xD;
      media, and small media (i.e., educational brochures). Third, increase provider delivery of&#xD;
      screening services through, improved provider recommendations, provider reminder/recall&#xD;
      systems, and shared-decision making tools. Evidence suggests that a combination of strategies&#xD;
      from each category leads to greater effects. The investigators will conjointly work with the&#xD;
      TAP to select evidence-based intervention strategies (at least 1 strategy from at least 2&#xD;
      [preferably all 3] categories) that can best address barriers identified through the&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative research, can leverage existing resources at the health center,&#xD;
      and meet the cancer control needs of the Zuni people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B2. Develop small media: The investigators will develop small media (i.e., educational&#xD;
      brochure) on the 3 cancers. The Community Guide recommended strategies to increase demand for&#xD;
      and access to screening require the ability to understand cancer risk, screening benefits,&#xD;
      health system navigation-all to make informed decisions and take appropriate action. The&#xD;
      investigators will use small media to convey this information. The investigators will&#xD;
      operationalize the Multi-level Health Outcomes Framework (MHOF) constructs such as knowledge,&#xD;
      susceptibility, severity, norms, and self-efficacy in the small media, and document health&#xD;
      literacy using the Suitability Assessment of Materials and Comprehensibility of Materials&#xD;
      (SAM+CAM) instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research Design: Qualitative design, using focus group methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Population: Zuni men age 50-75 years and Zuni women age 21-75 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recruitment Target: about 30-36 eligible persons (assuming attrition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recruitment Methods: Purposive sampling methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Procedures: Conduct three focus groups, with each group consisting of 6 to 8&#xD;
           participants. Each session will meet for approximately two hours. Before starting the&#xD;
           discussion, participants will provide informed consent and complete a survey collecting&#xD;
           socio-demographic information. The purpose of these focus groups is to finalize the&#xD;
           intervention's educational materials, ensuring they are culturally appropriate and&#xD;
           contain messages operationalizing various constructs of the theory guiding the study&#xD;
           (MHOF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Data Analysis: Each team member will read the transcripts independently and create&#xD;
           individual summaries in accordance with each domain area. The investigators will then&#xD;
           meet as a group to review the summaries and through a process of comparing/contrasting&#xD;
           observations, the investigators will distill the input into a series of recommendations&#xD;
           from which the investigators will modify the 3 brochures. Following the creation of&#xD;
           subsequent versions of the brochures, the investigators will then send them to&#xD;
           participants from the 3 groups for further review and comments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Sample Size Considerations: While the number of focus groups cannot be precisely&#xD;
           determined prior to data collection, based on prior experience, 3 groups should be&#xD;
           sufficient to capture the full range of salient themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Aim 3: Pilot Test the Multilevel/Multicomponent Intervention C1. Quantitative Research&#xD;
      (Pilot Test Effectiveness of the Intervention [INT])&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research Design: Cluster randomized stepped-wedge&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research Setting: Zuni Pueblo&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clusters and Randomization: The investigators will form 4 cluster categories stratified&#xD;
           by gender and age. In all, the investigators will form 12 clusters, each comprising 10&#xD;
           participants. The cluster categories, number of clusters per category, and&#xD;
           cancer-specific INTs that the clusters will receive are as follows. (1) 5 clusters of&#xD;
           men aged 50-75 (for colorectal cancer INT). (2) 3 clusters of women aged 50-75 (for&#xD;
           breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer INTs). (3) 2 clusters of women aged 50-75 (for&#xD;
           breast and colorectal cancer INTs). (4) 2 clusters of women aged 21-49 (for cervical&#xD;
           cancer INT). The investigators will randomize each cluster and offer the cluster&#xD;
           category specific cancer INT(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participant Identification and Sampling: The investigators will use a combination of&#xD;
           community meetings, posters, health fairs, and announcements on Zuni Radio to inform the&#xD;
           Pueblo residents of the study. The investigators will maintain a list by contact&#xD;
           information, gender, and age of those who are willing to participate in the study. The&#xD;
           investigators will select all members of a household eligible for any of the 3&#xD;
           cancer-specific INTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Interventions: Educational and behavioral interventions on cancers of the breast,&#xD;
           colorectal, and cervix (breast cancer screening intervention; colorectal cancer&#xD;
           screening intervention; and cervical cancer screening intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Procedures: The investigators will contact (in-person) interested participants just&#xD;
           prior to their cluster being randomized to the INT condition and provide them with a&#xD;
           recruitment packet. The packet will contain materials describing the study, PI contact&#xD;
           information, description of the overall benefits and risks of participation, consent&#xD;
           letter for the surveys, and date for the first study activity (i.e., baseline survey and&#xD;
           first INT session). The packet will also contain a card with a unique identifier that&#xD;
           links the participants to the surveys and INT. The card will also contain a scheduling&#xD;
           calendar to inform participants about the date and time for the next project activity&#xD;
           (survey, INT session, focus group). Zuni students and CHRs will administer the surveys.&#xD;
           The investigators will conduct 3 waves of outcomes evaluation surveys: baseline,&#xD;
           posttest #1, and posttest #2. The investigators will administer all surveys in-person&#xD;
           and each will last approximately 20 minutes. Prior to each project activity, the&#xD;
           investigators will contact (phone or in-person) participants informing them of the date,&#xD;
           time and place of the upcoming activity. During each project activity, the investigators&#xD;
           will confirm/update the participants' contact information. Between posttest #1, and&#xD;
           posttest #2, the investigators will remind (phone or in-person; at 3-monthly intervals),&#xD;
           if necessary, participants to complete their screening exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Implementation of the Intervention [INT]: The TAP will finalize the INT strategies (Aim&#xD;
           2). The overall INT will be bounded by contextual realities (rurality of the Zuni&#xD;
           Pueblo, resources at the health center, budget for the project). With this context in&#xD;
           mind, the investigators could operationalize The Community Guide's recommended&#xD;
           strategies that the TAP may plausibly identify as follows: To increase community access,&#xD;
           the investigators could: (a) Identify a point-person (i.e., Public Health Nurse) at the&#xD;
           health center who will triage participants to and schedule them for appropriate&#xD;
           screening(s). (b) Remind (phone or in-person) participants (between posttest #1, and&#xD;
           posttest #2) to complete their screening exam(s), offer assistance in scheduling a&#xD;
           screening appointment and a ride to the health center. These strategies would reduce&#xD;
           administrative barriers, navigate participants, and assist with transportation and in&#xD;
           scheduling an appointment. To increase community demand, the investigators could&#xD;
           consider: (a) Small media. (b) 1-on-1 education (supplemented by the small media) by the&#xD;
           project's CHRs. (c) Reminders between posttest #1, and posttest #2. (d)&#xD;
           Cognitive-behavioral group education and incentives. To increase provider delivery, the&#xD;
           investigators could: (a) Reduce health center-specific systemic barriers by identifying&#xD;
           a point-person to promote and facilitate screening services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Baseline and Posttest Surveys: The investigators will collect data on demographics,&#xD;
           knowledge, attitudes, perceived control, perceived susceptibility and severity, social&#xD;
           support, self-efficacy, and patient activation. At posttest #1, and posttest #2, the&#xD;
           investigators will inquire with whom and with how many persons they discussed the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Primary Outcome: Uptake of any combination of FOBT/FIT, Pap smear, or mammogram&#xD;
           screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Secondary Outcome: Temporal changes on MHOF constructs and their predictive value on&#xD;
           screening; feasibility and acceptability (described below); cost-effectiveness&#xD;
           (described below); and promoters/barriers to screening (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Data Management and Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Primary outcome: Completion of cancer screening. The investigators will compare the number&#xD;
      of cancer screening approaches undertaken by study participants, offset by the number of&#xD;
      possible screening tests, using Poisson regression approaches between those who are and are&#xD;
      not receiving active intervention. This will enable the estimation and comparison of&#xD;
      screening uptake between treatment arms, even when there are different numbers of possible&#xD;
      screening tests for groups of participants. The investigators will account for within-cluster&#xD;
      correlations using generalized estimating equations, and the investigators will explore the&#xD;
      impact on screening uptake of patient characteristics (e.g. sex) using fixed effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Secondary outcomes. I. Feasibility/acceptability: The investigators will summarize the&#xD;
      various measures feasibility with descriptive statistics. The investigators will use count&#xD;
      and percentages for most measures, but for others, such as measures of study promotion, the&#xD;
      investigators will summarize the efforts undertaken using means and standard deviations, or&#xD;
      medians and interquartile ranges, as appropriate for the data type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Promoters/barriers to screening: Analysis discussed under implementation of qualitative&#xD;
      data collection (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Positive changes in MHOF constructs: The investigators will also compare changes in MHOF&#xD;
      constructs (knowledge, attitudes, beliefs), perceived control, self-efficacy, and patient&#xD;
      activation, using linear mixed effects approaches that simultaneously account for&#xD;
      within-person and within-cluster correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis: The investigators will utilize a Markov decision&#xD;
      analytical model to simulate the progression of our cohorts (across the 3 cancers: breast,&#xD;
      colorectal, and cervical) through predefined states: normal, local, regional, disseminated,&#xD;
      and death. The likelihood of progressing through states (or remaining within states) will be&#xD;
      derived from the literature. All 3 cancer-specific INTs will be compared to a no-screen&#xD;
      pathway. The difference between each INT-based pathway and its respective no-screen pathway&#xD;
      is a function of the change in the probability of detection across each state of cancer&#xD;
      progression. The analysis compares the costs and outcomes over a predetermined timeframe&#xD;
      (likely to be longer (20+ years) for breast and cervical and shorter for colorectal (10-20&#xD;
      years)). Costs and benefits will be discounted. Our main CE outcome measures will be years of&#xD;
      life saved (YLS), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per YLS).&#xD;
      Additional CE outcome measures will include: the number of new cases and deaths from cancer,&#xD;
      the number of new screenings, and potential deaths from new screenings (colonoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      l. Sample Size Considerations: The investigators will enroll 10 participants into 12&#xD;
      different clusters, for a total of 120 participants. With this number of participants, and&#xD;
      assuming that those not in the active intervention group have historical screening uptake&#xD;
      levels (a weighted average of roughly 50%), then the study will have at least 80% power to&#xD;
      detect a relative increase in screening uptake of 20%, using a two-sided type I error level&#xD;
      of 5%, as long as the intra-cluster correlation is no larger than 0.62. As this degree of&#xD;
      intra-cluster correlation is very large, the study is well positioned to detect meaningful&#xD;
      intervention effects on screening uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C2. Qualitative Research (Understand Behavior Change Context)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research Design: Qualitative design, using focus group methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Population: Zuni men age 50-75 years and Zuni women age 21-75 years. Those who&#xD;
           completed at least 1 screening exam and those who did not complete any exam (Section&#xD;
           C2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recruitment Target: about 30-36 eligible persons (assuming attrition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recruitment Methods: Purposive sampling methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Procedures: Conduct three focus groups, with each group consisting of 6 to 8&#xD;
           participants. Each session will meet for approximately two hours. Before starting the&#xD;
           discussion, participants will provide informed consent and complete a survey collecting&#xD;
           socio-demographic information. The purpose of these focus groups is to finalize the&#xD;
           intervention's educational materials, ensuring they are culturally appropriate and&#xD;
           contain messages operationalizing various constructs of the theory guiding the study&#xD;
           (MHOF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Data Analysis: Each team member will read the transcripts independently and create&#xD;
           individual summaries in accordance with each domain area. The investigators will then&#xD;
           meet as a group to review the summaries and through a process of comparing/contrasting&#xD;
           observations, the investigators will distill the input into a series of recommendations&#xD;
           from which the investigators will modify the 3 brochures. Following the creation of&#xD;
           subsequent versions of the brochures, the investigators will then send them to&#xD;
           participants from the 3 groups for further review and comments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Sample Size Considerations: While the number of focus groups cannot be precisely&#xD;
           determined prior to data collection, based on prior experience, 3 groups should be&#xD;
           sufficient to capture the full range of salient themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C3. Assessment of Feasibility and Acceptability C3a. Procedure: The investigators will&#xD;
      analyze project records to quantify each feasibility measure. (1) Accrual (completion of&#xD;
      targeted enrollment): Number of eligible participants enrolled. (2) Attrition rate (&lt;20%):&#xD;
      Numerator=Number of enrollees who completed the baseline survey but subsequently dropped-out&#xD;
      of the study at various intervals (i.e., before, during, or after completing INT, or before&#xD;
      either of posttest #1, and posttest #2assessments). Denominator=Total number of enrollees.&#xD;
      (3) Study promotion: Number of flyers distributed, nature and number of inquiries received,&#xD;
      and sources of such inquiries. (4) Fidelity of INT implementation (per protocol): The&#xD;
      investigators will define the implementation protocols to document fidelity after the TAP&#xD;
      finalizes the overall INT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C4. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis C4a. Procedure: The investigators will collect and use&#xD;
      primary and secondary data to define parameters for the Markov models of cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      (CE). Primary data used for determining the CE of the intervention will include: compliance&#xD;
      improvements, costs related to the intervention (at both the patient (indirect) and provider&#xD;
      (direct) levels), age- and gender-stratified participation rates, and cancer detection rates&#xD;
      of the study population. Secondary data used for determining the CE of the intervention will&#xD;
      include: NM-specific cancer incidence, staging, and mortality rates, and direct medical costs&#xD;
      related to both the screening (primary costs) and treatment/management (secondary costs) of&#xD;
      screen-positive participants. Our data will allow estimates of screening uptake, cancer&#xD;
      incidence, cancer staging, treatment costs, and cancer mortality across the 3 cancer&#xD;
      screening interventions. The investigators will collect data on all direct medical costs&#xD;
      associated with the INT and follow-up, and indirect medical and non-medical costs (e.g., work&#xD;
      loss, travel, etc.) when possible. The investigators will assess direct medical costs through&#xD;
      the IHS Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), which contains patient encounter-level&#xD;
      data by outpatient International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 diagnoses and procedure&#xD;
      codes. The investigators will collect cancer diagnostic, treatment and inpatient data through&#xD;
      hospital discharge abstracts included in IHS contract billing. The investigators will use a&#xD;
      micro-costing approach to assess the cost of resources used or median cost of encounter based&#xD;
      on a resource-based relative value unit (RBRVU) system. The RBRVU is Medicare's reimbursement&#xD;
      rate for outpatient visits based on the procedure codes recorded for the encounter and is&#xD;
      used to estimate the healthcare system cost of procedures performed. Our main outcome&#xD;
      measures will be years of life saved (YLS), lifetime costs, and incremental&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per YLS). Secondary outcome measures will include: the number&#xD;
      of new cases and deaths from cancer, the number of screenings, and potential deaths from&#xD;
      screenings (colonoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Aim 4-Dissemination D1. Procedure: The investigators will disseminate findings tailored to&#xD;
      targeted non-scientific and scientific audiences. The investigators present preliminary&#xD;
      results on an annual basis to the Zuni Tribal leadership. The investigators will also present&#xD;
      findings to the Tribal Advisory Panel, general community, health center providers, and the&#xD;
      IHS health board. The TAP will assist in these dissemination efforts. After approval from the&#xD;
      tribal leadership, the investigators will publish the study findings.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will train Community Health Representatives (CHRs) in interactive group discussions techniques. CHRs will administer 1 session/week, lasting approximately 2 hours, and conducted among 12 men or women ages 21-75 per cluster. The CHRs will distribute the cancer-specific (i.e., breast, colorectal, and cervical) small media during the first session and refer to it during the course of the 4 sessions. During the sessions, the CHRs will function as a facilitator linking information with practical skills. At the end of the 4-week INT, participants will receive a voucher to present to a designated point-person at the health center who would schedule the screening for the age- and gender-specific cancers.</description>

    <description>Adult men and women will receive age- and gender-specific interventions. Women age 50-75 years will receive the interventions for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancers screening. Men age 50-75 years will receive the intervention for colorectal cancer screening. Women age 21-49 years will receive the intervention for cervical cancer screening. The 4-week interventions, delivered once a week, will consist of educational sessions that discuss cancer-specific information (i.e., breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer): breast (colorectal, cervical) cancer myths and facts, risk factors and symptoms, screening, and review/action plan. The educational sessions will be complemented by cancer-specific small media (brochure).</description>
