  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the safety of acalabrutinib and axicabtagene ciloleucel in&#xD;
      treating patients with B-cell lymphoma. Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking key pathways needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with axicabtagene ciloleucel is&#xD;
      engineered to target a specific surface antigen on lymphoma cells. Acalabrutinib may enhance&#xD;
      the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in treating patients with B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning up to 3 weeks and at least 24 hours prior to leukapheresis, patients receive&#xD;
      acalabrutinib orally (PO) every 12 hours. Treatment continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive axicabtagene ciloleucel&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) at 36-96 hours after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
