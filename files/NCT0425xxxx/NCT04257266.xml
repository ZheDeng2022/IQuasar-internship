  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study aims to examine whether Cryo Cooling packs reduce thermal and&#xD;
      cardiovascular strain after exercise-induced hyperthermia compared to a commercially&#xD;
      available ice pack. Secondly, the effect of Cryo Cooling packs on cognitive and exercise&#xD;
      performance will be examined. There is no current research examining the efficacy of Cryo&#xD;
      Cooling packs in hyperthermic individuals and this information will be helpful to establish&#xD;
      whether Cryo Cooling Packs can be used for performance enhancement or to prevent heat&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will consist of three study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Baseline and VO2max Testing Visit 2-3: Trial 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Baseline and VO2max Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are approved to participate will be scheduled for a baseline and VO2max&#xD;
      testing day. Upon arrival to the lab, subjects will provide a urine sample in a clean urine&#xD;
      cup. Urine specific gravity and urine color will be assessed. Nude body mass will be also be&#xD;
      recorded. Privacy will be afforded for each participant while obtaining body mass measures by&#xD;
      taking measurements with the participant alone in a private room behind a solid, closed door,&#xD;
      and the research reading the scale outside of the room. Participants will only be permitted&#xD;
      to continue to the VO2max test if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG)&#xD;
      ≤1.025 is met. If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject&#xD;
      will be asked to drink 500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration status. Height will be&#xD;
      measured with a tape measure on Visit 1. Percent body fat will be calculated using a 3-site&#xD;
      evaluation of skin fold thickness using skin fold calipers on one of the three baseline days.&#xD;
      A researcher will use appropriate grasping technique to measure skin fold thickness on the&#xD;
      chest, abdomen, and thigh. This will take less than ~5 minutes to complete. This information&#xD;
      will be used to describe the subject demographics. Participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) test on a treadmill in a thermoneutral environment.&#xD;
      This test will provide aerobic fitness levels of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2-3: Trials 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, counter-balanced, cross over design. Participant numbers will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned and trials will be ordered with a random number generator and assigned to a&#xD;
      participant number. These orders will be counterbalanced between participants to ensure that&#xD;
      there is not an order effect, and each participant will complete both trials as part of the&#xD;
      study. Participants will be allowed to make-up trial visits if they are sick, suffer an&#xD;
      injury or do not meet hydration requirements. Participants will be asked if they have a&#xD;
      current illness or taking medications to determine whether they can complete the exercise&#xD;
      trial. The participant's visit will be rescheduled if they have a fever, current illness or&#xD;
      taking medications that influence body temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cooling Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ice Pack Cooling&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Commercially Available Ice Pack&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise protocol, performance testing, cognitive testing, and recovery portions of this&#xD;
      study will be conducted in a climatic chamber with ambient temperature approximately 30-40°C&#xD;
      and relative humidity at approximately 30-70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the lab, participants will be asked to indicate if they have consumed alcohol&#xD;
      or caffeine in the last 24 hours. They will not be asked to specify exactly what they have&#xD;
      consumed, but if they provide a positive indication, their trial will be rescheduled for&#xD;
      another day. Participants will provide a small urine sample in a clean urine cup, and a nude&#xD;
      body mass will be measured. Upon arrival to the lab, hydration status will be assessed by&#xD;
      urine specific gravity, nude body mass and urine color. Participants will only be permitted&#xD;
      to continue to the exercise trial if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity&#xD;
      (USG) ≤ 1.025 is met. If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the&#xD;
      subject will be asked to drink 500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration status.&#xD;
      Participants will be given instructions at the prior visit about how to obtain desired&#xD;
      hydration status for the upcoming trial. Key study personnel will insert an esophageal probe&#xD;
      to measure esophageal temperature. Participants will then insert a rectal probe and wear a&#xD;
      heart rate monitor strap. Additionally, participants will wear 4-site skin temperature&#xD;
      sensors. The participants will also be asked to complete a subjective sleep questionnaire&#xD;
      upon arriving to the lab. All perceptual measures, cognitive performance measures and&#xD;
      physical performance tests will be administered to determine a baseline value at the&#xD;
      beginning of each trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo a treadmill protocol involving approximately 90 minutes of&#xD;
      jogging or walking. Cognitive and physical performance tests will be administered at various&#xD;
      time points throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After exercise, participants will be cooled by either 5 cryothermic ice packs or 5&#xD;
      commercially available ice packs. Participants will be cooled for approximately 30 mins. All&#xD;
      participants will be laying supine during cooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryothermic Cooling and Commercially Available Ice Pack Placement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage and Preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ice packs will be stored in a cooler at approximately 34°F for at least 6 hours prior to use&#xD;
      and kept as dry as possible (35°F to 70°F). Ideally, Ice packs will be kept in tray or basket&#xD;
      above ice or frozen gel packs, not in contact with the method of cooling the cooler.&#xD;
      Refrigerator may be acceptable for storage before cooler use as well, but prefer cooler for&#xD;
      real situations in field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cryo cooling elements: the cryo cooling packs will be shaken quickly and vigorously (10&#xD;
      seconds) and placed on subject (subject will be supine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For commercially available ice pack: ice packs will be placed on subject (subject will be&#xD;
      supine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ice packs will be placed on the following body segments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 ice pack on neck covering both carotid Triangle regions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 ice packs in axilla region&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 ice packs in groin region&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryo Cooling Elements and commercially available ice packs will be discarded after use.&#xD;
