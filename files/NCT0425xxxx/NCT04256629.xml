  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to investigate the safety of verinurad in healthy volunteers in&#xD;
      combination with allopurinol 300 mg, compared with placebo in particular its effect on&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), with focus on the QT/QTc interval&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, 3-period, crossover study to assess the effect on the QTcF interval of a single&#xD;
      oral dose of verinurad 24 mg extended release (ER8) formulation (therapeutic exposure) or&#xD;
      verinurad 40 mg immediate release (IR) formulation (supra-therapeutic exposure), each in&#xD;
      combination with allopurinol 300 mg, compared to placebo in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 study treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: Verinurad 24 mg ER8 formulation co-administered with 300 mg allopurinol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: Verinurad 40 mg IR formulation co-administered with 300 mg allopurinol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C: Matched placebos for both verinurad and allopurinol&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive a single dose of all 3 treatments (A, B, and C) in a cross-over&#xD;
      design with wash-out periods of at least 7 days between each study dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomised to the treatment sequence (ABC, BCA, CAB, etc.) using William's&#xD;
      Latin square. The treatments will be administered in a double-blind manner after an overnight&#xD;
      fast of at least 10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise the following periods (visits):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Period of maximum 28 days (Visit 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three treatment periods of 3 days each, during which subjects will be resident at the&#xD;
           study centre from the morning of the day before administration of the study dose until&#xD;
           discharge 2 days after study dose administration (Visits 2 to 4);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wash-out periods of at least 7 days between each study dose administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final visit within 7 to 10 days after the last study dose administration (Visit 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 53 days and have 5 study visits.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 50 years (inclusive) with suitable veins&#xD;
             for cannulation or repeated venipuncture.&#xD;

&#xD;
        (3) OR, if of childbearing potential, must be willing to use an acceptable method of&#xD;
        contraception to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and 3 months after the&#xD;
        Follow-up Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
