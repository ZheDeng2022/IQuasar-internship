  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical artery dissection (CAD) accounts for about 2% of all strokes, and is a major cause&#xD;
      of stroke in young people (about 15%). Many cases of CAD during pregnancy and puerperium have&#xD;
      been described, suggesting that pregnancy and puerperium may be potential risk factors for&#xD;
      CAD. The purpose of this study is to determine whether pregnancy and puerperium are also&#xD;
      recurrence risk factors for CAD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, all women of childbearing age who had had a CAD between 2005 and 2017 are&#xD;
      selected. Women are identified using the ICD10 diagnostic coding system. In addition, a text&#xD;
      search with key words (&quot;cervical or carotid or vertebral dissection&quot;) has been created in a&#xD;
      data warehouse of the University Hospital of Nantes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the recurrence of CAD during pregnancy and puerperium, the participating women&#xD;
      will be asked to answer to a questionnaire, by phone or mail. The questionnaire will be&#xD;
      conducted by the same investigator, an experienced neurologist. Information about recurrence&#xD;
      of CAD, number of pregnancies before and after the event will be recorded, as well as, the&#xD;
      site of obstetrical monitoring, way of delivery, and management of antithrombotics, in case&#xD;
      of further pregnancy. In case of no further pregnancy after the dissection, the reason will&#xD;
      be explored.&#xD;
