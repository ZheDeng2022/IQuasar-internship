      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ivosidenib when given together&#xD;
      with combination chemotherapy for the treatment of 1DH1 mutant acute myeloid leukemia that&#xD;
      has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Ivosidenib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking the IDH1 mutation and some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, cytarabine, and&#xD;
      filgrastim, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ivosidenib&#xD;
      with combination chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia compared to chemotherapy alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ivosidenib in combination with&#xD;
      fludarabine, cytarabine, plus granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (FLAG)&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety profile of ivosidenib in combination with FLAG chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the rate of complete remission (CR + complete remission with incomplete&#xD;
      hematological recovery [CRi] + complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp])&#xD;
      with ivosidenib in combination with FLAG chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the 1 year progression free survival. IV. To evaluate the 1 year overall&#xD;
      survival. V. To assess the number of patients that receive allogeneic stem cell transplant&#xD;
      after ivosidenib in combination with FLAG chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess for minimal residual disease negativity by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for&#xD;
      IDH1 mutations after treatment with ivosidenib in combination with FLAG chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess for minimal residual disease negativity by PCR for IDH1 mutations after 3&#xD;
      cycles of maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 0-6,&#xD;
      fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) QD over 30 minutes on days 1-5, cytarabine IV QD&#xD;
      over 4 hours on days 1-5, and ivosidenib orally (PO) QD on days 7-28. Treatment continues for&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive filgrastim SC QD on days 0-5, fludarabine phosphate IV QD&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 1-4, cytarabine IV QD over 4 hours on days 1-4, and ivosidenib PO QD&#xD;
      on days 1-28. Treatment continues for 28 days for 1 cycle in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive ivosidenib PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 26 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every month&#xD;
      for up to 1 year.&#xD;
