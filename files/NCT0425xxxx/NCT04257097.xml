  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare two surgical techniques for the treatment of the&#xD;
      maxillary and mandibular bone atrophies.. Therefore, the main purpose is to compare the (i)&#xD;
      the percentage of post-operative complications (ii) the three-dimensional bone gain with&#xD;
      customized titanium meshes (test group - the medical device is digitally designed and made&#xD;
      with customized laser sintering modality, customized to the defect of each patient) and with&#xD;
      titanium-reinforced PTFE mesh (control group - the medical device is cut, shaped, and&#xD;
      manually modelled to the patient's defect by the operator himself.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of the study is based on the fact that manual intra-operative modelling of a&#xD;
      titanium-reinforced PTFE mesh is operator-dependent, and even in the case of very experienced&#xD;
      operators it is always difficult, inaccurate and slow. The use of pre-modelled and&#xD;
      pre-fabricated custom-made meshes with bevel margins and three-dimensional morphology adapted&#xD;
      to the bone defect, would make it possible to carry out an important bone regeneration as it&#xD;
      reduces the operating times, the risks linked to mesh borders, trauma to the soft tissues and&#xD;
      the discomfort for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate, in cases of maxillary and mandibular atrophies characterized by&#xD;
      a vertical and / or combined resorption of the alveolar bone, the complication rate (intra-&#xD;
      and post-operative) and the three-dimensional bone gain after traditional bone regeneration,&#xD;
      where the medical device necessary for bone regeneration is cut out, shaped, and manually&#xD;
      modelled by the operator, compared to digital bone regeneration. Subsequently, the medical&#xD;
      device is digitally designed and made with a computerized method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is, therefore, the evaluation of the healing&#xD;
      complications; in particular, the early or delayed exposure of medical devices used for bone&#xD;
      regeneration, during the healing period. This exposure is, as reported in all clinical&#xD;
      studies, the main cause of the failure of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective, is the quantitative assessment of bone regeneration obtained by the 2&#xD;
      techniques. In particular, the evaluation of the reconstructed bone volume (RBV) with respect&#xD;
      to the planned bone volume (PBV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other targets include the qualitative evaluation of bone regeneration through histological&#xD;
      and histomorphometric analysis of the bone biopsies obtained at the moment that the medical&#xD;
      device is removed and finally the evaluation of the peri-implant bone resorption will be&#xD;
      conducted over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial, which is promoted by Prof. Giuseppe Corinaldesi and the Department of&#xD;
      Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, is designed as a pilot,&#xD;
      randomized, multicentric, independent, parallel-group clinical trial, in which the all&#xD;
      variables will be analysed prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have a selection and enrolment period of approximately 12 months and a&#xD;
      treatment period of approximately 24 months. As a result, the overall duration of the study&#xD;
      will be approximately 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the three-year period 2019/2021, it will include the treatment of 50 patients in good&#xD;
      general health conditions who are affected by partial edentulism of the maxilla or mandible&#xD;
      with vertical and horizontal resorption of the alveolar bone, which requires a prosthetic&#xD;
      rehabilitation supported by implants to improve function and aesthetics of edentulous areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into 2 study groups, according to the previously computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization sequence the following will be assigned to each group: group A (control), 25&#xD;
      patients who will be treated with bone regeneration with titanium-reinforced PTFE mesh,&#xD;
      shaped and manually modelled by the operator during surgery; group B (test), 25 patients will&#xD;
      be treated with bone regeneration with titanium mesh, designed and produced before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 3 different treatment phases: the first phase (T0) involves bone&#xD;
      regeneration using a standard technique (group A) or digital technique (group B); the second&#xD;
      one (T1), subsequently, after 6 months, this will forsee the removal of the regeneration&#xD;
      devices and the insertion of the implants; the third (T2), 3 months after the aforementioned,&#xD;
      will forsee the final functional loading of the implants, with a consequent follow-up of the&#xD;
      regenerated bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the materials and tools that will be used in the study are CE certified (with the&#xD;
      exception of the custom-made mesh which, as a custom-made device, does not require CE&#xD;
      certification) and have already been used in the normal care path for patients who have&#xD;
      undergone bone regeneration. Moreover, the control visits and the radiological investigations&#xD;
      of the data foreseen by the aforementioned protocol will be collected; They will be&#xD;
      summarized in the case report form (CRF), and are those that characterize the normal care&#xD;
      path of patients undergoing necessary bone regeneration for prosthetic implant rehabilitation&#xD;
      when the bone quantity is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of technique B&#xD;
      (digital technique) compared to technique A (traditional technique) in the incidence of&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary objectives include: assessment of patient and operator benefits, reconstructed&#xD;
      bone volume (RBV) compared to planned bone volume (PBV), histological and histomorphometric&#xD;
      analysis of bone quality obtained and peri-implant bone resorption after 12 months of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size necessary to support the null hypothesis is 17 subjects for each group. In&#xD;
      order to compensate for any protocol deviations or possible drop-outs, the number of patients&#xD;
      was increased to 25 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained in the two study groups will be subjected to descriptive statistical&#xD;
      analysis and the differences between groups will be tested by means of appropriate&#xD;
      statistical tests for purely exploratory and non-demonstrative purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be considered as the statistical unit of the analysis, and the statistical&#xD;
      significance will be set at Î± = 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data will be grouped and summarized with respect to the demographic,&#xD;
      anamnestic, and clinical variables of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will be performed using descriptive statistics. The data will be&#xD;
      presented both for the intent-to-treat population and for the per-protocol population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size necessary to support the null hypothesis is 17 subjects for each group. In&#xD;
      order to compensate for any protocol deviations or possible drop-outs, the number of patients&#xD;
      was increased to 25 per group. The sample size was calculated using dedicated statistical&#xD;
      software (STATA, StataCorp LLC) through Pearson's chi-squared test, guaranteeing a level of&#xD;
      significance of 95% and a power of 80%.&#xD;
