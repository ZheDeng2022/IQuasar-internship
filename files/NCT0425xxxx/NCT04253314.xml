  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow and is the most common&#xD;
      acute leukemia in adults. This study will evaluate how well Venetoclax works to treat AML in&#xD;
      adult participants who are ineligible for standard induction therapy in Russian Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is a drug approved to treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia. All study participants will&#xD;
      receive Venetoclax as prescribed by their study doctor in accordance with approved local&#xD;
      label. Adult participants with a diagnosis of AML who are ineligible for standard induction&#xD;
      therapy will be enrolled. Around 50 participants will be enrolled in the study in&#xD;
      approximately 15 sites in Russian Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive venetoclax tablets to be taken by mouth daily according to the&#xD;
      approved local label. The duration of the study is approximately 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is expected to be no additional burden for participants in this trial. All study visits&#xD;
      will occur during routine clinical practice (approximately every 3 months) and participants&#xD;
      will be followed for 18 months.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent adverse events/treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug.</description>
