    <textblock>
      The MitraClip System is the first commercially available catheter-based option for the&#xD;
      treatment of MR. The MitraClip System was developed as an alternate percutaneous technology&#xD;
      which may serve as a viable therapeutic option for open-heart surgery. Treatment with the&#xD;
      MitraClip device allows patients to undergo a less invasive procedure that can&#xD;
      mechanistically reduce MR and allow for improved quality of life. The MitraClip procedure is&#xD;
      performed under general anesthesia without the use of a heart-lung machine, with recovery&#xD;
      typically lasting two to three days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common heart valve condition in the world. MR occurs&#xD;
      when the mitral valve does not close properly, allowing blood to leak back into the upper&#xD;
      chamber of the heart. As a result, the heart may try to pump harder in order to compensate&#xD;
      for the decrease in blood flow to the rest of the body. Patients with severe MR suffer from&#xD;
      debilitating symptoms such as shortness of breath, heart palpitations, lightheadedness, and&#xD;
      fatigue. These patients are at risk of poor quality of life, marked limitation in activity,&#xD;
      repeated heart failure hospitalizations, and increased mortality. Chronic severe MR is often&#xD;
      associated with heart failure and can lead to death if left untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While mitral valve repair or replacement surgery is currently regarded as standard of care,&#xD;
      many patients with clinically significant MR are at an unacceptable risk of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality and are therefore not appropriate surgical candidates. To optimize afterload&#xD;
      reduction and treatment of fluid load, these patients are often treated with medical&#xD;
      management (i.e., beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers) which may&#xD;
      relieve MR symptoms, but does not address the underlying cause of the condition. As a result,&#xD;
      a significant portion of patients treated medically continue to progress to heart failure and&#xD;
      experience an increasingly debilitating quality of life. A significant unmet clinical need&#xD;
      thus exists for the treatment of moderate-to-severe and severe MR in high surgical risk&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MitraClip System has been in clinical use for treatment of significant MR since 2003. The&#xD;
      MitraClip System received CE (Conformité Européenne) Mark for both DMR and FMR indications in&#xD;
      March 2008 and was approved by FDA for DMR indication in October 2013 and for FMR indication&#xD;
      in March 2019. The system is approved for use in more than 102 countries or regions&#xD;
      worldwide. More than 100,000 patients have undergone the MitraClip procedure worldwide. On&#xD;
      June 15, 2020, the MitraClip System has been approved for clinical use in China.&#xD;

    <description>APS is defined as successful implantation of the MitraClip device(s) with resulting MR severity of 2+ or less as determined by the ECL assessment of a discharge echocardiogram (30-day echocardiogram will be used if discharge echocardiogram is unavailable or uninterpretable). Patients who die or who undergo mitral valve surgery before discharge are an APS failure.</description>

    <description>Clinical Endpoints. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life.&#xD;
In the KCCQ, an overall summary score can be derived from the physical function, symptom (frequency and severity), social function and quality of life domains. Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.</description>
