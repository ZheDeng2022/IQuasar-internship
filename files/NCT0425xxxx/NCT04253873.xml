  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gliomas are the most common malignant tumors of the central nervous system and are highly&#xD;
      invasive. Gliomas account for one-third of central nervous system tumors in adults and&#xD;
      children. Interstitial astrocytomas and glioblastomas are also called high-grade gliomas,&#xD;
      accounting for 77.5% of all gliomas.&#xD;

      Temozolomide combined with concurrent radiotherapy, followed by 6 cycles of temozolomide&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy, can prolong the patient's survival, and the 2-year survival rate has&#xD;
      increased from 10.4% to 26.5%. Great progress has been made, but the prognosis for glioma&#xD;
      patients remains poor. For patients with poor-quality high-grade gliomas, more effective new&#xD;
      treatments are urgently needed to achieve the purpose of survival benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeting VEGFs to inhibit tumor angiogenesis has shown good efficacy in a variety of tumors&#xD;
      including colon cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer and breast cancer. However,&#xD;
      for gliomas, anti-tumor angiogenesis drugs can improve patient OS Evidence related to PFS is&#xD;
      still scarce. Compared with other targeted drugs with multiple kinase targets, apatinib has&#xD;
      not only an advantage in price but also less side effects. Therefore, based on relevant data&#xD;
      from previous studies, a basic and clinical study of this apatinib combined with temozolomide&#xD;
      for high-grade gliomas was performed.&#xD;
