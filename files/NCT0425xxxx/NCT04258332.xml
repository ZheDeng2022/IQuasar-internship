  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Salt sensitivity of blood pressure (SSBP) is defined as the change in blood pressure (BP) in&#xD;
      relation to change in salt intake. An increase in BP from low- to high-salt diet is common&#xD;
      and associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, even among&#xD;
      normotensive individuals. Yet, the pathophysiology of SSBP is not well understood. The&#xD;
      prevailing paradigm is that abnormalities of neurohormones that regulate sodium (Na+)&#xD;
      retention and excretion and/or Na+ transporting pathways create Na+ imbalances that underlie&#xD;
      susceptibility to SSBP. As a homeostatic mechanism, BP fluctuates to maintain Na+ balance,&#xD;
      i.e. higher BP is needed for pressure natriuresis to excrete excess Na+. An alternate&#xD;
      framework emphasizes vascular dysregulation as the inciting mechanism. In both constructs,&#xD;
      how Na+ itself influences BP remains incompletely understood. Our preliminary work suggests&#xD;
      that excess Na+ induces a pro-inflammatory state that sustains higher BP. Interleukin-6&#xD;
      (IL-6) drives the induction of interleukin-17 (IL-17) secreting T helper 17 cells that were&#xD;
      recently demonstrated to be pathogenic in response to Na+ exposure. IL-6, IL-17 and related&#xD;
      cytokines regulate renal Na+ transporters and raise BP through vascular inflammation,&#xD;
      fibrosis, and impaired vasodilation. The immune response to high- and low-salt diet in&#xD;
      humans, however, is not completely understood, emphasizing the need for more detailed human&#xD;
      studies, with deeper immune profiling under controlled salt conditions and with neurohormonal&#xD;
      assessment. Our overarching postulate is that the inflammatory response to excess dietary&#xD;
      salt intake is associated with SSBP. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults&#xD;
      (CARDIA) study is the ideal cohort in which to translate our preliminary findings.&#xD;
      Investigators propose to investigate SSBP in CARDIA using standardized low- and high-salt&#xD;
      diets and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. Investigators will quantify SSBP in a total of&#xD;
      500 participants from the Chicago and Birmingham field centers during the upcoming year 35&#xD;
      exam (beginning in 2020). Our specific aims are: 1) to define the distribution of SSBP and&#xD;
      its clinical correlates in a contemporary community-based US cohort of middle-aged&#xD;
      individuals; 2) to investigate the immune response to dietary salt loading, and 3) to&#xD;
      investigate the association between the immune and BP responses to dietary salt loading. The&#xD;
      proposed study represents a unique opportunity to leverage a large, well-phenotyped cohort to&#xD;
      test novel hypotheses regarding SSBP. Phenotyping SSBP using standardized high- and low-salt&#xD;
      diets in CARDIA will be novel as this has never been performed in any of the existing US&#xD;
      based NHLBI sponsored cardiovascular epidemiologic cohorts. The proposed work has the&#xD;
      potential to yield a more readily available approach for differentiating an individual as&#xD;
      salt-sensitive or resistant. New insights into the pathophysiology of SSBP should also&#xD;
      provide a foundation for investigating high-impact clinical applications, by informing future&#xD;
      studies of therapies directed at SSBP. The scientific rigor is further enhanced by the rich&#xD;
      clinical, genetic, and biochemical data available in CARDIA.&#xD;

    <description>The high-salt diet will be achieved through the supplementation of each participant's usual diet with Na+ bullion packets (2 packets per day). This will increase Na+ intake by approximately 2,200 mg (≈100 mEq Na+) to a total greater than 5,000 mg Na+ per day based on prior estimates of Na+ intake (see section C1.2). In addition, 1,000 mg of calcium carbonate (provided via Tums tablets) will be taken daily on the high Na+ diet to reduce the potential impact of changes in calcium intake on blood pressure.&#xD;
The low-salt diet is comprised of 7 days of freshly prepared frozen meals, snacks, and Na+ free water. All low-salt meals will be prepared in each site's Metabolic Kitchen, with standardization of diets across sites. The low-salt diet includes: 20 mEq Na+ (±2 mEq) (460 mg/day), 100 mEq potassium (±2 mEq), and 1,000 mg calcium (±50 mg).</description>
