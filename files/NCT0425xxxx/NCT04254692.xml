  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of liposomal&#xD;
      bupivacaine in optimizing pain control, minimizing the risk of postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV), and improving recovery after abdominoplasty. This will be done by comparing&#xD;
      intraoperative abdominal wall and incisional injection of bupivacaine to bupivacaine plus&#xD;
      liposomal bupivacaine in 46 participants 18 years and older undergoing elective&#xD;
      abdominoplasty. This will be studied using pain assessments, validated surveys, medication&#xD;
      logs and review of medical records.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting can be frustrating sequelae of elective surgery.&#xD;
      Poorly managed postoperative pain can lead to increased opioid use, increased postoperative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting (PONV), delayed return to work and usual activities, unplanned hospital&#xD;
      admissions, surgical complications, and patient dissatisfaction. In light of the growing&#xD;
      opioid epidemic in the United States, any intervention that potentially minimizes opioid use&#xD;
      may have meaningful individual and societal impact. Despite the use of multiple techniques&#xD;
      for managing postoperative pain in abdominoplasty patients, pain control continues to be a&#xD;
      challenge for this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One technique commonly employed to improve pain control is the use of abdominal wall and&#xD;
      incisional injection of local anesthetic agents to block the sensory nerves supplying the&#xD;
      anterior abdominal wall and abdominal incisions in order to decrease sensation and pain in&#xD;
      the abdomen in the setting of abdominoplasty surgery. Local anesthetic often used in this&#xD;
      procedure is bupivacaine (Marcaine) Â± epinephrine. However, in 2012, a liposomal bupivacaine&#xD;
      suspension (Exparel; Pacira BioSciences, Inc, San Diego, California) was introduced as a&#xD;
      longer-acting local anesthetic used for management of postoperative pain. At the University&#xD;
      of Wisconsin, patients undergoing abdominoplasty routinely receive intraoperative injection&#xD;
      of local anesthetic to the abdominal wall and abdominal incisions, using bupivacaine as the&#xD;
      local anesthetic, along with standard multimodal perioperative pain management including cool&#xD;
      compresses, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of liposomal&#xD;
      bupivacaine in optimizing pain control, minimizing the risk of PONV, and improving recovery&#xD;
      after abdominoplasty. This will be done by comparing intraoperative abdominal wall and&#xD;
      incisional injection of bupivacaine to bupivacaine plus liposomal bupivacaine in patients&#xD;
      undergoing abdominoplasty. This will be studied using pain assessments, validated surveys,&#xD;
      medication logs and review of medical records.&#xD;
