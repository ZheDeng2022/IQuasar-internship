      A Post-market Clinical Follow-up Study to provide safety, performance and clinical benefits&#xD;
      data on the Exceed ABT acetabular cup (implants and instruments) when used in combination&#xD;
      with ceramic liners or polyethylene articulating liners bearing Options.&#xD;

      Study Aim: To collect survivorship and clinical outcomes long-term data confirm-ing safety,&#xD;
      performance and clinical benefits of the Exceed ABT ce-mentless cup when used in combination&#xD;
      with ceramic and polyeth-ylene articulating liners&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical performance - as measured by clinical score data (HHS, WOMAC and Oxford Hip Score),&#xD;
      radiographic as-sessments and survivorship which will be based on removal of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated by monitoring incidence of adverse events. Length of study: 13 years&#xD;
      (3 years enrollment plus 10 years follow-up): Post-operative follow-up visits at: 1, 3, 5, 7&#xD;
      and 10 years&#xD;
