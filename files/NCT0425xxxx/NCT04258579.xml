  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed EM/PROTECT, a behavioral intervention for depressed EM (elderly&#xD;
      mistreatment) victims, to work in synergy with EM mistreatment resolution services that&#xD;
      provide safety planning, support services, and links to legal services. PROTECT is built on a&#xD;
      model which postulates that chronic stress promotes dysfunction of the cognitive control&#xD;
      (CCN) and reward networks, impairing the victims' ability to flexibly respond to the&#xD;
      environment and limits their reward activities. PROTECT therapists work with victims to&#xD;
      develop action plans to reduce stress, and to increase rewarding experiences. EM/PROTECT has&#xD;
      been designed in an iterative process with community EM providers of the New York City (NYC)&#xD;
      Department for the Aging (DFTA) to use agencies' routine PHQ-9 depression screening and&#xD;
      referral for service. In the current study, the investigators will compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of EM/PROTECT with EM enriched with staff training in linking EM victims to community mental&#xD;
      health services (EM/MH). The investigators intend to enroll 50 subjects that will participate&#xD;
      in the study for approximately 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 9 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In all conditions, the change in clinically significant depressive symptoms as measured on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Scores are categorized as following: 0 to 6 - Normal /symptom absent. 7 to 19 - Mild depression. 20 to 34 - Moderate depression. &gt;34 - Severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in assessment of Quality of Life, as measured by the WHO-QOL</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 9 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In all conditions, changes in assessment of quality of life measured by the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHO-QOL) scale. Scores across 4 domains (Physical Health, Psychological, Social Relationships, and Environment) range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating a higher quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in assessment of stress, as measured by the PSS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In all conditions, changes in assessment of stress measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scale. Scores range from 0-40. Scores ranging from 0-13 are considered low stress, scores ranging from 14-26 are considered moderate stress, and scores ranging from 27-40 are considered high perceived stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in assessment of exposure to meaningful activities, as measured by the BADS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In all conditions, changes in assessment of meaningful activities measured by the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS). Scores are divided across 4 domains: Activation subscale scores range from 0-42, Avoidance/Rumination subscale scores range from 0-48, Work/School Impairment subscale scores range from 0-30, Social Impairment subscale scores range from 0-30. For all subscales, high scores are consistent with the subscale title (e.g., high scores on Activation subscale = more activation).</description>
