      An increasing number of women are reporting a collection of non-specific systemic symptoms&#xD;
      thought to be caused by their breast implants. The term Breast Implant Illness or &quot;BII&quot;&#xD;
      originated with several social media groups. There is no current pathophysiologic explanation&#xD;
      or diagnostic test for BII; it is not a recognized medical disease at this time. Recently&#xD;
      several studies have been designed and funded to study the role of psychological and social&#xD;
      behavioral factors. This study has been designed to scientifically analyze biospecimens from&#xD;
      three cohorts of age matched women in the United States. This study aims to address the&#xD;
      questions asked by patients, physicians, and the FDA with regard to the scientific validity&#xD;
      of BII.&#xD;
