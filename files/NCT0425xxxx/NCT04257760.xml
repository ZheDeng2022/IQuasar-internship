  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative illness which currently has&#xD;
      no medical cure. It is routinely accompanied by a significant symptom burden including high&#xD;
      levels of distress in patients and their caregivers. As a result, an early palliative care&#xD;
      approach is recommended in the ALS population. Palliative care has been shown to have&#xD;
      positive effects on the quality of life in patients and caregivers in other life limiting&#xD;
      illness such as cancer and multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, our understanding of the&#xD;
      palliative care needs in ALS is limited and the efficacy of palliative care involvement is&#xD;
      poorly understood. Furthermore, ALS patients are largely underserved by palliative care in&#xD;
      Ontario, with &lt;50% of ALS patients receiving palliative care even in the last year of life.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that ALS patients will be agreeable to palliative&#xD;
      care consultations and that this will improve the quality of life of patients and their&#xD;
      caregivers. Specific Aims: This project seeks to initiate routine palliative care&#xD;
      consultation in an interdisciplinary ALS clinic to: 1) improve patient and caregiver quality&#xD;
      of life, 2) further understand the palliative care needs of the ALS population and 3)&#xD;
      identify which patients and caregivers are most likely to benefit from palliative care&#xD;
      consultation, thus guiding clinicians on when to refer in the future. Significance: This&#xD;
      study is the first investigate the feasibility and efficacy of palliative care consultation&#xD;
      in the ALS population, and its effects on quality of life. It has the potential to provide&#xD;
      increased support to patients as well as caregivers. Finally, this study will aid in our&#xD;
      understanding of the optimal time to involve palliative care in the ALS population and will&#xD;
      act as a foundation on which larger, controlled studies can be built.&#xD;

      Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible for the study will be asked by their ALS care team if they would&#xD;
      like to speak to the research assistant about the study. Patients may also self refer if they&#xD;
      hear about the study and are interested in learning more about it. As a part of this study,&#xD;
      participants will meet briefly with a palliative care (PC) physician to discuss the goals of&#xD;
      palliative care and the interventions a palliative care physician can provide. As part of the&#xD;
      study, patients will be offered the choice of a palliative care consultation (in a timely&#xD;
      manner - either at home or at the ALS clinic) or no palliative care consultation.&#xD;
      Participants will fill out a brief questionnaire regarding their interest in a PC&#xD;
      consultation. Relevant demographic information such as time since diagnosis and functional&#xD;
      ability will be collected for all patients included in the study. This study is planned to&#xD;
      recruit patients for the period of one year, with a total study period of 18 months (i.e. the&#xD;
      first patient included to the study will be followed until death or for 18 months and the&#xD;
      last patient recruited to the study will be followed for 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who agree to participate in the study, will be asked to complete two scales&#xD;
      which measure quality of life: The ALS Specific Quality of Life Revised Scale (ALSSQOL-R,) a&#xD;
      validated instrument to measure quality of life in ALS patients (8, 15) and the Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a validated instrument for measuring anxiety and&#xD;
      depression in patients and caregivers(16). These scales will be completed at baseline, 1&#xD;
      month, 3 months and every 3 months for the entirety of the study period. Caregivers will&#xD;
      complete the HADS at the same time interval. The ALSSQOL-R and HADS require 10-20 minutes and&#xD;
      2-5 minutes to complete, respectively (15, 17). The ALSSQOL-R is routinely used as pre-visit&#xD;
      screening in multidisciplinary ALS clinics and is felt to be feasible in the ALS&#xD;
      population(15). The invitation to the study and coordination of survey completion will be led&#xD;
      by a research assistant and not a member of the patient's care team. Survey completion rates&#xD;
      and feasibility of routine completion will be examined. Qualitative reasons for declining a&#xD;
      PC consult at the time of study initiation, as reported by patients on the consent to PC&#xD;
      consultation questionnaire, will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and caregivers who receive a PC consult as a part of the study period will complete&#xD;
      a questionnaire focusing on their satisfaction with the consultation, its timeliness (i.e.&#xD;
      too early or too late in their illness trajectory) and any fatigue or distress which resulted&#xD;
      from the consultation. Follow-up PC assessments will occur as determined by the patient and&#xD;
      PC physician. Patients and caregivers who decline participation in the study as well as those&#xD;
      who are included in the study but declined PC consultation will continue with usual care and&#xD;
      thus be referred to a PC specialist at the discretion of their physicians. A detailed&#xD;
      overview of the plan for study recruitment and planned outcome measures are outlined in&#xD;
      Figure 1 and Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses Strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on several different outcomes as listed in Table 1. The main outcome&#xD;
      will be the effect of PC consultation on patient and caregiver quality of life. This will be&#xD;
      determined by evaluating a change in ALSSQOL-R and HADS scores in patients and caregivers&#xD;
      over time, both individually and between the groups of patients who received and did not&#xD;
      receive a PC consult. Unfortunately, there are no previously reported minimally important&#xD;
      differences for these scales in the ALS population. Difference in quality of life indicators&#xD;
      will be examined between patients who received PC involvement and those in the usual care&#xD;
      group. Mean quality of life scores will be compared at different time points post&#xD;
      consultation and statistical significance will be determined using t-tests. Quality of life&#xD;
      scores pre and post palliative care consultation will also be examined in patients and&#xD;
      caregivers at different time points. They will be reported as mean scores (+95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals) and significant change will be determined using univariate analyses. As this study&#xD;
      has a focus on describing the PC needs of the ALS population, chart reviews of PC consults&#xD;
      will be completed to identify the major themes and issues discussed in PC consults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process measures for this study will also be examined. These include the proportion of&#xD;
      patients that were approached who consented to be in the study, proportion of patients in the&#xD;
      study who choose a PC consultation, the duration of the PC consultation, the number of&#xD;
      follow-up appointments per patient, the delay between enrollment in the study and initial PC&#xD;
      consultation. The acceptability and satisfaction with PC involvement will be assessed by&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative measures including patient and caregiver self-reported reasons&#xD;
      for accepting or declining a PC consultation and responses to post PC satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire. Balancing measures and potential negative effects of PC consultation,&#xD;
      including anxiety and fatigue, will be assessed via the post PC consultation satisfaction&#xD;
      scale. If data allows, subsequent studies may focus on the change in health care utilization&#xD;
      (i.e. emergency department visits, hospitalizations etc.) in the group of patients who&#xD;
      received PC when compared to the usual care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the variability in presentation and often rapid clinical decline experienced by&#xD;
      patients with ALS, the idea of early PC for all patients is likely not feasible and unlikely&#xD;
      to be beneficial. Some patients may experience significant impairment and the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis and benefit from immediate referral, while others may experience a period of&#xD;
      stability and be comfortable without referral. Considering this, a goal of this study is&#xD;
      understanding which factors are most likely to prompt a referral to PC, and which patients&#xD;
      are most likely to benefit from a PC referral. As a part of the study, PC consultations and&#xD;
      patient records will be reviewed and demographic information such as ALS Functional Rating&#xD;
      Scale score (ALSFRS -R), time since diagnosis and the presence or absence of symptoms will be&#xD;
      considered. This will be linked to reported quality of life scores to identify which factors&#xD;
      are most likely to improve with PC referral and which factors are most associated the need&#xD;
      for PC referral. This will help guide clinicians nationwide as to when to consider PC&#xD;
      referrals in their patients, with the goal of ensuring patients have timely access to PC at&#xD;
      the appropriate time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, there is immense potential to improve patient quality of life with this project.&#xD;
      It is the first to introduce routine PC into a multi-disciplinary ALS clinic in Ontario, a&#xD;
      population that is largely underserviced by PC. It seeks to understand the physical and&#xD;
      emotional factors which limit patient quality of life and links to physicians and resources&#xD;
      to act on these issues. This project also plans to improve the quality of life of caregivers,&#xD;
      providing increased support and further understanding of caregiver needs. The investigators&#xD;
      hope to identify the factors that make a patient/caregiver most likely to benefit from PC;&#xD;
      which will guide referral criteria for all patients with ALS and ensure that PC consultations&#xD;
      are available to patients at a timely manner when it is most likely to be impactful. Finally,&#xD;
      this study will improve the capacity of current health care providers to address patient and&#xD;
      caregiver quality of life concerns. It will provide a new foundation of knowledge on which&#xD;
      larger, controlled studies can be built in the future.&#xD;
