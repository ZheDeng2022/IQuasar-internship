    <textblock>
      GNX-001 is an open-label, phase 1, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion study of GNX102&#xD;
      infused every 21 days. Approximately 30 patients may be enrolled in the dose escalation&#xD;
      portion of this study. Once the MTD or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been identified,&#xD;
      up to 15 additional patients may be enrolled in one or two expansion cohort(s) at one or two&#xD;
      dose levels recommended by the Safety Review Committee) to confirm the safety profile of the&#xD;
      RP2D and provide additional information on anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with adeno- or epithelial-cancers that have a likelihood of GNX102 targeted antigen&#xD;
      expression based on previous studies, including colorectal, hepatocellular, non-small cell&#xD;
      lung, gastric, breast, pancreatic, cutaneous, acral, or mucosal melanoma, esophageal,&#xD;
      prostate, and epithelial uterine cancers, can be screened for enrollment in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GNX102 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) developed by GlycoNex. GNX102 binds with high&#xD;
      affinity to branched Lewis B/Lewis Y (LeB/LeY) glycans, which are novel glycans caused by&#xD;
      glycosylation changes in tumors. The monomeric LeB and LeY are blood group related antigens,&#xD;
      commonly present in healthy adult tissues at low to moderate levels, but are overexpressed in&#xD;
      multiple carcinomas and their presence correlates with tumor development and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Higher affinity for branched LeB/LeY glycans is intended to allow GNX102 to discriminate&#xD;
      between the monomeric LeB and LeY glycans presented on normal tissues from the branched LeB&#xD;
      and LeY glycans present on cancer tissues. This preferential binding to branched LeB/LeY&#xD;
      versus monomeric LeB and LeY could improve the therapeutic index by both improving&#xD;
      selectivity for tumor cells and reducing toxicity to normal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product GNX102 will be administered as an intravenous infusion over one&#xD;
      hour every 21 days as a single agent. One cycle is 21 days in duration. Patients may continue&#xD;
      to receive study drug every 21 days without interruption between cycles unless there is&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or experiences progressive disease. A dose delay of up to 14 days is&#xD;
      permitted between cycles to address toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GNX102 starting dose will be 1 mg/kg and escalating to 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg and 60&#xD;
      mg/kg. This dosing schedule is designed to start with a dose that is anticipated to produce&#xD;
      an exposure level in patients that has some potential to provide clinical benefit yet is&#xD;
      many-fold below an exposure level that was associated with an acceptable safety profile in&#xD;
      toxicology studies. The half-log dose escalation strategy is designed to ensure that there&#xD;
      are clinically meaningful differences in GNX102 exposure between successive cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to five (5) dose levels are planned during dose escalation. Dose escalation will depend on&#xD;
      the number and intensity of observed toxicities as well as review of available&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK data). A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review available safety and&#xD;
      PK data as relevant to make recommendations related to selection of dose and schedule (dosing&#xD;
      interval), as well as modifications to PK time points. At the recommendation of the SRC, a&#xD;
      cohort may be repeated or intermediate dose levels between scheduled dose levels may be&#xD;
      explored during the escalation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will follow a standard oncology 3+3 design with a dose-escalation schema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients may be enrolled in the dose expansion cohorts. Once the MTD has been&#xD;
      determined in the dose escalation phase of the study, approximately 15 additional patients&#xD;
      may be enrolled in one or two dose expansion cohort(s) (at the MTD and one lower dose level)&#xD;
      to further assess safety and the RP2D as well as anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with FDA COVID-19 Guidance on the Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical&#xD;
      Products during COVID-19 Pandemic (dated March 18, 2020; updated March 27, 2020; updated&#xD;
      April 16, 2020), GlycoNex and the Contract Research Organization (CRO), Linical Americas,&#xD;
      supporting this study are modifying their processes and procedures in alignment with FDA&#xD;
      Guidance to ensure the safety of study participants, while streamlining study conduct and&#xD;
      decreasing the burden on patients and sites. The intent is to reduce visits, procedures&#xD;
      and/or tests that are considered non-essential in order to assure patient safety and address&#xD;
      the most important trial objectives. The SRC may determine that procedures or visits need to&#xD;
      be rescheduled or omitted. The IRB will be notified promptly of such change(s) and a&#xD;
      subsequent amendment will be provided in a timely manner.&#xD;
