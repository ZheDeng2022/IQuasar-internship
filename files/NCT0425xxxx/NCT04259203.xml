  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacity of Erickson hypnosis in the treatment of chronic pain in&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease. Half of participants will follow a 2-month Erickson&#xD;
      hypnosis protocole, while the other half will benefit from the usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of patients with Parkinson's disease suffer of chronic pain directly&#xD;
      related to the disease. The management of painful symptoms is difficult and currently, there&#xD;
      is no commonly admitted guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown the efficacy of Erickson hypnosis to reduce the perception of&#xD;
      chronic pain in different conditions. This efficacy has never been tested in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Erickson hypnosis protocol, compared&#xD;
      to usual care, for the management of Parkinson's disease-related chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team assume that Erickson hypnosis will be more efficient than usual care to reduce&#xD;
      perceived chronic pain. They also assume that regular practice of autohypnosis will&#xD;
      contribute to long-term efficacy.&#xD;
