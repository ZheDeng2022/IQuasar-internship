    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a chronic multifactorial inflammatory disease associated with dysbiotic&#xD;
      plaque biofilms and characterized by progressive destruction of the tooth supporting&#xD;
      apparatus. Its primary features include the loss of periodontal tissue support, manifested&#xD;
      through clinical attachment loss (CAL) and radiographically assessed alveolar bone loss,&#xD;
      presence of periodontal pocketing and gingival bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontitis is multifactorial inflammatory disease with numerous systemic or local risk&#xD;
      factors playing a part in its clinical sequences. Periodontitis causes increased local&#xD;
      inflammation as well as contributes to systemic inflammation with an increase in the levels&#xD;
      of local and systemic inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α),&#xD;
      interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 (IL-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and&#xD;
      microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase bone fragility&#xD;
      and susceptibility to fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of osteoporosis occurs through spontaneous increase in pro-inflammatory and&#xD;
      pro-osteoclastic cytokines such as TNF-α , IL-6 and IL-1 β that activates receptor activator&#xD;
      of nuclear factor-Kb ligand (RANKL) leading to an enhanced ability of osteoclasts to resorb&#xD;
      bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Studies on systemic influence of periodontitis have suggested that locally produced&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β , TNF-α and IL-6 may be released into circulation.&#xD;
      Most studies shows that IL-6 and TNF-α is major cytokine responsible for resorption of bone&#xD;
      in osteoporosis and increase of bone turnover markers. Periodontitis is chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      disease characterized by destruction of tooth supporting tissues by virtue of the immunologic&#xD;
      response to bacterial challenge originating from dental plaque. In Periodontitis, the&#xD;
      increased released of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF- α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in systemic&#xD;
      circulation which causes increase in systemic bone loss through their osteoclastic activity.&#xD;
      The systemic inflammation and rate of bone loss is measured by systemic inflammatory and bone&#xD;
      resorption markers respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Till date there is no conclusive interventional study done on impact of management of&#xD;
      periodontitis on systemic inflammation and bone resorption markers in pre-menopausal women&#xD;
      with periodontitis and low bone mineral density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY The study will be conducted as follows This prospective interventional study will&#xD;
      be conducted in the department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Post Graduate Institute&#xD;
      of Dental Sciences (PGIDS), Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontitis patients with low bone mineral density (BMD) will be recruited from the&#xD;
      outpatient department of PGIDS, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated using G power software using t test to compare difference between&#xD;
      two matched (dependent) means . Total sample size was calculated as 34. A total of 38&#xD;
      patients will be recruited expecting a 10% dropout rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, periodontal parameters plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on&#xD;
      probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL) will be assessed at six&#xD;
      sites (disto-buccal, mid-buccal, mesio-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual and disto-lingual)&#xD;
      per tooth excluding third molars. Periodontal examination would be performed at baseline and&#xD;
      8 weeks after scaling and root planing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recording periodontal parameters at baseline, oral hygiene instructions would be given&#xD;
      and scaling and root planning would be done. Patient would be recalled at after 8 weeks of&#xD;
      complete scaling and root planing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection and serum analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessing markers of systemic inflammation and bone resorption, serum samples will be&#xD;
      collected from venipuncture in antecubital fossa at 8 hours and after an overnight fasting&#xD;
      for all subjects at baseline in individuals meeting the inclusion criteria. Serum samples&#xD;
      would again be analyzed for systemic markers at 8 weeks after scaling and root planing in&#xD;
      individuals who have bleeding on probing (BOP) less than 10% of the total sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters of systemic inflammation that would be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-6 (IL-6) Tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) Total leukocyte count(TLC) Differential&#xD;
      leukocyte count (DLC) Platelet count Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (N/L) mean platelet volume&#xD;
      platelet distribution width&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic marker of bone resorption that would be analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (s-CTX-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric parameter that would be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Mass Index (BMI) calculated as weight/height 2 (Kg/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-menopausal women having stage 2 or stage 3 periodontitis would be enrolled to participate&#xD;
      in the study .Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry scan would be done for screening patients with&#xD;
      low bone mineral density (osteopenia/osteoporosis). Those who fulfill the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      would be enrolled in the study clinical periodontal parameters(CAL,PD,and BOP) would be&#xD;
      recorded and venous blood samples for measuring serum levels of IL-6,TNF-α, and serum CTX-1&#xD;
      would be collected. Scaling and root planing would be performed in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be re-evaluated after 8 weeks for recording all the periodontal parameters and&#xD;
      systemic inflammation (IL-6 and TNF-α,) and systemic resorption marker (serum CTX-1 ).&#xD;
