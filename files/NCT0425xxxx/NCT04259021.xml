  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before an anesthetic procedure, airway management is essential to ensure adequate ventilation&#xD;
      and breathing of the patient during the entire surgical process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preanesthetic evaluation of the airway allows for proper planning, facilitates the&#xD;
      anticipation of human resources and necessary means to face the possible challenges in a safe&#xD;
      and efficient way. Orofacial mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation are a crucial step&#xD;
      in general anesthesia. Most of the time, management is not complicated, but when an&#xD;
      unpredicted difficult airway occurs, it is currently one of the most important challenges to&#xD;
      face as an anesthesiologist. These situations are rare as the prevalence of a difficult&#xD;
      airway is approximately 2.2% of the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When there is a case of a difficult airway and adequate management is not achieved, very&#xD;
      serious complications may occur including brain damage, cardio-respiratory arrest, aspiration&#xD;
      of gastric content, traumatic airway injuries, tooth damage, unnecessary surgical access to&#xD;
      keep the airway permeable or death. For these reasons, in anesthesia, an unforeseen difficult&#xD;
      airway is considered a crisis situation. Therefore, a preoperative airway assessment is&#xD;
      paramount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional predictive tests evaluate multiple anthropometric characteristics in which the&#xD;
      physical presence of the patient is mandatory. However, no test can currently predict a&#xD;
      difficult airway based on a single characteristic nor in the patient's absence. Nowadays, the&#xD;
      optimization of resources and new technologies have increased interest in developing new&#xD;
      tests or methods for preoperatively assessing the difficulty of the airway and new methods of&#xD;
      airway evaluation have been proposed. As recently demonstrated, the detection of a difficult&#xD;
      airway depends not only on the morphology but also on functional traits of the airway. Some&#xD;
      studies propose the analysis of voice parameters as a reflection of anatomical and functional&#xD;
      features of the superior airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that the analysis of voice characteristics could reflect the&#xD;
      airway's anatomy and therefore the investigators will be able to predict a difficult airway,&#xD;
      and this would enable the development of a voice-based assessment method which could have an&#xD;
      promising role in facilitating telematic airway evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proper airway management is essential for safe anesthesia practice. In particular,&#xD;
      ventilation with an orofacial mask and endotracheal intubation are a crucial step in general&#xD;
      anesthesia. The prevalence of a difficult airway is approximately 2.2% although it can vary&#xD;
      greatly according to different groups of patients. It is defined, according to the American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiology, as the clinical situation in which an experienced anesthesiologist&#xD;
      has difficulty with ventilation using a face mask, during endotracheal intubation or both.&#xD;
      Although other definitions also exist and include difficulty in ventilation or placement of&#xD;
      supraglottic devices, difficult laryngoscopy defined by a 3 or 4 grade on the Cormack-Lehane&#xD;
      scale or multiple attempts at intubation. A case of an unexpected difficult airway can lead&#xD;
      to minor complications, such as loss or damage to teeth, pharynx or entail severe injuries,&#xD;
      such as aspiration of gastric content, laryngeal lesions, respiratory failure,&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory arrest or even death. Furthermore, complications increase considerably when&#xD;
      there are no alternative plans and multiple repeated attempts at intubation are made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the factors that mostly contribute to complications when an unanticipated difficult&#xD;
      airway is found are due to deficiencies in identification, communication, preoperative&#xD;
      planning and lack of training. An unpredicted difficult airway is a situation in which&#xD;
      decision making is difficult, management is complex, and it is considered a crisis situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of evaluation and management of the airway is such that different study groups&#xD;
      within the main scientific societies of anesthesiologists are dedicated to studying and&#xD;
      implementing protocols with the aim of avoiding these risky situations. A difficult airway&#xD;
      should be detected during the pre-anesthetic visit, thus allowing the anesthesiologist to&#xD;
      evaluate the patient, identify risk factors, advance to possible complications, and prepare&#xD;
      an appropriate anesthetic plan. This means organizing both material and personal help,&#xD;
      informing the patient; changing the type of anesthesia or even postponing elective surgeries&#xD;
      to schedule them when the patient is correctly optimized making sure that the means in which&#xD;
      the surgical procedure is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the surgical procedure and the initial anesthetic plan, the evaluation of the&#xD;
      airway should always be performed with all patients since any sedation or regional anesthesia&#xD;
      can be converted into a general anesthesia and require control of the airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, an increase in the efficiency of health procedures without the loss of&#xD;
      safety or quality is expected. An attempt to protocolize a remote preoperative evaluation&#xD;
      (telephone call) has been made which patients undergoing low complexity procedures. However,&#xD;
      the most important limiting factor in remote pre-anesthetic evaluation is the inability to&#xD;
      perform the airway assessment properly. Although there are risk factors that can be detected&#xD;
      with a medical history such as a previous record of a difficult airway, obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea syndrome, hoarseness, dysphonia or obesity, the traditional evaluative predictive tests&#xD;
      require the physical presence of the patient and are based on the physical examination of the&#xD;
      patient such as thyroid-chin distance, cervical mobility, mouth opening and subluxation&#xD;
      capacity, or the assessment of pharyngeal structures by the Mallampati test consisting of the&#xD;
      direct visualization of the upper airway. However, no test can predict a difficult airway&#xD;
      based on a single characteristic in the patient's absence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined evaluation of several risk factors obtains greater sensitivity than when&#xD;
      analyzed in isolation. This is the case of the Arn√© Test, which consists of a multifactorial&#xD;
      index that offers a sensitivity and specificity greater than 90% to predict a difficult&#xD;
      airway when a score greater than or equal to 11 is obtained. In this context, new evaluation&#xD;
      methods have appeared, such as ultrasound or other imaging tests, which intend to correlate&#xD;
      the anatomical images of the airway with the presence of a difficult airway. But, the&#xD;
      detection of a difficult airway depends not only on the morphology, but also on its&#xD;
      functional characteristics. With the introduction of new technologies many attempts to&#xD;
      develop other methods to predict a difficult airway such as facial recognition based on image&#xD;
      processing have been made, however they have not succeeded yet. Other investigators propose&#xD;
      the analysis of voice parameters as a reflection of anatomical and functional characteristics&#xD;
      of the superior airway. Specifically, studies carried out in the field of maxillofacial&#xD;
      surgery describe how the expansion of the maxilla affects the widening of the upper airway&#xD;
      and, consequently, in the formation of the vowels and how this translates into a variation in&#xD;
      the properties of the voice, such as frequency or amplitude. Accordingly, the investigators&#xD;
      propose that voice characteristic analysis could reflect the airway's anatomy and be able to&#xD;
      predict a difficult airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on this, the investigators aim to develop a voice airway assessment method that&#xD;
      replaces anthropometric parameters evaluated in traditional tests to predict a difficult&#xD;
      airway, facilitating a remote airway evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voice recording will be made through a smart phone application to patients who are going to&#xD;
      undergo general anesthesia and require orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation, by direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy, at the pre-anesthetic visit. The day of the surgical procedure, the result of&#xD;
      the intubation - whether or not a difficult airway exists- will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The records of the mobile application database will be downloaded, the voice signal will be&#xD;
      processed, and parameters related to frequency, morphology and perturbation will be extracted&#xD;
      employing Matlab¬Æ as these are considered continuous variables, to determine the statistical&#xD;
      significance of the differences within parameters. The non-parametric test of&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov will be used for an easy and a difficult independent airway groups. Thus,&#xD;
      these variables will be introduced into several classification algorithms obtained by&#xD;
      combined methods using machine learning in order to predict the classification of patients&#xD;
      according to the Cormack scale grade and sensitivity and specificity will be determined to&#xD;
      assess their ability to predict a difficult airway. The area under the receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic curve will be used to assess the ability of the method to predict difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment period will take place over a period of 12 months or until the estimated&#xD;
      sample size is reached. The total duration of the study will be approximately 6 months years,&#xD;
      ending with a total of 800 patients.&#xD;
