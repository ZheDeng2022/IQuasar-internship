  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is not only amongst the top 3 most common cancer type in both men and women, but&#xD;
      also the leading cause of cancer mortality in Singapore and the United States. Platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy is currently the mainstay in drug treatment for lung cancer patients although it&#xD;
      only relieves disease-related symptoms temporarily. Recently, the use of molecularly targeted&#xD;
      therapy has led to improved survival in subsets of patients. In particular, the presence of&#xD;
      EGFR or ALK mutations from lung biopsies predicts improved response rate and progression-free&#xD;
      survival from the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or crizotinib respectively. Importantly,&#xD;
      EGFR mutations are more common in tumors of Asian patients (about 35%) versus non-Asians&#xD;
      (about 10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main cause of mortality in patients with solid cancers is metastases from dissemination&#xD;
      via blood circulation. The ability to detect the presence of tumor cells in circulation even&#xD;
      before overt metastases occur has evolved rapidly in recent years. The prognostic importance&#xD;
      of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in several cancers has&#xD;
      been found and this technique is widely recognized to be of major clinical and biologic&#xD;
      importance. This study evaluates the use of ctDNA and CTCs in predicting disease activity and&#xD;
      drug response in lung cancer patients and serves to complement existing methods to achieve a&#xD;
      non-invasive and accurate means to guide treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, the use of ctDNA and CTCs as a marker for risk assessment and treatment monitoring is&#xD;
      advantageous as it is accessible may be monitored on a regular basis on a non-invasive basis.&#xD;
      This will better tailor our surveillance programmes and treatment to optimize disease&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators have developed an EGFR mutation detection kit that detects the 3 main EGFR&#xD;
      mutations at ultrasensitive levels. The Investigators have applied this to a variety of&#xD;
      clinical materials including formalin-fixed paraffin embedded DNA, pleural effusions,&#xD;
      circulating DNA as well as circulating tumor cells and found that the kits can pick up these&#xD;
      mutations with high sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A microsieve membrane filter device to effectively isolate circulating tumor cells from whole&#xD;
      blood sample has been developed by the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology. The&#xD;
      device exploits the size difference between cancer cells and blood cells to achieve the&#xD;
      cancer cell capture on a microsieve filter with &gt; 85% recovery rate from 4.5-ml whole blood&#xD;
      within 10 min, demonstrated with cancer cells spiked into whole blood samples. The device&#xD;
      contains a densely packed pore array (&gt; 8000 pores/mm^2) with an optimized pore diameter of&#xD;
      10 Âµm. Fluid regulation and cell counting are achieved by a simple vacuum pumping and&#xD;
      laboratory fluorescence microscope. The captured cells are stained with anti-EpCAM-PE for&#xD;
      CTCs, anti-CD45-FITC for white blood cells, and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for cell&#xD;
      nuclei. The CTCs are identified with anti-EpCAM positive, anti-CD45 negative and DAPI&#xD;
      positive, characterized using a fluorescence microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, from our preliminary studies, the investigators hypothesize that our technology is&#xD;
      useful for isolating circulating tumour cells and that these circulating tumor cells likely&#xD;
      correlate with disease activity and are not found in health individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitoring of circulating tumor DNA and circulating tumour cells may provide a clinically&#xD;
      valuable lead time in determining response, compared to conventional radiologic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of patients will be recruited for a longitudinal cohort study where tissue and blood&#xD;
      are collected for biomarkers. No intervention is envisioned. The study will be conducted over&#xD;
      three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Samples and Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospectively over six years(August 2014 to August 2020), about 150 patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      lung cancer who provide full informed consent to this study will have tumor and/or blood&#xD;
      and/or effusions collected. Patients from other locations may be referred to these sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients do not consent to collection of blood for clinical studies but have consented and&#xD;
      signed informed operative consent for collection of frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin&#xD;
      embedded material for research purposes including biopsies, cytology or surgical resections&#xD;
      as part of the standard surgical consent form, tumor tissue and normal tissue will be&#xD;
      collected from Changi General Hospital. Tumor staging and grading were obtained from review&#xD;
      of the pathology reports and evaluation of the case notes by individual clinician&#xD;
      investigators. Written informed consent for analysis of prospectively collected clinical&#xD;
      samples will be obtained from all patients, including the consent to obtain a biopsy lung&#xD;
      tissue specimen for research purpose. No other additional procedures are needed other than&#xD;
      the recommended procedure to remove the patient's tissue for assessment of the tumour, be it&#xD;
      bronchoscopy, CT-guided biopsy or open surgery, depending on physician's assessment. Once&#xD;
      routine procedure is completed, one of the tissues will be selected for research purposes.&#xD;
      The &quot;research tissue blocks&quot; will be anonymized and the slides batched for subsequent&#xD;
      examination/verification of tumor presence by a pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each prospective patient will provide baseline 3 EDTA tubes of blood (total approximately 30&#xD;
      ml). Urine (~100mL) will be collected at the same time for study of urine DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These blood samples will be centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm, for collection of serum&#xD;
      and plasma for validation of biomarkers identified by microarray analysis, selecting for&#xD;
      candidate secreted proteins in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effusions (pleural or peritoneal) will be obtained as part of routine therapeutic procedures&#xD;
      as recommended by the treating clinician, where the fluids would otherwise have been&#xD;
      discarded. At no point will effusion fluid be obtained for the sole purpose of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Downstream work in terms of evaluation of the CTCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, DNA,&#xD;
      RNA, protein, and other genetic and molecular materials will be performed. Techniques applied&#xD;
      will include quantitative PCR, sequencing, flow cytometry and immunophenotyping,&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry, fluorescent in situ-hybridization, culture, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutational analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic material will be extracted from 3-5 mL of materials trapped on sieve and from blood&#xD;
      plasma, as well as relevant material such as effusions or urine. This will be analysed by&#xD;
      quantitative PCR using custom designed primers and/or sequencing. Genetic materials will also&#xD;
      be profiled using next-generation sequencing techniques to identify clinically actionable&#xD;
      mutations such as BRAF, ALK, ROS, RET, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be processed fresh. Any remaining sample will be separated into buffy coats and&#xD;
      plasma and stored in liquid nitrogen and/or -80C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and specimens are de-identified for laboratory processing. Each site will retain&#xD;
      information linking patient to specimen. This is necessary for determination of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identified data will be located on a networked PC, physically located in Changi General&#xD;
      Hospital and behind institutional firewalls. Individually identifiable data will be retained&#xD;
      in the hospital and will not be shared with the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be archived for downstream projects once the study is completed.&#xD;
