      Randomized, balanced incomplete block design dose response study of efficacy, with 4&#xD;

      reference treatment (cooked rice only).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dose response study with 4 dosages of mulberry fruit powdered extract (0.37, 0.75, 1.12 and&#xD;
      1.5 g) added to cooked rice, compared to cooked rice only(reference) on post prandial blood&#xD;
      glucose response in healthy Indian adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, 1.5 g of mulberry fruit powdered extract was added to instant rice porridge and&#xD;
      compared to instant rice porridge only as positive control (replication of previous research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total there were 7 test products in the study: 5 active treatments and 2 reference&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a cross-over study (4 interventions per subject, 4 out of the 7 test products).&#xD;
      The recovery period between treatments was at least seven days.&#xD;
