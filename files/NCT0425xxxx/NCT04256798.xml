      PENGUIN is a pragmatic multi-center trial investigating the effects of pre-operative&#xD;
      mouthwash and perioperative oxygen on the incidences of pneumonia and surgical site infection&#xD;
      (SSI) following major abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from low and middle income countries and randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      trial treatment arms: a) pre-operative chlorhexidine mouthwash and 80-100% FiO2; b) no&#xD;
      pre-operative mouthwash and 80-100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2); c) pre-operative&#xD;
      chlorhexidine mouthwash and 21- 30% FiO2; or d) no pre-operative mouthwash and 21-30% FiO2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PENGUIN is a pragmatic, blinded (outcome assessor), 2x2 factorial, multi-centre randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial, with an internal pilot, to evaluate measures to reduce surgical site&#xD;
      infection (SSI) and pneumonia rates in patients undergoing surgery with an abdominal&#xD;
      incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumonia is one of the most serious complications to occur after surgery, accounting for up&#xD;
      to one in four of all postoperative deaths. The incidence is greater still in high-risk&#xD;
      populations such as those undergoing midline laparotomy where mortality rates are more than&#xD;
      10%. SSIs are clearly important being the most frequent healthcare-associated infection in&#xD;
      LMICs, affecting one in three patients undergoing contaminated or dirty surgery (34, 35).&#xD;
      SSIs cause pain, discomfort and disability. They increase the time taken to return to work,&#xD;
      and healthcare costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of postoperative mortality and complications such as surgical site infection is&#xD;
      three times greater in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) than in high-income countries.&#xD;
      In order to address surgical need worldwide, it is estimated that provision of a further 312&#xD;
      million operations would be required each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from hospitals in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) who are&#xD;
      undergoing elective or emergency mid-line laparotomy. Eligible patients will be randomised at&#xD;
      the level of the individual in a 1:1:1:1 ratio between:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Preoperative chlorhexidine mouthwash and 80-100% FiO2 during surgery B. No preoperative&#xD;
      chlorhexidine mouthwash and 80-100% FiO2 during surgery C. Preoperative chlorhexidine&#xD;
      mouthwash and 21-30% FiO2 during surgery D. No preoperative chlorhexidine mouthwash and&#xD;
      21-30% FiO2 during surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6 month internal pilot will assess the feasibility of recruitment, compliance with&#xD;
      treatment allocation and patient retention and follow-up rates. The main Randomised Control&#xD;
      Trial will recruit 12,924 participants.&#xD;
