        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have radiologically confirmed (ie, CAT scan and/or MRI) persistent or&#xD;
             recurrent EC of epithelial origin that has progressed after prior platinum based&#xD;
             chemotherapy or is refractory to platinum-based chemotherapy and has at least 2+&#xD;
             staining for Trop-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must have availability of archival tumor tissue FFPE block for TROP-2 testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis must be histologically confirmed by a gynecologic pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as lesions&#xD;
             which can be measured by physical examination or by means of medical imaging&#xD;
             techniques. Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded). Each&#xD;
             lesion must be ≥ 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation&#xD;
             or plain x-ray, or ≥ 10 mm when measured by spiral CT and/or MRI. Ascites and pleural&#xD;
             effusions are not to be considered measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this&#xD;
             protocol as defined by RECIST v1.1. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will&#xD;
             be designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is&#xD;
             obtained to confirm persistence following completion of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After undergoing surgery, patients may be optimally or sub optimally debulked.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with measurable recurrent disease of any previous substage (I-IV) are&#xD;
             eligible to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function: WBC greater than or equal to&#xD;
             3,000/ul, Platelets greater than or equal to 75,000/ul, Granulocytes greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 1500/ul.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate renal function: creatinine less than or equal to 2.0&#xD;
             mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic function: Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X laboratory normal.&#xD;
             SGOT/SGPT ≤ 3 X laboratory normal or ≤ 5 X laboratory normal if known liver&#xD;
             metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed an approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 2 weeks beyond prior treatment (chemotherapy,&#xD;
             investigational drugs including small molecular inhibitors, endocrine therapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy) or major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 2 weeks beyond high dose systemic corticosteroids (however,&#xD;
             low dose corticosteroids ≤ 20 mg prednisone or equivalent daily are permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from all acute toxicities to Grade 1 or less from adverse&#xD;
             events due to a previously administered agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Patients with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy or ≤ Grade 2 alopecia are an exception&#xD;
                  to this criterion and may qualify for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: If patients received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately&#xD;
                  from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting&#xD;
                  therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with recurrent disease may have received multiple prior chemotherapies for&#xD;
             treatment of their endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior immunotherapy therapy alone or in combination with&#xD;
             chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7&#xD;
             days prior to the study entry and be practicing an effective form of contraception&#xD;
             during the study and until conclusion of 12-week post-treatment evaluation period.&#xD;

             symptoms have returned to baseline, have no evidence of new or enlarging brain&#xD;
             metastases, and are taking ≤ 20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent. All patients&#xD;
             with carcinomatous meningitis are excluded regardless of clinical stability.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have a known history of HIV-1/2 with uncontrolled viral load and on medications that&#xD;
             may interfere with SN-38 metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have active HBV or HCV. In subjects with a history of HBV or HCV, subjects with a&#xD;
             detectable viral load will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hemorrhagic diathesis or active bleeding disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Gilbert's disease.&#xD;

             perforation within 6 months of initiation of study treatment.&#xD;
