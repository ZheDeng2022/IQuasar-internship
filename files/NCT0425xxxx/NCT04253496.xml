  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to analyze 100 PCNSL homogenously treated with high-dose methotrexate based&#xD;
      chemotherapy using NGS of PCNSL samples. We will perform DNA-seq and RNA-seq from tumor&#xD;
      samples. This data will be combined with their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at different&#xD;
      time points: at diagnosis, at the end of the treatment and at disease progression. Among the&#xD;
      100 PCNSL that will be included, 70 will be from a retrospective (training set) from patients&#xD;
      included in the French National PCNSL dataset (LOC cohort) and 30 PCNSL from a prospective&#xD;
      cohort from patients included in a phase III clinical trial (BLOCAGE, PHRC 2014). On the one&#xD;
      hand, we will perform a radiomics analysis (quantitative imaging) using 3D tumor and edema&#xD;
      segmentation. This analysis will help us to elucidate the potential correlation of MRI&#xD;
      phenotypes and genotype (using high-throughput data). In addition, we will use the radiomics&#xD;
      data combined with in vitro and in vivo data (using a mouse model of PCNSL) as well as&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry data to obtain a multidimensional mathematical modeling of PCNSL&#xD;
      clinical evolution that will allow us to better predict the clinical course of this rare&#xD;
      subtype of brain tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) are extra-nodal, malignant non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphomas of diffuse large B-cell type confined to the CNS or eyes without evidence of&#xD;
      systemic spread. PCNSL account for up to 1% of all lymphomas and 3% of primary brain tumors.&#xD;
      Despite recent progress in PCNSL treatment, remissions are short lasting and the outcome&#xD;
      remains poor with a minority of long-term survivors (20%). Moreover, treatments expose&#xD;
      patients to a high risk of neurotoxicity. Even though PCNSL has been extensively studied, the&#xD;
      pathogenic mechanisms underlying its remarkable tropism and its peculiar clinical behaviour&#xD;
      are not well elucidated. Since 2010, the French National Institute of Cancer (INCa) has&#xD;
      supported the creation of medical networks dedicated to rare cancers, including PCNSL (LOC&#xD;
      network). LOC has developed a national clinical database of newly diagnosed PCNSL with a&#xD;
      virtual tumor database to perform translational studies. Furthermore, LOC has launched&#xD;
      several prospective trials including a phase III clinical trial (BLOCAGE - PHRC 2014) with an&#xD;
      expected sample size of 300 patients to perform ancillary analysis. Modeling malignant&#xD;
      extracerebral/systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma therapy and outcome has been previously&#xD;
      performed, however due to its peculiar anatomical and immunoprivileged microenvironment, and&#xD;
      its specific therapeutic management, specific modeling of PCNSL is required. Interestingly,&#xD;
      in glioblastoma, another primary brain tumor, a model prediction of expected tumor burden&#xD;
      provided a personalized assessment of a therapy's effectiveness. Therefore, a comprehensive&#xD;
      mechanistic view of mathematical modeling of PCNSL growth and treatment response could be&#xD;
      used to better stratify PCNSL evolution and to predict the best treatment options. From a&#xD;
      radiological point of view, PCNSL often display a characteristic presentation with&#xD;
      periventricular contrast enhancing lesions. This is due to its hypercellularity, high&#xD;
      nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and its predilection for&#xD;
      the periventricular and superficial regions often in contact with ventricular or meningeal&#xD;
      surface. Interestingly, some small studies suggest that the integration of radiological and&#xD;
      high-throughput data would help to stratify the prognosis of PCNSL. In addition, MRI assesses&#xD;
      therapeutic response but this evaluation lacks of sensitivity to detect non-enhancing&#xD;
      lesions. Radiomics is a promising new paradigm for extending clinical imaging into the era of&#xD;
      molecular and genomic imaging. Interesting results using MRI and molecular phenotypes have&#xD;
      been obtained in different cancers and very recently in glioblastomas4. However, there is&#xD;
      only some evidence suggesting that molecular phenotype of PCNSL could be related to some&#xD;
      particular imaging morphophenotypes. Interestingly, our team has recently identified a&#xD;
      potential molecular-radiological association between the presence of TERT promoter mutations&#xD;
      and the localization of PCNSL within corpus callosum. Furthermore, using MRI data&#xD;
      (macroscopic data) will be also used to explore predictors of MRI patterns in a multivariate&#xD;
      framework, we will develop a linear modeling approach that measures the association of MRI&#xD;
      patterns with a number of potential predictors, including expression levels on a gene-by-gene&#xD;
      basis, driver mutations and clinical variables. Somatically acquired mutation and cytogenetic&#xD;
      lesion will be encoded as being present/absent. We choose a linear model due to its&#xD;
      interpretability and established statistical methods, enabling us to test which MRI&#xD;
      morphological pattern are associated with deregulated transcripts in the presence of specific&#xD;
      alterations after correcting for other confounding factors and other clinical variables and&#xD;
      coexisting driver mutations. The total variance in the MRI data will be studied and dissected&#xD;
      using data from selected driver genes, cytogenetic lesion and the most relevant principal&#xD;
      components of MRI data will be analyzed in a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator&#xD;
      (LASSO) penalized model. The optimal model maximizes the explained variance R2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate prognosis accuracy of survival models using Harrel's C statistic, as&#xD;
      implemented in Hmisc R package. This statistic measures the fraction of pairs of patients&#xD;
      with concordant risk predictions, and outcome similarly to the area under the receiver&#xD;
      operating characteristic curve. To reduce the bias of estimated risk, we will use a fivefold&#xD;
      cross-validating scheme. In addition, we will also analyze survival impact of this&#xD;
      multidimensional data using random forest as an alternative approach for predicting outcome&#xD;
      and measuring variable importance. These are implemented in the randomForesetSRC R package.&#xD;
      the preliminary results obtained on a sub sample of patient showed that the 100 patient&#xD;
      cohort will be sufficient to build and assess the predictive values of the models we will&#xD;
      study. Tools to integrate multiple sources data set described above for a small subset will&#xD;
      be scaled up using all the variables available from the complete dataset: non negative matrix&#xD;
      co-factorization and regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient prognosis may tightly correlate with a characteristic morphological tumor phenotype&#xD;
      on the histological level and with tumor shape, which itself may correlate with the gene&#xD;
      expression pattern. For this reason, macro-level growth simulations with the above&#xD;
      statistical model will be complemented by simulations with mechanistic models at the&#xD;
      histological level, and at whole tumor level. The histological-level model will be calibrated&#xD;
      with experiments using diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines co-cultured with&#xD;
      other microenvironment cells like glial cells, and with murine experiments. This model shall&#xD;
      shed light on the mechanisms at cell level capable of explaining the observed cell&#xD;
      proliferation and multicellular arrangement pattern.&#xD;
