    <textblock>
      The principal aim of this study is to determine whether a novel biopsychosocial intervention&#xD;
      following opioid overdose (OD) affects 1) the frequency of secondary opioid OD events and 2)&#xD;
      the proportion of individuals who remain engaged in treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD)&#xD;
      or are in remission at 30 days and at 180 days post intervention. Remission is defined as&#xD;
      engagement in daily medication-assisted therapy (MAT)-typically buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP)&#xD;
      or methadone- and/or a recovery capital score of â‰¥ 27.5. The intervention principally&#xD;
      involves connecting OUD-affected individuals with community resources, including BUP-, other&#xD;
      MAT-, and education-related services. To carry out the intervention, an addiction recovery&#xD;
      coach and an appropriately trained health educator paramedic (research assistant) will form a&#xD;
      Team and perform follow-up visits (electronically/remotely and/or by phone and/or in person,&#xD;
      when appropriate) after a participant has experienced at least 1 opioid OD requiring naloxone&#xD;
      resuscitation. Our hypothesis is that the intervention will decrease subsequent OD events and&#xD;
      increase the likelihood of remission. To evaluate this hypothesis, data will be collected&#xD;
      from self-report and from EPIC, Yale New Haven Hospital's medical record system. The&#xD;
      secondary aim is to determine whether the intervention affects 1) the frequency of&#xD;
      positive-urine tests for opioids and 2) the frequency and proportion of subjects&#xD;
      self-reporting opioid use. Our hypothesis is that this intervention will decrease both. Data&#xD;
      from the entire cohort will be compared in aggregate with patients who were started on BUP in&#xD;
      the ED over the same time period and with historic controls.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Scientific premise for proposed project. Buprenorphine/naloxone-based (BUP) treatment for&#xD;
      opioid use disorder (OUD). It is known that medication-assisted therapy (MAT) of opioid use&#xD;
      disorder (OUD) with buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP) is associated with decreased risk of opioid&#xD;
      overdose, improved engagement in treatment at 30 days, and less self-reported opioid use&#xD;
      compared with those who receive only a brief negotiated interview (BNI) or referral for&#xD;
      counselling. As a result of previous research, patients in Yale's Emergency Department (ED)&#xD;
      who are successfully resuscitated with naloxone following an opioid overdose are routinely&#xD;
      screened using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for OUD. Those who&#xD;
      screen positive for moderate to severe OUD are offered initiation of BUP treatment in the ED,&#xD;
      with outpatient primary care clinic referral for ongoing medical monitoring and treatment. At&#xD;
      the time of the ED visit, however, fewer than half of these patients will consent to&#xD;
      initiation of BUP. Those who decline are offered overdose education and naloxone (OEN) by ED&#xD;
      staff. A safety net that includes tailored linkage plans to effectively engage opioid&#xD;
      overdose survivors with BUP, intensive psychosocial support, and follow-up counseling in the&#xD;
      community is needed. To gain a better understanding of the motivations of those who decline&#xD;
      the offer of BUP, research from Yale's Department of Emergency Medicine purposively sampled&#xD;
      16 opioid overdose survivors who agreed to participate in a qualitative study looking at&#xD;
      their knowledge and understanding of OUD (unpublished). Predominant themes included the&#xD;
      following: ambivalence regarding the effectiveness of treatment for OUD, concerns about&#xD;
      concurrent social supports such as housing and mental health services; lack of appreciation&#xD;
      for the risks associated with OUD (even with multiple prior overdoses); strong, but abstract,&#xD;
      desire to discontinue use of opioids, despite refusal of treatment; and limited understanding&#xD;
      of how to prevent or emergently manage overdoses. These perceptions from the patient&#xD;
      population with OUD declining treatment directly informed the current study and its proposed&#xD;
      research strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer support and recovery in OUD. In 2012, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services&#xD;
      Administration (SAMHSA) established a working definition of recovery from mental health and&#xD;
      substance use disorders: a process of change through which individuals improve their health&#xD;
      and wellness, live self-directed lives, and strive to reach their full potential. The&#xD;
      definition identifies 4 dimensions that support recovery: 1) health, including both&#xD;
      management of the disease and decision making associated with physical and emotional&#xD;
      wellbeing; 2) home, e.g., a stable place to live; 3) purpose, e.g., meaningful daily&#xD;
      activities; and 4) community, e.g., supportive relationships and social networks. One of the&#xD;
      interrelated guiding principles of recovery promulgated by SAMHSA is peer support. Peer&#xD;
      recovery support services are delivered by persons who have common life experiences with&#xD;
      those they are serving. Since 1998, SAMHSA has sponsored Recovery Community Services grant&#xD;
      programs, and in 2002 the program changed its focus to emphasize the use of peers for&#xD;
      recovery support services. This funding now targets recovery community statewide networks.&#xD;
      The Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery (CCAR) was established in 1998, with initial&#xD;
      funding by the State's Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services and one of the&#xD;
      original SAMHSA grants. Since then, it has grown to its current size with a staff of 28,&#xD;
      recovery centers located in major cities, an ED recovery coach program, and 308 volunteers&#xD;
      who donated 28,841 hours in 2017 alone. CCAR recovery coaches are peer experts; many have&#xD;
      been in recovery themselves. They have experiential knowledge and training. More&#xD;
      specifically, CCAR describes a recovery coach as a motivator who exhibits bold faith in an/a&#xD;
      individual/family's capacity for change, and who encourages and celebrates achievement. The&#xD;
      recovery coach is an ally and confidant who genuinely cares, listens, and can be trusted with&#xD;
      confidences, as well as a truth teller who provides a consistent source of honest feedback&#xD;
      regarding self-destructive patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting. He or she is also a&#xD;
      role model and mentor who offers his/her life as living proof of the transformative power of&#xD;
      recovery and provides stage-appropriate recovery education and advice. The recovery coach is&#xD;
      trained to serve as a problem solver who identifies and helps remove personal and&#xD;
      environmental obstacles to recovery. He or she serves as a resource broker, linking&#xD;
      individuals/families to formal and indigenous resources such as sober housing,&#xD;
      recovery-conducive employment, health and social services, and other recovery support. The&#xD;
      recovery coach advocates by helping individuals and families navigate service systems for&#xD;
      access, responsiveness, and protection of rights. The recovery coaches may also be community&#xD;
      organizers to help develop and expand available recovery support resources, lifestyle&#xD;
      consultants to assist individuals/families to develop sobriety-based rituals of daily living,&#xD;
      and friends, providing companionship. Coaches receive training at the CCAR Recovery Coach&#xD;
      Academy, a 5-day intensive training program that focuses on providing individuals with the&#xD;
      necessary skills to mentor, support, and guide any person who would like to enter or sustain&#xD;
      long-term recovery from addiction. At this training, prospective CCAR recovery coaches learn&#xD;
      about the roles and functions of a recovery coach, core values and guiding principles of&#xD;
      recovery, relationship enhancement and crafting skills, appropriate attitudes about&#xD;
      self-disclosure, stages of recovery, addressing stigma, awareness of culture, power and&#xD;
      privilege, and addressing ethical and boundary issues. This Academy also teaches how to&#xD;
      practice newly acquired skills. CCAR recovery coaches' style of treatment is generally&#xD;
      informal, and they assist the individual affected by OUD in focusing on what he or she can do&#xD;
      at the present time to facilitate recovery in the future, in addition to helping these&#xD;
      individuals connect with community resources. Reports suggest that fostering a supportive and&#xD;
      positive treatment environment is critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community treatment of OUD. Some small studies and anecdotal successes have been reported in&#xD;
      a variety of settings when community health educators were included in programs to assist&#xD;
      patients with OUD. Most of the available reports are in emergency medical services (EMS)&#xD;
      trade journals, organization newsletters, public news releases, and other &quot;gray&quot; literature.&#xD;
      For example, a Fairfield County, Ohio initiative called Project FORT (Fairfield Overdose&#xD;
      Response Team) dispatches a community paramedic and a law enforcement officer to meet with&#xD;
      patients after opioid overdoses. This is a community outreach model program that contacts&#xD;
      patients, within 1-3 days of overdose, and assists them with getting into treatment&#xD;
      facilities, which are aimed primarily at abstinence. With no reports of formal outcomes, as&#xD;
      of December, 2017, Project FORT had piloted 12 patients. Of these, 1 was known to be in an&#xD;
      inpatient treatment program, and another had been admitted to the hospital for opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal then discharged to inpatient treatment. The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of&#xD;
      Public Health is collaborating with Baltimore City Fire Department's paramedics and the&#xD;
      Behavioral Health System of Baltimore in a program that trains the paramedics to perform a&#xD;
      screening test for OUD, followed by a BNI after responding to opioid overdoses. At the time&#xD;
      of their report, patients with OUD were being referred by the paramedics to a community-based&#xD;
      research center within the Bloomberg School for counseling, motivation, and discussion of&#xD;
      barriers to treatment. HIV (+) patients were preferentially referred to a medical facility&#xD;
      for treatment with BUP along with management of their HIV disease. Their longer-term plan was&#xD;
      to eventually transport clinically stable patients after overdose directly to a sobering&#xD;
      center, similar to the protocol used in the City of San Francisco. Although the patients&#xD;
      referred by the paramedics to the community-based research center are randomized to one of 2&#xD;
      different treatment arms, there have been no reports of the effectiveness of the paramedics&#xD;
      in this role. In a Palm Beach, FL community paramedicine program loosely based on previous&#xD;
      work at Yale, consented patients are started on BUP in the ED after an overdose. But&#xD;
      community paramedics deliver the ensuing daily doses to the patients at home for the first&#xD;
      week of therapy. These medics are accompanied by peer recovery specialists who work with the&#xD;
      patient on support systems for longer term recovery. Although no outcomes data are available&#xD;
      for this program, it involves a rapid taper off of BUP early in the treatment regimen. In&#xD;
      most other studies, early discontinuation of BUP is associated with poorer short- and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes, and increased risk of nonfatal and fatal overdoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Paramedic Referrals for Increased Independence and Decreased Disability in the Elderly&#xD;
      (PRIDE) program at Yale. Findings from the Department of Emergency Medicine previously&#xD;
      demonstrated that 1/3 of all seniors who activated the local 9-1-1 system due to inability to&#xD;
      get up after a fall at home would activate 9-1-1 again within the ensuing 30 days.&#xD;
      Furthermore, 2/3 of all calls to EMS for a &quot;lift assist&quot; were repeat calls to the same&#xD;
      address within the previous 30 days. By addressing some of the factors contributing to the&#xD;
      risk of falling, and by improving access to community medical resources based on individuals'&#xD;
      needs, many unplanned healthcare encounters likely could be prevented, while keeping&#xD;
      participants safely in their homes. Thus, a collaborative program between research paramedics&#xD;
      and home healthcare nurses was established. The program was funded by a Health Care&#xD;
      Innovations Award from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services in 2014. The overarching&#xD;
      goal of Paramedic Referrals for Increased Independence and Decreased Disability in the&#xD;
      Elderly (PRIDE) was to help older individuals to live independently, while decreasing&#xD;
      requirements for unplanned utilization of EMS, EDs, and hospitalization. To be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in PRIDE, seniors must have fallen in the past or felt that they were at risk for&#xD;
      falling, resided within a 15-town area in South-Central Connecticut, and resided at home or&#xD;
      in an assisted-living facility. The program's intervention involved home visits by the PRIDE&#xD;
      Team. Health-educator paramedics, as research assistants, and nurses recorded results of&#xD;
      balance and other agility tests, participants' medications, vital signs, and performed safety&#xD;
      assessments of the living space. The home healthcare nurses evaluated gait, posture,&#xD;
      cardiovascular health and medications, requirements for durable medical equipment, and&#xD;
      ongoing care needs, such as physical or occupational therapy. All participant data were&#xD;
      entered into a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA)-compliant, encrypted&#xD;
      database: Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). Additionally, if needed, staff set up&#xD;
      appointments with the participant's primary care provider, and a free ride in a medically&#xD;
      appropriate vehicle to and from the appointment was included. Subsequent unplanned healthcare&#xD;
      utilization was tracked using the electronic medical record system at Yale New Haven Hospital&#xD;
      (YNHH). PRIDE operated from 2014-2018 and enrolled greater than 5,600 participants. Data&#xD;
      (currently unpublished) to date demonstrate that there are significantly fewer ED visits and&#xD;
      less EMS utilization among those who received PRIDE services, compared with participants who&#xD;
      enrolled but declined visits by PRIDE staff. These data suggest that PRIDE's intervention was&#xD;
      effective in decreasing unplanned healthcare utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed adaptation of PRIDE to serve persons with OUD. We propose to adapt the PRIDE program&#xD;
      infrastructure to provide a safety net for patients who 1) have been resuscitated from an&#xD;
      opioid overdose with naloxone, 2) have screened positive for OUD using the MINI, and 3)&#xD;
      refused to initiate treatment with BUP in the ED, if offered. We may also include and accept&#xD;
      referrals from CCAR, Project Alcohol &amp; Substance Abuse Services, Education, and Referral to&#xD;
      Treatment (ASSERT) (whose recruiters work in the YNHH EDs), staff working in the Yale EDs and&#xD;
      with American Medical Response (AMR) units, and a Community Health Care Van. For this&#xD;
      program, the composition of the field teams will be changed, pairing recovery coaches from&#xD;
      CCAR with experienced PRIDE research paramedics, to form RCP Teams. For those affected by&#xD;
      moderate-severe OUD, we expect that engaging with the RCP Teams will create a more robust&#xD;
      linkage of care with community resources and treatment options. Importantly, these Teams will&#xD;
      motivate interest in treatment, facilitate access to BUP or methadone or equivalent, assist&#xD;
      with other community-based recovery strategies, help address acute psychosocial issues, and&#xD;
      provide ongoing education and counselling. The requirements for these capabilities were&#xD;
      derived from our previous qualitative studies of persons with OUD who declined ED-initiated&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan. To date, there is no standard of care for individuals with OUD who have&#xD;
      overdosed on opioids, have been resuscitated by naloxone, and have refused BUP treatment. As&#xD;
      noted previously, YNHH typically will send home these individuals with OEN kits. However,&#xD;
      follow-up care remains variable. Hence, this research seeks to determine whether individuals&#xD;
      with OUD might benefit significantly from a novel, Team-based intervention encouraging&#xD;
      biopsychosocial and medical interventions. First, this work will assess whether a novel&#xD;
      biopsychosocial intervention following OD affects 1) the frequency of secondary opioid OD&#xD;
      events and 2) the proportion of individuals who remain engaged in treatment for OUD or are in&#xD;
      remission within 30 and 180 days post intervention. Remission may be defined as engagement in&#xD;
      daily medication-assisted therapy-typically buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP) or methadone- and/or&#xD;
      a recovery capital score of â‰¥ 27.5. The study's hypothesis is that the intervention by the&#xD;
      RCP team will decrease subsequent OD events and increase the likelihood of remission. This&#xD;
      work also seeks to determine whether the intervention affects 1) the frequency of&#xD;
      positive-urine tests for opioids and 2) the frequency and proportion of subjects&#xD;
      self-reporting opioid use. The hypothesis is that the intervention will decrease both. The&#xD;
      study plan is as follows: To prepare for the intervention, health educators and key study&#xD;
      staff are required to attend 12 hours of in-person training, which is to take place over 2&#xD;
      days, to learn about best practices assessing those with OUD. One of the co-principal&#xD;
      investigators (co-PIs) of this study, along with CCAR staff, will teach. Sessions will&#xD;
      include training to conduct a BNI and a brief assessment of recovery capital (BARC-10)&#xD;
      interview. Training also will prepare all staff to respectfully ask questions about potential&#xD;
      overdose events and the possibility of creating and/or implementing a wellness plan. After&#xD;
      resuscitation from opioid overdose by naloxone individuals in the EDs at the York St. and&#xD;
      Chapel St. campuses of YNHH will be screened by ED providers for OUD using a MINI. This is an&#xD;
      evidence-supported, standard practice at Yale. Upon screening positive for OUD, individuals&#xD;
      should be offered BUP treatment by staff. Those who screen positive for OUD, but who decline&#xD;
      BUP, will be offered overdose and naloxone kits. In addition, the study Team will approach&#xD;
      these individuals to ask whether they might be interested in research participation. If the&#xD;
      patient were to express interest, then the study Team members would set up an appointment&#xD;
      (remotely/electronically and/or by phone and/or in person, if appropriate) to meet at a time&#xD;
      and place of the prospective/ participant's choosing. Depending on preference informed&#xD;
      consent may be obtained in the ED or at the first outpatient visit. In addition, individuals&#xD;
      from CCAR may refer interested individuals to study participation, providing that at some&#xD;
      time in the previous 7 days they had overdosed on opioids, were resuscitated by naloxone, and&#xD;
      screened positive for OUD in a YNHH ED. After consent and study initiation, either at the&#xD;
      hospital or later, the Team will perform a BNI- whose goal is to employ motivational&#xD;
      techniques to help those with substance misuse consider their reasons for wanting to address&#xD;
      dependency. The Team will perform psychosocial and medical evaluations. The Team will also&#xD;
      enter all data into a secured, encrypted database, REDCap. Approximately 30 days after&#xD;
      consent, the Team will schedule Meeting 1 with participants. During this time, the Team will&#xD;
      collect and enter data into REDCap based on discussions with and evaluations of participants.&#xD;
      During Meeting 2, which should occur no more than 180 days after consent, the Team will also&#xD;
      collect and enter data into REDCap based on discussions with and evaluations of participants.&#xD;
      The study team will also enter data from participants' medical records at all time intervals.&#xD;
      Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, at the time of this writing (07/25/2020), many follow-up&#xD;
      visits will occur remotely/electronically, using HIPAA-compliant software + data bases,&#xD;
      and/or by phone. However, on a case-by-case basis, in-person follow up visits are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the entire cohort will be compared in aggregate with patients who were started on&#xD;
      BUP in the ED over the same time period and with historic controls.&#xD;
