  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pharachute Supralaryngeal Airway (PSA) is an extraglottic airway device (EAD) for routine&#xD;
      use in anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to do a pilot study on a minimum of 20 and maximum of 30 participants whose&#xD;
      fitness status is ASA 1 or 2 for whom this type of airway management is routinely used. When&#xD;
      the participants are asleep the airway will be inserted, with ease of insertion and&#xD;
      satisfactory positive pressure ventilation assessed. This will be indicated by minimal&#xD;
      threshold leak from the breathing system and the seal pressure that can be achieved. Any&#xD;
      side-effects will be assessed post-operatively.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is non-commercial. No extraglottic airways are good enough to displace&#xD;
      the use of tracheal tubes, currently used in 40+% of general anaesthesia. Anaesthesia&#xD;
      requiring tracheal tube intubation is associated with 0.1% with permanent voice changes1.&#xD;
      That means, 800 people per annum in the UK will suffer permanent voice changes. Reduction of&#xD;
      the use of tracheal tubes to 10% will reduce this problem by 600 per annum. The PSA device is&#xD;
      a new extraglottic airway designed with the purpose of achieving better sealing pressures&#xD;
      safely because of a different sealing site and self-energizing sealing mechanism and a better&#xD;
      prevention of the risk of aspiration in the presence of regurgitation. Therefore, it has the&#xD;
      potential to make a huge difference to patients. As a first step in this objective, we need&#xD;
      to find out whether the airway device is predictably reliable and whether the seal pressures&#xD;
      are good enough for positive pressure ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Research hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PSA is a reliable extraglottic airway that can be inserted easily, atraumatically and&#xD;
      achieves reliable sealing pressures that will allow for positive pressure ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the use of the PSA in general anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How easy is it to insert?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a placement learning curve?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is its maximum sealing pressure?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the usual ventilation pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity and incidence of minor postoperative complications such as sore throat,&#xD;
           dysphagia, hoarseness etc?&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Primary endpoints Ease of insertion - number of attempts&#xD;
&#xD;
      time taken mechanical trauma - is there blood on the device at removal?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum peak inspiratory pressure during manual controlled ventilation. Sealing pressure&#xD;
      during controlled ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - nausea and vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
      hoarseness sore throat difficulty swallowing neck pain hearing problems mouth pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      tongue numbness&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed as to the side-effect risks about the airway device they are to&#xD;
      receive in a manner that compares it with the alternative airway management strategy, which&#xD;
      they will be free to choose instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peak airway and sealing pressures will be measured intra-operatively using the pressure&#xD;
      gauge on the anaesthetic machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be assessed for postoperative complications. This will take the form of&#xD;
      a postoperative questionnaire, which can be found in appendix iii. They will be asked about&#xD;
      the complications at 2hrs postoperatively and 24hrs postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Subject selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will all be adult ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade 1-2&#xD;
      participants, who are competent to consent and who are undergoing elective surgical&#xD;
      procedures. The ASA grading can be found in the appendix (ii).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and females between 165 and 175 cm height. (This height restriction is because this&#xD;
      initial study will be limited to the availability of one size [4] only for this pilot study).&#xD;
      The selection of participants for the study may also include the matching of the width of the&#xD;
      thyroid cartilage to the width of the PSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age 16-89 inclusive. ASA grade 1-2. Undergoing elective surgery. Able to give written and&#xD;
      signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria may have to change as there is only one size of PSA to test and we are&#xD;
      yet to work out whether the above best estimate of how to select the correct size is&#xD;
      accurate. So, it would appear to be a logical plan to include in the study design a test to&#xD;
      verify the above selection criterion using a maximum of the first 10 participants that may&#xD;
      not be included in the study that will be published, unless the above selection criteria is&#xD;
      validated, i.e. does not require any adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Requiring emergency surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 participants: Reasons for the choice of this number is based upon other appropriate&#xD;
      respective studies both pilot and randomized controlled studies (only 22 and 60 cases in the&#xD;
      case of the SLIPA airway2,3) conducted by this author and many other similar studies&#xD;
      published in the literature (See literature review). As this is a pilot study, it would seem&#xD;
      that the right number we should choose is the minimum number of participants to enable us to&#xD;
      answer the primary question reliably, although it is probably too few to give meaningful&#xD;
      answer to the the secondary questions. Nevertheless, this data may still be useful and&#xD;
      sufficient to exclude unanticipated serious side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.5 Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be visited as part of the normal preoperative visit, (this will be mainly&#xD;
      day surgery, so before the operating list begins). Those who satisfy the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be approached for the study, given a participant information leaflet to read and time to&#xD;
      ask any questions they may have. Informed consent will be obtained prior to the participant&#xD;
      undergoing any procedure. . Only a study doctor who has been trained, is competent and is on&#xD;
      the study delegation log will participate in the consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will ask the participant immediately before anaesthesia is induced if they&#xD;
      have any further questions and to confirm that they still wish to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Study procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Immediately before day surgery begin&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Discussion of trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provision of information leaflet. Discussion of questions arising from the leaflet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 In the induction room before anaesthesia commences&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any further questions about the study. The opportunity to change their minds&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal confirmation of the signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Anaesthetic induction and maintenance No special test equipment is needed for this study&#xD;
      other than what is in everyday current use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard monitoring to be attached before induction. Anaesthesia induction with 1mcg/kg&#xD;
      fentanyl and 1-3mg/kg propofol to loss of verbal contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular relaxation, only if required by the surgery, including the use of twitches on&#xD;
      Train of Four monitoring (TOF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia maintained with Sevoflurane in an air/oxygen mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Insertion of PSA device According to manufacturer's insertion guidelines (participant must&#xD;
      be deep enough or muscle relaxant working according to TOF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time for insertion from picking up device to attachment of breathing system measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of attempts documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10. Adequacy of ventilation Manual ventilation immediately following insertion. Adequacy&#xD;
           of chest wall movement, end tidal carbon dioxide waveform noted. If repositioning&#xD;
           required then intervention (head extension, neck flexion, jaw thrust) and effect noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If ventilation is unsatisfactory following two insertions of the medical device this will be&#xD;
      abandoned and alternative airway management instituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Positive pressure ventilation Target tidal volume of 6mL/kg (milliliters per kilogram).&#xD;
      Ratio of Inspiration: Expiration between 1:1 and 1:2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Set rate adjusted to maintain end tidal carbon dioxide 4 - 5 kiloPascals (kPa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. Measurement of airway pressures&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.1 Peak airway pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      - At steady state&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.2 Seal pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spill valve occlusion. Seal pressure regarded as that pressure at which gas heard to be&#xD;
      leaking from around the sealing flange of the device (Manual pressure control by squeezing&#xD;
      the bag may be used to achieve this rapidly, thus minimizing the time period of application&#xD;
      of the Valsalva manoeuvre effect [peak pressure less than two seconds], thus minimizing risk&#xD;
      to the participant as regards effect upon the cardiovascular system (CVS) and barotrauma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited to a maximum of 40cm water pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13. Removal of device Once surgery completed. Anaesthesia discontinued, TOF 1:4 &gt; 75% and&#xD;
      reversal agent if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of device once participant able to open eyes and mouth to command.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14. Postoperative follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a postoperative questionnaire (Appendix iii) at the&#xD;
      following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2hrs postoperatively (when the participant will still be in the Recovery Ward)&#xD;
&#xD;
      24hrs postoperatively Any complications that last up to 24 hours and are more than just mild&#xD;
      and fading symptoms will be considered serious enough to necessitate the patient being seen&#xD;
      again as soon as possible and assessed as to the need for treatment or referral to a general&#xD;
      practitioner for management. This will also immediately trigger consideration as to whether&#xD;
      to discontinue the trial and the product development.&#xD;
