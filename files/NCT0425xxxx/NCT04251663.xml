  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis suppurativa is a debilitating chronic inflammatory follicular skin disease. The&#xD;
      estimated prevalence of HS range between 1 and 4%, even though it has been an underdiagnosed&#xD;
      disease until recently (Revuz J, 2009). In the acute stage, patients present with painful&#xD;
      inflamed nodules (boils) and abscesses in the groin, buttocks and axillae. In a late stage&#xD;
      sinus tract formation and scarring occurs. Treatment options include the antibiotics,&#xD;
      anti-TNF and surgical methods (wide excisions and deroofing). However, most patients do not&#xD;
      respond, or only respond partially or temporarily to treatments (von der Werth JM, 2001;&#xD;
      Napolitano M, 2017; Nazary M, 2011; van der Zee HH, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of HS is largely unknown, and possible causes include plugged apocrine gland&#xD;
      or hair follicle, excessive sweating, androgen dysfunction and genetic disorders. Defective&#xD;
      cytokine responses and the infiltration of a variety of immune cells suggest the&#xD;
      autoinflammatory nature of the disease (Giamarellos-Bourboulis EJ, 2007; van der Zee HH;&#xD;
      2011; van der Zee HH, 2012), which is in line with the significant improvement seen in&#xD;
      patients administered the tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) blocker adalimumab (Kimball AB,&#xD;
      2016). Neutrophils have been identified in skin lesions and are considered to be the major&#xD;
      cell type to produce pus. Complement C5a is a major chemotactic factor that stimulates&#xD;
      neutrophil infiltration. The role of C5a has just recently started to be studied in HS. (Blok&#xD;
      JL, 2016; Kanni T, 2018). An open label phase 2 study demonstrated that a 50% HS clinical&#xD;
      response rate was achieved in up to 83% of patients receiving an C5a antibody (IFX-1, NCT&#xD;
      03001622). Thus, targeting the C5a signaling may represent a promising therapeutic strategy&#xD;
      in HS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the C5a effects result from binding to the canonical complement 5a receptor 1, C5aR.&#xD;
      However, there is a second C5a receptor, C5L2, whose roles are still controversial. Both pro-&#xD;
      and anti-inflammatory properties have been proposed for C5L2. These contradictory results may&#xD;
      be dependent on specific physiological or pathological conditions (Zhang T, 2017).&#xD;
      ChemoCentryx has a series of potent and selective small molecule C5aR inhibitors (C5aRi) that&#xD;
      are being developed for inflammatory diseases such as ANCA associated vasculitis, C3&#xD;
      glomerulopathy and HS. In this proposal, we will use these C5aRi to examine the differential&#xD;
      effects of targeting C5aR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ex vivo skin culture system will be utilized to examine the effects of C5aR inhibition on&#xD;
      neutrophil activation/inflammatory activities. Four-millimeter (4mm) lesional and&#xD;
      perilesional skin biopsies will be taken from skin excisions of 40 patients with known&#xD;
      Hidradenitis Suppurativa. Surplus skin excision material from &quot;deroofment&quot; treatment of HS&#xD;
      patients will be used. Peri-lesional and lesional biopsies will be collected for comparison.&#xD;
      These samples will be delivered to ChemoCentryx for direct analysis or treatment with C5a&#xD;
      and/or C5a inhibitors. Analysis will include but not limited to histological analysis,&#xD;
      examining immune cell populations and surface markers, protein and gene expression levels of&#xD;
      complement factors, cytokines and chemokines. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, ELISA and&#xD;
      other standard assays will be used for these analyses. These studies will extend the on-going&#xD;
      studies with Dr. Kavita and colleagues, and will test the hypothesis that continued&#xD;
      activation of neutrophils and other C5a-expressing leukocytes in the skin lesions of HS&#xD;
      patients contribute to tissue damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to collect plasma samples from 40 HS patients with active disease. All sample&#xD;
      collection will follow a well-defined protocol, with a maximum of 30ml of blood collected.&#xD;
      Samples will be immediately transported to ChemoCentryx for processing. Immune cell&#xD;
      populations, expression levels of C5aR and other related factors, responses to ex vivo&#xD;
      stimulations, and other characteristics of blood cells will be examined. Plasma and serum&#xD;
      will be collected and analyzed for levels of complement factors, cytokines and chemokines.&#xD;
      The plasma samples will also be used to stimulate immune cells purified from health donors.&#xD;
      C5a and C5aR inhibitor will be used to determine the role of C5aR in these in vitro assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be consented and enrolled for a single initial study visit with collection&#xD;
      of blood and/or skin tissue. Completion of this visit will be considered the end of the&#xD;
      individual's participation in the study. Participants may, however, at the discretion of the&#xD;
      principle investigator, be consented and enrolled again for a future study visit with&#xD;
      collection of blood and/or skin tissue. Re-enrolled participants will retain their initial&#xD;
      study code and collected specimens will be date and visit number labelled.&#xD;
