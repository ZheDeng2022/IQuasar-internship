  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicentric, open-label,two arms to assess and compare the effect of&#xD;
      single oral administration of MD1003 on the pharmacokinetic parameters in renal impaired&#xD;
      patients and healthy subjects with normal renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned enrollment is 36 subjects (18 impaired patients and 18 healthy subjects).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicentric, open label, phase I, two arms study to compare pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of MD1003 after a single oral dose of MD1003 100 mg in 18 healthy male volunteers and in 18&#xD;
      renal impaired patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to enroll a total of 36 subjects to receive a single oral dose of&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product (IMP):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 patients with mild renal impaired function, 6 patients with moderate renal impaired&#xD;
           function and 6 patients with severe renal impaired function will be enrolled in four&#xD;
           Hungarian centers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 Healthy volunteers will be enrolled by Eurofins Optimed in Gières, France. Healthy&#xD;
           volunteers will be matched with impaired renal function patients on ethnic group, sex,&#xD;
           age and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study up to 21 days prior to&#xD;
      the first administration. For both arms, subjects will be admitted into the Clinical Research&#xD;
      Unit (CRU) on Day -3. On the morning of Day 1, subjects will receive a single 100 mg oral&#xD;
      dose of MD1003 following an overnight fast (i.e., at least 10 hours). Subjects will be&#xD;
      confined to the CRU until discharge on Day 8 with PK blood sample draws for measurement of&#xD;
      MD1003 and its main metabolites being taken throughout the confinement (Predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5,&#xD;
      2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 hours post-dose). Urine sample&#xD;
      draws for measurement of MD1003 and its main metabolites will also be taken throughout the&#xD;
      study (pre-dose, ]D1T0h - D1T4h], ]D1T4h - D1T8h], ]D1T8h - D1T12h], ]D1T12h - D2T24h],&#xD;
      ]D2T24h - D2T36h], ]D2T36h - D3T48h], ]D3T48h - D4T72h], ]D4T72h - D5T96h], ]D5T96h -&#xD;
      D6T120h], ]D6T120h - D7T144h], ]D7T144h - D8T168h] post-dose). Then, subjects will come back&#xD;
      to the CRU for 4 ambulatory visits on Day 10, Day 12, Day 14 and Day 16 for blood sampling&#xD;
      (respectively 216, 264, 312, 360 hours post dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up post study visit will occur on Day 23 (±2 days) post-dose to ensure the ongoing&#xD;
      wellbeing of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs assessments, 12-lead ECG&#xD;
      and physical examination (PE) findings will be monitored at screening and at specified times&#xD;
      during the study. All AEs will be recorded throughout the study (i.e., from signing of the&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form until Study Completion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Completion is defined as the last subject's end-of-study assessment.&#xD;
