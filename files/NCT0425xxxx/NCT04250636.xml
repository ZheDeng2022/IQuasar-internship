      The proposed study is a phase 1, open label, single arm study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of single intravenous infusions of 3BNC117-LS and&#xD;
      10-1074-LS, each monoclonal antibody (mAb) dosed at 30 mg/kg in viremic human&#xD;

      The proposed study is a phase 1, open label, single arm study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of single intravenous infusions of 3BNC117-LS and&#xD;
      10-1074-LS in viremic HIV-infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten eligible participants will be enrolled sequentially in the study and will receive each&#xD;
      mAb, dosed at 30 mg/kg intravenously and in sequence on study day 0. Following mAb&#xD;
      administration, study participants will return for safety assessments on days 1 and 3, and&#xD;
      weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 following dosing, then bi-weekly or monthly until the end of study follow&#xD;
      up. All participants will be followed for 24 weeks after 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will be performed at multiple time points following 3BNC117-LS and&#xD;
      10-1074-LS infusions. Serum samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements will be collected&#xD;
      before and at the end each mAb infusion administration and at multiple subsequent time points&#xD;
      during study follow up. Samples will also be collected for measurement of HIV-1 plasma RNA&#xD;
      levels before 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS infusions (screen and day 0) and at every follow up&#xD;
      visit. T cell subsets will also be monitored during study follow up. Assessments will also&#xD;
      include measurement of anti-drug antibody responses and sequencing of plasma envelope before&#xD;
      infusions and after viral rebound (first time point after viremia nadir is reached and viral&#xD;
      load (VL) is &gt; 1,000 copies/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be advised and encouraged to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 4&#xD;
      weeks of receiving 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS infusions or sooner if: VL fails to decrease by&#xD;
      &gt; 0.5 log10 copies/ml within 2 weeks of antibody infusions, VL increases &gt; 0.5 log10&#xD;
      copies/ml between weekly measurements or significant T-cell decline (confirmed CD4+ T cells &lt;&#xD;
      200 cells/μl) is noted.&#xD;
