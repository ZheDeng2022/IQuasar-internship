    <textblock>
      Narrowing of the coronary arteries can cause chest pain and weaken the heart. In patients who&#xD;
      have had heart attacks, blocked or severely narrowed arteries should be investigated (with&#xD;
      coronary artery x-rays, or angiography) with efforts undertaken to improve the blood flow&#xD;
      (angioplasty and stenting or heart bypass surgery). Sometimes these arteries are in fact&#xD;
      supplying heart tissue which is already dead. Procedures to open up these vessels will&#xD;
      therefore not influence how the patient feels or their future prognosis. On occasion, in&#xD;
      order to determine whether heart tissue is alive (viable) and likely to benefit from of such&#xD;
      efforts, a further investigation is required before another attempt is undertaken to open up&#xD;
      these diseased arteries. This will require imaging of the heart to assess the state of the&#xD;
      tissue (for example with magnetic resonance imaging, or cardiac MRI which is the gold&#xD;
      standard). This means that patients may require two invasive procedures. One way around this&#xD;
      would be to assess the electrical properties of the heart muscle in question during a single&#xD;
      procedure. The principle is simply that dead muscle will have no electrical activity.&#xD;
      Assessing the electrical properties of the heart through the coronary arteries using the same&#xD;
      equipment used to treat the diseased artery during initial coronary angiography may provide&#xD;
      viability information instantly, thus allowing treatment to proceed at the same procedure. In&#xD;
      order to investigate whether this approach has promise, we will be performing a cardiac MRI&#xD;
      around the time that patients have their coronary angioplasty. The electrical data will be&#xD;
      compared to the cardiac MRI results to determine if this technique can be used in clinical&#xD;
      practice. This innovative work has potential clinical and financial benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients can be diagnosed and treated during one procedure&#xD;
