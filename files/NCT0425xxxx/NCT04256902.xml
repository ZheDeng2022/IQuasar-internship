      Despite increased visibility and acceptance of the LGBT community (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and&#xD;
      Transgender), in some parts of society, many LGBT people struggle with self-acceptance.&#xD;
      Minority Stress Theory, described in the scientific literature, explains that health&#xD;
      disparities among populations such as the LGBT population can be explained by stressors&#xD;
      induced by a hostile, homophobic culture, which results in harm suffered, expectations of&#xD;
      rejection, and internalized homophobia. The harm suffered may include acts of discrimination,&#xD;
      harassment, violence (physical or linguistic). But more deeply, two important points of this&#xD;
      theory: 1) the expectations of the LGBT person to experience rejection based on their&#xD;
      identity and the anti-LGBT social stigma, 2) internalized homophobia, which is a social&#xD;
      internalization from negativity against homosexuality and transgender to the initial stages&#xD;
      of the identity development of an individual who can continue throughout his life. Perceived&#xD;
      harm, stigma and lived rejection are associated with an increased propensity to experience&#xD;
      significant psychological pain. LGBT people are more likely to develop self-identification&#xD;
      based on sexual orientation or gender, making them more vulnerable to any rejection signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing scientific interest around Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies (CBT) of 3rd&#xD;
      wave, also called therapies derived from Buddhism, or therapies based on meditation. These&#xD;
      programs aim to observe and test, through an experiential meta-cognitive practice, the dogmas&#xD;
      or preconceptions (about ourselves, others, and the world) and mental attitudes that guide&#xD;
      our choices without our knowledge and are at the origin of suffering, in order to gain inner&#xD;
      freedom. These practices constitute an experiential scientific methodology of self-knowledge&#xD;
      and reality. These secular programs have become a standard treatment in the management of&#xD;
      stress, chronic pain, and the prevention of relapsing depression. In addition, the interest&#xD;
      of these practices has been demonstrated in many areas of somatic and psychiatric medicine&#xD;
      (including depression and suicidal behavior), but also for the promotion of mental health in&#xD;
      the general population. This topic is the subject of more than 15,000 international&#xD;
      scientific publications with reading committee (Medline indexed), and of strong interest and&#xD;
      shared by both the scientific community and the general public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientists are currently deepening these therapies with a focus on wisdom-based&#xD;
      self-identification. Beyond the name &quot;therapies&quot;, this educational information is key to life&#xD;
      for everyone. Who am I ? Am I defined by my social roles, my physical characteristics, my&#xD;
      preferences? How to face external challenges? How to develop real self-confidence?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr Déborah Ducasse offers a conference on the theme: &quot;Sexual orientation, gender: where is&#xD;
      the problem?&quot; Nowhere. Self-identification. &quot;. This conference will take place on 05/15/2020,&#xD;
      on the occasion of World Day Against Homophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the OECD press release in 2019 &quot;The LGBT challenge: how to improve the&#xD;
      integration of sexual and gender minorities? &quot;(Panorama de la société 2019: Social Indicators&#xD;
      of the OECD), the investigators want to assess whether an intervention targeting valid&#xD;
      self-identification can 1) have a positive impact on the acceptance and discrimination&#xD;
      indicators of the OECD ; 2) have an impact on valid self-identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct benefits are expected, psychologically and socially, in the fight against&#xD;
      discrimination, inclusion and self-acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the medium and long term: major public health interest via the adaptation of&#xD;
      psychoeducational interventions based on self-identification in order to prevent psychosocial&#xD;
      risks and suicidal behavior in connection with an altered self-identification based on sexual&#xD;
      orientation and gender.&#xD;

      A wide communication (media, social networks) will be organized around this conference which&#xD;
      is free to enter A prior registration will be requested by email. For each person sending an&#xD;
      email to register, they will be offered to participate in the research by following the web&#xD;
      link to the Google Form questionnaire (&quot;pre-conference&quot;) with information on the proposed&#xD;
      research. Refusal to participate in the research will not prevent you from attending the&#xD;
      conference, this will be mentioned when sending the link to the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the conference, another email will be sent to those who have agreed to&#xD;
      participate with a new Google Form link to answer specific &quot;post-conference&quot; questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the conference will be studied by comparing the pre and post conference&#xD;
      questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: Evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on self-identification&#xD;
      (conference &quot;Sexual orientation, gender: where is the problem? Nowhere. Self-identification.&quot;&#xD;
      Lasting 2 hours), on the acceptance of homosexuality and transgender, in people coming to&#xD;
      attend this intervention (evaluations before and after)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: Evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on&#xD;
      self-identification (2 hours), on the representations of stigmatization of homosexuality and&#xD;
      transgender, in people coming to attend this intervention (evaluations before- after).&#xD;
