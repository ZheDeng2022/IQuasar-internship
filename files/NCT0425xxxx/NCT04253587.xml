    <textblock>
      Therapeutic treatment is yet available for declining memory, which is an impairment affecting&#xD;
      the quality of life for many older adults and patients with cognitive impairment. Cognitive&#xD;
      training with an immersive, virtual reality video game promises to drive hippocampal-cortical&#xD;
      plasticity and associated gains that can restore memory capability or provide therapeutic&#xD;
      treatment for memory deficits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A hallmark of higher cognition is the capability for flexible association of diverse bits of&#xD;
      information stored in memory, such that experiences can be remembered in detailed and&#xD;
      distinct terms (i.e., high-fidelity LTM). Interventions capable of sustaining improved&#xD;
      learning and flexible association of new information into LTM remain elusive. Interventions&#xD;
      have yet to be developed to attenuate the decline of high-fidelity LTM in normal aging or&#xD;
      provide therapeutic treatment for patients with cognitive impairment without dementia (i.e.,&#xD;
      MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project applies a translational neuroscience approach in development of a cognitive&#xD;
      training intervention that targets sustained improvement in capabilities for long-term memory&#xD;
      (LTM) and cognitive control. Treatments use commercially available head-mounted display&#xD;
      Virtual Reality (VR) technology for deeply immersive presentation of a spatial wayfinding&#xD;
      video game. The hypothesis is that immersion in a game to navigate errands through&#xD;
      unfamiliar, visually complex neighborhoods (i.e., wayfinding) will be an effective means to&#xD;
      environmental enrichment, which refers to a process whereby new and complex experiences bring&#xD;
      change to brain and behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance of this platform is in value to both gains from cognitive training that can&#xD;
      generalize to improvements in untrained capability for high-fidelity LTM and clinical&#xD;
      assessments for patients with memory deficits. Research in rodents and humans shows that&#xD;
      healthy function of the hippocampus supports lifelong neurogenesis, which has been linked as&#xD;
      the neurobiological basis to formation of new, high-fidelity memories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VR spatial wayfinding game was developed in-house to incorporate full scientific rigor,&#xD;
      as with procedures in any properly controlled behavioral experiment. The game uses both VR&#xD;
      computer graphics tools and numerous levels of adaptive challenge to deliver a dynamic,&#xD;
      engaging experience for participants throughout the training regimen. A participant's pre-&#xD;
      and post-training assessments will occur promptly before and after their 15-hour training&#xD;
      regimen, including collection of functional MRI (fMRI) data and blood-drawn biospecimens.&#xD;
      Cognitive outcome measures will assess capabilities for high-fidelity LTM retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of the VR wayfinding game intervention will be evidenced by post-training&#xD;
      improvements in retrieval of high-fidelity LTM and associated cognitive control capabilities.&#xD;
      FMRI results associated with the measured cognitive improvements will localize changes in&#xD;
      functional brain networks that support gains in memory capabilities. Neuronal-derived exosome&#xD;
      factors will provide confirmatory evidence of a hippocampal-dependent mechanism of action&#xD;
      stimulated by the training regimen.&#xD;
