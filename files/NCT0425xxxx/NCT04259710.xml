  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the second major cause of death for women in Israel and the leading&#xD;
      cause of death among women worldwide. Women have higher mortality rates after a coronary or&#xD;
      cerebrovascular event compared to men, and receive less attention for prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk factors for heart disease among women in Israel are high: 53% of women in the State&#xD;
      of Israel are overweight or obese and 48% of women do not exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing physical activity can lower the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      women. The literature suggests that even minor changes in behavior can reduce the morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality and costs to the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pedometers have proven to be an effective tool for increasing physical activity, and have the&#xD;
      potential to create change in health habits. The pedometer measures steps and is a simple&#xD;
      measure that gives an estimate of the extent of exercise in terms of steps. The device is&#xD;
      simple and user-friendly and serves as an indicator of movement as a result of health&#xD;
      choices. The literature shows that when pedometers are integrated into a support program,&#xD;
      they provide an incentive to increase physical activity. Supporting software includes, among&#xD;
      other things - choosing personal goals, close tracking, and self-tracking and re balancing&#xD;
      systems. &quot;Implementation intention&quot; is a strategy in the form of an &quot;if-then plan&quot; that can&#xD;
      increase the likelihood of attaining one's goals. It is different than specifying a goal&#xD;
      intentions as it specifies the when, where and how portions of goal-directed behavior. This&#xD;
      study seeks to compare the increase in steps in participants randomly assigned in a 2:2:1&#xD;
      allocation to a goal-setting pedometer intervention, a goal-setting plus implementation&#xD;
      intentions pedometer intervention vs pedometer only.&#xD;

      Goals-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increasing step count as measured by a pedometer in hospital employees. The overall goal&#xD;
           is for each participant to reach 10,000 steps a day at the end of the 12 weeks of&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of increase in steps in participants who undergo an implementation intentions&#xD;
           intervention in addition to a goal setting intervention to those who receive the goal&#xD;
           setting intervention alone, to those assigned to pedometer without goal setting&#xD;
           intervention. The goal setting intevention includes setting weekly goals with the&#xD;
           investigator, and receiving weekly tips.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The implementation intention group will fill out an action planning form 3 times during&#xD;
           the course of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pedometer only group will receive a pedometer and instructions as to it's use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examining the effect of self-efficacy on increasing the amount of steps among program&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examining the effect of the program on a measure of burnout in the workplace among&#xD;
           program participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Examining the impact of a program designed to increase physical activity (through&#xD;
           walking) on self-report of nutrition behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Examining the correlation between emotional self-regulation as measured on a self-report&#xD;
           measure and success in increasing steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Examining the effect of the program on physiological measures: BMI, blood pressure,&#xD;
           pulse, and waist circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population- Hadassah Medical Center employee and volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      sample size- 180 Hadassah employee and volunteers to be enrolled in the program, using the&#xD;
      first to enroll method. The sample size was calculated based on an expected 1000 step&#xD;
      difference between the intervention groups with implementation intentions vs the group&#xD;
      without implementation intentions. change in the number of steps per day between the control&#xD;
      group and the intervention groups, as shown in previous studies. Under a 2350 Sd assumption,&#xD;
      a sample size of 87 participants in each group would provide a power of 80% to detect a 5%&#xD;
      significance level change.&#xD;
