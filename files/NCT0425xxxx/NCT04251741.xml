    <textblock>
      A potential application of therapeutic drug monitoring is to predict efficacy after switch to&#xD;
      another biological in the case of inefficacy of the previous TNF-inhibitor (TNFi) in&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. It has been shown that when antidrug antibodies against&#xD;
      adalimumab are detected (resulting in lower drug serum concentrations) in patients failing&#xD;
      adalimumab, a normal response to a next TNF blocker can be anticipated. However, when&#xD;
      clinical response is unsatisfactory and no antidrug antibodies against the first TNFi are&#xD;
      detected (generally drug levels are adequate in this case), this predicts a lower response to&#xD;
      a next TNFi. This means drug resistant failure in the former, compared to class resistant&#xD;
      failure in latter category of patients. The current RA treatment strategy after failure of&#xD;
      the first TNF-inhibitor is to start either a second TNFi or a non-TNFi. However, by&#xD;
      channelling patients with sufficient adalimumab concentration to a non-TNFi will provide&#xD;
      higher chance of disease control. Patients with very low or undetectable drug levels have an&#xD;
      equal or potential higher chance of disease control with a drug of the same class (i.e.&#xD;
      another TNFi).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decades biopharmaceuticals such as agents against tumor necrosis factor (TNF),&#xD;
      are frequently prescribed to optimize rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Although TNFi such as&#xD;
      adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab, have improved the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, a&#xD;
      proportion of patients discontinue the treatment because of inefficacy or intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where TNFi have failed, mainly two treatment approaches are available: switch to another TNFi&#xD;
      or to a biological with a different mode of action (notably rituximab, abatacept or&#xD;
      tocilizumab) or to a target synthetic DMARDs. The EULAR recommendation for the management of&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis advocate that any biologic agent including a subsequent TNFi can be used&#xD;
      with equal chance for effect in case of non-response to a previous TNFi. This recommendation&#xD;
      is based on three randomized controlled trails, but it should be noted that systematic&#xD;
      reviews also including non-randomized controlled studies sometimes concluded that non-TNFi&#xD;
      are more effective after TNFi failure than a second TNFi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, currently there are no strong predictors available for response to bDMARDS in RA.&#xD;
      This study focuses on non-response after adalimumab, as this is the most prescribed TNFi&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it seems that indeed on a group level response to a non-TNFi is comparable to a&#xD;
      second TNFi after the first TNFi has failed, using therapeutic drug monitoring could identify&#xD;
      subgroups of patient who would benefit more from either a non-TNFi or a TNF-i as next&#xD;
      treatment. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for this hypothesis are explored in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonresponse on adalimumab in RA can have different causes. Firstly, the patient might not be&#xD;
      sensitive to TNF blockade at all, or the patient develops this trait later on (primary&#xD;
      nonresponse or secondary nonresponse). In these patients, switching to a non-TNFi might&#xD;
      conceptually be superior to starting a second TNFi. However, in other patients nonresponse&#xD;
      (either primary or secondary) might be caused by inefficient drug concentration because of&#xD;
      development of antidrug antibodies against adalimumab. In these patients a TNFi might be just&#xD;
      as effective as a non-TNFi, as these patients have drug- but not class failure. Thus, testing&#xD;
      of adalimumab levels might be helpful in channelling patients to their most optimal&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Above mentioned hypothesis has been tested in three studies (5) of which one concerned&#xD;
      adalimumab in RA. This study showed that response to a second TNFi was indeed higher in&#xD;
      patients with antidrug antibodies (ADA) and low adalimumab levels, and lower in patients with&#xD;
      adequate adalimumab levels. However, a diagnostic study comparing a serum concentration&#xD;
      guided versus usual care switching strategy has not yet been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multi-centre, double blinded randomized controlled trial it will be evaluated whether&#xD;
      clinical outcome after switching to a subsequent biological treatment is superior with a&#xD;
      switching strategy using adalimumab concentration compared to usual care switching strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis starting another bDMARD (biologic disease modifying&#xD;
      antirheumatic drugs) after adalimumab failure (defined as DAS28-CRP &gt;2.9) are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to usual care (with randomized switch to etanercept or to a non-TNFi) or 'drug&#xD;
      concentration' guided switch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding disease status, functioning, adverse events and use of co-medication/rescue&#xD;
      medication will be collected during this study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis starting another bDMARD after adalimumab failure (defined as DAS28CRP&gt;2.9) are randomly assigned to usual care (with randomized switch to etanercept or to a non-TNF-inhibitor) or 'drug concentration' guided switch.&#xD;
When randomized to the usual care group, the treating rheumatologist gets the advice from an independent coworker to switch patients to etanercept 1*50 mg/week or a non-TNFi (abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, or sarilumab), based on random allocation. When randomized to a non-TNFi, the treating rheumatologist will choose the non-TNFi. In the 'drug concentration guided' group, in patients with a concentration &lt;1.0 mg/L a switch to etanercept (standard dosing regimen of 50mg once a week) is advised by an independent coworker and in patients with a concentration ≥ 1.0 start of a non-TNF-inhibitor (the same drugs and dosing as in usual care group) is advised.</intervention_model_description>
