  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will compare effects of two types of 8-weeklong&#xD;
      interventions: a) multimodal or b) general movement to facilitate social communication and&#xD;
      motor skills of school-age children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Recently, the&#xD;
      investigators have identified cortical dysfunction patterns as markers of&#xD;
      imitation/interpersonal synchrony difficulties in children with ASD using functional&#xD;
      near-infrared spectroscopy. In this project, the investigators want to validate whether&#xD;
      cortical markers can determine treatment responders and if such markers are sensitive to&#xD;
      training-related changes. Following training, the investigators expect to see a variety of&#xD;
      behavioral and neural changes in both groups. If the study aims are achieved, the&#xD;
      investigators will validate the use of cortical markers as a treatment response measure. This&#xD;
      research will build evidence for the use of various movement interventions for school-age&#xD;
      children with ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      45 children with ASD between 5 and 15 years of age will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      multimodal or general play or seated play groups. Each child will participate in 9 testing&#xD;
      sessions (4 pretests, 3 posttests, and 3, 2-month follow-ups) and 8 weeks of multimodal or&#xD;
      general intervention between pre-tests and post-tests. In the 8-week phase between the pre-&#xD;
      and post-tests, each child will complete group-specific intervention-related activities with&#xD;
      the expert clinician twice per week via telehealth or face-to-face interactions. Each session&#xD;
      will last for a total of 30-45 minutes. If the study aims are achieved, the investigators&#xD;
      will validate the use of cortical markers as a treatment response measure. Findings from this&#xD;
      research will offer evidence for the use of various movement interventions for school-age&#xD;
      children with ASD.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in cortical activation during the Rhythmic Synchrony task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Post-test after 8 weeks of intervention, Baseline to Follow-up testing after 8 weeks from post-test</time_frame>
    <description>In the rhythmic synchrony task children will perform, drum, march, and sway actions across the following conditions - solo actions - moving to a rhythmic beat played aloud in the background), social actions - move in synchrony with the adult as the child follows the adult's drumming motions. The adult will be listening to the rhythmic beat only not the child. Testers will also attach 5 tiny inertial measurement units to the two wrists, mid-back (2nd sacral vertebra), and on both shoes (at the 1st metatarsal head) using wrist/waist bands or velcro for the child and the adult partner to measure moment-to-moment kinematics and relative phasing/coordination between limbs and between people. A cap with probes will be used to record the oxyhemoglobin concentration in mmol.mm from different brain regions as a measure of cortical activation. A higher value indicates greater cortical activation/neural processing.</description>

    <measure>Change in cortical activation during a building task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Post-test after 8 weeks of intervention, Baseline to Follow-up testing after 8 weeks from post-test</time_frame>
    <description>In the building task cortical activation data will be collected using a cap with probes. In the Tower of Hanoi building task, children will complete two tasks : a) response inhibition task using the Flanker test and b) cognitive flexibility task using the Reverse Flanker test. Both involve finger pointing in one direction or another to make decisions about where the group of fish shown on the screen are looking (right or left). Oxyhemoglobin concentration in mmol.mm from different brain regions are a measure of cortical activation. A higher value indicates greater cortical activation/neural processing.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in joint attention scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Post-test after 8 weeks of intervention, Baseline to Follow-up testing after 8 weeks from post-test</time_frame>
    <description>In the Joint Attention Test, the child and tester are seated across from each other at a table. The environment is set up such that objects are placed in specific locations. The scale consists of eight naturalistic prompts designed to elicit response or initiation of joint attention. Each prompt is scored on a four-point scale (i.e., social action, looking at the tester's face, make eye contact, and a verbal response). Scores are between 0 to 38.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gross-motor performance scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Post-test after 8 weeks of intervention, Baseline to Follow-up testing after 8 weeks from post-test</time_frame>
    <description>The fine and gross motor coordination subtests of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-Second Edition (BOTMP-2) are a standardized and normed measure of gross and fine motor coordination. BOTMP-2 provides a raw, standard, and percentile scores. BOTMP-2 has eight subtests (running speed and agility, balance, bilateral coordination, strength, upper-limb coordination, response speed, visual-motor control, and upper-limb speed and dexterity). Testers will administer a short form of BOTMP-2 as well as the subtests for balance, bilateral coordination, manual dexterity, strength, fine motor precision, and fine motor integration, and upper-limb coordination subtests. The test provides percentile score that range from 0-100.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in praxis errors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Post-test after 8 weeks of intervention, Baseline to Follow-up testing after 8 weeks from post-test</time_frame>
    <description>The praxis subtests of Sensory Integration and Praxis Testing (SIPT) are standardized and normed measures of examining motor coordination, sensory integration, and praxis. Specifically, the investigators are planning to use items from subtests of postural praxis, and bilateral motor coordination subtest. The praxis subtests will examine a child's ability to generalize the imitation skills to novel actions involved in the SIPT praxis subtests. This test provides the number of errors per action copied and a total number of errors. There is no fixed range as such but the scores could range from 0 to 100.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in movement quality and prosocial behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Post-test after 8 weeks of intervention, Baseline to Follow-up testing after 8 weeks from post-test</time_frame>
    <description>In the structured play task, the testers will assess a child's ability to engage in prosocial behaviors as well as task-specific upper and lower-limb gross motor coordination skills. First, the tester will pretend to need help opening a tube or in collecting dropped items to see if the participating child will assist in opening or cleaning up of blocks. Next, the testers will perform multiple object control and locomotor skills consistent with the musical activities practiced during the training weeks. The test includes ball skills such as throwing, catching, dribbling, as well as locomotor skills of jump, hop, gallop, etc. developed using the items from the Test of Gross Motor Development-2nd edition (TGMD-2). Two trials of each action will be recorded. This task includes raw, standard, and percentile scores. Higher scores indicate better performance and range from 0-100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in distance covered during walking</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Post-test after 8 weeks of intervention, Baseline to Follow-up testing after 8 weeks from post-test</time_frame>
    <description>Testers will use the 2-minute walk test to assess endurance of the participating children. The test will be chosen based on the walking tolerance of the child and the severity of locomotor impairments. The test assesses the maximum distance that the child can cover in 1 or 2 minutes. The 2-minute walk test distance has been found to be highly correlated with the gold standard 6-minute walk test commonly used to assess endurance. This test provides a distance measure and more the distance covered indicates better performance. The distance covered may range from 125-200 meters approximately.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in time taken to complete the task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Post-test after 8 weeks of intervention, Baseline to Follow-up testing after 8 weeks from post-test</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed-Up &amp; Go test (TUG) test measures the time taken in seconds to stand up from a chair with armrest, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down again. A higher value indicates poor performance and time taken is usually between 4 to 7 seconds.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Measures social communication delay</measure>
    <time_frame>In the screening phase after initial contact with researchers</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) is a 15-minute parent questionnaire to screen for autism-specific, social communication behaviors of children above three years of age. A higher SCQ total score indicates a greater social communication delay. The SCQ scores may range from 0 to 39.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Measures level of functioning in multiple domains</measure>
    <time_frame>In the baseline period</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scales (VABS) is a 20-minute parent questionnaire/interview that includes subscales of motor (gross motor, fine motor), socialization (interpersonal relationships, play, and coping skills), and communication (receptive, expressive, and written language) as well as adaptive functioning (personal, domestic, and community) for individuals between birth to 90 years of age. The VABS will provide us information on level of functioning across various developmental domains. Children with ASD will complete this measure. A higher VABS standard score indicates better functional performance for a given subdomain or overall. The VABS standard scores range from 1-100 with 100 being best performance.</description>
