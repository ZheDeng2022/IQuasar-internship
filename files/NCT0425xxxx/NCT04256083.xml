  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amniotic fluid embolism is a serious complication of the peri-partum period that is&#xD;
      associated with high maternal mortality rate, ranging from 20 to 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of amniotic fluid embolism remains poorly known at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition and diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism is only clinical, based on different&#xD;
      scores, the most used of which is the score proposed by the United Kingdom Obstetric&#xD;
      Surveillance System (UKOSS). This score supports the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism in&#xD;
      the event of acute maternal collapse associated with one or more of the following features:&#xD;
      cardiac rhythm problems, acute fetal compromise, respiratory distress, maternal hemorrhage,&#xD;
      coagulopathy, convulsions, premonitory symptoms (restlessness, numbness, tingling, agitation,&#xD;
      etc.). ) seizure, in the absence of any other clear cause. Amniotic fluid embolism is a&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of maternal collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining specific biological markers for this disease would be very useful in order to be&#xD;
      able to affirm the diagnosis and refute other diagnostic hypotheses with certainty. The&#xD;
      detection of amniotic cells in the blood or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid seems to be of&#xD;
      little help. The assay of plasma tryptase does not confirm the diagnosis of amniotic&#xD;
      embolism, but is useful for ruling out the diagnosis of anaphylactic shock. The dosage of the&#xD;
      complement lacks sensitivity and specificity to be useful in the diagnosis of amniotic fluid&#xD;
      embolism. The maternal plasma assay of IGFBP-1 (&quot;Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein&quot; type&#xD;
      1) has been proposed for the biological diagnosis of amniotic embolism. IGFBP-1 is present in&#xD;
      high concentration in amniotic fluid, while its concentration is low in maternal plasma. High&#xD;
      levels of IGFBP-1 in maternal blood would therefore make it possible to establish the&#xD;
      diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism with excellent sensitivity and specificity according to&#xD;
      previous data collected from 25 patients. However, no study has confirmed this result to&#xD;
      date. Other markers have also been suggested (zinc-coproporphyrin in particular), but to&#xD;
      date, no specific marker for this disease has been formally identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic phenotyping consists in the identification of subtle and coordinated metabolic&#xD;
      variations associated with various pathophysiological stimuli. Different analytical methods,&#xD;
      such as nuclear magnetic resonance, allow the simultaneous quantification of a large number&#xD;
      of metabolites. Statistical analyses of these spectra thus lead to the discrimination between&#xD;
      samples and the identification of a metabolic phenotype corresponding to the effect under&#xD;
      study. This approach allows the extraction of candidate biomarkers and the recovery of&#xD;
      perturbed metabolic networks, driving to the generation of biochemical hypotheses&#xD;
      (pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic tests, therapeutic targets,...).. It is thus&#xD;
      possible to obtain biochemical characterizations of human biological samples (also called&#xD;
      &quot;metabolic profile or signature&quot;) which can be compared in order to identify distinctive&#xD;
      elements of certain pathophysiological states, establishing a metabolic phenotype of the&#xD;
      pathological state studied. This analysis can be supplemented by a study of the proteome&#xD;
      (proteomics), in order to identify one or more biological markers associated with a disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the metabolic and proteomic phenotyping in three groups&#xD;
      of women: women for whom the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism was retained according to&#xD;
      the UKOSS clinical criteria (Group AFE), women admitted for prophylactic elective cesarean&#xD;
      section (Group Control 1), women presenting acute collapse or shock in the peri- partum for&#xD;
      which the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism has been excluded (severe hemorrhage, SEPSIS,&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism for example; Group Control 2)&#xD;
