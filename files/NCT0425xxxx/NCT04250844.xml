  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of intrapyloric botulinum toxin in children with&#xD;
      feeding disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic vomiting and feeding difficulties are common in young children and have a negative&#xD;
      physical and psychosocial impact for patients and families. Currently there is no&#xD;
      straightforward treatment algorithm for these issues, and management often involves multiple&#xD;
      medication trials and procedures. Intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection has been proposed as&#xD;
      a treatment for nausea and vomiting in adults, but there is minimal prior research on use in&#xD;
      children and no prior research on use in children with feeding disorders. The aims of this&#xD;
      study are: (1) to determine the efficacy of intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection for&#xD;
      reducing gastrointestinal symptoms in children, (2) to determine the efficacy of intrapyloric&#xD;
      botulinum injections for improving feeding outcomes in children, and (3) to define predictors&#xD;
      of response to intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection.&#xD;

    <measure>Degree of improvement in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). This is composed of 23 items comprising 4 dimensions: Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, and School Functioning. Each item is answered using a 3-point scale: 0 (Not at all), 2 (Sometimes), 4 (A lot). Scores range 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating worse quality of life. The outcome will be assessed by calculating the change in score from baseline to 4 weeks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of symptomatic improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms will be measured with the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI). The GCSI is based on three subscales: post-prandial fullness/early satiety (4 items); nausea/vomiting (3 items), and bloating (2 items). A six-point Likert response scale, ranging from 0 (none) to 5 (very severe) is used to rate severity of each symptom. Scores range from 0 to 45, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms. This outcome will be assess by calculating the change in score from baseline to 4 weeks.</description>

The dosage will be determined by the patient's physician.</description>
