  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 30 to 90 percent of all breastfeeding women suffer from painful and sore nipple&#xD;
      lesions. Reasons for these lesions are still not completely clarified. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      irrespective of the underlying cause, these painful nipple lesions lead to an early stop of&#xD;
      breastfeeding, which has negative consequences for the infant as well as for the mother. Even&#xD;
      if the painful nipple lesions do not lead to a weaning of the baby, they cause an increased&#xD;
      psychological distress for the mother and therefore may negatively influence the mother-child&#xD;
      relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since breastfeeding is the natural and best possible type of nutrition for healthy, full term&#xD;
      babies problems causing an early stop of breastfeeding should be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The low-level laser therapy (LLLT) represents a simple and low risk treatment to reduce pain&#xD;
      and accelerate wound healing. It is supposed to improve tissue organization and should have a&#xD;
      positive anti-inflammatory and immune modulating effect. Therefore, this therapy is more and&#xD;
      more frequently used to also treat painful nipple lesions, although hardly any studies have&#xD;
      been conducted. Furthermore, in women with too little mother milk, the LLLT seems to increase&#xD;
      the milk production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the positive effects of LLLT on painful and sore&#xD;
      nipple lesions. This would justify a LLLT for women with painful nipple lesions on a wider&#xD;
      scale, with the overall goal to reduce early stopping of breastfeeding and therefore having a&#xD;
      positive impact on both, the child's health as well as the mother's wellbeing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is conducted at the department of obstetrics of the University hospital of Zurich.&#xD;
      194 breastfeeding or expressing participants with sore and painful nipple lesions who fulfill&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria are included in this study. If the participant meets any exclusion&#xD;
      criteria she is excluded from this study. After being enrolled in the study, the participant&#xD;
      is randomized to get either 3 low-level laser therapy (LLLT) treatments or 3 placebo&#xD;
      treatments within 1 to 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women having signed the declaration of consent and fulfill all inclusion criteria are then&#xD;
      examined by a breastfeeding consultant. During this examination nipple lesions are classified&#xD;
      into four different stages, causes for the lesions are evaluated and the nipple form is&#xD;
      recorded. A swab of the milk is taken to rule out a pathogenetic colonization with germs.&#xD;
      Then a blood sample is collected to analyze inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP), leucocyte (Lc)), inflammation modulators (interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      alpha (TNF-Î±)) and the lactating hormone (prolactin). The taking of blood is repeated at the&#xD;
      end of the third therapy. In the beginning and at the end of the last treatment, nipple&#xD;
      lesions are classified and photographically documented. Specific instructions regarding the&#xD;
      correct positioning and removal of the baby at the breast as well as breastfeeding positions&#xD;
      are given to the women before starting the treatment. Women then breastfeed their baby once&#xD;
      before and once after the entire therapy. Two hours after breastfeeding, the amount of milk&#xD;
      is being measured after 15 minutes of pumping. Additionally, the sensation of pain is&#xD;
      evaluated on the basis of a visual analog scale (VAS) from 1-10 and the satisfaction of the&#xD;
      treatment is recorded before and after every single treatment. At the end of the last&#xD;
      therapy, a final examination is conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the statistical analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints a proportional odds model&#xD;
      is used.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The low-level laser and the placebo-laser cannot be differentiated visually. The lasers are marked with the names &quot;Geraet1&quot; and &quot;Geraet2&quot;.

    <measure>Pain Reduction: visual pain scale</measure>
    <time_frame>though individual study completion, an average of 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary goal is to evaluate the pain reduction with the help of a visual pain scale form 1 to 10 (0 = no pain; 10 = pain as bad as can be).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>though individual study completion, an average of 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>One secondary goal is to evaluate the effect of the low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on wound healing. For this evaluation the nipple lesions are staged from 1-4 and photo documented and inflammatory markers (C reactive protein (CRP) and leucocytes (Lc)) and modulators (interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) are analyzed in the blood.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Milk Production</measure>
    <time_frame>though individual study completion, an average of 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Another secondary goal is to evaluate the effect of the low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on milk production. This is done through measuring the milk production after 15 minutes pumping of both breasts and analyzing the prolactin in the blood.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with the low-level laser therapy (LLLT): visual analogue scale</measure>

    <description>An additional secondary goal is to evaluate the participants' degree of satisfaction with the LLLT. This is accomplished with the help of a visual analogue scaled.</description>
