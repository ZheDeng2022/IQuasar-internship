      This is a single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, with parallel groups and&#xD;
      reference group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to investigate the immunity of infant born from caesarian section&#xD;
      and fed with formula milk containing fermented matrix a double and triple dosage compare the&#xD;
      first part of the trial FERCT15 assuming a dose-effect relationship of the fermented matrix&#xD;
      with immune response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The microbiota plays an important role in modulating the development of the immune system,&#xD;
      making decisive the interrelation that between nutrition, microbiota and immune cells to&#xD;
      modulate long-term health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of feeding, especially breastfeeding, and the type of delivery are factors that can&#xD;
      contribute to the development of the microbiota. Specifically, the exclusive breastfeeding&#xD;
      promotes the development of bifidobacteria that promotes protection against potential&#xD;
      infections and the development of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years it was improved the biological effects of formula milk, that represent the&#xD;
      substitutes of breast milk when this is not available or if there are contraindications to&#xD;
      breastfeeding. Functional foods derived from fermentation of cow's milk with probiotic&#xD;
      strains have been proposed for the prevention of infectious diseases of the child. Recently,&#xD;
      in a monocentric double-blind prospective study, the efficacy of fermented cow's milk with&#xD;
      Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74 was evaluated in the prevention of common winter infections&#xD;
      in children aged between 12 and 48 months. In this study, children treated with fermented&#xD;
      milk had a lower incidence of respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections compared to&#xD;
      the control group. This effect was associated with a significant stimulation of innate&#xD;
      immunity (α- and β-defensin, LL-37) and acquired (secretory IgA) and to a modulation of&#xD;
      composition and function of the intestinal microbiota characterized by a significant increase&#xD;
      in strains producing butyric acid (Firmicutes phyla). The nutritional intervention was very&#xD;
      well accepted by the children and no adverse events were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From previous results emerged that in infants born by eutocic delivery fed with fermented&#xD;
      formula milk, there is more valid response of innate and acquired immunity compare to&#xD;
      controls. In infants born by cesarean section this response is less expressed. It is possible&#xD;
      to suppose that this response is linked to a different microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives of this study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to investigate the immunity of infant born from caesarian section and fed with formula milk&#xD;
      containing fermented matrix a double and triple dosage compare the first part of the trial&#xD;
      FERCT15 assuming a dose-effect relationship of the fermented matrix with immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Value the tolerance in the two groups of infants fed with the two formulas in the study, with&#xD;
      reference to the group of infants fed with breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Value the modifications of the intestinal microbiota in the 3 groups of infants fed with the&#xD;
      3 formulas in the study, with reference to the group of infants fed with breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study with reference&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the anthropometric parameters (weight, length and cranial circumference)&#xD;
      Evaluation of body composition by plethysmography Evaluation of the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tolerance of fermented formulated milk by means of data collection and diary delivery to the&#xD;
      parents of the participants Evaluation of the safety of fermented formulated milk by&#xD;
      recording adverse events Determination of faecal samples of antimicrobial peptides&#xD;
      (defensins, catelecidines), IgA, microbiota and metabolome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be enrolled at birth (within 7 days of life) upon acquisition of the informed&#xD;
      consent of both parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment, infants born by caesarian section who take breast milk due to the&#xD;
      absence of breast milk will be randomized to receive up to the third month of age or a&#xD;
      standard formula without fermented matrix (control group) or a formula milk containing&#xD;
      fermented matrix at dosage of 4.6 g per 100g of powder (group fed with double dosage of&#xD;
      fermented matrix compare to FERCT15) or formula milk containing fermented matrix at dosage&#xD;
      6.9 g per 100g of powder (group fed with triple dosage of fermented matrix compare trial&#xD;
      FERCT15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be carried out by promoting and supporting breastfeeding and, in the event of&#xD;
      exclusive breastfeeding forecasts for at least the first 3 months of age, newborns will be&#xD;
      included in the study as a reference group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 medical visits to enrollment (V0), the first (V1) and the third month of life&#xD;
      (V2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visits the anthropometric parameters, the body composition, and the gastroenteric&#xD;
      tolerance will be evaluated. A stool sample will also be collected at the three points of the&#xD;
      life study to determine the anti-microbial peptides (catelecidine, alpha and beta defensin)&#xD;
      and the secretory IgA, and perform the analysis of the microbiota and the metabolome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was determined considering the secretory IgA values obtained in the FERCT15&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fecal secretory IgA mean value was 78,3 ±34,37ug/g and of 43,86±30,44 ug/g of feces in&#xD;
      the group fed with formula milk with fermented matrix (dosage of 2,3g/100g of powder) and&#xD;
      with the standard formula respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a 15% drop-out rate, 14 newborns per group must be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for the evaluation of variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The descriptive analyzes will be performed by calculating mean, median and standard&#xD;
      deviations for the continuous variables and expressing the distribution of the frequencies&#xD;
      for the discrete variables. The main analysis will resort to tests for independent samples,&#xD;
      Student or Mann-Whitney tests according to the distribution of the outcome variables. To&#xD;
      jointly analyze the trend in time from V0 to V2 of the outcome variables in the two groups,&#xD;
      the one that received the fermented formulated milk and the one that received the standard&#xD;
      formula, based on the type of delivery (spontaneous or cesarean) will be used regression&#xD;
      models for repeated measurements (random effects models or GEE models).&#xD;
