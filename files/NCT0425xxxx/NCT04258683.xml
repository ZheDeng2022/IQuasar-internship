      This is a phase 2A multi-centre, open label, pilot study of pembrolizumab added to the&#xD;
      standard first-line therapy of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) in&#xD;
      newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma that are not eligible for autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2A, pilot study of pembrolizumab administered in combination with CyBorD in&#xD;
      newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible multiple myeloma patients who achieve less than VGPR&#xD;
      (according to IMWG criteria) after two cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients will start their standard CyBorD treatment with the&#xD;
      combination of cyclophosphamide administered at 300 mg/m2 orally, bortezomib administered at&#xD;
      1.5 mg/m2 subcutaneously, and dexamethasone administered orally at 40 mg, all given on days&#xD;
      1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle. Patients not progressing after 2 cycles of CyBorD&#xD;
      treatment and achieving less than VGPR by IMWG criteria will be screened for this study.&#xD;
      Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will add pembrolizumab to their standard CyBorD&#xD;
      treatment starting with cycle 4 day 1, which will be cycle one of this study treatment.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab in combination with CyBorD will be administered intravenously at 200 mg at day&#xD;
      1 of every 3-week cycle for 8 cycles (24 weeks). CyBorD will be discontinued after 24 weeks&#xD;
      and Pembrolizumab will be administered as a single agent at the same dose for an additional&#xD;
      27 cycles (81 weeks).&#xD;
