  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current prevention and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in sarcopenia, by&#xD;
      non-pharmacological approaches remain limited and are far from optimal. This randomized&#xD;
      control intervention pilot study will provide new evidence of the unexplored relationship&#xD;
      between muscle strength and high BP in sarcopenia, and experimentally test the effects of an&#xD;
      evidence-based progressive resistance training intervention on BP, while also examining&#xD;
      reversibility to identify muscle strength as a non-pharmacological target for BP control in&#xD;
      older sarcopenic adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This premise of this K01 proposal is to address current gaps in the literature regarding the&#xD;
      understanding of high blood pressure due to sarcopenia, and provide new evidence for the&#xD;
      discernible relationship between low muscle strength and blood pressure in sarcopenia, and&#xD;
      effective non-pharmaceutical treatment approaches. This study will evaluate the feasibility&#xD;
      of recruitment, retention, implementation and adherence to an empirically-based progressive&#xD;
      resistance training (PRT) intervention to test its effect on blood pressure in a targeted&#xD;
      population of older adults with sarcopenia who are randomized (via block permuted scheme) to&#xD;
      the PRT intervention. Built within this randomized control intervention design, the&#xD;
      investigators will further explore reversibility to examine whether muscle strength serves as&#xD;
      an intervention target for blood pressure control in sarcopenic adults, which will be more&#xD;
      appropriately tested in subsequently well-powered R-level intervention studies.&#xD;
      Physiologically plausible microvascular mechanisms by which the PRT impacts changes in blood&#xD;
      pressure will also be explored.&#xD;

    <description>60 Intervention group will receive 12 weeks of supervised resistance training following the American Heart Association and American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for older adults. Exercises will include a mixture of upper-body and lower body strength exercises. Training load will be determined based on initial 1-repetition maximum tests (1-RM). Initial exercise load will start off at low resistance (40-50% 1RM) with more frequent repetitions per exercise, and will gradually increase weight load and intensity over the exercise training period.</description>
