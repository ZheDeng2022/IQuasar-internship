      The aim of this prospective observational trial is to evaluate the influence of Coping&#xD;
      strategies on pulmonary rehabilitation outcomes like 6-minute walk distance and Quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the recent pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) statement of the American Thoracic Society/&#xD;
      European Respiratory Society, PR is mentioned to be beneficial by improving exercise&#xD;
      capacity, symptoms and quality of life in patients with other chronic respiratory diseases&#xD;
      than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (1). Although patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) often suffer from psychological distress such as symptoms of anxiety&#xD;
      and depression, only little is known about the impact of these mental co-morbidities on PR&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a former study the investigators demonstrated that patients with IPF benefit well from an&#xD;
      inpatient PR program of only 3 weeks duration by improving exercise capacity (6-Minute walk&#xD;
      distance), health-related quality of life as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression.&#xD;
      During the 3-months follow-up after PR, most of these improvements disappeared so that this&#xD;
      group showed similar values at follow-up compared to baseline. However, in contrast patients&#xD;
      from the control-group with usual care worsened significantly during the 6 months study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, a linear regression analysis revealed that IPF patients with lower levels of&#xD;
      anxiety showed the tendency to have the best sustainability in exercise capacity at the 3&#xD;
      months follow-up. Given that maintenance of exercise capacity may be crucial to influence&#xD;
      prognosis and the risk of mortality, reducing symptoms of anxiety might be of special&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The negative influence of anxiety symptoms on exercise capacity is a new finding in IPF&#xD;
      patients but already known in the field of other chronic diseases: in patients with chronic&#xD;
      pain and recently also in patients with COPD, &quot;fear avoidance&quot; behavior is discussed as&#xD;
      having a direct negative influence on daily physical activity levels. COPD patients seem to&#xD;
      develop fear/anxiety of exercise-related dyspnea due to classical and operant conditioning.&#xD;
      This may lead to consecutive avoidance of physical activity and other exercises in daily life&#xD;
      (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety symptoms and psychological distress have been shown to be related to patients&#xD;
      individual illness perceptions and their way of coping with the disease like e.g.&#xD;
      problem-focusing coping, looking for information, depressive coping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with IPF, the role of coping styles in the context of PR has not been&#xD;
      investigated yet. It is unclear whether anxiety symptoms are influenced by individual&#xD;
      characteristics of IPF patients such as specific coping strategies and illness perceptions&#xD;
      and therefore, whether individual coping strategies might have an influence on the PR&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This latter might be an underestimated issue influencing the PR effects in patients with&#xD;
      chronic respiratory diseases. Better knowledge in this field is of special clinical&#xD;
      importance in order to ensure short- und long term PR success. Potential differences in&#xD;
      psychological profiles or coping strategies between COPD and IPF patients might result in&#xD;
      disease-specific interventions during and after PR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therforme, aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of coping strategies on pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective observational trial. Asssessments will take place at admission of&#xD;
      the rehabilitation program, at discharge and partially after 3-month.&#xD;
