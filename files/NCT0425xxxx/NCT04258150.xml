  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a dreadful disease due to its often advanced stage at&#xD;
      diagnosis and poor sensitivity to chemotherapy. Progression after 1. line chemotherapy is&#xD;
      inevitable in patients with advanced PC, and treatment options for patients who progress&#xD;
      after 1. line chemotherapy are limited. Considering the emerging role of the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment (TME), the combination of checkpoint blocking antibodies with agents that&#xD;
      target the inhibitory effects of the TME could lead to better responses in tumor historically&#xD;
      resistant to checkpoint blocking antibody approaches. Inflammation is one of the hallmarks of&#xD;
      cancer, and contributes to PC initiation, enhanced invasiveness and metastasis. The&#xD;
      immune-modulating cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) facilitates the inflammation cascade and key&#xD;
      pathways within the respective TME, among others promotion of tumor-induced immunosuppression&#xD;
      and facilitation of metastasis. Thus, IL-6 inhibition approach can potentially directly&#xD;
      affect the immunosuppressive TME compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the synergy of the proposed combinatorial approach, participants with locally&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic pancreatic tumors who have progressed during or after at least 1 line of&#xD;
      systemic chemotherapy in the metastatic setting will receive nivolumab and ipilimumab&#xD;
      administered in combination with radiotherapy and tocilizumab. It is anticipated that this&#xD;
      clinical study will inform the use of this 3-drug combination for further phase II and/or&#xD;
      phase III clinical testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study assessing ipilimumab, nivolumab and tocilizumab in combination with&#xD;
      SBRT of 15 Gy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic PC whose disease has progressed&#xD;
      on at least 1. line chemotherapy with either a 5-FU-containing and /or gemcitabine containing&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The trial is designed as an investigator initiated prospective open-label study&#xD;
      in patients with advanced PC to determine the efficacy and safety ipilimumab, nivolumab and&#xD;
      tocilizumab in combination with SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of Part A, Lead-in, as well as a possible Part B, non-randomized&#xD;
      expansion (Part B: Expansion) or a possible Part B, randomized controlled study (Part B:&#xD;
      RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, patients will be enrolled in the study to treatment with ipilimumab, nivolumab and&#xD;
      tocilizumab in combination with SBRT, until 30 patients have been treated (Part A: Lead-in).&#xD;
      Patient recruitment and tumor assessment will be monitored on an ongoing basis. This Part A:&#xD;
      Lead-in involves Department of Oncology, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University&#xD;
      Hospital, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter extension will be activated in case of successfully completed lead-in phase and&#xD;
      the format of that Part B will be determined based on the responses seen in the first 30&#xD;
      patients in Part A. A protocol amendment will be made if criteria are met to proceed to Part&#xD;
      B. The protocol amendment will include available data from Part A and any changes to study&#xD;
      design, additional sites and statistical plan, if needed.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Subjects must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent&#xD;
                  form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be&#xD;
                  obtained before the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not&#xD;
                  part of normal subject care&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
                  schedule, laboratory testing, and other requirements of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytological confirmation of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
             carcinoma prior to entering this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For Part A and Part B Expansion: there is no upper limit on the number of prior&#xD;
                  chemotherapy regimens received. Patients must have received and progressed during&#xD;
                  or after at least 1 line of systemic chemotherapy in the metastatic setting&#xD;
                  (gemcitabine or 5-FU based regimens).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For Part B RCT: patients must have tumor progression following prior standard&#xD;
                  first-line 5-FU-containing or gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy (no more than 1&#xD;
                  prior chemotherapy regimen or any other systemic therapy for recurrent/metastatic&#xD;
                  pancreatic carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Notes:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If a participant received adjuvant/neoadjuvant systemic combinational&#xD;
                       therapy, and progressed within 6 months, the adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
                       will be considered as 1 line of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  In general, discontinuation of 1 drug in a multi-drug regimen and&#xD;
                       continuation of other drug(s), is considered part of the same line of&#xD;
                       treatment. Restarting the same regimen after a drug holiday or maintenance&#xD;
                       chemotherapy can also be considered part of the same line of treatment.&#xD;
                       Switching from IV (5-FU) to an oral formulation (capecitabine) of the same&#xD;
                       drug is also considered part of the same line of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Minimum time from first systemic therapy for recurrent/metastatic&#xD;
                       adenocarcinoma of pancreas to progression should be at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG/WHO Performance Status (PS) 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants will be required to undergo mandatory pre- and on-treatment biopsies&#xD;
             at acceptable clinical risk as judged by the investigator. An archival pre-treatment&#xD;
             sample is not acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10⁹/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10⁹/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (patients with Gilbert's&#xD;
                  Syndrome must have a total bilirubin ≤ 50 mmol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST/ALT ≤ 5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or CrCl ≥ 40 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
                  formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception as&#xD;
             indicated in Appendix 3. For a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is&#xD;
             insufficient information to assess teratogenicity (preclinical studies have not been&#xD;
             done), a highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per&#xD;
             year) is required. The individual methods of contraception and duration should be&#xD;
             determined in consultation with the investigator. WOCBP must follow instructions for&#xD;
             birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours,&#xD;
             contraception should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for&#xD;
             the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab and&#xD;
             ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. WOCBP should therefore use an&#xD;
             adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for&#xD;
             nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. The investigator shall review contraception&#xD;
             methods and the time period that contraception must be followed. Men that are sexually&#xD;
             active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the&#xD;
             investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a&#xD;
             period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five&#xD;
             half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab is up to 25 days. Men who are sexually active&#xD;
             with WOCBP must continue contraception for 31 weeks (90 days plus the time required&#xD;
             for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.&#xD;
             Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e. who are postmenopausal or surgically&#xD;
             sterile as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have signed and dated a BIOPAC approved written informed consent form in&#xD;
             accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with&#xD;
             vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune&#xD;
             condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic&#xD;
             treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger&#xD;
             are permitted to enroll&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of ipilimumab, nivolumab and tocilizumab. The following are exceptions to this&#xD;
             criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, or topical steroids; or local steroid injections (e.g.&#xD;
                  intra-articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
                  prednisone or equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. CT scan&#xD;
                  premedication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of allergy to study drug components&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP who are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
