  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sustained military operations (SUSOPs) result in psychological stress and cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction, which may be related to the recruitment of classical monocytes into the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of sustained-release beta-alanine on changes in cognition and&#xD;
           markers of immune cell recruitment during a 24-hour simulated military operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine associations between changes cognition and changes in markers mediating&#xD;
           immune cell recruitment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sustained military operations (SUSOPs) expose soldiers to a multitude of stressors, including&#xD;
      sustained physical activity, caloric deficit, and sleep deprivation. Several studies have&#xD;
      shown that the combination of these factors result in psychological stress, which often leads&#xD;
      to significant cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological stress has been shown to result in activation of neuroendocrine pathways that&#xD;
      signal into the periphery and relay information from the brain to the immune system. This&#xD;
      process is generally characterized by elevations of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      chemokines, secondary messengers and reactive oxygen species. Notably, peripheral classical&#xD;
      monocytes are reported to undergo recruitment to the brain during periods of psychological&#xD;
      stress following priming by cytokines secreted from activated microglia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carnosine, an endogenous dipeptide consisting of beta-alanine and L-histidine, has been shown&#xD;
      to inhibit the synthesis of inflammatory and oxidative mediators in microglia in vitro.&#xD;
      Beta-alanine, which is the rate limiting amino acid in carnosine formation has been shown to&#xD;
      increase carnosine concentrations in various regions of the brain in rodents which been&#xD;
      associated with biochemical changes that resulted in favorable improvements in resilience to&#xD;
      stress exposure. However, data on the effects of beta-alanine supplementation on cognition in&#xD;
      humans is less clear. Further, the effect of beta-alanine supplementation on systemic and&#xD;
      cellular mediators of monocyte recruitment has not been examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of sustained-release beta-alanine on changes in psychological&#xD;
           stress and cognition using Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric (ANAM)&#xD;
           cognitive assessments during a 24-hour simulated military operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effect of sustained-release beta-alanine on monocyte chemoattractant&#xD;
           protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-8, Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (CD11a),&#xD;
           macrophage-1-antigen (CD11b) expression and C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) expression&#xD;
           on neutrophils and classical monocytes during a 24-hour simulated military operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine associations between MCP-1, interleukin-8, CD11a, CD11b, CCR2 and a composite&#xD;
           measure of cognition derived from ANAM assessment scores during a 24-hour simulated&#xD;
           military operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind placebo controlled trial compared the effect of supplementation with sustained&#xD;
      release beta-alanine (12 grams per day) versus placebo (equivalent amount of rice powder) on&#xD;
      cognition and monocyte responses during a 24-hour simulated military operation consisting of&#xD;
      sleep-restriction, caloric restriction, and acute and sustained periods military specific&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation occurred over a period of 14 days prior to completion of the simulated&#xD;
      military operation. ANAM tests were assessed and blood samples taken upon arrival to the lab&#xD;
      for the 24 hour simulated operation (0 hours) and at 12, 18 and 24 hours during the SUSOP.&#xD;
