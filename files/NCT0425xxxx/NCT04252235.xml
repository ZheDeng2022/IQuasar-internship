  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the influence of home air purification on the lung health of adults with&#xD;
      eosinophilic COPD. Half of the participants will receive real air purifiers (HEPA filters)&#xD;
      and half will receive sham air purifiers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the&#xD;
      United States, and is exacerbated by exposure to air pollution. Knowledge about whether air&#xD;
      purification affects the health of those with eosinophilic COPD (approximately 40% of all&#xD;
      COPD patients seeking care), who generally have more active airway inflammation. If found to&#xD;
      be beneficial, home air purification may offer a non-pharmacologic intervention for a large&#xD;
      proportion of people with this common and serious disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate whether home air purification affects lung function, respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms, nasal biomarkers (inflammatory proteins and metals) among people with eosinophilic&#xD;
      COPD. Participants will be randomized to receive real or sham air purifier in the bedroom and&#xD;
      living room for 12 months. The intervention group will receive two high efficiency&#xD;
      particulate air (HEPA) air purifiers, while the control group will receive two sham air&#xD;
      purifiers that look and sound the same as real HEPA air purifiers.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline [3 months before intervention and day of intervention] and post intervention [7 days, 6 months and 12 months]</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced exhalation maneuver. Lower volumes indicate worse lung function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health status (also called health-related quality of life) by St. George Respiratory Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline [3 months before intervention and day of intervention] and post-intervention [6 months and 12 months]</time_frame>
    <description>The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire is scored from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate more health impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in respiratory symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly for 3 months preintervention and 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale measures the severity of respiratory symptoms in COPD. The total score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional capacity by 6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>The 6 minute walk test measures distance (in meters) walked in a time of 6 minutes</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in nasal inflammatory mediators</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline [3 months before intervention and day of intervention] and post intervention [7 days, 6 months and 12 months]</time_frame>
    <description>Concentrations of inflammatory mediators relevant to allergic and non-allergic airway pathophysiology will be measured repeatedly at baseline and post-randomization in the nasal lining fluid by nasosorption. Mediators will include including Eotaxin, Eotaxin-3, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-8 (HA), IL-10, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17A, IP-10, MCP-1, MCP-4, MDC, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, TARC, TNF-α, TNF-β, VEGF-A</description>

    <ipd_description>After study completion, data requests for post-hoc analyses may be submitted to the PI who will discuss each request with members of the research team and External Advisory Committee. If approved, we will facilitate secure access to data with appropriate coding files that will allow interpretation of the dataset. We will utilize data-sharing agreements to restrict the transfer of data, requiring that data be used only for research purposes. If excessive data preparation is needed, we will request funds from the requester to cover the additional personnel and resource costs.</ipd_description>
