  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, frequently associated with dysmenorrhea,&#xD;
      dyspareunia and abdomino-pelvic pain limiting quality of life. Most medical therapies aim to&#xD;
      alleviate the severity of symptoms. Recent guidelines recommend the use of either OCPs or&#xD;
      progestins as a first-line treatment of pain associated with endometriosis. The effectiveness&#xD;
      of both OCPs and dienogest, a fourth-generation progestin, for endometriosis treatment has&#xD;
      been demonstrated. The literature is rich with data comparing the use of Visanne or OCPs to&#xD;
      placebo or GnRH analogs. However, there are no head to head studies comparing their efficacy&#xD;
      in the management of endometriosis associated pain. The study aims to evaluate if Dienogest&#xD;
      (Visanne) is not inferior in efficacy to oral contraceptive pills (Yasmin) in controlling&#xD;
      pain associated with endometriosis?&#xD;

      Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which&#xD;
      induces a chronic inflammatory reaction. It is an estrogen-dependent associated with pelvic&#xD;
      pain and infertility. It is a relatively common chronic gynecological disease that affects&#xD;
      approximately 10% of reproductive aged women. Patients with endometriosis often suffer from&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, and chronic abdominal or pelvic pain, resulting in a&#xD;
      severely limited quality of life. The aim of most medical therapies is to alleviate the&#xD;
      severity of symptoms. Commonly used hormonal therapies include combined oral contraceptives&#xD;
      (OCP), progestogens, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, androgens and&#xD;
      antiprogestogens, all of which are considered to have similar efficacy but different&#xD;
      tolerability profiles, which are often suboptimal. To date, the most widely used agent for&#xD;
      the medical treatment of endometriosis is oral contraceptive (albeit off-label). In&#xD;
      particular, evidence supporting the efficacy of estrogen-progestin therapy (EP) in pain&#xD;
      control and reducing the risk of recurrence in women undergoing surgery for endometriosis. In&#xD;
      recent years, the effectiveness of dienogest, a fourth-generation progestin, for&#xD;
      endometriosis treatment has been demonstrated. Dienogest seems to be as effective as&#xD;
      gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-a (GnRH-a) in terms of endometriosis-related pelvic pain&#xD;
      improvement. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Visanne versus OCP&#xD;
      treatment of endometriosis associated pelvic pain in a double-blinded randomized controlled&#xD;
      pilot study. It is a two armed pilot study; each group will include 50 patients. Women with&#xD;
      endometriosis will be randomized to receive either DNG (n=50) or OCPs (n=50). The diagnosis&#xD;
      of endometriosis will be by clinical evaluation, laparotomy, laparoscopy, or imaging analysis&#xD;
      (combination of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography) of endometriotic ovarian&#xD;
      chocolate cysts.The first group will receive Deinogest (Visanne) 2mg/day, orally for 24&#xD;
      weeks. The second group will receive monophasic combined OCP (Yasmin, Ethinyl Estradiol and&#xD;
      Drospirenone) daily for 24 weeks. The treating physician and the patients will be blinded to&#xD;
      the treatment option. The relief of symptoms and efficacy will be evaluated by questionnaire&#xD;
      on follow up visits at 3 and 6 month of the treatment. Data collected will be analyzed and&#xD;
      compared between the 2 groups. We hypothesize that there will be no difference in pain&#xD;
      scores, efficacy and safety between the two treatments.&#xD;
