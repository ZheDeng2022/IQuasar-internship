  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the impact of a&#xD;
      remotely-delivered antenatal milk expression (AME) intervention versus an attention control&#xD;
      condition on breastfeeding outcomes among a sample of 280 nulliparous, non-diabetic women&#xD;
      with pre-pregnancy body mass indices ≥ 25. AME involves milk expression and collection in the&#xD;
      third pregnancy trimester and is theorized to address multiple barriers to breastfeeding&#xD;
      among women with higher BMI, including impaired breastfeeding self-efficacy, insufficient&#xD;
      milk supply (critical period endocrine modulation of milk volume), and early formula&#xD;
      supplementation in the context of a medically complex birth (availability of banked antenatal&#xD;
      milk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in their third trimester of pregnancy and allocated into one of&#xD;
      two study arms: 1) AME instruction delivered by remote, live International Board Certified&#xD;
      Lactation Consultants via an innovative app-based telelactation platform; or 2) an attention&#xD;
      control condition (video-based infant care education unrelated to infant feeding).&#xD;
      Video-based education for both groups will occur in weekly study visits from 37 to 40 weeks&#xD;
      gestation, with women in the intervention group continuing AME 1-2 times per day at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured outcomes of interest will include short and long-term breastfeeding practices (e.g.,&#xD;
      breastfeeding duration, exclusivity) and participants' experiences with and perceptions of&#xD;
      AME.&#xD;

      The purpose of the PREPARE Trial is to examine the impact of an antenatal milk expression&#xD;
      (AME) intervention among women with pre-pregnancy BMI 25 or more on breastfeeding outcomes,&#xD;
      including breastfeeding self-efficacy, breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, and perception&#xD;
      of insufficient milk supply. Specifically, the investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effect of the AME intervention on short-term breastfeeding outcomes,&#xD;
           including breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusivity, to two weeks postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore the sustained effect of the AME intervention on longer-term breastfeeding&#xD;
           duration and exclusivity over the first year postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine participants' experiences with and perceptions of AME.&#xD;
