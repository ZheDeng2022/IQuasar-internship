  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1-2, multicenter, international, single-arm, open-label study designed to&#xD;
      identify a recommended dose of bosutinib administered orally once daily in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed chronic phase Ph+ CML (ND CML) and pediatric patients with Ph+CML who&#xD;
      have received at least one prior TKI therapy (R/I CML), to preliminary estimate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability and efficacy, and to evaluate the PK of bosutinib in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 part of the study employs a 6+4 design (no DLT in 6 patients or 1 DLT in 10&#xD;
      patients) and incorporates additional PK information before escalating to the next dose&#xD;
      level. If there is unacceptable toxicity or if PK results have exceeded the acceptable&#xD;
      exposure levels for the adult equivalent dose, further dose escalation will be prohibited.&#xD;
      The Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) is defined as the dose that results in&#xD;
      equivalent(approximately ±20% of the adult values) PK exposure to 500 mg/day in adults and&#xD;
      with 0 of 6 or &lt;2 DLTs observed out of 10 evaluable patients with Ph+ CML and resistance or&#xD;
      intolerance to prior TKI therapy. The phase 2 part of the study will enroll the following&#xD;
      patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newly diagnosed (ND): newly diagnosed pediatric Ph + CML patients in chronic phase (CP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resistant/intolerant (R/I): chronic phase or advanced (accelerated (AP) or blast phase&#xD;
           (BP) pediatric Ph+ CML patients with resistance or intolerance to at least 1 prior TKI&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria Phase 1 (R/I patients only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Cytogenetic and molecular diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML[2] at&#xD;
             either time of initial CML diagnosis or at time of study screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Cytogenetics must be performed by chromosome banding analysis (CBA) of bone marrow&#xD;
             cell metaphases, and requires at least 20 metaphases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Only if dividing marrow cells cannot be obtained, or if there is an insufficient&#xD;
             number of metaphases, CBA can be substituted by interphase fluorescence in situ&#xD;
             hybridization (IFISH) of bone marrow or peripheral blood cells, using dual color dual&#xD;
             fusion probes, that allow the detection of BCR-ABL+ nuclei; at least 200 nuclei should&#xD;
             be counted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Qualitative RT-PCR should be performed on RNA extracted from freshly collected bone&#xD;
             marrow or peripheral blood cells. It identifies the transcript type, either e14a2 or&#xD;
             13a2 (also known as b3a2 and b2a2), or much more rarely e19a2, or e1a2, indicating the&#xD;
             BCRABL protein weight (P210, rarely P230 or P190).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Resistance (suboptimal response or failure, as defined by 2013 European Leukemia Net&#xD;
             guidelines[3]) or intolerance (with or without suboptimal response or failure) to at&#xD;
             least one prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) The 2013 European LeukemiaNet&#xD;
             guidelines[3] will be used to define suboptimal response and failure to prior TKI&#xD;
             therapy. Details are provided in appendices 3 (intolerance or failure after one TKI)&#xD;
             and 4 (Failure after more than one TKIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Intolerance to prior TKI therapy will be determined by the treating investigator, but&#xD;
             generally applies to patients who are unable to receive standard or reduced doses of a&#xD;
             TKI due to significant drug-related toxicity and/or when the drug-related toxicity is&#xD;
             not responding to appropriate medical management. Patients who enroll as a result of&#xD;
             intolerance to prior TKI therapy may have any level of response to their prior therapy&#xD;
             and still be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age ≥1 and &lt;18 years at day of attaining the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Lansky performance status ≥50% for patients ≤16 years of age, or Karnofsky scale ≥50%&#xD;
             for patients &gt;16 years of age (appendix 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate bone marrow function:&#xD;
&#xD;
             For second-line and third-line CP CML patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1000/mm3 (&gt;1.0 x109/L); Platelets ≥75,000/mm3 (≥75 x109/L)&#xD;
             without any platelet transfusions during the preceding 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For fourth-line CP and all for all AP/BP CML patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Absolute neutrophil count &gt;500/mm3 (&gt;0.5 x109/L); Platelets ≥50,000/mm3 (≥50 x109/L)&#xD;
             without any platelet transfusions during the preceding 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Adequate Renal Function: Subjects must have a calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥&#xD;
             60mL/min/1.73 m2, using the Schwartz formula to estimate GFR (see appendix 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate liver function, including:&#xD;

             involvement of the liver; Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN unless the patient has documented&#xD;
             Gilbert syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Recovered to Grade 0-1, or to baseline, from any acute toxicities of prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, differentiation therapy, or biologic&#xD;
             therapy, with the exception of alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Able to reliably swallow whole capsules, whole tablets; or drug added to a suitable&#xD;
             foodstuff (from capsule contents, added to either apple sauce or yoghurt); or tablets&#xD;
             and/or capsules dissolved in water as an oral syringe drinking solution, or tablets&#xD;
             dissolved and administered by NG tube when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Serum/urine pregnancy test (for all girls ≥ age of menarche) negative at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

             agree to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study and for&#xD;
             at least 30 days after the last dose of assigned treatment. A patient is of&#xD;
             childbearing potential if, in the opinion of the Investigator, he/she is biologically&#xD;
             capable of having children and is sexually active.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Written informed consent of parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and/or patients (when&#xD;
             applicable depending on age and local law and regulations)&#xD;
&#xD;

               8. Serum/urine pregnancy test (for all girls ≥ age of menarche) negative at&#xD;
                  screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Male and female patients of childbearing potential and at risk for pregnancy must&#xD;
                  agree to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study and&#xD;
                  for at least 30 days after the last dose of assigned treatment. A patient is of&#xD;
                  childbearing potential if, in the opinion of the Investigator, he/she is&#xD;
                  biologically capable of having children and is sexually active.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Written informed consent of parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and/or patients (when&#xD;
                  applicable depending on age and local law and regulations)&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Patients (including legally acceptable representative for minors where&#xD;
                  applicable) who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
                  plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resistant/Intolerant (R/I) CML patients: The exclusion criteria for the R/I cohort in&#xD;
             Phase 2 are identical to the Phase 1 exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly Diagnosed CML patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of primary Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia.&#xD;

             testing will be performed at screening for a baseline assessment, but results are not&#xD;
             used to determine eligibility. This exclusion criterion is based on whether there is a&#xD;
             known history of these mutations at the time of study entry. If these mutations become&#xD;
             evident during the study the patient will go off study).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Diagnosed or suspected congenital or acquired prolonged QT syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of prolonged QTc.&#xD;

         16. Recent or ongoing clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder that may interfere&#xD;
             with the intake or absorption of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Evidence of serious active or uncontrolled bacterial, fungal or viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Known history of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
