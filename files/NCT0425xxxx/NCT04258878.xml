      We aim to prospectively evaluate the risk factors that can play a role before, during or&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSIs) are either superficial or deep and may involve the organs, or&#xD;
      spaces accessed during an operation. The reported incidence of SSIs in coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      grafting (CABG) surgery ranges between 0.3% and 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a strong suggestion that an impairment of vascular supply of the sternum may be one&#xD;
      of the most important factors influencing the incidence of deep sternal wound infection&#xD;
      (DSWI). Several studies have studied the risk factors for SSIs including DSWI in cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. These risk factors included obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD), connective tissue disease, steroid use, smoking, peripheral&#xD;
      vascular disease and renal insufficiency. In addition, intraoperative factors (e.g., use of&#xD;
      bilateral internal mammary arteries [BIMA] grafting, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass [CPB]&#xD;
      duration) and postoperative variables (e.g., prolonged mechanical ventilation, reoperation&#xD;
      for bleeding, postoperative transfusions and gastrointestinal, nephrological and respiratory&#xD;
      complications) have been shown to be associated with DSWI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk for sternal wound infection (SWI) is increased if cardiac surgery involves internal&#xD;
      thoracic arteries grafting and a valve procedure, or use of a ventricular assist device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leg wound infections at donor sites account for &gt;70% of cases with severe infection following&#xD;
      cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac SSIs increase the length of hospital stay (LOS) and increase treatment costs in&#xD;
      proportion to the severity of the infection. These costs increase by 3.8%, 14.7% and 29.4% in&#xD;
      mild, moderate and severe infections respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is often confounded by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and in&#xD;
      addition, substantial proportions of these infected patients are elderly and have co-existing&#xD;
      medical problems. In the past, such elderly patients with significant comorbidities would not&#xD;
      have been considered for surgery.[8] As the population ages, it is reasonable to assume that&#xD;
      older and sicker patients will be admitted for surgery, and this will inevitably increase the&#xD;
      risk and incidence of SSIs.&#xD;
