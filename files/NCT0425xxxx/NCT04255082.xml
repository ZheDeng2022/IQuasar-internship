  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of mindfulness-based interventions on&#xD;
      patient stress, patient-provider communication, and other measures of SDM at MDMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to have a quantifiable measure of perceived stress and communication ability&#xD;
      in patients. This is the first study of its kind to be conducted at MDMC. This pilot study&#xD;
      will not only benefit the patients but also contribute to the medical community's&#xD;
      understanding of treating the whole patient through mindfulness and shared decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Study Objectives 2.1.1. Primary Objective To assess the impact of mindfulness-based&#xD;
      interventions on inpatients and outpatients stress, patient-provider communication, and other&#xD;
      measures of SDM at MDMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.2. Secondary Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of such a study in the patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective cohort of patients at MDMC, The Liver Institute, and Texas&#xD;
      Oncology between 6/1/2018 and 12/31/2020. Subject records will be reviewed to identify&#xD;
      case-based details including demographics, diagnosis, and date of diagnosis. Subjects will&#xD;
      complete survey instruments to assess their levels of stress and anxiety, and the impact of&#xD;
      the same on their ability to communicate at baseline, after the stress management coaching&#xD;
      session, following their treatment planning visit (outpatients only), and one week after the&#xD;
      visit (by mail). Providers will also complete the dyadic OPTION instrument (for outpatients&#xD;
      only) to empirically assess the perceived degree of patient involvement in the treatment&#xD;
      planning process. The face-to-face stress management coaching session will occur&#xD;
      approximately an hour before meeting with the treatment planning team for outpatients and at&#xD;
      a designated time identified for inpatients. The session will focus on mindfulness-based&#xD;
      interventions on stress regulation, communication, and shared decision making. A&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation will be performed and a unique treatment plan developed for each&#xD;
      subject based on a biopsychosocial model to address the mind, body, and spirit. Nutritional&#xD;
      counseling and lifestyle coaching will also be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Study Outcome Measures 2.2.1. Primary Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the mindfulness-based intervention which will be assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and post-intervention perception of stress and anxiety Impact of stress on&#xD;
      communication Emotional-Brain state Level of SDM during a pivotal visit with provider e.g.&#xD;
      treatment planning visit (for outpatients only) The Emotional Distress-Anxiety (PROMIS,&#xD;
      2016), Communication Short Form (Cella, PROMIS, 2013), Emotional/Brain State Question&#xD;
      (Mellin, 2017) and The Shared Decision Making dyadic OPTION scale (Melbourne, 2016) will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.2. Secondary Outcome Feasibility of such a study in the patient population and setting.&#xD;
      This will be measured by the barriers encountered and the ability to successfully carry out&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
