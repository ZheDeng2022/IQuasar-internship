    <textblock>
      The proposed ONE TEAM Study is an 18-month, cluster randomized controlled trial. This study&#xD;
      will use a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design with a second&#xD;
      randomization for the intervention group using a dynamic treatment regimen approach. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to randomize 800 adults with newly-diagnosed selected cancers treated&#xD;
      with curative intent (breast, prostate, colorectal, endometrial, non-small cell lung, and&#xD;
      endometrial) and with &gt;1 selected cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidity (hypertension,&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia). Participants will be enrolled through Duke&#xD;
      Cancer Institute and two community-based oncology practices, both settings serving&#xD;
      socio-demographically diverse populations. The unit of randomization will be the PCP clinic;&#xD;
      there will be ~80 PCP clinics across North Carolina involved in the study. The overarching&#xD;
      goals of this study are to improve chronic disease management and communication among cancer&#xD;
      survivors by engaging PCPs as active members of the cancer care team and reframing the&#xD;
      message to cancer survivors and providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diversity supplement with retrospective and qualitative components has been added to&#xD;
      abstract older adults with solid tumors who underwent cancer surgery at DUHS. Aims include&#xD;
      (1) to estimate the prevalence of cardiovascular complications ≤90 postoperative days among&#xD;
      older adults with solid tumors undergoing surgery, and its association with care coordination&#xD;
      between surgical providers and PCPs ; (2) to develop a risk index for cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications ≤90 days of surgery among older adult patients with a solid tumor; and (3) to&#xD;
      Assess experience and perceptions of PCPs on care coordination with surgical providers of&#xD;
      older adults with a solid tumor following cancer surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an 18-month cluster randomized controlled trial using a SMART design with two&#xD;
      randomizations (the second using an embedded dynamic treatment regimen), with a target&#xD;
      enrollment of 800 patients with one of six solid tumors (stage I-III breast, prostate,&#xD;
      colorectal, endometrial, and head/neck cancer; stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer) who are&#xD;
      being treated with curative intent. To engage the PCP early in the process, the investigators&#xD;
      will enroll patients at one of their first visits with a cancer specialist (e.g., surgeon,&#xD;
      radiation or medical oncologist). The investigators estimate that 80 unique community-based&#xD;
      PCP clinics across North Carolina will be involved in the study. The investigators will&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of the multi-level intervention compared with usual care on (1)&#xD;
      Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures of management of&#xD;
      the three CVD comorbidities using laboratory testing (glycated hemoglobin [A1c], lipid&#xD;
      profile) and blood pressure measurements; (2) medication adherence assessed pharmacy refill&#xD;
      data using Proportion of Days Covered (PDC); and (3) patient-provider communication&#xD;
      (Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care, PCC-Ca-36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key aspects of the intervention are to: reframe the message to patients, PCPs, oncologists,&#xD;
      and the respective health care teams in these two settings to emphasize the importance of&#xD;
      optimizing the management of comorbidities during and after cancer therapy; promote a change&#xD;
      in the workflow in both PCP and oncology practices; enhance PCP-oncologist relationships, and&#xD;
      utilize EHR technology. There are two phases of the intervention, both having patient- and&#xD;
      PCP-level components. During the first phase of the intervention, occurring with the first&#xD;
      randomization, the investigators will test the effectiveness of a self-guided, informational&#xD;
      strategy (iGuide). For PCP clinics that do not achieve the HEDIS targets, a booster phase&#xD;
      with tailored (patient-level) and targeted (PCP-level) strategies will be tested with a&#xD;
      second randomization (iGuide2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention has been designed to leverage communication tools with in our electronic&#xD;
      health record (EHR), Epic . For patients who agree to receive study communications through&#xD;
      Epic's patient portal, MyChart, we created an automated messaging system using a dynamic,&#xD;
      rules-based protocol which determines the proper language to send each subject based on their&#xD;
      study arm and time since enrollment. We developed a similar rules-based automated messaging&#xD;
      system for provider communications. This method sends letters to a provider's Epic inbox,&#xD;
      called InBasket, for Duke providers and PCPs in the community who have limited access to the&#xD;
      Duke EMR through a portal called MedLink. Epic will send letters to PCPs outside of Duke who&#xD;
      do not have MedLink access by fax. These outside providers will also be given the opportunity&#xD;
      to enroll in MedLink if they are interested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the study will be given a survivorship care plan based on the American&#xD;
      Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) template. Because the investigators will be recruiting&#xD;
      participants at our cancer centers and community practices, there will be an inevitable&#xD;
      contamination across cancer specialists. Thus, the investigators did not include an&#xD;
      oncology-level intervention. However, cancer specialists are integral to the patient- and&#xD;
      PCP-level interventions. At the end of the study, patients and PCPs will be mailed a&#xD;
      newsletter with a summary of the study findings. Lastly, it is inevitable that some patients&#xD;
      will change their PCP during the study. When notified of the change, the research team will&#xD;
      send the new PCP the intervention materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective data analysis of Duke cancer registry data integrated with EHR data elements&#xD;
      linked by the medical record number will done. The study cohort will consist of older adults&#xD;
      ≥65 years who have ≥1 cardiovascular comorbidity (hypertension, type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia) and underwent cancer surgery for solid tumors at DUHS from January 1st, 2017 to&#xD;
      December 31st 2019. Cancers of interest are breast, prostate, colorectal, endometrial,&#xD;
      gastric, esophageal, liver, pancreatic, renal cell, bladder, ovarian, head/neck, and&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. Cancer diagnoses will be grouped according to the International&#xD;
      Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd revision (ICD-O-3). Key variables to be&#xD;
      abstracted include demographic, clinical (comorbidities &amp; pertinent history, medications,&#xD;
      cancer treatment, labs), geriatric-specific (frailty, function, cognition, operative,&#xD;
      post-operative, and PCP follow-up data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative component will involve semi-structured interviews with PCPs of older adults&#xD;
      with solid tumors who underwent cancer surgery within a 12-month period in the DUHS.&#xD;
      Participating PCPs will complete an audio-recorded semi-structured interview that will last&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes. Qualitative interview: We will design a semi-structured interview&#xD;
      guide assessing perspectives on (1) frequency, modes, and perceived quality of communication&#xD;
      with surgical providers during transitions in care from surgery (2) perceived barriers to&#xD;
      effective care coordination with surgical providers (3) how communication and care&#xD;
      coordination can be improved. Open-ended prompts may include &quot;Please describe your experience&#xD;
      with care coordination with surgical providers of older adults undergoing cancer surgery?&quot;&#xD;
      &quot;What challenges have you faced when communicating with surgical providers of your older&#xD;
      adult patients?&quot;; &quot;What are your thoughts on ways to improve communication and care&#xD;
      coordination after an older adult with solid tumor undergoes surgery?&quot;, &quot;Please give examples&#xD;
      of particularly good or poor care coordination with surgical providers?&quot; The interview guide&#xD;
      will be designed with assistance from the experienced research staff in the Duke Behavioral&#xD;
      Health and Survey Research Core.&#xD;

    <measure>Medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be measured as proportion of days covered, and the research team will obtain pharmacy refill data from the EHR. For participants followed by a Duke PCP, all refills (including refill date, amount, number of refills) are captured in Epic. For PCPs outside of Duke, the research team will use the Epic link with Surescripts which captures e-prescribed medications. Using this data, the investigators will calculate the PDC for an index medication from each medication class for the three CVD comorbidities, depending upon the number of CVD comorbidities a participant has. PDC is a measure of how many days a patient is in possession of their medication, calculated as the total number of days in a followup period divided by the total number of days that a medication was available (ratio of the number of days the patient is covered by a medication during a refill period).</description>

To assess financial burden, or financial toxicity, the research team will collect the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity (COST). The FACIT-COST is an 11-item measure. The research team will also objectively ask patients about the amount of out-of-pocket expenditures for care over the last month via survey questions (e.g., insurance premiums, copayments, prescription medications, etc).</description>

The targeted iGuide 2 PCP-level intervention will include a cancer specialist-facing dashboard that includes the specialists's patients who are enrolled in the study and are in the intervention arm. The HEDIS quality measures for our three CVD comorbidities will be used. The dashboard will be populated with data available in Epic for the specific patient. If some information is missing (i.e., there is no lipid profile in the laboratory tab), the dashboard will query the PCP via an e-consult, asking to supply the information. Bimonthly, starting with the second randomization, an asynchronous specialist-to-PCP e-consult will be sent to PCPs whose patient(s) do not meet all three of the HEDIS quality metrics.</description>

Monthly, patient education material on healthy living will be sent to the participants via the patient portal or by mail, based on participant preference. At the completion of therapy, they will be provided the NCI Facing Forward:Life After Cancer booklet. Note, this approach is not fully equivalent to an attention control as there will be touch points in the iGuide and iGuide2 interventions that the investigators cannot match for the control group. Also, the research team will not engage the PCPs in clinics randomized to the control group.</description>
