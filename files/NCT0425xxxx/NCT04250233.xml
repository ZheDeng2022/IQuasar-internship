  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposal summarizes aspects related to respiratory rate in women who undergo spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia for cesarean delivery who receive or do not receive neuraxial opioids&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory monitoring device will be used to count respiratory rate continuously, as opposed&#xD;
      to the intermittent nursing respiratory rate (RR) counts once per hour. The device counts&#xD;
      respiration (RR) using a sticker placed by on the neck to detect vibrations made by&#xD;
      respiration. This overcomes the specific limitation of capnography that requires wearing the&#xD;
      nasal cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, observational study with institutional review board (IRB) approval. Women who&#xD;
      undergo elective cesarean delivery under neuraxial block receive neuraxial opioids for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential study recruits will be approached prior to the cesarean delivery anesthesia&#xD;
      assessment. Suitable women will be informed that neuraxial morphine is the gold-standard&#xD;
      analgesia, however many women suffer nausea, vomiting and pruritus (itching) and may prefer&#xD;
      an alternative analgesic or a lower dose of morphine. All women will receive intrathecal&#xD;
      fentanyl as an adjuvant to the bupivacaine anesthesia. This fentanyl may also cause pruritus&#xD;
      however this is limited to the 2-hour duration of the effect of the fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be offered standard neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery (heavy bupivacaine&#xD;
      10 mg; fentanyl 10-15mic; and low dose intrathecal morphine mic). Alternatively, women will&#xD;
      be offered an alternative anesthesia option: 1) heavy bupivacaine 10 mg; fentanyl 10-15 mic&#xD;
      with an ultra-low dose, 50 mic of morphine, or 2) heavy bupivacaine 10 mg; fentanyl 10-15 mic&#xD;
      without intrathecal morphine + postoperative bilateral quadratus lumborum block (QLB),&#xD;
      transversus abdominis plane (TAP) or erector spinus block (ESP). For patients who select&#xD;
      block without intrathecal morphine, the choice of block will depend on anesthesiologist's&#xD;
      decision.&#xD;
