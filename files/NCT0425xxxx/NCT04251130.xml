  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a tau PET scan in cognitively normal older adults and patients&#xD;
      with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), enrolled in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating&#xD;
      Center (NACC) study at the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Memory Center/Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease Core Center (PMC/ADC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional and longitudinal study using the radiotracer [18F]-PI-2620 to&#xD;
      determine the relationship of tau pathology to both cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical&#xD;
      and biomarker data of NACC cohort participants who are Cognitively Normal or MCI. All&#xD;
      subjects will already be part of the longitudinal cohort study, known as the &quot;NACC&quot; cohort,&#xD;
      of the PMC/ADC (protocol 068200). Participants will provide informed consent for this&#xD;
      protocol before beginning any study procedures. After screening assessments, participants&#xD;
      will undergo PET scan imaging with [18F]PI-2620. There will be one follow-up [18F]PI-2620 PET&#xD;
      scan approximately 18 +/- 6 months after bas eline scan.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will receive an IV bolus injection of approximately 5 mCi ± 20% of [18F]PI-2620. All subjects will undergo a 30-minute brain PET/CT scan performed starting at approximately 45 minutes' post injection of [18F]PI-2620. A low-dose CT scan will be acquired according to standard PET/CT imaging procedures to be used for attenuation correction. All images will be reconstructed using standard reconstruction techniques</description>
