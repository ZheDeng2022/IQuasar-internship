      The study will assess the prevalence of mental health problems among different athletes. The&#xD;
      study is based on the application of the battery of psychodiagnostic questionnaires, which&#xD;
      were chosen aiming at investigating the prevalence of different symptoms related to problems&#xD;
      in mental health or disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This descriptive cross-sectional study will undertake sample with athletes categorized by the&#xD;
      quality of their achievement.&#xD;

      In the field of sports, there is a lot of knowledge about sports injuries, nutrition and&#xD;
      regeneration. Much less is known about mental health among athletes. The investigators often&#xD;
      think that the incidence of mental problems is low among top athletes. As the main cause of&#xD;
      this misconception, the authors attribute the idealization of sports and athletes. Both the&#xD;
      professional and the lay public are often of the opinion that only mentally strong&#xD;
      individuals can be successful, which of course means that there is no place in the highest&#xD;
      level for individuals with mental problems and disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study will be performed with 400-500 athletes of both genders aged 18 to 40,&#xD;
      from Slovenia. The investigators will invite all athletes who have been categorized in the&#xD;
      current year and classified into the membership category, i.e. national, international, world&#xD;
      or Olympic class (there were 500 at the last categorization) and they compete in various&#xD;
      sports disciplines. The study will be designed as a cross-sectional study. For the purpose of&#xD;
      the research, the investigators will use a battery of psychodiagnostic questionnaires&#xD;
      consisting of five parts: demographics and sport characteristic, depression symptomatic,&#xD;
      anxiety symptomatic, eating problems, alcohol use and abuse and resilience characteristics of&#xD;
      individual athlete.&#xD;
