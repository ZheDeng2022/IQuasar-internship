      This is a prospective, multi-national, multi-centre, randomized, non-blinded (photo&#xD;
      evaluation is blinded), controlled clinical investigation in patients suffering from diabetic&#xD;
      wounds reaching to tendon, bone, or joint. Patients will be randomised to received intact&#xD;
      fish skin (Kerecis™ Omega3 Wound) plus standard of care or standard of care alone, and wound&#xD;
      healing compared over 16 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center study in France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden on the healing&#xD;
      effect of Kerecis™ Omega3 Wound in severe diabetic ulcers and open amputation wounds compared&#xD;
      to standard of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell and/or tissue based wound treatment products (CTPs) have been advancing in the treatment&#xD;
      of non-healing ulcers in the last 20 years. In 2013, a new product was approved in Europe and&#xD;
      by the FDA, intact fish skin, delivered as a sterilized, freeze-dried material, for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute and chronic wounds. Fish skin has the benefit of not requiring treatment&#xD;
      with antibiotics, or virus inactivating methods, thereby allowing the natural content of the&#xD;
      skin to remain, and is a by-product of food industry. Therefore, the fish derived CTP is both&#xD;
      ecologically sustainable as well as rich in naturally occurring soluble molecules and omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study evaluating the prognosis of diabetic ulcers from large registry data found that the&#xD;
      deeper, larger, and more long-standing ulcers would take longer to heal. If a wound was older&#xD;
      than 2 months, larger than 2 cm2 and reached bone or tendon, the likelihood of healing in 20&#xD;
      weeks was 19%. The average cost to close a diabetic foot wound with advanced moist wound&#xD;
      healing has been calculated at €2300 per cm2, so closing a 3 cm2 wound would cost €6900..&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wealth of clinical experience on diabetic wounds exists on the Kerecis fish skin material.&#xD;
      This is, however, mainly in the form of case series and has been published through posters&#xD;
      and case reports. The main indication for Kerecis is deep or non-healing diabetic ulcers,&#xD;
      which are the biggest problem in diabetic wound care ultimately leading to amputation.&#xD;
      Studies on CTPs have almost solely been done on shallow diabetic ulcers to get a homogeneous&#xD;
      study population which then is randomized to treatment with the studied product or the&#xD;
      control product. This means that in the case of a favourable outcome in the study, those&#xD;
      products are not really tested on the ulcer for which they are ultimately intended, ulcers&#xD;
      where the next step is amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled study on deep diabetic wounds is designed to prove the efficacy of&#xD;
      Kerecis™ Omega3 Wound for the indications it is intended for - severe diabetic foot ulcers -&#xD;
      and to show the cost effectiveness of using Kerecis™ Omega3 Wound over standard of care.&#xD;
      Wounds resulting from an amputation that are left open with an opening into bone, or from a&#xD;
      dehisced amputation where the sutures have gone up, are included. Acute amputations where the&#xD;
      metatarsal bones are exposed are included, provided that the patient has diabetes and the&#xD;
      amputation is a result of an ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is probably the first study on severe diabetic ulcers where the CTP is used on the&#xD;
      types of wounds that it is intended for, thereby giving a straight answer to the actual&#xD;
      savings included in healing a serious diabetic wound earlier or changing the stage to a&#xD;
      smaller shallower ulcer (changing grade of ulcer), thus, radically changing the prognosis.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetic patient with chronic lower extremity wounds: Grade 2 or 3 according to&#xD;
             University of Texas score: Grade 2: &quot;Wounds that penetrate to tendon or capsule&quot;.&#xD;
             Grade 3: &quot;wounds that penetrate to bone or into the joint&quot;. In this context, probing&#xD;
             gently to bone means that the wound reaches bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  OR patients with diabetes that are recently amputated below the ankle, where the wound&#xD;
             has not been closed or has dehisced and bones/tendons are exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have moderately decreased or normal arterial circulation. In this study&#xD;
             the cutoff point is Ankle Brachial Index (ABP) below 0.6. (Toe pressure and TPCO2&#xD;
             values will be obtained if possible. Toe pressure of 50mmHg and a TCPO2 value of 40mm&#xD;
             on the dorsum of the foot is often considered as indicative of adequate perfusion.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who will tolerate aggressive debridement. Light bleeding of the wound surface&#xD;
             should be seen after debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had his/her ulcer for one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the&#xD;
             clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or Female, over 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Geographical distance compatible with taking part in the study. Observe though that&#xD;
             the patient can be treated at a &quot;home clinic&quot; every other week as long as the end&#xD;
             point is not imminent and photos and acetate tracers with cm markers are fed into the&#xD;
             photo portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test for a woman of childbearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is able (in the investigator's opinion) and willing to comply with all the&#xD;
             clinical trial requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient whose wound surface is not measurable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients suffering from unmanaged osteomyelitis. With adequate treatment the patient&#xD;
             can be re-screened for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with severe ischemia (Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) &lt;0.6).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with necrotic wound who will not tolerate aggressive debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with immune deficiency or autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having done arterial reconstruction within one month. These patients can be&#xD;
             re-screened later.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient on systemic corticosteroids or other treatments causing delayed wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants who are pregnant, breast feeding or planning pregnancy during the&#xD;
             course of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the clinical&#xD;
             trial, or may influence the result of the clinical trial, or the participant's ability&#xD;
             to participate in the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with known allergy to fish.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient deprived of liberty by judicial or administrative decision, person subject to&#xD;
             a legal protection measure.&#xD;
