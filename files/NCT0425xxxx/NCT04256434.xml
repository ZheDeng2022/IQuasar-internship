  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, sequential 2 cohort, intramuscular injection study in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. The study will enroll approximately 24 healthy volunteers to examine the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability after intramuscular injection of NALDEBAIN ER Injection&#xD;
      and nalbuphine injection.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject in a cohort will be evaluated for study eligibility during the screening period,&#xD;
      which is within 28 days prior to receiving the study drug (Day 1). Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      admitted into the study site on Day -1 and will be required to stay in clinical site for 5&#xD;
      (Cohort 1) or 2 nights (Cohort 2) for study procedures in each cohort. Eligible subjects will&#xD;
      undergo additional eligibility assessments on Day -1 and those reconfirmed eligible will&#xD;
      intramuscularly receive NALDEBAIN ER Injection (Cohort 1) or nalbuphine (Cohort 2) on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood sampling timepoints for Cohort 1 will be at predose, 6, 12, 24, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80,&#xD;
      88, and 96 hours after dosing. Subjects will be discharged after the 96-hour blood sample and&#xD;
      return to the clinical site for the sample collection at 120, 168, 216, 288 and 360 hours&#xD;
      post dosing. The blood sampling timepoints for Cohort 2 will be predose, 5, 15, and 30&#xD;
      minutes postdose, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return for a follow-up visit to complete safety evaluations for approximately&#xD;
      15 days after study drug administration in cohort 1; and 1 days after study drug&#xD;
      administration in Cohort 2.&#xD;
