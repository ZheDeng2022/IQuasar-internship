  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will evaluate how well hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) scan works in predicting tumor aggressiveness in patients with renal tumors.&#xD;
      Hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate is a non-radioactive substance with potential usage in the&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging of tumors. Hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate MRI may help doctors determine&#xD;
      non-invasively whether a kidney tumor is a benign tumor or cancer, and if cancer, how&#xD;
      aggressive it is. This may help doctors and patients with renal tumors in the future to make&#xD;
      better treatment decisions.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To investigate the association between HP 13C pyruvate-to-lactate conversion (peak&#xD;
      lactate/pyruvate ratio, lactate /pyruvate AUC (area under the curve), the apparent rate&#xD;
      constant (kPL) and renal tumor histology (benign renal tumors versus RCCs) and grade (low vs&#xD;
      high grade in cases of RCCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the reproducibility of HP 13C pyruvate MRI in patients who undergo an&#xD;
           optional second HP 13C pyruvate MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the association between HP 13 C pyruvate-to-lactate conversion and tumor&#xD;
           growth rate in patients who are deemed clinically appropriate for active surveillance&#xD;
           for their renal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the safety of HP 13C pyruvate in renal tumor patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To investigate the association between HP markers (peak lactate/pyruvate, lactate&#xD;
      /pyruvate AUC, kPL) and tissue-based markers including Lactate Dehydrogenase A (LDHA)&#xD;
      expression and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and Monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4)&#xD;
      expression on tumor tissues from surgical specimen or from biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive HP 13C pyruvate intravenously (IV) and then undergo 13C MRI scan 1-2 minutes&#xD;
      post HP 13C pyruvate injection. Patients may receive an optional second HP 13C pyruvate&#xD;
      injection and undergo 13C pyruvate MRI scan 15 to 60 minutes following completion of the&#xD;
      first scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 30 minutes.&#xD;

    <measure>Estimate of intra-subject agreement for those with optional second scan</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who obtained an optional second HP 13 C pyruvate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be used to estimate the intra-subject agreement. ICCs will be obtained from a one-way analysis of variance model based on 2 serial measurements per subject. The ICC ranges from 0 to 1. An ICC close to 1 indicates high similarity between values from the same group. An ICC close to zero means that values from the same group are not similar. The results will be presented with a 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <description>For patients who are in active surveillance for their renal tumors, MRI findings will be compared to tumor growth rate while on active surveillance.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Localized renal tumor measuring 2 centimeters (cm) and greater in diameter. To&#xD;
             minimize any potential partial volume effects in this pilot study, we have limited the&#xD;
             lower size range of the tumor to 2cm. The investigators will include all localized&#xD;
             renal tumor measuring 2 cm and greater in diameter in this first study to facilitate&#xD;
             obtaining tumors of a range of histology and grade&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject is either scheduled to undergo partial or radical nephrectomy at&#xD;
             University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), or is deemed clinically appropriate to&#xD;
             undergo active surveillance for his/her renal tumor. The subject is able and willing&#xD;
             to comply with study procedures and provide signed and dated informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject is willing to undergo standard of care abdominal MRI in connection with&#xD;
             the study exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who because of age, general medical or psychiatric condition, or physiologic&#xD;
             status cannot give valid informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients unwilling or unable to undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including&#xD;
             patients with contra-indications to MR imaging, such as cardiac pacemakers or&#xD;
             non-compatible intracranial vascular clips.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any metallic implant or device that distorts local magnetic field and compromises the&#xD;
             quality of MR imaging of the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior focal therapy (i.e. ablation) for the renal tumor. In patients with tumor&#xD;
             biopsy, imaging study will occur at least 4 weeks following any biopsy to avoid&#xD;
             artifact from hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Poorly controlled hypertension, with blood pressure at study entry &gt;160/100. The&#xD;
             addition of anti-hypertensives to control blood pressure is allowed for eligibility&#xD;
             determination.&#xD;
