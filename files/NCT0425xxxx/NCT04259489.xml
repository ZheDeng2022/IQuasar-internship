      This is a prospective, randomization, parallel, controlled study, which conducted to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness and related influencing factors of the Shared Care multidisciplinary&#xD;
      diabetes care model. Patients with T2DM involved in the Shared Care model pay regularly&#xD;
      quarterly visit to a multidisciplinary team led by physician at outpatient clinic, and&#xD;
      receive remote and systematic management and education online after going home. After at&#xD;
      least one year follow-up, evaluate the glycemic achieving rate (HbA1c&lt;7%), the diabetes&#xD;
      self-management behavior change and the effect of online diabetes self-management support for&#xD;
      patients of the Shared Care multidisciplinary diabetes care model.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a complex, chronic illness requiring continuous medical care with multifactorial&#xD;
      risk-reduction strategies beyond glycemic control. At present, about 114 million diabetics&#xD;
      and 11.6% incidence rate of diabetes in China have produced huge chronic disease management&#xD;
      pressure and created great challenges for China's limited medical resources. (1-5).&#xD;
      Meanwhile, with population aging and increasing prevalence of obesity in China, the number of&#xD;
      patients with diabetes mellitus, diabetes-related complications and related mortality are&#xD;
      expected to further increase, which also indicates greater healthcare expenditure and&#xD;
      socioeconomic burden. A multi-center, cross-sectional survey of outpatients conducted in 606&#xD;
      hospitals across China showed that the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes did not&#xD;
      achieve the goal of HbA1c &lt;7.0% (6). There are varieties of problems including inadequate&#xD;
      patient education, inability to track the out-of-hospital situation of diabetes, and lack of&#xD;
      effective patient follow-up and education between each visits (1-5). Many researches have&#xD;
      proved that comprehensive diabetes management education can significantly improve the quality&#xD;
      of life of patients, decrease the incidence and mortality of diabetes complications, and&#xD;
      relieve the government's medical economic burden (7). Besides, A number of studies have shown&#xD;
      that the early detection and comprehensive management of diabetes can prevent the occurrence&#xD;
      of a variety of complications and decrease the disability rate and premature death rate of&#xD;
      diabetes. Therefore, how to improve the current situation of diabetes control in China is&#xD;
      very important and a real problem in front of every doctor, patient and health institution.&#xD;
      According to the diabetes management guidelines published by American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association(ADA) and the National Institutes of Health(NIH), continuous follow-up of&#xD;
      patients, diabetes self-management education and support (DSME/S) combined with&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team comprehensive management can be abled to achieve better management&#xD;
      results, and it is also a more comprehensive and cost-effective way to manage diabetic&#xD;
      patients (8-12). In order to support health professionals to improve medical efficiency and&#xD;
      promote patients develop healthy lifestyle, Shared Care diabetes management model established&#xD;
      and believe that it will provide a sustained and effective solution for improving the&#xD;
      effectiveness of comprehensive management for patients and reducing the burden of national&#xD;
      chronic disease management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Shared Care aims to provide patients with a continuous management model of&#xD;
      omni-directional and lifelong care management, and to strengthen diabetes self-management&#xD;
      education and supports (DSME/S), achieve better health outcomes and delay incidence and&#xD;
      mortality of diabetic complications. The model consisted of a medical team that includes&#xD;
      dietitians, diabetes educators, nurses and physical therapist led by physician, and provides&#xD;
      comprehensive disease and health management for patients with diabetes through outpatient&#xD;
      consultation and out-of-hospital online continuous management. The management strategy is&#xD;
      adjusted and individualized based on patients' habit and situation. Compared with traditional&#xD;
      diabetes outpatient settings, patients of Shared Care return to the hospital for regular&#xD;
      follow-up every three months since the initial visit after the informed consent. For each&#xD;
      follow-up, a comprehensive management plan is made by a multidisciplinary team, including&#xD;
      doctor consultation, diabetes management, foot evaluation, fundus assessment, insulin&#xD;
      injection assessment, exercise evaluation and guidance, etc. The patients download the Shared&#xD;
      Care mobile application during the outpatient service and connect with the smart-glucometer&#xD;
      BG1 to upload blood glucose dairy, blood pressure diary and food log in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With patient's informed consent, Patient-related vital signs (such as height, weight, body&#xD;
      mass index, blood pressure, waist, hips), laboratory indicators (including glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, triglycerides, kidney indicators such&#xD;
      as urine microalbumin and creatinine Ratio, glomerular filtration rate), blood glucose&#xD;
      records, online learning frequency and other data will be uniformly recorded and&#xD;
      comprehensively analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All out-of-hospital online diabetes educators are qualified as registered nurses. Before the&#xD;
      start of the study, the nurses should uniformly receive training and examination related to&#xD;
      diabetes education in the Department of Endocrinology of Chaoyang Hospital. The main contents&#xD;
      of online education include personalized assessment and suggestions on diet, hyperglycemia&#xD;
      and hypoglycemia events, drug use and insulin preservation as directed by doctors, and on&#xD;
      blood glucose monitoring and reminders for revisit every three months, etc. In case of&#xD;
      special circumstances or prescription adjustment, online diabetes educators should follow the&#xD;
      training process to summarize the patient's condition with the doctor on the same day or&#xD;
      during the weekly regular outpatient clinic, or arrange additional subsequent visit of the&#xD;
      patient, all online consultation process is carried out under the supervision of the doctor&#xD;
      (the diabetes educator spends about 5 minutes a week to discuss the condition of special&#xD;
      patients with the doctor according to the actual situation). The model enables both patients&#xD;
      and medical teams to carry out real-time data sharing, intelligent analysis and remote&#xD;
      monitoring, thus significantly improving management efficiency and releasing medical&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of preliminary studies had been conducted in Chaoyang Hospital since January 2018.&#xD;
      mean age of patients enrolled was 54.69 ± 11.14 years; the duration of diabetes was more than&#xD;
      7.8 ±7.0 years, and more than 70% were complicated with hypertension and / or dyslipidemia.&#xD;
      The baseline glycemic achieving rate of patients with a duration more than 10 years was less&#xD;
      than 35%. After participated in the Shared Care management model, glycemic achieving rate of&#xD;
      patients with diabetic was more than 75%. Compared with the baseline HbA1c 7.4±1.5%, patients&#xD;
      HbA1c in the latest follow-up was 6.6 ±1.0%, with the average decreased of 0.8 ±1.6% (P&#xD;
      &lt;0.05). The 3B achieving rate (HbA1c &lt;7%, LDL-C &lt; 2.6mmol/L, BP &lt;130/80mmHg) of patients&#xD;
      under the management of Shared Care Model was 21.84%. The baseline urinary microalbuminuria /&#xD;
      creatinine (UACR) 35.8mg/g was not significantly increased compared with the last follow-up&#xD;
      of 32.1mg/g (P&gt;0.10). The daily cost of hypoglycemic medicine was significantly reduced in&#xD;
      patients with the duration of diabetes less than 2 years or 15 years or more (medicine daily&#xD;
      cost of the baseline and the latest follow-up was 3.5 RMB per day and 2.3 RMB per day&#xD;
      respectively in patients with the duration of diabetes less than 2 years (P&lt;0.05); medicine&#xD;
      daily cost of the baseline and the latest follow-up was 10.4 RMB per day and 9.5 RMB per day&#xD;
      respectively in patients with the duration of diabetes of 15 years or more (P&lt;0.05)), but&#xD;
      there was no significant increase in patients with other durations of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study evaluated and explored the effect of patient management and related factors under&#xD;
      the Share Care management model aims to provide a clear evidence for the choice of new&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment strategies for patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in the study need to go through screening, initial visit, revisit,&#xD;
      half-year visit and annual visit. The following is an overview of the research design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      210 patients with type 2 diabetes who met the criteria were enrolled. All patients with&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo basic interviews, vital sign measurements and related&#xD;
      biochemical tests. During the screening phase, the following variables will be collected:&#xD;
      age, sex, smoking status (current smokers, former smokers, non-smokers), duration of&#xD;
      diabetes, duration of dyslipidemia, concomitant diseases and medication, etc. Besides, vital&#xD;
      signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, regular blood test and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), the&#xD;
      patient's blood lipid spectrum includes total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), High&#xD;
      density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),&#xD;
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio(ACR) and safety laboratory measurements (creatine kinase, SCr,&#xD;
      BUN, UA, ALT, AST) also will be collected. The designated researcher will conduct a serum&#xD;
      pregnancy test on all fertile women. The body mass index ((BMI)) is calculated by dividing&#xD;
      weight by the square of height (kg / m2). After fasting overnight for 8 to 12 hours, the&#xD;
      blood samples were collected before breakfast the next day. EGFR will be calculated using a&#xD;
