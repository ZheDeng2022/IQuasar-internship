  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide with one in four&#xD;
      estimated to be affected by iron deficiency anaemia. Women of reproductive age are at&#xD;
      greatest risk for iron deficiency and anaemia due to iron losses during menstruation and&#xD;
      childbirth as well as the increased need for iron throughout pregnancy. However, iron&#xD;
      deficiency without anaemia is at least twice as common as iron deficiency anaemia with&#xD;
      females aged 11-49 at the biggest risk of all. Despite this, it is commonly left undiagnosed.&#xD;
      Those who are iron deficient non-anaemic can still suffer from the same common consequences&#xD;
      of iron deficiency anaemia; these include unexplained fatigue, mood changes and decreased&#xD;
      cognitive performance. Previous studies have found a significant relationship between iron&#xD;
      status and cognitive performance in anaemic women. However, studies assessing cognition, mood&#xD;
      and fatigue in women of varying iron status including those who are iron deficient nonanaemic&#xD;
      are lacking. The most recent observational study of this kind found that better iron status&#xD;
      was associated with better sustained attention but worse working memory. However, iron&#xD;
      deficient anaemic females were not included in this observation. This study will extend upon&#xD;
      this in order to determine any differences between non-anaemic iron deficiency and iron&#xD;
      deficiency anaemia. The aims of this study are to improve knowledge concerning women's health&#xD;
      and to determine whether there is a relationship between iron status, cognitive performance,&#xD;
      subjective mood and fatigue in women of reproductive age (18-49 years).&#xD;

      Each participant will be required to attend the laboratory on two occasions. The first is&#xD;
      comprised of a screening/training visit, which will take place in the afternoon for&#xD;
      approximately 2.5 hours. This will also be between days 21-28/the week before onset of their&#xD;
      menstrual cycle. If they do not have menstrual bleeds then this appointment can be any&#xD;
      afternoon. This will comprise: briefing of requirements of the study; obtaining of informed&#xD;
      consent; confirmation of eligibility to take part, including collection of demographic data&#xD;
      and health screening, and training on the cognitive and mood measures. The training session&#xD;
      will follow standard operating procedures to decrease the chance of learning effects during&#xD;
      main trials. Extra training will be given where necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to complete questionnaires based upon food frequency, caffeine&#xD;
      consumption and to estimate the number of hours of exercise completed on a weekly basis. A&#xD;
      menstrual cycle questionnaire will also be completed to estimate menstrual blood loss and so&#xD;
      that participants attend their testing visit during days 7-14 of their cycle. If participants&#xD;
      do not have a menstrual cycle due to contraceptive methods, then appointments will be&#xD;
      approximately two weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A finger-prick and venous blood sample will be collected from participants, which will be&#xD;
      analysed for iron status. Those whose haemoglobin levels are &lt;120g/L will be advised to seek&#xD;
      advice from their GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the testing visit, participants will be asked to fast for 12 hours prior to the visit,&#xD;
      avoiding intake of all food and drink with the exception of water. They will also be asked to&#xD;
      avoid alcohol and refrain from intake of 'over the counter' medication for 24 hours.&#xD;
      Participants will arrive at the laboratory at a designated time in the morning. The following&#xD;
      procedures will take place prior to cognitive and mood testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of continued conformity to eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse event and concomitant medication assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ensure that participant is in good health&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then complete the baseline cognitive and mood assessments.&#xD;
