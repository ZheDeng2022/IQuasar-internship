      This phase II trial studies the efficacy and safety of systemic induction of mFOLFIRINOX,&#xD;
      followed by hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) floxuridine-dexamethasone administered&#xD;
      concurrently with systemic mFOLFIRI in treating patients with liver-dominant intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens, such as mFOLFIRINOX and mFOLFIRI (Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan,&#xD;
      Fluorouracil, Folinic acid, Floxuridine) work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Delivering chemotherapy via HAI (hepatic arterial infusion) can allow for&#xD;
      liver-directed treatment while limiting toxic side effects typically seen with traditional&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the toxicity, safety and tolerability of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI)&#xD;
      floxuridine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the efficacy of systemic induction of oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium (folinic&#xD;
      acid), irinotecan hydrochloride, and fluorouracil (modified [m] FOLFIRINOX), followed by HAI&#xD;
      of floxuridine-dexamethasone (DEX) administered concurrently with systemic irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium (folinic acid), and fluorouracil (mFOLFIRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate tumor response to treatment and participant survival. II. Assess rate of&#xD;
      post-operative complications. III. Evaluate serious post-operative complications following&#xD;
      surgical placement of the HAI pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the radiographic response using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) as part of an&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether, compared to historical controls, induction mFOLFIRINOX combined with&#xD;
      integrated HAI of floxuridine-DEX and systemic mFOLFIRI treatment will improve patient&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL) including fatigue and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Investigate molecular signature associated with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Generate a differential expression pattern of ribonucleic acid (RNA)s (microRNA [miR] and&#xD;
      messenger RNA [mRNA]) in patients with ICC derived from tumor samples compared to adjacent&#xD;
      normal liver samples as well as lymphatic tissue, blood and bile).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Characterize the changes in the population of circulating hybrid cells (CHCs) pre-,&#xD;
      during, and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase II, single arm, study that consists of a two-part treatment plan&#xD;
      (Treatment Periods 1 and 2) of systemic induction of mFOLFIRINOX, followed by HAI&#xD;
      floxuridine-DEX administered concurrently with systemic mFOLFIRI. The first 6 patients&#xD;
      enrolled will be part of a safety run-in, after which enrollment could be expanded to&#xD;
      additional 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After laparoscopic staging, eligible patients will receive a systemic regimen of mFOLFIRINOX&#xD;
      with 25% dose reduction of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil administered every&#xD;
      2-weeks for 4 cycles (8 weeks) (Treatment Period 1). After completing mFOLFIRINOX induction,&#xD;
      participants' disease will be re-evaluated by MRI/CT imaging. Only those that achieve disease&#xD;
      control based on RECIST criteria (v1.1) will be eligible for HAI therapy via a laparotomy and&#xD;
      placement of a HAI pump. (Treatment Period 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing 2 cycles of HAI treatment with concurrent FOLFIRI, participants will undergo&#xD;
      repeat MRI/CT imaging to assess disease response. An image-guided liver biopsy will be&#xD;
      performed after completion of the 8 weeks of treatment of HAI floxuridine/dexamethasone&#xD;
      combined with systemic mFOLFIRI of Treatment Period 2. Optional extrahepatic biopsies may be&#xD;
      collected from participants demonstrating disease progression. Participants with controlled&#xD;
      disease (as defined by RECIST criteria) may receive additional cycles of HAI-delivered&#xD;
      floxuridine and dexamethasone, along with systemic administration of mFOLFIRI.&#xD;
