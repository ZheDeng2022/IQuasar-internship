  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of CB-839 HCl when given&#xD;
      together with sapanisertib in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body (advanced). CB-839 HCl and sapanisertib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride&#xD;
      (CB-839 HCl) (telaglenastat) in combination with MLN0128 (sapanisertib) and determine the&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To examine preliminary efficacy of CB-839&#xD;
      HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib) in squamous cell lung cancers (LSCC) and in&#xD;
      select, molecularly-defined non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIa. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and&#xD;
      disease control rate (DCR) of patients treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128&#xD;
      (sapanisertib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate genomic and metabolomic signatures with response. II. To evaluate metabolic&#xD;
      response (18Glutamine [GLN]-positron emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT];&#xD;
      18Fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET/CT) in NSCLC tumors treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat)&#xD;
      and MLN0128 (sapanisertib) in the dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and&#xD;
      sapanisertib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up quarterly.&#xD;

                            contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
                            prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;

                            her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
                            treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
                            protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the&#xD;
                            study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after&#xD;
                            completion of CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 3 weeks or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6&#xD;
             weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) is a weak in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C9. Therefore, patients&#xD;
             receiving any medications or substances that are substrates of CYP2C9 are eligible,&#xD;
             but should use caution with substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index. Because&#xD;
             the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly&#xD;
             consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed&#xD;
             consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with&#xD;
             other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the&#xD;
             patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) is an&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat), breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat). These potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to MLN0128 (sapanisertib)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Manifestations of malabsorption due to prior gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, GI&#xD;
             disease, or for an unknown reason that may alter the absorption of MLN0128&#xD;
             (sapanisertib). In addition, patients with enteric stomata are also excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant active cardiovascular or pulmonary disease including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mm Hg, diastolic&#xD;
                  blood pressure &gt; 95 mm Hg). Use of anti-hypertensive agents to control&#xD;
                  hypertension before cycle 1 day 1 is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled asthma or oxygen (O2) saturation &lt; 90% by arterial blood gas&#xD;
                  analysis or pulse oximetry on room air&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Significant valvular disease; severe regurgitation or stenosis by imaging&#xD;
                  independent of symptom control with medical intervention, or history of valve&#xD;
                  replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medically significant (symptomatic) bradycardia&#xD;
