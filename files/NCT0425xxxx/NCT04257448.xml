      A multi-center, open-label phase I/II study to to determine the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Azacitidine and/or Romidepsin in combination with nab-Paclitaxel/Gemcitabine in patients with&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (Part 1), followed by sequential immune&#xD;
      targeting with programmed death-ligand (PD-L)1 blockade in combination with low-dose&#xD;
      Lenalidomide (Part 2) in patients with controlled disease after 3 cycles (Part 1).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first part of the study will employ a standard 3 + 3 design to test safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition with Romidepsin (Arm A), DNA&#xD;
      methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibition with Azacitidine (Arm B) or both agents (Arm C), in each&#xD;
      arm in combination with nab-Paclitaxel/Gemcitabine (Part 1a). Study treatment is given until&#xD;
      intolerable toxicity as defined in the protocol. Treatment will escalate until the&#xD;
      recommended dose for RDE is identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the expansion part (Part 1b) of the study, one of the treatment arms (Arm C over B over&#xD;
      A) will be continued using a Simon Two-stage design to a maximum of 35 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients from Part 1a and 1b will be treated for a total of three cycles and will then&#xD;
      enter the second part of the study in case of disease control with still measurable disease&#xD;
      (PR, SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part (Part 2) of the study (consolidation therapy), all patients from Part 1&#xD;
      (dose escalation and expansion cohorts from experimental arms and standard arm) who have not&#xD;
      progressed after three cycles of nab-Paclitaxel/Gemcitabine with or without additional&#xD;
      epigenetic treatment (= at least SD by RECIST 1.1 after 3 cycles) receive sequential immune&#xD;
      targeting with PD-L1 blockade (standard fixed dose Durvalumab 1500 mg q4w iv) in combination&#xD;
      with low-dose Lenalidomide (10 mg d1-21 q4w po) until documented disease progression.&#xD;
