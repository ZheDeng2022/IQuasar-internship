      In this pilot study, 30 prevalent hemodialysis patients will undergo three regular&#xD;
      hemodialysis sessions during which various potassium assessments will be performed. Pre- (t1)&#xD;
      and post-dialysis (t2) plasma potassium levels (K+Pl) will be measured using standard&#xD;
      ion-selective electrodes. These values will be correlated to K+ determine in saliva probes&#xD;
      (K+Sa) using genetically encoded potassium ion indicators (GEPIIs). Additionally, continuous&#xD;
      ECG will be recorded during each hemodialysis treatment and potassium assessment (K+ECG) will&#xD;
      be performed upon ECG-based parameters and correlated to K+Pl.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death in industrialized countries.&#xD;
      Medical therapy for these diseases has seen significant progress, much of which is based on&#xD;
      agents interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin-converting&#xD;
      enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists,&#xD;
      neprilysin inhibitors). However, these agents bear the side effect of reducing renal&#xD;
      potassium (K+) excretion and may thus lead to elevation of blood K+ Levels (hyperkalemia).&#xD;
      Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening condition, which in its most severe forms&#xD;
      requires immediate medical attention, since there is imminent danger of dangerous arrhythmias&#xD;
      and sudden cardiac death. Therefore, hyperkalemia is a leading reason to withdraw potentially&#xD;
      lifesaving therapy in a significant number of patients, which is considered to have a&#xD;
      negative impact on patient outcomes. Recently, novel intestinal potassium binders have been&#xD;
      shown to be efficient in reducing incidence and severity of hyperkalemia These compounds have&#xD;
      very recently been shown to allow extending the benefits of antihypertensive therapy with&#xD;
      spironolactone to patients with chronic kidney disease with refractory hypertension . Yet due&#xD;
      to preanalytical problems as well as time and cost-restraints, out-patient monitoring of&#xD;
      serum or plasma potassium levels has proven problematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma potassium level and kinetics at two timepoints before and after a hemodialysis&#xD;
      session as determined by either standard of care (i.e. ion selective electrode) will be&#xD;
      compared to the potassium level measured in (i) saliva (salivary potassium [K+Sa]) or (ii)&#xD;
      determined based on electrocardiogram (K+ECG). Patients suffering from end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease undergoing hemodialysis (HD) frequently present with severe hyperkalemia prior to a&#xD;
      HD session. During HD treatment, K+ levels undergo unphysiologically rapid changes due to K+&#xD;
      removal via HD as well as due to changes in acid-base status. Thus, HD patients represent a&#xD;
      unique population in whom significant K+ derangements and rapid K+ Level changes predictably&#xD;
      occur and where these phenomena can be investigated in a safe environment.&#xD;
