      This study will test the feasibility of a carbohydrate-restricted, high-fat (CRHF) diet&#xD;
      intervention in newly diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients who will&#xD;
      receive definitive radiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our previous observational research indicates that a pretreatment diet high in total&#xD;
      carbohydrates is associated with increased risk of all-cause and disease-specific mortality&#xD;
      in head and neck cancer. The purpose of this study is to conduct a single-blinded randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to test the feasibility of a carbohydrate-restricted, high-fat (CRHF) diet&#xD;
      intervention in newly diagnosed head and neck cell squamous carcinoma (HNSCC) patients who&#xD;
      will receive definitive radiation. The secondary aim is to collect preliminary data on the&#xD;
      effect of the intervention on tumor progression, nutritional status, body composition,&#xD;
      quality of life, and symptom burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirteen newly diagnosed HNSCC non-metastatic patients were recruited from Augusta Victoria&#xD;
      Hospital in East Jerusalem and randomized into one of two arms; a carbohydrate-restricted,&#xD;
      high-fat diet arm (arm A) and a regular diet composition arm (Arm B). Arm A (N=6) were&#xD;
      provided a CRHF diet both neoadjuvantly (for 2 weeks prior to treatment) and adjuvantly&#xD;
      (during treatment with radiation). Arm B (N=7) received standard oncologic treatment&#xD;
      including a regular diet (50-52% carbohydrates, 30% fats, and 18-20% proteins). Feasibility&#xD;
      outcomes, including recruitment, retention, intervention adherence, and safety were tracked&#xD;
      weekly. Biomarkers, tumor progression, nutritional status, body composition, QOL, and&#xD;
      symptoms were assessed at baseline, 2-weeks, and 2-3 months post-treatment. A control group&#xD;
      (N=26) included HNSCC patients who follow the same applicable eligibility criteria and did&#xD;
      not receive any kind of dietary intervention. Medical information were collected&#xD;
      retrospectively from the control group patients' files. Information on demographics (age,&#xD;
      sex, smoking status, weight, height, marital status, education, occupation, and residency),&#xD;
      tumor site, cancer stage, treatment dose reduction, treatment break, early cessation of&#xD;
      treatment, hospitalization, symptoms, and weight loss, were collected during treatment from&#xD;
      arms A and B and retrospectively from the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed pilot/feasibility study is the first step in determining if a CRHF diet is an&#xD;
      effective treatment modality in cancer and if providing a diet with any composition before&#xD;
      and during treatment is more beneficial than not providing a diet at all.&#xD;

Fats: from mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, including medium- and long-chain fatty acids.&#xD;
Proteins: plant-based proteins and lean animal-based proteins. All meals were provided to the participants throughout the study period and the diet was provided orally unless the patient was on a feeding tube or a feeding tube is ordered by a physician during the study period. Diet texture was according to patients chewing and swallowing abilities. If the patient is on a feeding tube or intake is insufficient, a formula with similar macronutrient composition + a protein supplement was provided.</description>
