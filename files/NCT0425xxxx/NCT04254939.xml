        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For phase I study, the subject must have histologically or cytologically confirmed&#xD;
             unresectable or metastatic GIST that progressed after imatinib and at least one&#xD;
             additional TKI treatment, or who cannot tolerate the standard treatment or have D842V&#xD;
             mutation in the PDGFRα gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For phase II study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i) Group 1: Chinese subjects with unresectable GIST harboring D842V mutation in PDGFRα&#xD;
             gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii) Group 2: Chinese third-line and fourth-line or later subjects with unresectable&#xD;
             GIST that has progressed after standard treatment and/or do not tolerate standard&#xD;
             treatment, and do not have a known D842V mutation in the PDGFRα gene.&#xD;
&#xD;

             metabolism or excretion of the investigational product, or interfere with the&#xD;
             evaluation of study result.&#xD;
