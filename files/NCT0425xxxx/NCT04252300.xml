  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in this study want to learn how the study drug BAY1817080 interacts with another&#xD;
      drug called rosuvastatin (brand name: Crestor) and affects the way the body absorbs,&#xD;
      distributes and excretes rosuvastatin in healthy adult male and female participants&#xD;
      (drug-drug interaction study). The study drug BAY1817080 is a new drug under development with&#xD;
      a goal to suppress pain and chronic cough. It works by binding to and blocking proteins&#xD;
      related to pain in the body. Rosuvastatin is an approved and marketed drug to lower high&#xD;
      levels of &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol (a waxy, fat-like substance found in blood). Both drugs interact&#xD;
      with the same proteins (molecules) in the human body, and as a result, the study drug may&#xD;
      affect the way rosuvastatin is taken up and used by the body when applied together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be asked to visit the clinic 3 times over a period of 3 to 4&#xD;
      weeks. Each participant will receive rosuvastatin tablets twice with at least 11 days in&#xD;
      between and the study drug tablets twice daily for 14 days. Blood samples will be taken from&#xD;
      the participants to measure the blood levels of rosuvastatin.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the influence of multiple doses of&#xD;
      BAY1817080 on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin given concomitantly. Secondary objective&#xD;
      is to investigate the safety of BAY1817080.&#xD;
