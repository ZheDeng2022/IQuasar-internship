      This study will assess the difference in prostatitis symptoms in men with localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer following brachytherapy taking Q-Urol relative to placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial assessing the safety of Q-Urol&#xD;
      use after brachytherapy placement in patients with localized prostate cancer. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receiveQ-Urol/Placebo twice daily for 6 weeks after&#xD;
      brachytherapy placement. Questionnaires will be administered pre- and post-treatment to&#xD;
      assess the change in prostatitis symptoms and quality of life measures. The mean values&#xD;
      between groups will be compared.&#xD;
