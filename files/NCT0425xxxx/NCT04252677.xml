  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of adolescent behaviors that can lead to obesity are alarming, and reduced&#xD;
      life expectancy is the future of America's youth if behavioral changes are not implemented to&#xD;
      improve health and reduce the obesity burden. Researchers have argued that health literacy is&#xD;
      a precursor to health knowledge and is necessary for translating knowledge about healthy&#xD;
      choices into behavior, with low health literacy being associated with reduced preventive&#xD;
      health behaviors in adults. Given the lack of health literacy-specific interventions&#xD;
      addressing adolescents' obesogenic behaviors, the purpose of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness of adding a health literacy module to an obesity prevention&#xD;
      intervention that addresses adolescents' obesogenic behaviors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rates of pediatric obesity (~19%) and diabetes (0.24%) in the US are alarming and&#xD;
      behaviors implicated in obesity and type 2 diabetes are highly prevalent. Approximately 69%&#xD;
      and 73% of adolescents consume less than two fruits and vegetables daily respectively, while&#xD;
      53% engage in insufficient physical activity. These behaviors magnify adolescents' immediate&#xD;
      and long-term risks for obesity and obesity-related chronic illnesses, as well as complicate&#xD;
      the treatment of obesity-related chronic illnesses. Children and adolescents who are obese&#xD;
      are four times more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than normal weight children,&#xD;
      with serious short and long-term consequences impacting quality of life. Reduced life&#xD;
      expectancy is the future of America's youth if behavioral changes are not implemented to&#xD;
      improve health and reduce the obesity burden. Reversing current national trends in obesity&#xD;
      and type 2 diabetes require novel and sustainable prevention strategies to address children&#xD;
      and adolescents' obesogenic behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescence is marked by increased autonomy in decision-making, yet data suggest that&#xD;
      adolescents are not equipped with all the skills to make effective health-related behavioral&#xD;
      decisions. While health knowledge works in conjunction with motivation and behavioral skills&#xD;
      to predict behavior, most existing adolescent interventions target these variables in&#xD;
      isolation with modest success. Researchers have argued that health literacy (HL) - the&#xD;
      ability to access, understand, and use health information to make informed health decisions -&#xD;
      is a precursor to health knowledge and is necessary for translating health knowledge into&#xD;
      behavior. Low HL among adults is associated with poor ability to interpret health messages,&#xD;
      and results in reduced preventive health behaviors. Further, parent and adolescent HL is&#xD;
      negatively related to adolescents' obesity status. Thus, while research on adding HL to&#xD;
      existing behavior interventions to improve adolescents' obesity prevention behaviors is&#xD;
      lacking, it is expected that the inclusion of HL into existing interventions will increase&#xD;
      intervention effectiveness and positive behavior outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this line of research is to reduce the incidence of obesity in&#xD;
      adolescents and by extension reduce the risk for obesity-related chronic illnesses using&#xD;
      interventions that address individual and contextual factors related to long-term health&#xD;
      decision-making and behavior change. The goal of the proposed study is to examine the effect&#xD;
      of adding a HL component to an obesity prevention intervention that addresses adolescents'&#xD;
      obesogenic behavior-related health knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is adolescents receiving HL training as part of an obesity prevention intervention&#xD;
      will have higher rates of prevention behaviors than those in the obesity prevention only&#xD;
      condition. Study goals will be achieved through the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Modify successful components of existing obesity prevention interventions into an&#xD;
      interactive digital platform with and without HL for acceptability and usability in&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: Use successful components of existing interventions, our completed preliminary&#xD;
      research, and our research teams' expertise to develop an interactive digital intervention&#xD;
      including HL, and obesogenic behavior-related health knowledge, motivation, and behavioral&#xD;
      skills. Assess and modify the intervention for usability and acceptability among&#xD;
      14-16-year-olds through an iterative process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine if the addition of HL training to an interactive digital obesity prevention&#xD;
      intervention will improve adolescents' obesity prevention behaviors over the obesity&#xD;
      intervention alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Adolescents in the obesity prevention plus HL intervention will have higher rates&#xD;
      of obesity prevention behaviors at posttest and follow-up compared to the obesity prevention&#xD;
      only group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: Conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) intervention (obesity&#xD;
      prevention only, obesity prevention/HL) and estimate the intervention's effects on obesogenic&#xD;
      behaviors. Adolescents (n = 76; 14-16-year-olds) will be randomly assigned to each condition&#xD;
      (38/condition). Conduct pretest, posttest, and 1- and 3-month assessments of HL, obesogenic&#xD;
      behaviors, and obesogenic behavior-related motivation, behavioral skills, and knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Intervention completion will result in effect size estimates of improvements in&#xD;
      obesity prevention behaviors, health knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills for both&#xD;
      groups with greater improvements for the HL group at posttest and follow-up. The obesity&#xD;
      prevention/HL intervention group will also have higher HL at posttest and follow-up.&#xD;
      Retention, recruitment, completion and treatment fidelity rates will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation &amp; Impact: This study incorporates HL, an understudied but potentially critical&#xD;
      factor in adolescents' health behaviors. The intervention will be developed and implemented&#xD;
      in a digital format which will increase reach and impact. This is the first study examining&#xD;
      the effect of including HL in adolescents' obesity prevention interventions. This study sets&#xD;
      the groundwork for a full scale, RCT to assess the benefit of HL training added to an obesity&#xD;
      prevention intervention to address adolescents' obesogenic behaviors.&#xD;
