  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to (1) define and characterize brain networks of cognitive flexibility&#xD;
      amongst patients with frontal lesions; (2) quantify the effects of ecological cognitive&#xD;
      trainings and brain stimulation on behavioral performance and brain networks; (3) identify&#xD;
      predictive markers of effective rehabilitation (patients)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decision making impairments and perseveration are frequently observed in patients with&#xD;
      frontal lobe lesions, associated with overall chronic and serious deficits in executive&#xD;
      functions. In order to improve mental flexibility, patients can benefit from reeducation&#xD;
      based on regular training of executive functions along with a non-invasive brain stimulation.&#xD;
      One of the key areas for such processing is the prefrontal cortex. Previous studies have&#xD;
      shown however that maintaining a good level of mental flexibility in complex tasks involves a&#xD;
      dynamic integration of several brain areas distributed in large networks. These areas in&#xD;
      cooperation can be solicited by a multi-modal intervention such as motor-cognitive tasks&#xD;
      associated with a transcranial stimulation. The goal of the present project is to develop a&#xD;
      new rehabilitation program and to assess its impact in comparison with current programs. The&#xD;
      investigators will also develop new methods to measure long term cerebral modifications&#xD;
      induced by these programs. This goal will be reached by: 1) the identification of the brain&#xD;
      networks of mental flexibility. 2) The assessment of multimodal task effects associated with&#xD;
      or without a transcranial brain stimulation. Behavioral (performance in executive tasks) and&#xD;
      functional (parameters of cerebral functional connectivity networks at rest) measures will be&#xD;
      used. 3) The identification of mental flexibility predictors. The goal will be to find which&#xD;
      initial individual's parameters of brain functional connectivity at rest could predict an&#xD;
      optimal level of mental flexibility after training. This project aims at improving the&#xD;
      quality of life in the brain-damaged population; impact that could eventually extend to the&#xD;
      other parts of the population.&#xD;
