  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric, single arm, prospective, stratified by breast density clinical&#xD;
      investigation using Mammowave that is a device, which uses microwaves instead of ionizing&#xD;
      radiation (X-ray)for breast lesions(BL) detection. Specifically, Mammowave employs a novel&#xD;
      technique which generates images by processing very low power (&lt;1 mW) microwaves. The exam&#xD;
      takes few minutes per breast and is performed with the patient lying in a comfortable facing&#xD;
      down position. Mammowave is safe to be used at any age, in any condition (pregnancy, specific&#xD;
      illness) and for unlimited number of times.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of participants will be 500 (for all the sites). The Study will be composed of two&#xD;
      phases: a preliminary phase to 'optimize the imaging algorithm for each apparatus installed&#xD;
      at each centre', where 15 healthy volunteers in each centre will be examined by MammoWave. In&#xD;
      the second phase, the remaining people will be enrolled (Breast Lesions pts will be about 70%&#xD;
      of total) and examined by MammoWave by the clinical investigator, and results will be&#xD;
      compared with the effective diagnosis already obtained by standard clinical methods. BL&#xD;
      includes malignant lesions (BC) and benign lesions, and may be palpable or non-palpable&#xD;
      lesions. BL includes also isolated clustered microcalcifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, in each centre the clinical investigators will compare MammoWave&#xD;
      output against the radiologist study output obtained using conventional exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, at the end of the study, the MammoWave output will be centrally reviewed in&#xD;
      blind by an independent radiologist in order to confirm the data and confirm centrally the&#xD;
      comparisons performed locally. The primary goal of the clinical study is to assess&#xD;
      Mammowave's ability in BL detection and differentiation.&#xD;

    <description>Patients should perform MammoWave exam. A short visit should be performed and during this visit a qualitative differentiation would be performed between patients with high density breast, and patients with low density breast. After the patients will be ready for the MammoWave exam. The exam will be composed of two phases: the data acquisition and the data processing. During the acquisition that should takes about 10 minutes the patients would be lying in a prone position, on a bed which is part of the MammoWave. The upper part of MammoWave has a container cup shape, which contains the breast, which also has the function of separate it from the internal parts of the device. After patient is on the bed and MammoWave would start to perform the acquisition. Once the acquisition is completed, the data will be processed through an imaging algorithm, which is integrated in the device. The final output will be composed by one or more images, plus one or more parameters describing the images.</description>
