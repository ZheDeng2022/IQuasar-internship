  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are testing improvement in survival outcomes in DIPG&#xD;
      patients when stratified with MR perfusion score and treated with the said protocol. Newly&#xD;
      diagnosed DIPG patients will undergo MRI perfusion study in addition to the usual MRI at&#xD;
      diagnosis and will be stratified into hyperperfused or hypoperfused tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hyperperfused patients will receive additional low dose Bevacizumab weekly with&#xD;
      conventional standard radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypo-perfused patients will receive ultra-low-dose radiotherapy fractionation equivalent&#xD;
      to conventional RT biological dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In tumours like Diffuse pontine glioma (DIPG), the diagnosis itself spells a death sentence&#xD;
      for the child affected. The current standard treatment is conventionally fractionated daily&#xD;
      radiation treatment for 6 weeks which benefits 80-90% patients with temporary improvement in&#xD;
      neurological function which gives survival up to 8-10 months. With research over several&#xD;
      decades, none of the altered fractionation radiotherapy or additional chemotherapy or&#xD;
      targeted agents has shown a significant difference in outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to do an MRI perfusion study in addition to usual MRI at diagnosis&#xD;
      and stratify them into hyperperfused or hypoperfused based on the criteria from the&#xD;
      investigator's previously published institutional experience in DIPG. The hyperperfused&#xD;
      patients will receive additional low dose a drug called Bevacizumab weekly with conventional&#xD;
      standard radiotherapy. It is hypothesized that low dose Bevacizumab will decrease hypoxia and&#xD;
      improve the efficacy of conventional radiotherapy and in turn improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypo-perfused patients will receive ultra-low-dose radiotherapy fractionation equivalent&#xD;
      to conventional RT biological dose. As it is assumed that hypoperfused tumours are&#xD;
      radioresistant, the investigator hypothesis that the ultra-low dose radiotherapy may overcome&#xD;
      that radioresistance as seen in GBM adult patients and may improve outcomes.&#xD;
