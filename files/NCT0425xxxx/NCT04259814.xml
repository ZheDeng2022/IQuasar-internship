  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) has been successfully used with children&#xD;
      who have hemiplegia (weakness or paralysis on one side of the body.) mCIMT uses a removable&#xD;
      cast during treatment and home exercise programs. It has been found that mCIMT can improve&#xD;
      use, strength and coordination of a child's affected hand, and may also help improve speech&#xD;
      and language skills. The goal of this project is to investigate whether combining mCIMT with&#xD;
      speech therapy will enhance speech outcomes in children with cerebral palsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy (CP) often have hemiplegia, meaning only one side of the body is&#xD;
      affected. They may have difficulty with daily tasks that require two hands. They may also&#xD;
      have difficulty with speech and/or language. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is a&#xD;
      treatment that has been used to help improve children's performance of everyday activities&#xD;
      and enhance their quality of life. CIMT uses a cast on the unaffected arm to encourage use of&#xD;
      the affected hand. In traditional CIMT, a child wears a non-removable cast 24 hours a day for&#xD;
      a duration of time. A more child-friendly version, modified constraint-induced movement&#xD;
      therapy (mCIMT), uses a removable cast during treatment and home exercise programs. It has&#xD;
      been found that mCIMT can improve use, strength and coordination of a child's affected hand.&#xD;
      Preliminary studies have also shown some speech and language improvement in children with&#xD;
      speech impairments who participated in mCIMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to investigate whether combining mCIMT with speech and language&#xD;
      treatment (SPT) will enhance speech outcomes when compared with SPT alone. We will examine&#xD;
      (1) whether it is feasible and effective to deliver (SPT) and mCIMT simultaneously, and (2)&#xD;
      whether providing mCIMT simultaneously with SPT leads to greater gains in speech-language&#xD;
      outcomes than SPT alone? Such information could add valuable evidence-based treatment options&#xD;
      for children with hemiplegia and comorbid speech-language deficits, change the way in which&#xD;
      we plan patients' care, and help justify co-treating patients who get mCIMT. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that forced use of the impaired limb in therapeutic tasks would have spread effects resulting&#xD;
      in increased rate of speech-language improvement during treatment intervals when the patient&#xD;
      is casted.&#xD;
