  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is a multifactorial, progressive disease which is the major causes of dental&#xD;
      pain, infection and tooth loss. Dental caries can substantially compromise the quality of&#xD;
      life in older adults 1 2. As the number of older adults in the US increases, the dental&#xD;
      professionals have become increasingly concerned with the dental need of elderly and&#xD;
      preventive regimes to reduce the incidence of caries3 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention becomes an area of paramount importance. Many studies have advocated nonsurgical&#xD;
      intervention for shallow dentin caries lesion.The most effective method for prevention to&#xD;
      date is considered to be fluoride. In the United states fluoride has been incorporated in&#xD;
      many ways like water fluoridation, fluoride mouth wash, dentifrices and professionally&#xD;
      applied fluoride varnishes . The American Dental Association (ADA) recommended the use of&#xD;
      fluoride for patients of all ages who are at risk of developing dental caries7 . With the&#xD;
      high success of fluoride, another treatment method using Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) is&#xD;
      gaining popularity in the United States. SDF has been used in many countries like Japan,&#xD;
      Australia, China, and Cuba for treatment of caries . Successful treatment data from other&#xD;
      countries is promising, and promoting the use of SDF in the United States. SDF is available&#xD;
      in the United States as 38% aqueous solution and approved as a desensitizing agent. American&#xD;
      Dental Association published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on nonrestorative&#xD;
      treatments for caries teeth and recommended use of SDF on a carious cavitated lesion on&#xD;
      permanent teeth9 . Clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of SDF in arresting root&#xD;
      caries in older adults.&#xD;

      Potential subjects will be identified through regular appointments. Screening will be&#xD;
      performed on subjects to determine their eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Subjects will sign an informed consent before enrollment in the study. Patient will&#xD;

    <measure>DIAGOdent: laser fluorescence to aid in the detection of caries</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 month for next 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>As the incident laser light is dispersed into the site, carious tooth structure will exhibit fluorescence, proportionate to the degree of caries, resulting in elevated scale readings on the display. Healthy tooth structure exhibits little or no fluorescence and will result in very low scale readings on the display. Over 90% accurate in detecting lesions not detectable with an explorer or bitewing X-rays. The remote display for DIAGNOdent pen uses infra-red signals, and the values are shown simultaneously on the DIAGNOdent pen and on the remote display</description>
