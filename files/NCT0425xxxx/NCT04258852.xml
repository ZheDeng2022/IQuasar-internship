    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to test the overall hypothesis that e-cigarettes (ECs) provide&#xD;
      efficient nicotine delivery to the brain and arterial blood in non-EC-naïve smokers and&#xD;
      e-cigarette users and that EC liquid characteristics modulate this effect. This study will&#xD;
      test the hypothesis through complementary methods that include [ [18F]NCFHEB (aka&#xD;
      [18F]Flubatine) PET neuroimaging, arterial blood nicotine measurements, and subjective drug&#xD;
      effects assessments.&#xD;

      C.2 Subject Inclusion and Assessments Overall study design: Non-EC-naïve smokers or&#xD;
      e-cigarette users (n=20) will abstain from tobacco smoking/nicotine products for 5 days prior&#xD;
      to each PET scan. In a randomized order (counterbalanced), after baseline quantification of&#xD;
      receptor availability, subjects will be scanned while using an EC: (1) &quot;JUUL&quot; 5%, a common&#xD;
      commercially available unmodified nicotine salt EC, and (2) JUUL 3%, a lower nicotine&#xD;
      strength product. A third optional scan where subjects smoke a cigarette may be conducted but&#xD;
      is not required. During scanning, subjects will undergo arterial blood nicotine level&#xD;
      measurements following EC use and measures of nicotine withdrawal, craving, and drug effects&#xD;
      will be measured. 5-7 days of smoking abstinence will be required prior to each PET scan to&#xD;
      ensure no residual nicotine occupies receptors. Subjects will go back to smoking as usual&#xD;
      after first scan for 2-3 weeks prior to subsequent smoking abstinence/PET scanning. Subjects&#xD;
      will be provided with smoking cessation resources upon request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.2.b Subjects: Twenty non-EC-naïve tobacco dependent smokers or e-cigarette users will be&#xD;
      recruited for the study. All research subjects will be recruited under guidelines of the Yale&#xD;
      University Institutional Review Board (Human Investigation Committee). Smokers will be&#xD;
      recruited from the community via IRB-approved advertising. After completing informed consent,&#xD;
      subjects will have a psychiatric, physical and neurological examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
      an electrocardiogram (EKG) (see C.2.c Clinical Assessments below). This is considered the&#xD;
      screening phase. Subjects will be excluded for major medical, neurological or psychiatric&#xD;
      illness, abnormal laboratory tests, or contraindication to PET or MR imaging. A urine drug&#xD;
      screen and pregnancy test are performed at screening and prior to each imaging session and&#xD;
      participants are excluded for a positive test. Detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria can be&#xD;
      found in Protection of Human Subjects section. All women will be required to have a negative&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test and all subjects are required to have a negative urine drug toxicology&#xD;
      test prior to radiotracer administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.2.c Clinical Assessments: A standardized battery will be administered to all subjects at&#xD;
      intake including Health Questionnaire, the SCID, assessments of demographics, measures of&#xD;
      tobacco use, alcohol and drug use, family history of smoking, mood (PROMIS short forms for&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and anger), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), anxiety&#xD;
      (State Trait Anxiety Inventory), impulsivity (Brief - Barratt Impulsivity Scale, smoking&#xD;
      dependence (PROMIS nicotine dependence scale), smoking craving (Tiffany QSU) and withdrawal&#xD;
      (Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale). Mood and smoking assessments will be repeated on each&#xD;
      scan day before and after challenge. Product liking, craving and the Drug Effects&#xD;
      Questionnaire (DEQ) will be assessed on a subjective scale (0-100, low-high) immediately&#xD;
      following product use. The DEQ will measure acute effects consisting of seven items: drug&#xD;
      strength, high, feeling stimulated, good effects, bad effects, wanting more drugs, and drug&#xD;
      liking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and after each PET scan/e-cig challenge:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROMIS Dyspnea Severity Item Pool&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROMIS Dyspnea Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROMIS Fatigue Short Form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Cough item&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The health questionnaire titled 'assessment of health problems' (and provided as an&#xD;
           attachment via a comment in IRES) will be added to the protocol and will be completed at&#xD;
           intake and before each exposure. Note that potential subjects with chronic symptoms that&#xD;
           would interfere with monitoring of vaping complications, will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive findings of a change in symptom or single severe symptom would trigger clinical&#xD;
      referral to a treating physician or the emergency room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.2.d Contingency Management: All smokers/e-cigarette users will be helped to remain&#xD;
      abstinent for 5- 7 days prior to each PET scan with highly successful contingency management&#xD;
      techniques that have been used extensively in the laboratory before. Subjects will return to&#xD;
      smoking use as usual after the first PET scan and repeat smoking abstinence prior to the next&#xD;
      PET scan. This technique has been successful in the past to study nicotine occupancy of&#xD;
      receptors after multiple challenges by recruiting smokers who are non-treatment seeking.&#xD;
      Subjects will be met daily over the course of abstinence provide support and obtain CO and&#xD;
      urine cotinine levels to ensure smoking abstinence. Subjects who are not able to abstain from&#xD;
      tobacco smoking (2 consecutive days without a decrease in urine cotinine levels or a sudden&#xD;
      increase in urine cotinine or CO levels) will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.2.e - MRI/cognitive testing Subjects will be asked to go to the MRRC at The Anlyan Center&#xD;
      for Medical Research &amp; Education (TAC, 300 Cedar Street) to have an MRI (Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging) scan of their brain. The purpose of the MRI is to help us identify the different&#xD;
      regions of their brain on the PET scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI scan is a routine way to get pictures of the inside of the body. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked if they are carrying any metallic objects before they move toward the MRI system. These&#xD;
      objects will be held for them in a locked cabinet in the MRI Center to avoid having these&#xD;
      objects fly toward the magnet when they approach it. They will also be asked to walk through&#xD;
      a metal detector. They will be asked to lie still in the MRI scanner for about 30 minutes.&#xD;
      The scanner looks like a deep tunnel. They will be inside the tunnel from head to knees. They&#xD;
      will not be able to see out of it, but they will be able to hear us and be heard if they wish&#xD;
      to say anything. They will hear a drumming noise when the camera is taking pictures of their&#xD;
      brain. If they feel uncomfortable during the scan, the scan will be ended at any time they&#xD;
      wish. However, if they cannot complete the MRI scan, they will not be able to participate in&#xD;
      any more of these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sessions of testing of their memory, attention, and concentration may take place. This&#xD;
      will take approximately 1hr total. They will be given a break between these sessions. This&#xD;
      may take place on the same day as the MRI scan, or on another day prior to PET scans if that&#xD;
      works better with their and staff schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit, they may play a computer game called the Face Game. The goal of the Face&#xD;
      Game is to win as much money as possible. They may earn money by quickly and correctly&#xD;
      pressing one of two keys on the keyboard, each time they see a face on the screen. They will&#xD;
      press one key if they think that the mouth on the face is long, and the other if they think&#xD;
      it is short.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cold Pressor Task Subjects may also be asked to participate in the cold pressor task during&#xD;
      the study to test the body's physiological response to cold water. They will be asked to&#xD;
      immerse your hand in a bucket of ice cold water maintained at 0-4°C. They will be told to&#xD;
      raise their other hand when they begin to feel pain and to remove their hand from the water&#xD;
      when they can no longer tolerate the pain. While their hand is immersed in water, they will&#xD;
      also be asked to rate their pain on a scale from 0-100 and their heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impulsivity Subjects may be asked to play a game in which they will use a computer mouse to&#xD;
      click a balloon pump that inflates a balloon on the screen. The objective of the task is to&#xD;
      get the largest amount of the money possible while avoiding balloon explosions. This&#xD;
      assessment tests their impulsivity. They may be asked to play this game on the day of their&#xD;
      PET scan too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.3. PET Imaging Procedures PET procedures will be conducted at the Yale University PET&#xD;
      Center. Female subjects will be given a urine pregnancy test prior to the initiation of any&#xD;
      imaging procedures. If the test is positive, the scans will be canceled. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive a minimum of 2 and maximum of 3 PET scans. The 3rd scan is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET scans: Prior to the PET scans, a T1-weighted MRI will be acquired for all subjects on a&#xD;
      3.0 Tesla Siemens Trio camera to rule out any brain abnormalities and for anatomical&#xD;
      reference in the image analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET scans are acquired as subjects lie supine on the scanner bed. Venous catheters will be&#xD;
      used for intravenous administration of the radiotracer, and possibly for additional venous&#xD;
      blood sampling. A radial artery catheter will be inserted by an experienced physician before&#xD;
      the PET scan to draw arterial blood samples for metabolite analysis and for determination of&#xD;
      the fraction of plasma radioactivity unbound to protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infusion of the radiotracer takes 210 minutes (3.5 hours). Subjects will be scanned for 2&#xD;
      hours (starting 90 minutes after initiation of radiotracer infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      [18F]NCFHEB will be synthesized and administered on PET scan days as a bolus plus constant&#xD;
      infusion with a Kbol of 360 minutes over 3.5 hours. PET data will be acquired on the MCT. A&#xD;
      6-min transmission scan will be acquired at the beginning or end of each PET scan to correct&#xD;
      for attenuation. Arterial blood samples will be taken to obtain a metabolite-corrected&#xD;
      [18F]NCFHEB input function. Baseline receptor availability will be measured 90-120mins after&#xD;
      radiotracer infusion. Then, subjects will start a challenge (NIDA EC or JUUL EC,&#xD;
      counterbalanced order) at 125min for 5 minutes in the scanner. Thereafter, post nicotine&#xD;
      scanning will continue until end of 4 hrs of infusion. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse,&#xD;
      respiration) and ECG's will be obtained before and after radiotracer administration. The same&#xD;
      procedures will follow for the 2nd PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of EC: Subjects will receive 2 different scans and will puff one of two EC products (in&#xD;
      random order, counterbalanced): &quot;JUUL&quot; 5% (50 mg/ml), a common commercially available&#xD;
      unmodified nicotine salt EC, and (2) JUUL 3% (30 mg/ml), a lower nicotine strength product.&#xD;
      Only tobacco flavor will be used. A training session to familiarize smokers with the EC&#xD;
      product used in the study will be conducted at an appointment prior to the PET scans.&#xD;
      Subjects will be advised to take longer and slower puffs from the EC (at least 3-4 seconds)&#xD;
      as compared with puffing a cigarette. During each scan, subjects will be instructed to puff&#xD;
      on the EC for up to 5 minutes. All users will be directly observed during EC use to ensure&#xD;
      they do not have any problems operating the device. If available, a mouthpiece to measure&#xD;
      puff topography may be used as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of Regular Cigarette: A third PET scan using a regular cigarette may be offered for&#xD;
      cigarette smokers but is not required for study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples: On PET scan days, arterial blood samples will be collected prior to&#xD;
      radiotracer administration and at multiple time points (t = 0, 0.3, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60,&#xD;
      90 minutes post challenge) after EC/cigarette use to determine nicotine concentrations in the&#xD;
      blood, which will be assayed using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry with&#xD;
      deuterated internal standards.47 These data will be used to calculate pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      patterns of nicotine delivery under each condition (Cmax, Tmax, and AUC for nicotine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image Analysis and Outcome Measure: List-mode PET data will be reconstructed with OSEM with&#xD;
      built-in corrections for attenuation, normalization, scatter, randoms, deadtime and subject&#xD;
      motion.53,54 Following image reconstruction, a summed image will be registered to the&#xD;
      subject's MRI. Regions of interest (ROIs) will be anatomically defined using a template&#xD;
      [Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL)] coregistered to the subject's MRI image. ROIs used for&#xD;
      calculation of receptor occupancy will be: cerebellum, frontal, parietal, temporal, and&#xD;
      occipital cortices, caudate, putamen, hippocampus, and amygdala. These regions are chosen&#xD;
      because they were previously examined in β2*-nAChR studies, have significant density in the&#xD;
      human brain, and are relevant to the craving and withdrawal properties of nicotine. The&#xD;
      thalamus will not be included because equilibrium is not reached in this region with the&#xD;
      bolus-infusion paradigm. The volume of distribution VT will be estimated using the&#xD;
      equilibrium ratio between total radioactivity concentration in tissue and parent&#xD;
      concentration in arterial plasma. Baseline VT will be estimated from 90-120 min after&#xD;
      infusion start, previously shown to establish good equilibrium in brain Post-ECig VT will be&#xD;
      estimated from 180-210 minutes after infusion start (55-85 minutes post challenge). Prior&#xD;
      preliminary data show that this is a sufficient amount of time for a new steady state to be&#xD;
      achieved. Receptor occupancy and VND will be estimated using the Lassen plot approach.&#xD;
