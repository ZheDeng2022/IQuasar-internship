      Aim The aim of the study is to characterize the typical basic life support (BLS) course&#xD;
      participant. The characterization include age, sex, education, ethnicity, income, health care&#xD;
      data and cohabitation. All data will be compared with that of the general population. Hereby&#xD;
      the study wish identify potential focus areas for recruitment of willing and able bystanders&#xD;
      to increase survival. Furthermore, this study will provide a foundation for evaluation of&#xD;
      current initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance In Denmark, several population-based campaigns have been initiated to increase&#xD;
      the amount of able and willing laypersons to assist at out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).&#xD;
      The main focus has been on increasing the quantity of laypersons attending BLS courses. Even&#xD;
      measures of changing legislation mandating course participation have been passed and&#xD;
      implemented. Estimates state that approximately 3-4.5% of the entire Danish population&#xD;
      participates in BLS courses annually. Consequently, a substantial amount of resources has&#xD;
      been spent on educating and certifying laypersons in BLS on a population level. In this&#xD;
      study, the characteristics of these BLS course participants will be described. This will&#xD;
      provide the basis for evaluation of already implemented interventions. Additionally, this&#xD;
      study will be able to support course distributors, foundations and national councils in&#xD;
      making strategies for further recruitment based on evidence. The present study will assist in&#xD;
      pinpointing society groups with a theoretical bystander potential, but low level of BLS&#xD;
      education. This can guide future efforts in trying to improve bystander initiated&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and survival from OHCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study population includes all Danish citizens who attended a BLS training course&#xD;
      certificate from 2016-2018 above the age of 15. This cut off is based on the earliest&#xD;
      mandatory BLS training in primary school. Using Personal Identifications Numbers (PIN) of BLS&#xD;
      course participant from January 1st, 2016 to December 31st, 2018, data will be extracted and&#xD;
      delivered anonymously, including information on age, sex, income, education, ethnicity and&#xD;
      cohabitation, from the Statistics Denmark. The relative risk of BLS course attendance&#xD;
      stratified by education and income level, cohabitation status, age of youngest child,&#xD;
      urbanization level, sex and ethnicity of the Danish BLS course participants compared to the&#xD;
      general population will be presented. Prevalence of BLS courses participants by age and sex&#xD;
      will be analyzed and graphically display and prevalence of BLS course participants by income&#xD;
      and age will be calculated by regression models. A layperson focus group interview consisting&#xD;
      of BLS course participants will be conducted to explore the attending courses participants&#xD;
      views of the project and to revise accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymity is secured through a data processing agreement between the Danish First Aid Council&#xD;
      and Statistics Denmark, facilitated by the Copenhagen Emergency Medical Services. An&#xD;
      application will be formulated to the Danish Data protection agency regarding storage of&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome A characterization of the typical BLS course participants in Denmark with&#xD;
      median age, sex, cohabitation, income and education. The association between sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics of BLS course participants and relevant prevalence's by the entire population&#xD;
      will be presented.&#xD;

      Background Bystander initiated basic life support (BLS) play an increasingly important role&#xD;
      in the efforts and strategies to improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).&#xD;
      Denmark is known internationally for our ability to investigate OHCA on a population scale&#xD;
      and for the high number of laypersons educated in BLS. Denmark has approximately 5400 OHCA&#xD;
      each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been a significant increase in survival after OHCA in Denmark the last two decades.&#xD;
      Since 2001, the 30-day survival rate has increased fourfold from approximately 4% in 2001 to&#xD;
      16% in 2018. This increase has been linked to a significant rise in bystander-initiated CPR&#xD;
      prior to the arrival of emergency medical services (EMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Global Resuscitation Alliance emphasizes the need to educate laypersons in BLS and of the&#xD;
      ten steps to improve survival from OHCA, four steps involve BLS and the community. It is&#xD;
      stated by the Global Resuscitation Alliance that &quot;a population universally trained in CPR has&#xD;
      the potential to double survival rates&quot; . Bystander-initiated CPR rate has increased from 20%&#xD;
      in 2001 to 77% in 2018. In the same period as Denmark have witnessed a fourfold increase in&#xD;
      bystander-initiated CPR and approximately threefold increase in the number of basic life&#xD;
      support courses have been seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rise number of basic life support courses in is largely due to several central&#xD;
      initiatives. To increase bystander CPR rates in Denmark, CPR courses have been made mandatory&#xD;
      in all primary schools since January 2005 and when taking driver's license since October&#xD;
      2006. Further, several large scale national campaigns, like TrygFondens Heartrunners, have&#xD;
      been initiated to increase bystander CPR rates and the use of automatic external&#xD;
      defibrillators (AED) for laypeople. An examination of TrygFondens First Responders project&#xD;
      Heartrunners showed that up to 98% of the first responders had participated in BLS course and&#xD;
      a majority (70%) within the last two years. Hence, the soon to be national, first responder&#xD;
      project TrygFondens Heartrunners is recruiting largely among citizens whom have participated&#xD;
      in BLS courses within the last two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, in an upcoming study of a representative part of the entire population, 4 out of 5&#xD;
      respondents answered that they had participated in some kind of BLS course in their lifetime.&#xD;
      Unverified numbers assert that approximately 250.000-300.000 citizens attend certified BLS&#xD;
      courses annually. This entails, that approximately 3-4,5% of the entire Danish population&#xD;
      attain a certificate annually. However, the measure of annual BLS course participants in&#xD;
      Denmark is, for now, only an assumption. When engaging 3-4.5% of the entire Danish population&#xD;
      annually, it is reasonable to evaluate the effort. Little is known about the profile of this&#xD;
      large proportion of Danish citizens. Obvious questions to be asked are; &quot;Can the numbers be&#xD;
      verified?&quot;, &quot;Are the targeted groups of potential bystanders reached?&quot; and &quot;To recruit and&#xD;
      maintain able and willing bystanders, whom should campaigns address?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most courses (&gt;97%) are provided by one of the organizations of the Danish First Aid Council&#xD;
      or the danish Heart Foundation. Only a minor proportion of approximately 2.500-4.000 are&#xD;
      provided by the Danish/European resuscitation council. All recognized providers intend to&#xD;
      follow the standards of the ERC guidelines. Since 2016 the Danish First Aid Council, who&#xD;
      conduct most courses, have registered all certificates electronically with Personal&#xD;
      Identification Number (PIN) of participants, type of course and date of passed course for&#xD;
      each of the approximately 250.000-300.000 participants annually. The courses include 4 hours&#xD;
      training in BLS including CPR and AED use. The Danish Heart Foundation have created a&#xD;
      voluntary based BLS introduction course of 30 minutes length including CPR and AED use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain the high number potential bystanders based on able and willing laypersons to act&#xD;
      at OHCA, it is essential to not only retain the active BLS educated able bystanders, but also&#xD;
      to continuously recruit new potential able bystanders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment efficacy is optimized by targeting those segments of the population with the&#xD;
      largest available resource and by focusing on those who are the most likely to respond&#xD;
      positively. The willingness to provide BLS by layperson and attending a course has many&#xD;
      similarities with the willingness to donate blood. Therefore, it is reasonable to look at&#xD;
      initiatives involved in maintaining and increasing recruitment of blood donors on a national&#xD;
      level. In a study from 2017 Burgdorf et al. examined the Danish blood donors and assume that&#xD;
      potential donors would be similar those who already have donated with respect to age, sex and&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics. Similarly, it is rational to attain more detailed knowledge&#xD;
      of who attend BLS courses to increase and maintain recruitment for current at future BLS&#xD;
      educational interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize the typical BLS course participants. The characterization includes: age,&#xD;
           sex, income, education, ethnicity, health care data and cohabitation in comparison with&#xD;
           the general population&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify recruitment potentials in the general public for BLS educational&#xD;
           interventions to increase survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To provide basis information to be used when designing strategies for recruitment to&#xD;
           population-based BLS educational interventions to increase survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance This study will provide knowledge that can help optimization of public efforts to&#xD;
      increase the willingness to help in all emergency situations and specifically increase the&#xD;
      knowledge of those willing to aid as bystander for OHCA. By extension this will increase&#xD;
      survival. This can result in optimization of future campaigns to improve survival and&#xD;
      evaluation of current national population-based interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study is a registry-based follow-up study. The study population comprised all&#xD;
      Danish citizens above the age of 15 in 2018. This cut of is based on earliest mandatory BLS&#xD;
      training in school and will have no upper age limit. The methodical approach is in large&#xD;
      guided by similar studies examining recruitment potential and characteristics of a&#xD;
      population-based effort to increase willingness of laypersons donating blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1968 all Danish citizens have been identifiable through a 10-digit Personal&#xD;
      Identification Number (PIN). Through Statistics Denmark it is possible to attain&#xD;
      sociodemographic data from PIN numbers. When the investigated population is sufficiently&#xD;
      large, the data output will be considered anonymously encrypted by the Statistics Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis data storage and anonymization With the PIN numbers of all BLS course&#xD;
      participants, the current study wish to extracted information on sex; year of birth;&#xD;
      ethnicity (born in Denmark by at least one ethnically Danish parent, born in Denmark by&#xD;
      non-Danish parents, born in a Western country other than Denmark, or born in a non-Western&#xD;
      country); parental birth place; cohabitation status (living with parents, living alone,&#xD;
      living with a person of opposite gender, living with a person of same gender, living in a&#xD;
      multi-household which is a household with three or more unrelated adults); age of youngest&#xD;
      child in the household (0, 1-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11 or 12+ years old, or no children); and level&#xD;
      of urbanization (&lt;25, 25-350, &gt;350-1000, &gt;1000-2000, &gt;2000 persons per square kilometer);&#xD;
      education (primary and lower secondary education, high school, technical and vocational&#xD;
      education and training, higher short/middle length education, higher long term education),&#xD;
      and income (deciles relative to gender and birth year) and potentially health care data&#xD;
      (number of hospitalizations and parameters related to general health) as done in previous&#xD;
      study on blood donors. For all the above-mentioned parameters reference values for the&#xD;
      background population is extracted as reference for direct statistical comparison. To&#xD;
      estimate relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) of attending a BLS course for&#xD;
      demographic/sociodemographic variables, binary regression models with log-link or multiple&#xD;
      logistic regression will be conducted. Maximum likelihood estimate of RR and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals will be calculated in a joint model. Data are presented with prevalence of BLS&#xD;
      course certificate with mutually adjusted RR or OR and 95% confidence intervals. The relative&#xD;
      risk for each subgroup is compared to the reference group (RR = 1.00). To show the prevalence&#xD;
      as a smooth function of age, this study will identified the number of BLS course certificates&#xD;
      and number of potential able bystanders at each age in days or months. If needed the&#xD;
      prevalence will smoothed using the loess algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and statistical analyses will be performed using R-statics™ (The R Foundation&#xD;
      for Statistical Computing, Austria). All data will be stored anonymously on secured folder&#xD;
      within the regional central IT system. A formal application to Danish data Protection Agency&#xD;
      regarding usage, transformation and storage of certificate data will be formulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Because this is a Registry-based study no ethical approval is required. However, the&#xD;
      the regional committee for ethical approval have been contacted will register this study with&#xD;
      a unique registration number for approval.&#xD;
