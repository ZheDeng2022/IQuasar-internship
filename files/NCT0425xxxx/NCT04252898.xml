  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This controlled trial investigates the impact of the implementation of a front-of-pack&#xD;
      nutrition label, namely Nutri-Score, on foods and beverages sold in a contract catering in&#xD;
      France on the nutritional quality of purchases.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of front-of-pack nutrition labelling is thought to help consumers making&#xD;
      healthier food choices at the point-of-purchase. In 2017, the French government has selected&#xD;
      the Nutri-Score as single front-of-pack nutrition label to be applied on food products sold&#xD;
      in French supermarkets, on a voluntary basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have found that the Nutri-Score would help consumers making healthier choices.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, its impact has been demonstrated in experimental supermarkets and its&#xD;
      implementation only concerns products sold in groceries and supermarkets, as it is stated in&#xD;
      the official decree. The potential impact of the Nutri-Score in contract catering remains&#xD;
      unknown, while this sector represents a growing share of out-of-home catering and that the&#xD;
      promotion of the Nutri-Score in this sector is now part of the National Public Health Plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the objective of the present study is to investigate the impact of the implementation&#xD;
      of the Nutri-Score in contract catering restaurants on the nutritional quality of food&#xD;
      purchases. The trial will be conducted using a quasi experimental before/after design with a&#xD;
      comparison group. Data on purchases will be collected regularly through receipts, and the&#xD;
      nutritional quality of purchases will be evaluated over time on two pairs of sites. In each&#xD;
      pair of sites, one site will receive an intervention (Nutri-Score) and one site will be a&#xD;
      control site. Within each pair, the sites will be comparable in terms of food offer and&#xD;
      consumers profile.&#xD;
