  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus interna (GPi) are two main targets in the&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). Large randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials, in which patients of comparable clinical and demographics were randomized&#xD;
      to either GPi DBS or STN DBS, have demonstrated equal effects of both targets in motor&#xD;
      symptom improvement, the superiority of STN DBS in the medication reduction and the potential&#xD;
      advantage of GPi DBS for cognitive, psychiatric and axial aspects. Unfortunately, in such a&#xD;
      highly heterogeneous disease of PD, many of these randomized controlled trials didn't include&#xD;
      sufficient subjects and thereby yielded inconsistent results. Moreover, most studies are&#xD;
      investigating the difference between GPi and STN in different patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to address the problem, an intra-patient comparison will be made by investigating&#xD;
      the acute turning-on effects of unilateral STN stimulation versus unilateral GPi stimulation&#xD;
      on axial symptoms, cognition and also cardinal symptoms within each individual patient who&#xD;
      received the treatment of combined unilateral STN and contralateral GPi DBS. Axial symptoms&#xD;
      including gait, balance and posture, motor symptoms and cognition are comprehensively&#xD;
      assessed under two treatment conditions.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Throughout the study, all participants, independent raters/evaluators and statisticians will be blind to the treatment conditions and parameter configurations. Independent raters who are blind to the conditions will be responsible for the conduct of all the assessments. Participants are blind to the treatment conditions. Movement disorders clinician responsible for programming are blind to the study protocol. They are simply told to adjust parameter to optimize therapeutic effects.</masking_description>

    <measure>Difference in Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) task scores between treatment conditions in the on- and off- medication states</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Timed Up-and-Go task is a well-defined objective gait measurement. The task requires an individual to stand up, walk 5 m, turn, walk back, and sit down. The time taken to complete the test is strongly correlated with the level of functional mobility. This test will be videotaped and scored by two blinded neurologists.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Voice recording at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz using 16-bit quantification will be conducted in a sound-treated room using a microphone and a digital voice recorder with a mouth-to-microphone distance of 15 cm. The recorded voices will then be used for a composit acoustic analysis.</description>

    <description>To deliver unilateral STN DBS, bilateral stimulation will be turned off for three hours, and then turn on the unilateral STN DBS. The STN stimulation will be programmed as previous parameter configuration with optimal therapeutic benefits. Participants will be asked to complete a comprehensive set of assessments under unilateral STN stimulation in the off-medication state. 45 minutes after taking regular medication, participants need to complete the second set of assessments in the on-medication state.</description>
