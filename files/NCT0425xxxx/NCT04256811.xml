    <textblock>
      The aim of the present investigation was to perform the content and construct validation of&#xD;
      the diagnostic criteria for TMD (DC/TMD) Axis I, for children 7 to 11 years old. A Delphi&#xD;
      process was used to perfom the content validity of the DC/TMD Axis I. 189 7-11 years old&#xD;
      children were assessed with the adapted instrument. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was&#xD;
      used to investigate construct validity of the DC/TMD for children. A baseline one-factor&#xD;
      model was compared against a two-factor (Model 2) and a seven-factor (Model 3) models based&#xD;
      on the original DC/TMD. Root-mean-squared error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit&#xD;
      index (CFI), chi-square, change in chi-square and Cronbach's Alpha were used to analyze the&#xD;
      data. All analysis were performed in STATA© version 13.0.&#xD;

      This research was evaluated and approved by the ethics committee of Universidad CES (File 94,&#xD;
      Project Code 584). Subjects signed a written assent and their parents signed written informed&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This was a prospective study to perform the content and construct validation of the&#xD;
      DC/TMD Axis I for 7-11 year old children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population of the study was children between 7 and 11 years of age of both&#xD;
      genders, that were recruited in the specialized orofacial pain clinic at Universidad CES. The&#xD;
      sample was recruited by convenience from February to November 2017, after having ready the&#xD;
      Delphi process (June 2015-May 2016) and the adaptation of the instrument for children (June&#xD;
      2016- December 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Colombian laws and policies for research, participants were evaluated by a&#xD;
      psychologist, using a standardized instrument (CES-ERIL), to assure that their reasoning and&#xD;
      comprehension abilities, were enough to understand the questions in the instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examiner calibration to the original DC/TMD Axis I&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator who carried out the clinical assessment of participants was first calibrated&#xD;
      on the use of the original Spanish translation of the DC/TMD Axis I on adults. The&#xD;
      calibration process was performed by three members of INfORM and strictly followed the&#xD;
      protocol&#xD;
      (https://ubwp.buffalo.edu/rdc-tmdinternational/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2017/01/DCTMD-Trai&#xD;
      ning-and-Calibration-160401.pdf).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary statistic for assessing performance (i.e., case classification) was Kappa.&#xD;
      Comparisons of interest included pair-wise between the clinical examiner (Suarez N) and the&#xD;
      Reference Standard Examiner (Restrepo C, who is a calibrated member of INfORM) and an overall&#xD;
      Kappa for all examinations (Kappa=0.82).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content validity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original DC/TMD axis I9 was applied to 25 children, who were accompanied by their&#xD;
      parents. The children were different from children participating in the study. The exam was&#xD;
      performed in the presence of the children´s parents, who confirmed the answers to the&#xD;
      symptoms questionnaires. Appreciations from the examiners, children and their parents were&#xD;
      recorded, regarding the understanding of the questions in the symptoms questionnaire and the&#xD;
      language used to give instructions and ask about pain in the clinical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical information and results from the exploratory study were available to the performers&#xD;
      of the adapted DC/TMD Axis I for children, as a basis for the construction of the new&#xD;
      instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The content validity of the DC/TMD was performed through a Delphi process described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delphi process&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delphi technique was described by one of its originators as 'a method of eliciting and&#xD;
      refining group judgments' and its purpose is to find consensus of experts around a certain&#xD;
      situation or research. The Delphi method in this investigation was performed following the&#xD;
      process of a previous investigations in TMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects of the Delphi study were 3 parents of children with TMD (whose children were&#xD;
      evaluated with the original DC/TMD Axis I in the exploratory study), 2 parents of children&#xD;
      without TMD (whose children were evaluated with the original DC/TMD in the exploratory&#xD;
      study), one pediatrician expert in neurodevelopment; two psychologists, one that works with&#xD;
      children with TMD at clinics of Universidad CES and another expert in psychometrics; one&#xD;
      physical therapist, two general dental practitioners, two pediatric dentists and one&#xD;
      maxillofacial surgeon who were presently involved in TMD patient care and were associated&#xD;
      with the Pain clinic at Universidad CES. The group was called in this investigation as&#xD;
      &quot;panelists&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The panelists were invited to participate directly and personally by the investigators. By&#xD;
      email, the panelists received a detailed explanation about the study and an attached excel&#xD;
      sheet that contained the whole questions and items of the clinical examination contained in&#xD;
      the original DC/TMD Axis I as rows. In the first round of the Delphi study, panelists were&#xD;
      requested to fill in three columns with the following three questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For questions contained in the DC/TMD Axis I symptoms questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How understandable do you think this question is for children 7-11 years old on an&#xD;
           11-point rating scale from 0 &quot;completely not understandable&quot; to 10 &quot;extremely&#xD;
           understandable&quot;?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Should this question be included in an adapted DC/TMD axis I (0 - no, 1 - yes)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How confident are you with your recommendation about the inclusion of the question on a&#xD;
           11-point rating scale from 0 &quot;not confident at all&quot; to 10 &quot;extremely confident&quot;?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do you have any suggestion on the language and/or number of questions the instrument&#xD;
           should include? Why?&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the items included in the DC/TMD Axis I clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How important to you are the following items for TMD diagnoses in 7-11 year-old children&#xD;
           on an 11-point rating scale from 0 'completely unimportant' to 10 'extremely important'?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Should the item be included in a DC/TMD clinical examination (0 - no, 1 - yes)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How confident are you with your recommendation about the items to be included in the&#xD;
           adapted DC/TMD Axis I for children on a 11-point rating scale from 0 'not confident at&#xD;
           all' to 10 'extremely confident'? The panelists should fill in the requested information&#xD;
           and sent the excel file back by email. In the second round of the Delphi process,&#xD;
           panelists received medians and interquartile ranges for the &quot;understandable&quot; and&#xD;
           &quot;confidence&quot; ratings of the symptoms questionnaire (question 1 and 3) and for the&#xD;
           &quot;importance&quot; and &quot;confidence&quot; ratings of the DC/TMD Axis I clinical examination&#xD;
           (questions 1 and 3); added as extra columns in the excel sheet. For question 2, the&#xD;
           proportion of positive answers, i.e., the per cent of panelists recommending the&#xD;
           inclusion both of questions in the symptoms questionnaire and of items in the DC/TMD&#xD;
           Axis I clinical examination, was given. Provided with the findings from the first Delphi&#xD;
           round, the panelists answered again the three questions. This process asking panelists&#xD;
           to score the questions again while considering the findings from the previous round was&#xD;
           continued until a priori set criterion for consensus among the panelists was reached.&#xD;
           Criterion measure for a consensus, was set using Cronbach's alpha as a measure of&#xD;
           &quot;internal consistency of the panel&quot;. An alpha &gt;90 was used to stop the consensus&#xD;
           process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the Delphi process, an adaption of the early official Spanish translation of&#xD;
      the DC/TMD Axis I was performed in order to use the instrument in 7 to 11 years-old children.&#xD;
      All children answered the questions in spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical examination, pressure applied to the muscles and TMJ, the Palpeter® (BUTLER®.&#xD;
      Etoy, Switzerland), was used to standardize the pressure to the muscles. To determine the&#xD;
      best force to be applied to the masticatory muscles in children, different pressures were&#xD;
      tested according to previous literature in children. The pressures used in the original&#xD;
      DC/TMD Axis I were evaluated as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child answered the symptoms questionnaire and was evaluated with the clinical&#xD;
      examination form of the adapted DC/TMD Axis I fo 7-11 year-old children. All assessments were&#xD;
      obtained by the same calibrated investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construct validation&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was performed a construct validity using CFA. Factors were initially defined according to&#xD;
      the diagnosis tree of the original DC/TMD Axis I9 (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pearson correlation coefficients among the items of the DC/TMD Axis I were obtained. Three&#xD;
      fit indices were used to test the best CFA model that could represent the adapted DC/TMD Axis&#xD;
      I for children: root-mean-squared error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index&#xD;
      (CFI), chi-square, and change in chi-square, according to the change in degrees of freedom&#xD;
      between models. Good models have RMSEA values that are 0.08 or less and a CFI greater than&#xD;
      0.90 is considered to be an indicator of a good fitting model. When comparing models, a lower&#xD;
      chi-square value indicates a better fit, when an equal number of degrees of freedom is&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon the hypothetical underlying constructs for the DC/TMD Axis I, three models were&#xD;
      developed to represent the best fit for the overall data. Model 1 was a one factor model used&#xD;
      as a baseline comparison against the other models. Model 2 was a two factor model with pain&#xD;
      disorders and joint disorders treated as latent factors. For Model 3, each factor included in&#xD;
      the diagnosis tree of the original DC/TMD Axis I for adults, was treated as latent factor,&#xD;
      except for Subluxation, Disc Displacement with Reduction with Intermitent Locking and Disc&#xD;
      Displacement with Reduction with Limited Opening.&#xD;
