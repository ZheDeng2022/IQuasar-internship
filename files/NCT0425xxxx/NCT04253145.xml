      Prospective, open-label, uncontrolled and multicenter phase I-II study in SCLC patients with&#xD;
      ECOG PS 0-1 who have failed one prior platinum-containing line but no more than one&#xD;
      chemotherapy-containing line. The study will be divided into two parts: a dose-ranging phase&#xD;
      I with escalating doses of PM01183 in combination with a fixed dose of atezolizumab, followed&#xD;
      by a single-arm phase II part with expansion at the RD determined during the phase I.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I Patients will receive atezolizumab at a fixed dose of 1200 mg intravenously (i.v.)&#xD;
      followed by PM01183 at a starting dose of 2.5 mg/m2 i.v. as a 1-hour infusion on Day 1 every&#xD;
      three weeks (q3wk). PM01183 doses will be escalated in successive cohorts of patients&#xD;
      following a modified Fibonacci scheme and a classical 3+3 design, and according to observed&#xD;
      tolerance and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose for phase II studies&#xD;
      (RD) of PM01183 in combination with atezolizumab in advanced SCLC patients progressing after&#xD;
      platinum doublet chemotherapy.&#xD;
