        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women, aged 21-30 years, medically healthy upon physical examination and&#xD;
             laboratory testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent experience (last 90 days) consuming at least 4 (women) or 5 (men) standard&#xD;
             drinks in a single occasion. This ensures that customary drinking levels are not&#xD;
             exceeded during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to read and write English; willing and able to provide voluntary, written&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current significant medical conditions, such as neurological, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             endocrine, renal, liver, or thyroid pathology, including COPD and anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past or current neurological disorder or disorders affecting the brain, including but&#xD;
             not limited to multiple sclerosis, history of stroke, brain tumors, traumatic brain&#xD;
             injury with loss of consciousness, seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past or current psychiatric disorder (DSM-5 diagnosis, assessed by SCID-5), including&#xD;
             substance use disorder, and past or current psychotic symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants whose previous alcohol experience does not exceed the targeted alcohol&#xD;
             dose (4 standard drinks for women, 5 standard drinks for men, all during the same&#xD;
             occasion), for ethical purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with any significant current medical conditions that would contraindicate&#xD;
             the consumption of alcohol, such as history of neurological trauma or diseases,&#xD;
             seizures, delirium or hallucinations, hepatic, or other unstable medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use or regular use in the past 6 months of any prescription, psychoactive, or&#xD;
             herbal medications (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, ecstasy,&#xD;
             marijuana), with no current drug use confirmed by urine toxicology. No participant&#xD;
             will be asked to stop taking medication to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing, or fail to use one of the following methods of&#xD;
             birth control unless she or her partner is surgically sterile: hormone contraceptives&#xD;
             (oral, implant, injection, patch, or ring), contraceptive sponge, double barrier&#xD;
             (diaphragm or condom plus spermicide), or IUD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications to MRI, such as claustrophobia or metal in their body&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants whose participation would cause them to exceed yearly radiation limits&#xD;
             for research subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be excluded for any infection or vaccination in the previous month&#xD;
             or regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (to avoid these factors from&#xD;
             influencing the TSPO signal)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are classified as &quot;low binders&quot; for the rs6971 polymorphism (&lt;10% of&#xD;
             the population). This genetic polymorphism has a well-characterized effect on&#xD;
             [11C]PBR28 affinity for TSPO141. Homozygotes for the minor allele have negligible&#xD;
             specific binding, and are therefore excluded.&#xD;
