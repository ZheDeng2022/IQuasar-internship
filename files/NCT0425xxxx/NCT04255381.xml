  <brief_summary>

      The aim of this clinical study is to determine the feasibility, safety, and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Zone-Model Predictive Control Artificial Pancreas (ZMPC_AP) system in&#xD;
      pediatric subjects with type 1 diabetes in an ambulatory semi-supervised environment over a&#xD;
      short duration of 3 days and 2 nights, or up to 60 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The artificial pancreas platform employed under study is centered about the following four&#xD;
      key innovations: 1) A zone model predictive control strategy that is at the same time very&#xD;
      safe with respect to hypoglycemia, and can simultaneously and independently be tuned with&#xD;
      respect to its response to hyperglycemia; 2) Zone control with diurnal blood-glucose target&#xD;
      zones; 3) Models of insulin-glucose physiology and insulin on board; 4) A system for alarming&#xD;
      and notification of impending hypoglycemia and technical malfunctions: the Health Monitoring&#xD;
      System. These features have been evaluated in several clinical trials in adults with&#xD;
      unannounced meals and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will evaluate enhancements to our previous system tailored for the special&#xD;
      needs of pediatric subjects: 1) A control strategy with responses to hyperglycemia and&#xD;
      hypoglycemia spanning wide ranges, as is typical with children; 2) The use of time-dependent&#xD;
      zones specific for pediatric subjects; 3) The development of models for young children,&#xD;
      capturing the greater physiologic variability, and ensuring cautious insulin delivery; 4)&#xD;
      remote alarming and notification systems that are useful to parents.&#xD;
