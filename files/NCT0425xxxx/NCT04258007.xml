  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study hypothesizes that Sugammadex may has more appropriate recovery profile than&#xD;
      neostigmine in pediatric cardiac patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. In pediatric&#xD;
      cardiac patients, clear and rapid recovery (fast-tracking) is required to maintain&#xD;
      hemodynamic within the normal physiological values which may be saved by sugammadex&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are numerous advantages of early tracheal extubation otherwise known as fast-tracking&#xD;
      following anesthesia for congenital heart disease (CHD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early tracheal extubation not only eliminates the potential morbidity related to an&#xD;
      endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation such as atelectasis, accumulation of secretions,&#xD;
      nosocomial infections, and the potential for airway trauma, it also limits the need for&#xD;
      sedation and the antecedent adverse effects including respiratory and hemodynamic depression,&#xD;
      tolerance, withdrawal, and delirium. Most importantly, the shift from positive pressure to&#xD;
      spontaneous ventilation augments cardiovascular function and improves preload. Reversal of&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade is a fundamental aspect of emergence from general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Historically, the only option to actively reverse blockade will be to administer&#xD;
      anticholinesterase inhibitors, which are unable to reverse deep neuromuscular blockade. They&#xD;
      are also associated with a variety of cholinergic side effects, including bradycardia,&#xD;
      nausea, and increased secretions, which require concomitant administration of an&#xD;
      anticholinergic agent, with its own adverse effects. Sugammadex is a newer, selective&#xD;
      relaxant binding agent&#xD;

    <description>Mean time in minutes from start of sugammadex or neostigmine administration to recovery of T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 was assessed by applying repetitive train of four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. Nerve stimulation continued until the ratio of the magnitude of the fourth twitch (T4) to first twitch (T1) reached at least 0.9</description>
