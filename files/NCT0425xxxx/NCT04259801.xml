  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how safe, and how well tolerated, the new study&#xD;
      drug NNC0480-0389 is when it is given together with semaglutide. This will be investigated in&#xD;
      healthy participants, participants with high bodyweight and participants with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2D). NNC0480-0389 has not been given to humans before. It has been previously tested in the&#xD;
      laboratory and on animals. NNC0480-0389 will be tested at various dose levels. Semaglutide is&#xD;
      a new approved drug and is already available on the market for treatment of diabetes. It will&#xD;
      also be investigated how quickly and to what extent NNC0480-0389 and semaglutide are taken up&#xD;
      and eliminated from the body. This is called pharmacokinetics. The effect of NNC0480-0389&#xD;
      given together with semaglutide will also be investigated on body weight and glucose levels&#xD;
      in the blood. This is called pharmacodynamics. The effects of NNC0480-0389 and/or semaglutide&#xD;
      will be compared to the effects of a placebo. A placebo is a &quot;dummy&quot; medicine without any&#xD;
      active medicine. Placebo looks like NNC0480-0389 and/or semaglutide. There are 4&#xD;
      possibilities for which treatment participants will get; participants will receive&#xD;
      NNC0480-0389 and semaglutide or NNC0480-0389 and placebo or placebo with semaglutide, or&#xD;
      placebo with placebo. Participants and the responsible doctor will not know which combination&#xD;
      participants will be given. This is called a double-blinded study. However, this information&#xD;
      can be looked up during the study if it is important for participants' health. The study&#xD;
      medicines will be given as injections under the skin. Participants will be in the study for&#xD;
      about 25 weeks.&#xD;
