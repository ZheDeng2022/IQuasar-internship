      PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of VBI-S in elevating the blood pressure of septic shock patients with absolute or relative&#xD;
      hypovolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TREATMENT Sepsis is a serious condition resulting from the presence of harmful&#xD;
      microorganisms in the blood or other tissues and the body's response to their presence,&#xD;
      leading to the malfunctioning of various organs. When hypotension due to sepsis cannot be&#xD;
      reversed with the infusion of fluids the patient is in a state of septic shock. Septic shock&#xD;
      is therefore an acute medical emergency and delayed therapy can lead to organ injury. VBI-S&#xD;
      is intended to raise blood pressure in patients with septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding: This is an open label study, randomization and blinding are not&#xD;
      applicable to this study. All patients entering this study will be treated with VBI-S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Board: A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the study&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Populations: * Safety Analysis Set (SAF): all patients who have received any amount&#xD;
      of VBI-S. * Intent to treat (ITT) population: all patients who have received any amount of&#xD;
      VBI-S&#xD;
