        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the study. The subject may&#xD;

             per institutional practices, prior to enrollment and for the duration of the study&#xD;
             therapy. Patients who test positive for anti-hepatitis B core (HBc) with undetectable&#xD;
             HBV DNA (&lt;10 IU/ml) do not require anti-viral therapy prior to enrollment however&#xD;
             these subjects will be tested at every cycle to monitor HBV DNA levels and initiate&#xD;
             antiviral therapy if HBV DNA is detected (≥10 IU/ml). Subjects with chronic infection&#xD;
             by hepatitis C virus (HCV), who are untreated, are allowed on study. In addition,&#xD;
             subjects with successful HCV treatment (defined as sustained virologic response [SVR]&#xD;
             12 or SVR 24) are allowed, as long as 4 weeks have passed between completion of HCV&#xD;

             through 150 days after the last dose of study drug (male and female subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential) Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle&#xD;
             and preferred contraception for the subject.&#xD;

             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has clinically apparent ascites on physical examination. Note: only ascites detectable&#xD;

             (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., T4, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;

             consultation with the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has received locoregional therapy to liver (transarterial chemoembolization [TACE],&#xD;
             transarterial embolization [TAE], radiation, radioembolization, or ablation) or major&#xD;

             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and/or curatively resected in situ cervical&#xD;
             and/or breast cancers. Subjects with history of early-stage prostate cancer that has&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator, including&#xD;
             dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. Has received prior immunotherapy including anti-programmed death (PD) 1,&#xD;

                  Class 3 or higher congestive heart failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A cardioverter-defibrillator or pacemaker (to prevent a life-threatening&#xD;
                  arrhythmia) that is located ipsilateral to the intended deltoid injection site&#xD;
                  (unless deemed acceptable by a cardiologist).&#xD;
