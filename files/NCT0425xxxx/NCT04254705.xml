    <textblock>
      In contrary to what is seen in FRT cells, rectal organoids of patients with a R334W mutation&#xD;
      do respond to CFTR modulators ivacaftor and lumacaftor. The present study will investigate&#xD;
      the response to modulators in organoids of 30 patients with CF and a R334W mutation, to allow&#xD;
      further stratificaton for a future clinical trial assessing the clinical effect of&#xD;
      ivacaftor/tezacaftor in patients with CF and a R334W mutation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: CF is caused by mutations in the 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance&#xD;
      Regulator (CFTR)' channel that codes for the CFTR protein, an anion channel. More than 2000&#xD;
      different CFTR mutations have been described. CFTR modulator drugs treat the underlying&#xD;
      protein defect by improving folding and trafficking of nascent protein (corrector) or by&#xD;
      improving channel opening at the cell membrane (potentiator). In the European Union,&#xD;
      treatment with CFTR modulators has only been approved for patients who are homozygous for&#xD;
      F508del or carry a mutation of class III or one of a limited number of residual function&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The R334W-CFTR mutation is a rare mutation (270 subjects in the European CF Registry ECFSPR),&#xD;
      described in CFTR2 as disease causing. Clinically there is evidence for residual CFTR&#xD;
      function in these subjects since only 36% of the patients with R334W are pancreatic&#xD;
      insufficient and the mean age of all patients in the CFTR2 database is a bit older (22 years)&#xD;
      than patients with CF and 2 known disease causing mutations (20 years). On the other hand,&#xD;
      patients with R334W have on average a high sweat chloride (mean 95 mmol/L) and severe lung&#xD;
      disease; their mean FEV1 reported to the CFTR database [1] is very similar to that of other&#xD;
      patients with the F508del CF causing mutation. In the Leuven clinic we have one subject with&#xD;
      R334W/F508del who is 60 year old and has very severe lung disease (FEV1 in the low 40s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When studied in FRT (Fisher rat thyroid) cells and compared to wild type, the R334W mutation&#xD;
      is reported to give rise to normal levels of protein at the cell membrane, but very much&#xD;
      decreased function (short circuit current measurement) of 1.3% of wild type. On the other&#xD;
      hand there is very limited rescue of CFTR function after addition of the potentiator&#xD;
      ivacaftor: from 1% to 5 % of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast with expression in heterologous systems, intestinal organoids allow study of CFTR&#xD;
      function in patient specific material. When tested in intestinal organoids from the patient&#xD;
      with F508del/R334W in the Leuven clinic, this mutation resulted in some residual function&#xD;
      documented by forskolin induced swelling at higher forskolin concentrations, even before&#xD;
      addition of CFTR potentiator or corrector. However, addition of ivacaftor and to a lesser&#xD;
      degree lumacaftor results in moderate to good rescue of function; the degree of rescue (FIS&#xD;
      result) is intermediate between that seen in F508del homozygous subjects and class III&#xD;
      mutation subjects. Comparable results are obtained in prof M Amaral's lab in 3 subjects&#xD;
      compound heterozygous for F508del/R334W (results in nasal cells, and intestinal organoids). A&#xD;
      CFTR functional rescue in organoids from a subject with the R334W/R746X is also reported by&#xD;
      the Dutch Utrecht group in organoids; the forskolin induced swelling induced by luma/iva was&#xD;
      again between the response seen with iva in organoids from subjects with gating mutations and&#xD;
      by luma/iva in organoids derived from F508del homozygous subjects. These findings suggest&#xD;
      that R334W might be a suitable candidate for TEZ/IVA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study described in this protocol will be the first step of a larger project that also&#xD;
      includes a clinical trial. With the present study, the response of organoids of patients with&#xD;
      mutation R334W to available&#xD;
&#xD;
      CFTR-modulators will be tested to identify the in vitro response. An interventional clinical&#xD;
      trial, submitted as a separate protocol, will subsequently assess the response to modulators&#xD;
      in vivo in the same patients. The clinical trial is thus not part of this protocol.&#xD;
