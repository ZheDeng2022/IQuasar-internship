      Calciﬁc tendinitis of the rotator cuff is one of the most common causes of shoulder pain.&#xD;
      Ultrasound guided percutaneous lavage (UGPL or barbotage or irrigation) of calcific&#xD;
      tendinopathy is indicated when conservative treatments (physiotherapy, nonsteroidal&#xD;

      injection of STS could fasten the dissolution of the calcific deposit. In view of the short&#xD;
      half-life of this molecule the investigators hypothesize that this would happen within the&#xD;
      first month after the procedure. Therefore, the investigatorschose to assess our primary&#xD;
      objective at 1 month. Few studies have evaluated the short-term radiographic evolution after&#xD;
      lavage.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Calciﬁc tendinitis of the rotator cuff is one of the most common causes of shoulder pain. It&#xD;
      is characterized by calcium phosphate crystal deposition in the rotator cuff. Its&#xD;
      pathogenesis and etiology remains unclear and the mechanisms leading to this pathological&#xD;
      mineralization are still largely unknown. This disorder can lead to a chronic pain during&#xD;
      daily or professional activities and to a restriction of range of motion. During the disease,&#xD;
      spontaneous resorption can occur with migration of apatite crystals into the subacromial&#xD;
      bursa causing severe pain and restriction of movement. Factors associated with the&#xD;
      development of symptoms are still unclear although the size and presence of a bursitis on&#xD;
      imaging have been shown to be associated with pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound guided percutaneous lavage (UGPL or barbotage or irrigation) of calcific&#xD;
      tendinopathy is indicated when conservative treatments (physiotherapy, nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs) have failed. At this stage, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT)&#xD;
      or subacromial corticosteroid injection can also be discussed. However, a recent network&#xD;
      meta-analysis has shown that UGPL could be the treatment of choice compared to the other&#xD;
      nonsurgical options such as ESWT or SAI. Arthroscopic removal of the calcific deposit is&#xD;
      considered as a second line therapy after failure of UGPL or EWST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of UGPL depends on the type of calcification. Calcific deposits can be&#xD;
      differentiated in hard calcifications, usually dense on X-Ray with an acoustic shadow on US,&#xD;
      and soft calcifications, with more heterogeneous or faint contours without acoustic&#xD;
      shadowing. Some studies observed failure only in patients presenting with a dense and&#xD;
      homogeneous calcification type A according to the Molé Classification and also showed that&#xD;
      outcome after needling and/or ESWT will be worse in case of dense calcifications, with only&#xD;
      30% of success compared to 61% in patients with soft calcification. These failures are most&#xD;
      of the time explained by the persistence of the calcific deposit. In line with this, was&#xD;
      found a positive correlation between the decrease of the size of the calcification and the&#xD;
      pain score over time; as the calcification became smaller, the pain became less intense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several approaches are currently used to facilitate the extraction of the calcification. It&#xD;
      has been shown that lavage with warm saline heated at 42°C reduced the procedure duration and&#xD;
      improved calcification dissolution. Another randomized controlled study recently reported&#xD;
      that lavage with a 2 needle approach also shortened the procedure in hard calcification.&#xD;
      However, none of these studies showed an impact on the rate of calcification elimination.&#xD;
      Other strategies are therefore needed to treat hard calcification of the rotator cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium thiosulfate (STS) (Na2S2O3) is primarily used to prevent and treat cyanide poisoning.&#xD;
      Intravenous STS is also used off-label to treat calciphylaxis leading to a significant&#xD;
      decrease of soft-tissue and vascular calcifications. However, its systemic use may be limited&#xD;
      by adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal upset, metabolic acidosis, and sodium overload.&#xD;
      Thus, alternative local approaches have been developed. Recent reports have shown the&#xD;
      interest of topical STS in the treatment of calciphylaxis, tumoral calcinosis associated with&#xD;
      connective tissue disease, pseudohypoparathyroidism or hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral&#xD;
      calcinosis. For instance, a daily application of topical STS on the calcific lesions of&#xD;
      patients with hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis led to their decrease after 5&#xD;
      months of treatment. Topical application of STS has also showed an anti-inflammatory effect&#xD;
      in patients with calcinosis cutis secondary to connective tissue disease and radiodermatitis.&#xD;
      Because deeper calcific deposits are unlikely to be reached by topical therapeutic agents,&#xD;
      some authors performed intralesional STS injections in patients with localized cutaneous&#xD;
      calciphylaxis. They observed a complete healing of ulcers and remission of disease with only&#xD;
      transient localized discomfort during injection. Despite these promising results, the exact&#xD;
      mechanisms by which STS is able to dissolve ectopic calcifications remain still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently one study showed that STS was well tolerated with no side effect occurring during&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided percutaneous lavage of calcific tendinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These preliminary results prompted us to study the interest of STS in the treatment of&#xD;
      calcific tendinitis. As dense calcifications are associated with higher risk of failure of&#xD;
      UGPL, the investigators will select patients to perform a lavage followed by an intralesional&#xD;
      injection of STS. The objective of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of sodium&#xD;
      thiosulfate lavage in the treatment of shoulder pain in calcific tendinitis. the&#xD;
      investigators will also assess its effect on clinical symptoms and radiographic evolution of&#xD;
      the calcific deposit and hypothesize that sodium thiosulfate would be well-tolerated and&#xD;
      fastened the elimination of the calcific deposit in patients with dense calcifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS The current study is a prospective, monocentric, phase II, single group, open label&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The investigators will include patients referred to the rheumatology&#xD;
      department for the treatment of a shoulder pain calcific tendinitis. Inclusion criteria are&#xD;
      the following: age over 18 years old; pain for more than 3 months; worsening of symptoms with&#xD;
      activities above shoulder level; minimum one the 3 following impingement positive clinical&#xD;
      tests (Yocum, Hawkins, Neer); calcification &gt; 5 mm in size on the standard anteroposterior&#xD;
      (AP) radiographs. Only type A calcification according the Molé Classification will be&#xD;
      included. The exclusion criteria will be: allergy to sodium metabisulfite, asthma, chronic&#xD;
      renal disease (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min), Type B or C calcification according the Molé&#xD;
      Classification, other shoulder disease (glenohumeral or acromioclavicular osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      rotator cuff tear, rheumatoid arthritis); previous percutaneous irrigation of the same&#xD;
      calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline clinical, radiological and ultrasonographic evaluation The investigators will&#xD;
      recorde the main demographic characteristics: medical history, occupation, dominant hand,&#xD;
      presence of nocturnal pain, and day off-work because of the shoulder pain. VAS pain at rest&#xD;
      and during activities, shoulder range of motion, DASH score, and EQ5D quality of life VAS&#xD;
      score will also be recorded. X-Ray of the affected shoulder will be performed&#xD;
      (anteroposterior view in neutral, internal and external rotation and lateral scapula view).&#xD;
      Calcifications types will be classified according to Molé at al (A: dense, well defined and&#xD;
      circumscribed; B: dense, well-defined and segmented; C: transparent and nonhomogeneous).&#xD;
      Surface of the calcification will be measured on the view where the calcification appears the&#xD;
      largest. The same view will be used for all measurements during follow-up. Density of the&#xD;
      deposit will be evaluated on the same view. All the measurements will be made by an&#xD;
      experienced rheumatologist (with 35 years' experience in clinical radiologic evaluation)&#xD;
      blinded from the clinical status (ABV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      US evaluation of the affected shoulder will be performed using a GE LogiS8 using a 6-15 MHz&#xD;
      linear probe. The investigators will be recorded the maximum size of the calcic deposit in&#xD;
      axial and longitudinal view. Calcific shoulder plaques will be classified into 4 types based&#xD;
      on their morphology, as previously described. Arc-shaped (an echogenic arc .with clear&#xD;
      shadowing); 2. Fragmented or punctate (at least 2 separated echogenic spots or plaques) with&#xD;
      shadowing); 3. Fragmented or punctate without shadowing; 4. Nodular (an echogenic nodule&#xD;
      without shadowing). Presence of a bursitis (&gt;2 mm thickening of the SAB) and power Doppler&#xD;
      signal in and around the calcification will be recorded. For power Doppler imaging, the pulse&#xD;
      repetition frequency will be set at 2.4 cm/s and the color gain at the most sensitive level&#xD;
      before the appearance of noise. The color flow signal intensity will be graded on a scale of&#xD;
      0 to 3, where 0 represents no signal, 1 = mild (weak, spot-like color flow signal), 2 =&#xD;
      moderate (a few rod-like color flow signals), and 3 = severe (multiple rod-like or linear&#xD;
      color flow signals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention All patients will be undergoing a baseline clinical, X-Ray and US evaluation by&#xD;
      rheumatologists with 11 years and 5 years' experience in US and US-guided interventions.&#xD;
      Patients will be with a US-guided single needle technic. After sterile preparation, local&#xD;
      anesthesia will be performed under US guidance. A total of 10 mL of lidocaine 1% will be&#xD;
      injected in the subcutaneous tissues, the subacromial bursa and over the surface of the&#xD;
      calcific deposit. A 21 G pediatric spinal needle will be used for the procedure to prevent&#xD;
      needle clogging by calcific debris. Indeed, introduction of the needle with the stylet&#xD;
      prevents the needle to be clogged. Once the needle tip will be inside the calcification, the&#xD;
      stylet will be removed, and the lavage could start. When backflow of calcific material could&#xD;
      be identified in the syringe, lavage of the deposit will be performed using sodium&#xD;
      thiosulfate 25 %: a volume of 1 mL of sodium thiosulfate will be prepared in a syringe and&#xD;
      successive propulsion and aspiration will be performed. The procedure will be repeated until&#xD;
      the backflow becomes clear. At the end of the procedure 1 mL (250 mg) of thiosulfate will be&#xD;
      injected inside the calcific deposit. Finally, 1.5 mL of methylprednisolone will be injected&#xD;
      in the SAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-Ray of the shoulder will be performed just after the procedure. Patients will be treated&#xD;
      with diclofenac (75 mg LP twice daily) and paracetamol (1000 mg, 4 times a day) for 48 hours&#xD;
      then only if needed. Routine use of the shoulder will be allowed without restrictions and all&#xD;
      patients had one week off-work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up All patients will have follow-up visits at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after&#xD;
      intervention. At each time point, VAS pain at rest and during activities, shoulder range of&#xD;
      motion, and DASH score will be recorded. EQ5D quality of life VAS score will be also&#xD;
      recorded. X-Ray of the affected shoulder will be performed at each time point and evaluated&#xD;
      as previously described. Care will be taken to use the exact same settings (mAs;kV) to allow&#xD;
      a proper comparison of the calcific deposit between each evaluation. The evolution of the&#xD;
      calcific deposit will be evaluated using a semi-quantitative score as followed: 0: no change&#xD;
      or minimal changes; 1: decrease size of the calcification less than 50%; 2: decrease of the&#xD;
      calcification between 50 and 90%; 3: more than 90% decrease size or disappearance of the&#xD;
      calcification. Surface of the calcification will be measured on the same view than at&#xD;
      baseline. US of the affected shoulder will be performed as previously described.&#xD;
