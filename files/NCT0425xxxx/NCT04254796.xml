  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective will be to study changes in putamen structural connectivity in healthy&#xD;
      teens with meditation training. Hypothesis: Putamen structural node strength will increase in&#xD;
      the training group compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      R61 Go/No-Go Criteria. Detect an effect size (a threshold of Cohen's d &gt; 0.20) in changes of&#xD;
      the primary mechanistic outcome (Putamen structural node strength) by the described&#xD;
      meditation training in 100 healthy adolescents that are 14-18 years old and retain at least&#xD;
      80% of randomized participants for primary outcome measurement at the end of the study&#xD;
      regardless of adherence to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective will be to study changes in emotional problems in healthy teens with&#xD;
      meditation training. Hypothesis: There will be a significant decrease in emotional problems&#xD;
      measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in the training group&#xD;
      compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Outcomes: The current research study design will utilize an individually&#xD;
      randomized group treatment, open-label, waitlist-controlled clinical trial to test the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the investigator's innovative mindfulness meditation intervention&#xD;
      (Training for Awareness Resilience and Action [TARA]) on the primary outcome (Putamen&#xD;
      structural node strength) and secondary outcome (emotional problems measured with the&#xD;
      Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ]) in healthy adolescents between the ages of 14&#xD;
      to 18 years old.&#xD;
