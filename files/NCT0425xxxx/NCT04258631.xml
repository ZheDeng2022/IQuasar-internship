  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV trial studies how well liposomal bupivacaine with or without hydromorphone&#xD;
      works in improving pain control during the first 24 hours after surgery in patients with&#xD;
      gynecological malignancies undergoing laparotomy. Liposomal bupivacaine is routinely&#xD;
      infiltrated into the skin surrounding the abdominal incision, and is effective in providing&#xD;
      good relief of incisional pain. Hydromorphone is also a type of pain medication that may&#xD;
      provide better management of deep abdominal pain. It is not yet known if giving liposomal&#xD;
      bupivacaine with or without hydromorphone will work better in improving pain in patients with&#xD;
      gynecological malignancies during the first 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate if no additional intervention is noninferior to intrathecal analgesia (ITA) for&#xD;
      postoperative pain experience 24 hours after surgery after laparotomy for gynecological&#xD;
      malignancy within an established enhanced recovery pathway which includes incisional&#xD;
      liposomal bupivacaine (ILB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the effect of intrathecal analgesia on patient satisfaction with postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia after laparotomy for gynecological malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Report the impact of ITA use on cost. IV. Validate the Quality of Recovery (QOR)-15 in&#xD;
      our population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo standard of care laparotomy and then receive liposomal bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care laparotomy and then receive liposomal bupivacaine&#xD;
      and hydromorphone intrathecally (IT).&#xD;

    <measure>Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score (OBAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The mean OBAS score between the two groups will be presented along with the upper limit of the 95% confidence bound for the mean difference. Will conclude non-inferiority if this upper limit is less than the predefined limit for noninferiority. Multivariable regression models will be fit to assess for differences in outcomes if there are unbalanced baseline covariates in the two treatment arms. Each of 7 questions are scored on a scale of 0 - 4 with a lower total score reflecting a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Will be measured in morphine metabolic equivalents. Data will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics by reporting mean (standard deviation [SD]) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous variables and frequency and percentages for categorical variables. Continuous variables will be compared between the two treatment arms using the two-sample t-test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. Categorical variables will be compared between the two treatment arms using the chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test.</description>

Continuous variables will be compared between the two treatment arms using the two-sample t-test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. Categorical variables will be compared between the two treatment arms using the chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test. Postoperative pain is scored on a scale of 0 - 10, with the lower score showing a better outcome.</description>
