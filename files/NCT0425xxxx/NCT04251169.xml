    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multicenter phase II study evaluating treatment with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      non-luminal Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative (hereafter referred to as HR+/HER2-)&#xD;
      breast cancer who had recurrence or progression while receiving previous therapy with a CDK&#xD;
      inhibitor in the adjuvant setting or to treat advanced disease (or both).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will utilize a 2-stage, single arm, Simon's 2-stage design1 with one (efficacy)&#xD;
      interim and a final analysis. The interim analysis will be conducted when 15 patients are&#xD;
      evaluable for Overall Response Rate (ORR) as determined locally by the investigator through&#xD;
      the use of RECIST v.1.1. If 5 or fewer responses are observed in up to 15 patients of&#xD;
      evaluable population (EP), the trial will be terminated in favor of the null for futility.&#xD;
      Otherwise, up to a further 31 patients may be evaluated,for a maximum total of 46 evaluable&#xD;
      patients. If a total of 19 or more responses are seen at the end of the second stage, then&#xD;
      the null will have been rejected in favor of the alternative; and further investigation of&#xD;
      the combination is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will not be halted during the interim analysis period. Therefore, no interruption&#xD;
      in the accrual will be done during the interim analysis in order to maintain the dynamic of&#xD;
      accrual in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirmation of all eligibility criteria, eligible patients will receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
      200 mg every 3 weeks (on D1 of each 21-day cycle, beginning in Cycle 1) in combination with&#xD;
      paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administered at days 1, 8, 15 of each 21-day cycle beginning at cycle 2.&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, 24 months from the date of the first dose of pembrolizumab or end of&#xD;
      study, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for survival from screening until the last patient recruited&#xD;
      has been followed for 12 months, has progressed or has died, whichever occurs first. The&#xD;
      patient will be followed for survival approximately every 3 months (± 21 days) until death,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or study termination by the sponsor. In addition,&#xD;
      information regarding use of subsequent anti-cancer agents for metastatic HR+/HER2- during&#xD;
      the survival follow-up period will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 and&#xD;
      Immune-Related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (iRECIST) will be performed every&#xD;
      9 weeks (63 days ± 5 days) until disease progression, treatment discontinuation, the start of&#xD;
      new anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or the end of the study, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. Tumor assessments will be performed on the specified schedule regardless of&#xD;
      treatment delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include the incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      and laboratory abnormalities graded per the NCI CTCAE v.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory safety assessments will include the regular monitoring of hematology, blood&#xD;
      chemistry and pregnancy test&#xD;

    <description>To identify new biomarkers of response to the combination treatment, we aim to further evaluate the expression of 752 genes that encompass important genomic signatures and individual genes. The Breast Cancer 360 Panel includes 752 genes that cover established breast cancer diagnostic and research signatures as well as key pathways at the interface of the tumor, tumor microenvironment and immune response. Special attention will be given to innate immune response genes as well as markers of antigen presentation, which are expected to be determinant for this combination treatment. The following genes/signatures will be evaluated among others: PAM50 genes and signatures, risk of recurrence (ROR) score, ER signaling biology, immune cell marker, chemo-endocrine score (CES), immune infiltration or proliferation</description>

             procedures to NCI CTCAE version 5.0 Grade ≤ 1 (except alopecia or other toxicities not&#xD;
             considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator´s discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Placement of central venous access catheter(s) (e.g., port or similar) is not&#xD;
             considered a major surgical procedure and is therefore permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;

         12. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
