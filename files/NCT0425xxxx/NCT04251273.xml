    <textblock>
      This research study, conducted by Truth Initiative, will help us learn how text messaging can&#xD;
      help young adults between 18 and 24 years of age quit vaping.&#xD;

      The Quit Vaping Study (QVS)'s primary aim is to conduct a fully powered comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a quit vaping text message program in&#xD;
      promoting abstinence from e-cigarettes among young users aged 18-24. This study is a 2-arm&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial conducted among young users aged 18-24 recruited through online&#xD;
      channels. Participants will be randomized to a quit vaping text message intervention or to an&#xD;
      assessment-only control condition and followed for 7 months to roughly correspond to 6-months&#xD;
      post-treatment. The secondary aim is to examine potential mediators of program effectiveness,&#xD;
      including treatment engagement and changes in self-efficacy and perceived social support for&#xD;
      quitting.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be enrolled to receive messages from This is Quitting.&#xD;
Users receive one age-appropriate message per day tailored to their enrollment date or quit date, which can be set and reset via text message. Those not ready to quit receive 4 weeks of messages focused on building skills and confidence. Users who set a quit date receive messages for a week preceding it and 8 weeks afterward that include encouragement and support, skill- and self-efficacy building exercises, coping strategies, and information about the risks of vaping, benefits of quitting, and cutting down to quit. Keywords COPE, STRESS, SLIP, and MORE provide on-demand support.</description>
