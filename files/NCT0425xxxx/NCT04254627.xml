    <textblock>
      Gulf War Illness is a condition that affects multiple major organ systems, resulting in a&#xD;
      diverse array of symptoms that include debilitating fatigue, memory and cognition&#xD;
      difficulties, headaches, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal problems, skin rashes, and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal/joint pain. This phase I single-site, open-label two-arm study will assess&#xD;
      the safety and mechanistic efficacy of a sequential etanercept-mifepristone intervention for&#xD;
      Gulf War Illness. The results of this phase I study will be compared to those from an&#xD;
      existing short-duration study to identify the optimal duration and dosage for use in a future&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a study in male Veterans 45-70 years of age who meet the modified Kansas and Centers&#xD;
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for GWI (Gulf War Illness) and have high&#xD;
      physiologic stress. This phase I single-site, open-label, two-arm study will focus on&#xD;
      optimizing the dosage of a sequential etanercept-mifepristone intervention for GWI. Twenty&#xD;
      participants will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 13, 16 and 24 weeks. The investigators will&#xD;
      use systems biology methods to perform computational modelling of physiological responses to&#xD;
      supervised maximal exercise challenge studies on a fitness bicycle at baseline and 24 weeks.&#xD;
      These analyses will assess the impact of the treatment on homeostatic networks: the changes&#xD;
      in levels of physiological parameters and the changes in inter-correlations among the&#xD;
      measured parameters (e.g., cytokines), cross-sectionally and over time. Participants will&#xD;
      also undergo subjective assessments of functional health, symptom severity, pain, fatigue,&#xD;
      and cognition at baseline, 6, 12, 13, 16, and 24 weeks. Participants will be observed through&#xD;
      the treatment period and for 3 months after completion to assess immediate effects and&#xD;
      durability of the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this phase I study will be compared to those from an existing short-duration&#xD;
      study to identify the optimal duration and dosage for use in a future phase II study.&#xD;

    <measure>Mechanistic effects on biomarker relationships</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mechanistic effects on biomarker network dynamics are measured by the change in median summary score for network-level distance between the Gulf War Illness biomarker profile at rest and model-predicted stable (healthy) states. These summary scores have a minimum value of zero and reflect the overall difference between the multidimensional relationships of the immune, autonomic, and neuroendocrine systems of ill participants at rest, relative to predicted values for stable (healthy) states. The analysis will be completed using the results of physical measures and biomarker assays performed on blood draws taken at rest prior to exercise challenges at baseline and 16 weeks. These include a Gulf War Illness-specific nanostring gene expression platform, an 18-multiplex cytokine assay, flow cytometry, neuropeptide, sex and stress hormone panels, and physical autonomic measures. Decreases in summary scores between baseline and 24 weeks indicate a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Homeostatic network correction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of correction of the homeostatic network toward normal is measured by the median summary score for network-level differences in connectivity of biomarker networks at multiple times during dynamic exercise challenges. These summary scores have a minimum value of zero and reflect overall changes within the immune, autonomic, and neuroendocrine systems during exercise, relative to predicted values for stable (healthy) states. The analysis will use the results of physical measures and blood draws taken before, during, and after exercise challenges at baseline and 24 weeks. The biomarker assays and physical measures include a Gulf War Illness-specific nanostring gene expression platform, an 18-multiplex cytokine assay, flow cytometry, neuropeptide, sex and stress hormone panels, and physical autonomic measures at multiple times during each exercise challenge and 24 hours afterward. Decreases in summary scores between baseline and 16 weeks indicate a better outcome.</description>
