  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoids are widely prescribed in the treatment of many inflammatory, autoimmune or&#xD;
      allergic diseases, but also in transplant patients or patients with malignant hematological&#xD;
      diseases (leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma, etc.). They have many side effects, including effects&#xD;
      on carbohydrate metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids are diabetogenic because they disrupt pancreatic insulin secretion and&#xD;
      decrease the insulin sensitivity of target tissues (liver, muscle, adipose tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of glucocorticoids may lead to the development of corticosteroid-induced diabetes in&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroid-induced diabetes is frequently found in clinical practice. Incidence figures&#xD;
      for corticosteroid-induced diabetes vary widely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case-control studies show odds ratios of corticosteroid-induced diabetes onset ranging from&#xD;
      1.36 and 2.23. In two of these studies, the diagnostic criterion was the prescription of a&#xD;
      hypoglycemic treatment. Smaller studies, retrospective or prospective, show incidence rates&#xD;
      of corticosteroid-induced diabetes ranging from 8.8 to 52%. This difference in incidence&#xD;
      rates is explained by the different glucocorticoid doses, glucocorticoid durations,&#xD;
      conditions requiring glucocorticoid therapy, and diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      corticosteroid-induced diabetes that vary from study to study. In kidney transplantation,&#xD;
      diabetes concerns 16% of patients before the age of 40, and up to 52% after the age of 50.&#xD;
      The diagnostic criteria used in the literature are often fasting and post prandial glycemia.&#xD;
      The differences in incidence rates found with these two diagnostic methods can be explained&#xD;
      by the pharmacokinetics of glucocorticoids. The main glucocorticoids prescribed have a&#xD;
      duration of action of 12 to 16 hours. As they are generally prescribed in the morning as a&#xD;
      single daily dose, fasting morning blood glucose levels are often normal while postprandial&#xD;
      blood glucose levels are increased. This observation has been presented in 2 studies.&#xD;
      However, the 2 diagnostic criteria were not statistically compared in these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While according to the American Diabetes Association, the 3 criteria used to diagnose&#xD;
      diabetes are fasting glycemia, glycemia 2 hours after an oral glucose load of 75 g and&#xD;
      glycated hemoglobin, these last 2 diagnostic criteria are, to the investigator's knowledge,&#xD;
      not used in the scientific literature to screen for corticosteroid-induced diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In current practice, the diagnostic criteria used are disparate. To date, there are no&#xD;
      studies that have determined which diagnostic criterion is the most effective in screening&#xD;
      for corticosteroid-induced diabetes. The current recommendations recommend early diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment in order to achieve satisfactory glycemic control as quickly as possible. These&#xD;
      recommendations have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of degenerative&#xD;
      complications of diabetes, but it is important to screen for corticosteroid-induced diabetes&#xD;
      with the most relevant diagnostic criterion in order to optimise its management.&#xD;
