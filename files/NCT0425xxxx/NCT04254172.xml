  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this low interventional study is to collect data on everyday movement in boys&#xD;
      with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) using wearable activity sensors. The activity sensors&#xD;
      could provide useful information beyond what is currently collected by functional (movement,&#xD;
      strength) assessments in clinic. This information can help with the understanding of the&#xD;
      impact of DMD, and perhaps with how possible treatments can affect this impact.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    This low-interventional study (involving no study drug) has been terminated early due to the&#xD;
    COVID-19 pandemic, and not for any safety or efficacy reasons.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy confirmed by medical history and genetic&#xD;
             testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight between 15 and 50 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of glucocorticoids for 6 months and a stable daily dose for at least 3 months&#xD;
             prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to rise from floor within seven (7) seconds and ability to walk&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current exposure to systemic immunosuppressant agents other than glucocorticoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to any gene therapy agent, including exon-skipping and missense agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to other investigational drugs within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is&#xD;
             longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any injury which may impact functional testing per investigator's judgement. Previous&#xD;
             injuries must be fully healed prior to consenting. Prior lower limb fractures must be&#xD;
             fully healed and at least 3 months from injury date at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any planned surgeries which may impact physical activity and performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence or history of musculoskeletal or neurological disease in addition to DMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known allergies or skin reactions to stainless steel, versaflex, and silicon that&#xD;
             may cause possible discomfort by wearable sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, cancer, autoimmune or allergic&#xD;
             disease that may interfere with the study conduct as per investigator's judgment,&#xD;
             excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and&#xD;
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or&#xD;
             participants who are Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly&#xD;
             involved in the conduct of the study.&#xD;
