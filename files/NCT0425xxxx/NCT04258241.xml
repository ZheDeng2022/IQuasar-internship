    <textblock>
      This prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled study evaluates the effects of&#xD;
      peripheral nerve blocks with and without local infiltration analgesia for postoperative pain&#xD;
      management after primary total knee arthroplasty. There are no any studies that show the&#xD;
      demand for local infiltration analgesia when together peripheral nerve blocks are performed.&#xD;
      Patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      local infiltration analgesia with or without (placebo group) local anesthetic. All patients&#xD;
      will receive peripheral nerve blocks for postoperative analgesia: femoral triangle and distal&#xD;
      adductor canal blocks. Comparison of these two groups of patients will be based on the&#xD;
      effects on postoperative pain control, the extent of motor blockade, the ability of early leg&#xD;
      motion and ambulation, patients satisfaction rates over the time of clinical recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the investigators hypothesized that peripheral nerve blocks (femoral triangle&#xD;
      and distal adductor canal blocks) with and without local infiltration analgesia provide&#xD;
      similar postoperative pain relieving effects and the ability of early mobilization after&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim: to evaluate peripheral nerve blocks with and without local infiltration analgesia&#xD;
      regarding the postoperative analgesic efficacy, the ability of early motion and ambulation in&#xD;
      patients following primary total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: peripheral nerve blocks with (LIA+) and without (LIA-) local infiltration&#xD;
      analgesia provide similar postoperative pain relieving effects after primary total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Effects: peripheral nerve blocks with (LIA+) and without (LIA-) local infiltration&#xD;
      analgesia provide similar ability to recover after primary total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare postoperative pain control effects between LIA+ and LIA- groups of patients&#xD;
           after primary total knee joint replacement surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the ability of early motion and ambulation after total knee joint replacement&#xD;
           surgery between the LIA+ and LIA- groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate opioid consumption and its adverse effects in LIA+ and LIA- groups of&#xD;
           patients after primary total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the patient's postoperative satisfaction rates in LIA+ and LIA- groups of&#xD;
           patients after primary total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective, double-blinded study includes American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)&#xD;
      I-III patients, aged 18-90 years, admitted for primary total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
      Preoperatively patients will be blindly randomized into one of two groups: LIA+ (peripheral&#xD;
      nerve blocks with local infiltration analgesia) and LIA- (placebo group, peripheral nerve&#xD;
      blocks without local infiltration analgesia). Group assignment will be concealed by opaque&#xD;
      envelopes that will be opened only after enrollment. The anesthesiologist performing the&#xD;
      block will be aware of the treatment, but the participant and outcomes assessor will be&#xD;
      blinded to group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist will perform peripheral nerve blocks under the guidance of a linear&#xD;
      ultrasound transducer probe. The femoral triangle and distal adductor canal blocks will be&#xD;
      performed. The femoral triangle block will be performed at the level where the medial border&#xD;
      of the sartorius muscle intersects the medial border of the adductor longus muscle with an&#xD;
      injection of 10 ml of 0.125% bupivacaine. A local anesthetic will be injected laterally to&#xD;
      the femoral artery. The distal adductor canal block will be performed at the level where the&#xD;
      femoral vessels (artery and vein) dive deeper from the sartorius muscle with an injection of&#xD;
      10 ml of 0.125% bupivacaine. A local anesthetic will be injected under the femoral artery.&#xD;
      The orthopedic surgeon will perform local infiltration analgesia with 150 mg of bupivacaine,&#xD;
      0.3 mg of epinephrine and 90 ml of normal saline in LIA+ group and with 0.3 mg of epinephrine&#xD;
      together with 120 ml of normal saline in LIA- group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the perioperative period, all patients from both groups will receive a standardized&#xD;
      anesthetic and analgesic. Premedication of midazolam 2.5-5 mg and dexamethasone 4 mg will be&#xD;
      given to all patients and a slow fluid infusion of crystalloids with 1 g of tranexamic acid&#xD;
      and 10 mg of ketamine started once an intravenous cannula will be placed. Spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      after identification of the subarachnoid space will be performed with 15 mg of&#xD;
      levobupivacaine. After that, peripheral nerve blocks will be performed under the ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance. Patients will be sedated with intravenously administered propofol during the&#xD;
      surgery. At the end of the operation, local infiltration with or without bupivacaine&#xD;
      (depending on the group of patients) will be performed. After the surgery, patients will be&#xD;
      transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the postoperative period for analgesia NSAIDs will be available to both groups of&#xD;
      patients. NSAIDs such as dexketoprofen 50 mg, acetaminophen 1 g - 3 times per day and&#xD;
      dexketoprofen/tramadol 25/75 mg will be administered after the surgery. Opioids will also be&#xD;
      available to patients as intramuscular boluses of pethidine 50 mg or morphine 10 mg without&#xD;
      restriction and administered for moderate or severe pain (VAS pain score of 5 or greater out&#xD;
      of 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative pain control efficacy will be assessed at 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours after the&#xD;
      surgery using the visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 (0 - no pain, 10 - worst&#xD;
      imaginable pain) at rest, during active and passive 45-degree knee flexion. All the&#xD;
      requirements of additional analgesics and their adverse effects will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extent of motor blockade and the ability of early motion will be evaluated at 3, 6, 24,&#xD;
      48 hours after the surgery. Patients will be asked to flex the foot, flex the knee and to&#xD;
      lift the straight leg. The possible motion at 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively will be&#xD;
      assessed with the Bromage scale grades: Grade I - free movement of legs and feet; Grade II -&#xD;
      just able to flex knees with free movement of feet; Grade III - unable to flex knees, but&#xD;
      with free movement of feet; Grade IV - unable to move legs or feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients ability of early ambulation will be evaluated using the Timed Up and Go (TUG)&#xD;
      test at 24 and 48 hours after the surgery. To do the TUG test, patients will have to sit down&#xD;
      on the bed, get up from the bed, walk 3 meters forward, turn, walk back 3 meters to the bed&#xD;
      and sit down. The time taken by a patient to perform this test will be calculated with a&#xD;
      chronometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the conversation with each patient and assessment of the postoperative pain control&#xD;
      efficacy, the ability of early postoperative motion and ambulation, the rate of patient&#xD;
      satisfaction will be evaluated using a 10 point scale from 0 (completely unsatisfied) to 10&#xD;
      (totally satisfied) at 3, 6, 24, 48 hours after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the study protocol, both groups of patients will be compared in terms of&#xD;
      postoperative pain control, opioid consumption, early motion and ambulation ability, the&#xD;
      incidence of complications (if any), and patients satisfaction rates over time of clinical&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
