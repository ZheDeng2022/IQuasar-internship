      Neuropathic pain is a common complaint in those with spinal cord injury (SCI) that has a&#xD;
      significant negative effect on quality of life. Efficacy of various treatments, however,&#xD;
      remains controversial. There is evidence to support that gabapentin and pregabalin have some&#xD;
      benefit in reducing neuropathic pain. Gabapentin is effective in the management of symptoms&#xD;
      and concerns related to SCI including motor recovery, spasticity, and mood among others. This&#xD;
      makes gabapentin an important pharmacologic intervention, which compels providers to define&#xD;
      treatment guidelines related to its use. One aspect of which should relate to the timing of&#xD;
      initiation of therapy. The goal of this study is to determine whether timing of initiation of&#xD;
      treatment with gabapentin will decrease prevalence and intensity of neuropathic pain.&#xD;

      Neuropathic pain is a common complaint in those with spinal cord injury (SCI) that has a&#xD;
      significant negative effect on quality of life. This makes the treatment of neuropathic pain&#xD;
      a priority in the SCI population. Efficacy of various treatments, however, remains&#xD;
      controversial. There is evidence to support that gabapentin and pregabalin have some benefit&#xD;
      in reducing neuropathic pain. Other positive effects of gabapentin on those with SCI have&#xD;
      also been demonstrated. However, there has not been a study on the influence of timing of&#xD;
      initiation of gabapentin on the efficacy of using it to treat neuropathic pain in the SCI&#xD;
      population. Such a finding could change the standard of care in treatment of acute SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pooled prevalence of neuropathic pain post spinal cord injury is 53%. Not only common,&#xD;
      neuropathic pain is pervasive, affecting aspects of patients' lives including sleep, physical&#xD;
      function, and mood that in turn impact their activities- work and recreational alike. Thus,&#xD;
      neuropathic pain management contributes to quality of life for a majority of people with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a high priority, the treatment of neuropathic pain in SCI remains notoriously&#xD;
      difficult. Treatments options may be divided into pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic.&#xD;
      Pharmacologic agents studied include amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin, opiates,&#xD;
      lidocaine, ketamine, valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam and carbamazepine; the most&#xD;
      studied of which are amitriptyline, gabapentin, and pregabalin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gabapentin's potential is not limited to neuropathic pain management, making it a&#xD;
      particularly compelling treatment option in the population with acute SCI. Gabapentin leads&#xD;
      to improvement in total motor scores, reduced spasticity, reduced autonomic dysreflexia, and&#xD;
      improved mood. Animal models suggest it may be neuroprotective in the acute phase of injury.&#xD;
      In those who undergo spine surgery, regardless of presence of SCI, gabapentin given&#xD;
      perioperatively leads to reduced opiate use and decreased pain in post-operative period.&#xD;
      Additionally, when compared to narcotic alternatives, gabapentin has minimal side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropathic pain in SCI is common, impactful, and difficult to treat. Gabapentin is effective&#xD;
      in the management of symptoms and concerns related to SCI including motor recovery,&#xD;
      spasticity, and mood among others. This makes gabapentin an important pharmacologic&#xD;
      intervention, which compels providers to define treatment guidelines related to its use. One&#xD;
      aspect of which should relate to the timing of initiation of therapy. The goal of this study&#xD;
      is to determine whether early initiation of treatment with gabapentin will decrease average&#xD;
      pain scores and opiate use when comparted to late initiation of treatment with gabapentin in&#xD;
      the population with acute SCI. Gabapentin, although used commonly, is not started in all&#xD;
      patients with acute SCI but is often started at the onset of neuropathic pain. If gabapentin&#xD;
      is found to be more effective when initiated early, it would be reasonable to start&#xD;
      gabapentin immediately following acute SCI in all patients in whom it is not otherwise&#xD;
      contraindicated.&#xD;
