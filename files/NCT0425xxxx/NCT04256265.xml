        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not eligible for treatment with currently approved treatments for SMA, or cannot&#xD;
             continue treatment with currently approved medications as documented by the treating&#xD;
             physician, or in the treating physician's judgment, the participant is at risk of&#xD;
             lack/loss of treatment efficacy of the current therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant does not qualify for and has no access to SMA treatment in the context&#xD;
             of an ongoing clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequately recovered from any acute illness at the time of screening, and considered&#xD;
             clinically well enough to participate, in the opinion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with retinopathy of prematurity should have evidence of stable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Type 1 SMA Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Confirmed diagnosis of 5q-autosomal recessive SMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Type 2 SMA Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed diagnosis of 5q-autosomal recessive SMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative blood pregnancy test at screening (all women of childbearing potential,&#xD;
             including those who have had a tubal ligation), and agreement to comply with measures&#xD;
             to prevent pregnancy and restrictions on egg and sperm donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males with female partners of reproductive potential must agree to use highly&#xD;
             effective contraception during therapy, and for at least 4 months after treatment&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to meet program requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant or previous participation in any investigational drug or device study&#xD;
             within 90 days prior to screening or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of other SMN-2 targeting therapy within 120 days of starting risdiplam&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of SMA gene therapy within the last 3 months (12 weeks) of receiving&#xD;
             risdiplam therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious medical condition, treatment, or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
             that, in the treating physician's judgment, precludes the participant's safe&#xD;
             participation in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ascertained or presumptive hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction) to risdiplam&#xD;
             or to the constituents of its formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspicion of illicit drug or alcohol abuse, in the treating physician's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior use of an inhibitor or inducer of flavin-containing monooxygenases 1 (FMO1)&#xD;
             or flavin-containing monooxygenases 3 (FMO3) taken within 2 weeks (or within 5 times&#xD;
             the elimination half-life, whichever is longer) prior to dosing.&#xD;
