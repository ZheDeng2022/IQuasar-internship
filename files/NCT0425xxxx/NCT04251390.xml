  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are very few evidence-based interventions for children with cerebral palsy who cannot&#xD;
      walk. The Trexo-Home is a device that is newly available for rent by families, but its impact&#xD;
      is unknown. By tracking and recording various outcome measures throughout this project, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to inform future larger scale controlled studies.&#xD;

      Design: This is a prospective case study to understand how a walking-aid device (Trexo-Home)&#xD;
      that has been rented by a family, may impact a child with cerebral palsy (CP) who cannot&#xD;
      walk. The decision to use the device was separate from this research, and the decision to do&#xD;
      research on it's use was secondary, making it an observational study. The proposed procedures&#xD;
      below may be modified to adapt to the child and family's interest and needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Rationale: Evidence suggests that positive health outcomes are associated with&#xD;
      reducing sedentary behaviour and sitting time. For individuals with significant motor&#xD;
      impairments, spending the majority of their days sitting in a wheelchair is often a reality,&#xD;
      potentially leading to secondary preventable chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. Many children with CP have mobility limitations,&#xD;
      and approximately 30% are non-ambulatory or require assistive devices. Currently, there are&#xD;
      very few treatments available for non-ambulatory children with CP, and treatments may be&#xD;
      invasive or have undesirable side effects. Tréxō Robotics (Trexo) aims to bridge the gap in&#xD;
      treatments available for non-ambulatory children. Trexo offers a robotic exoskeleton that&#xD;
      enables children to walk using a gait trainer with an external power source with the safety&#xD;
      of a walker. This revolutionary technology is new to the world of pediatric rehabilitation,&#xD;
      and Trexo Home provides the advantage of versatility to use the device at home or in the&#xD;
      community on a daily basis. This means children who would otherwise spend most of their day&#xD;
      sitting in a wheelchair can now stand and walk on a daily basis using this device in a&#xD;
      familiar setting. Presently, the impacts of its use are unknown, however similar exoskeletons&#xD;
      used with adults with spinal cord injury (SCI) show promising health benefits beyond&#xD;
      enjoyment of walking again, such as improvements in spasticity and regularity of bowel&#xD;
      movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This case study will involve one 7 year old child with CP who is functionally non-ambulatory.&#xD;
      This child's family holds an agreement to lease the Trexo Home for a period of 6 months.&#xD;
      Through the exploratory nature and prospective design of this case study, the investigators&#xD;
      will gather critical data for informing future larger scale, controlled studies. With limited&#xD;
      pediatric data related to the use of robotic assisted movement, this information could&#xD;
      potentially add to or alter current interventions recommended for children with significant&#xD;
      motor impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this case study is to thoroughly assess the impact of Trexo Home&#xD;
      use in one 7 year old child with CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System level IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Does using a robotic exoskeleton meet the family's primary goal - facilitating their&#xD;
      child's experience of joy? ii) What is the family's experience around feasibility and the&#xD;
      child's tolerability of using the Trexo at home or in the community? iii) What are the&#xD;
      initial physiologic outcomes following twelve weeks of Trexo use?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Implementation of this project will occur over 16 weeks, with a baseline period of 4&#xD;
      weeks , an intervention period of 12 weeks. Throughout the project the investigators will&#xD;
      have weekly contact with the participant's family. This frequency was selected in discussion&#xD;
      with the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joy will be evaluated using a Smiley Face Likert Scale, completed separately by the child and&#xD;
      the parents on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility and Tolerability will be quantified by number of minutes of Trexo Home use and&#xD;
      number of steps taken per day. Reasons for skipping or abbreviating a therapeutic session&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiologic outcomes evaluate key symptoms of cerebral palsy and secondary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spasticity will be assessed every second week using clinical measures (modified Tardieu and&#xD;
      modified Ashworth Scale) and quantitative measures (the Portable Spasticity Assessment Device&#xD;
      which differentiates reflexive and intrinsic stiffness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Range of motion (ROM) at the hip and knee joint bilaterally will be measured via standardized&#xD;
      goniometry, and will be done every second week, on alternate weeks from the spasticity&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child's sitting balance will be assessed monthly using the Early Clinical Assessment of&#xD;
      Balance Version 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowel movement frequency and any related medication use will be tracked with daily diaries.&#xD;
      This area has significant potential to enhance the quality of life of an individual, and&#xD;
      adults with a spinal cord injury using exoskeleton have noted benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videos of the balance assessment and of free movement will occur in phase 1 and every month&#xD;
      during phase 2, the intervention period. Video of the child using the Trexo device will be&#xD;
      taken every two weeks in phase 2.&#xD;
