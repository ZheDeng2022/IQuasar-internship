  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pathological complete remission (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy in HER2-positive early breast&#xD;
      cancer patients is closely related to disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS),&#xD;
      which makes pCR an important evaluation indicator of recurrence risk. Trastuzumab combined&#xD;
      with pertuzumab is a new standard targeted treatment regimen for HER2-positive early breast&#xD;
      cancer. However, there are still quite a few patients who do not reach PCR. For these&#xD;
      patients, current guidelines recommend the use of TDM-1 for intensive treatment after&#xD;
      surgery, although a significant number of patients still have recurrence or metastasis.&#xD;
      Besides, TDM-1 is unavailable in China. Pyrotinib has been approved for HER2-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer patients who have previously failed after the treatment of trastuzumab. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to conduct this phase II clinical study. Patients with poor response to&#xD;
      the standard neoadjuvant treatment regimen of trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab are&#xD;
      enrolled. These patients receive pyrotinib to observe that whether pCR has been improved. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to explore the effect of pyrotinib in patients with poor response to&#xD;
      standard dual-target neoadjuvant therapy, and further explore the improvement of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment strategy in HER2 positive early stage breast cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in Chinese women, with 20% to 30% HER2&#xD;
      overexpression. Pathological complete remission (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy in&#xD;
      HER2-positive early stage breast cancer patients is closely related to disease-free survival&#xD;
      (DFS) and overall survival (OS), which makes pCR an important evaluation indicator of&#xD;
      recurrence risk. Trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab is a new standard targeted treatment&#xD;
      regimen for HER2-positive early breast cancer, with overall pCR rate of 57% to 66%. However,&#xD;
      there are still quite a few patients who do not reach PCR after treatment in clinical&#xD;
      practice. For patients who do not reach pCR with neoadjuvant therapy, current guidelines&#xD;
      recommend the use of TDM-1 for intensive treatment after surgery, but even with TDM-1, a&#xD;
      significant number of patients still have recurrence or metastasis. Besides, TDM-1 is&#xD;
      currently unavailable in China. Pyrotinib has been approved for HER2-positive breast cancer&#xD;
      patients who have previously failed after the treatment of trastuzumab. The investigators&#xD;
      intend to conduct this single-arm, single-center phase II clinical study. Patients with poor&#xD;
      response to the standard neoadjuvant treatment regimen of trastuzumab combined with&#xD;
      pertuzumab are enrolled. These patients receive pyrotinib to observe that whether pCR has&#xD;
      been improved after the replacement of targeted treatment regimen. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      explore the effect of pyrotinib in patients with poor response to standard dual-target&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy, and further explore the improvement of neoadjuvant treatment strategy in&#xD;
      HER2 positive early stage breast cancer patients.&#xD;
