  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teleneonatology, the use of audio-video communication to facilitate neonatal-perinatal care,&#xD;
      may bridge the resuscitation quality gap by connecting centers with lower level care to&#xD;
      experienced care providers. Using randomized trial design, this investigation will compare&#xD;
      teleneonatal resuscitation facilitated by a neonatologist to standard resuscitation within a&#xD;
      simulated environment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple studies have evaluated telemedicine using simulation, but the level of evidence for&#xD;
      the use of telemedicine to improve neonatal resuscitation is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this investigation and within a simulated environment, pediatric interns and residents&#xD;
      will resuscitate a simulated 25 week infant at delivery assisted by a simulated nurse and&#xD;
      respiratory therapist. Participants will be randomized to resuscitation performed either with&#xD;
      or without telemedicine facilitated by a neonatologist. The primary outcome will be time to&#xD;
      effective ventilation with other secondary outcomes including metrics derived from the&#xD;
      American Academy of Pediatrics Neonatal Resuscitation Program.&#xD;
