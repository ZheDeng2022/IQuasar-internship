      Patients with complex chronic multiple illnesses constitute an increasing challenge and more&#xD;
      evidence-based knowledge of effective practice is required. In Denmark and the rest of the&#xD;
      world, improved health care, public health, and increased focus on early diagnosis have led&#xD;
      to increases in life expectancy resulting in a growing population of older people living with&#xD;
      multiple long-term conditions (multimorbidity). Today, every fourth Dane suffers from more&#xD;
      than one concomitant chronic or severe disease, estimated to rise to 60% for those over 65&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National and international health care is organised and targeted as specialised,&#xD;
      mono-diagnostic efforts for single diseases leading to lack of coordination and failure to&#xD;
      integrate multidisciplinary patient trajectories. Danish research shows that general practice&#xD;
      is challenged by insufficient collaboration between professionals involved in the treatment.&#xD;
      Despite this, there exists limited evidence of initiatives aiming to improve care for&#xD;
      multimorbid patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. identify chronic multimorbid patients and to analyse their use of two or more outpatient&#xD;
           clinics, their general use of health care utilisations and their disease pattern and&#xD;
           characteristics (Cross-sectional study using national registers).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. develop an innovative organisational structure around a multidisciplinary outpatient&#xD;
           pathway for multimorbid patients and to pilot-test it (feasibility study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. phase-III test a multidisciplinary outpatient pathway and to preliminarily evaluate the&#xD;
           effects in patients and health professionals and on resource utilisations (effect study)&#xD;

      Background Patients with complex chronic multiple illnesses constitute an increasing&#xD;
      challenge and more evidence-based knowledge of effective practice is required. In Denmark and&#xD;
      the rest of the world, improved health care, public health, and increased focus on early&#xD;
      diagnosis have led to increases in life expectancy resulting in a growing population of older&#xD;
      people living with multiple long-term conditions (multimorbidity). Today, every fourth Dane&#xD;
      suffers from more than one concomitant chronic or severe disease, estimated to rise to 60%&#xD;
      for those over 65 years. Multimorbidity is more prevalent in women, rises with declining&#xD;
      social status and is associated with poorer quality-of-life. With an increasing proportion of&#xD;
      multimorbid patients, the prevalence of polypharmacy will increase. A multisymptomatic and&#xD;
      complicated disease pattern applies to both physical and mental illness, multiplicative&#xD;
      effects can create a need for people within different specialities working together. Earlier&#xD;
      studies show, that the most common chronic diseases are diabetes, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Comorbid diseases tend to compound&#xD;
      and interact, for example, COPD and diabetes are often seen in combination with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyday-life of multimorbid patients is influenced by drug consumption, frequent visits to&#xD;
      general practice, hospitalisations and outpatient clinics. A recent study showed that&#xD;
      patients with three chronic conditions visit health professionals five times a month and&#xD;
      spend 50-71 hours per month on health-related activities. However, studies on derivative&#xD;
      effects of multimorbidity are scarce and research focus is primarily placed on mainly health&#xD;
      services. Multimorbid patients experience and are in reality exposed to lack of coordination,&#xD;
      lack of inter-disciplinary communication and overall poor care management. Individual&#xD;
      resources and priorities in everyday life play a dominant role in navigating the tension&#xD;
      between everyday life and the health care system. This is often extremely demanding for&#xD;
      patients to navigate in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National and international health care is organised and targeted as specialised,&#xD;
      mono-diagnostic efforts for single diseases leading to lack of coordination and failure to&#xD;
      integrate multidisciplinary patient trajectories. Danish research shows that general practice&#xD;
      is challenged by insufficient collaboration between professionals involved in the treatment.&#xD;
      Despite this, there exists limited evidence of initiatives aiming to improve care for&#xD;
      multimorbid patients. Previous initiatives involve getting patients to take more active part&#xD;
      in their disease, creating disease insight, involving case managers, patient-shared medical&#xD;
      appointments, collaborative models and communication technology. Present on-going studies&#xD;
      focusing on interventions for multimorbid patients are also few.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the evidence is sparse on collaborative approaches directed at multimorbid&#xD;
      patients and on organising health care systems to accommodate this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and hypotheses Hypothesis 1 Multimorbid patients have numerous contacts to&#xD;
      outpatient clinics and are characterised as being older patients with common chronic&#xD;
      diseases, a complicated disease pattern and frequent users of health care utilisations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To identify chronic multimorbid patients and to analyse their use of two or more&#xD;
      outpatient clinics, their general use of health care utilisations and their disease pattern&#xD;
      and characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: It is feasible to convert several outpatient clinic pathways to one&#xD;
      multidisciplinary outpatient pathway and to structure an organisation around it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To develop an innovative organisational structure around a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      outpatient pathway for multimorbid patients and to pilot-test it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Patients and health care professionals find it advantageous to convert&#xD;
      outpatient visits for multimorbid patients to a multidisciplinary outpatient pathway, and the&#xD;
      use of resources will lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To phase-III test a multidisciplinary outpatient pathway and to preliminarily&#xD;
      evaluate the effects in patients and health professionals and on resource utilisations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a national cross-sectional study, data on multimorbid patients is obtained using validated&#xD;
      Danish registries, processed with remote access to Statistics Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are diagnosed with more than one chronic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seen in more than one outpatient clinic (within 18 months, 12 months, 6 months, 3&#xD;
           months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  â‰¥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure and outcomes: Primary exposure constitutes chronic diseases occurring in multimorbid&#xD;
      patients with classification a priori. Based on diagnoses (selected diagnoses chosen from&#xD;
      previous studies), clinical, socio-demographic characteristics and the need for health care&#xD;
      are investigated. We wish to demonstrate how these exposures are distributed by the number of&#xD;
      concomitant outpatient visits within different time intervals of 18 months, 12 months, 6&#xD;
      months, 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a feasibility-design efforts will be devoted to setting up an innovative multidisciplinary&#xD;
      outpatient pathway based on recommendations for complex interventions in the health system.&#xD;
      It involves the process of going from a conceptual to an operational setup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: A multidisciplinary outpatient pathway will be established at the University&#xD;
      Research Clinic for Innovative Patient Pathways. Through literature review and specialist&#xD;
      opinions, interviews, the intervention will consist of two or more disciplines collaborating&#xD;
      in establishing a treatment plan for the patient. A process manual of the individual phases&#xD;
      and a participatory cooperative approach will be used. A steering group will involve plastic&#xD;
      organic groups (health care professionals, patients, general practitioners), which will&#xD;
      contribute along with the hospital's task force team (center management, senior health care&#xD;
      professionals, representatives of quality development) through process support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure and outcomes: In the multidisciplinary outpatient pathway, health care professionals&#xD;
      will collaborate between medical specialties and examinations gathered for one joint&#xD;
      encounter with the patient. An integrated discharge summary is sent to general practice. The&#xD;
      exact structure and composition of the multidisciplinary outpatient pathway is part of the&#xD;
      feasibility study. Interviews are conducted on patients and healthcare professionals to&#xD;
      assess their experience with the pathway. Also a process evaluation is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3: To phase-III test a multidisciplinary outpatient pathway and to preliminary evaluate&#xD;
      the effects in patients and healthcare professionals and on resource utilisations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective study with difference-in-difference analysis, a cohort of multimorbid&#xD;
      patients seen in outpatient clinics is included based on the composition from the feasibility&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure: The newly established multidisciplinary outpatient pathway. Outcomes: In paired&#xD;
      measurements, Patient Reported Experience Measures (PREM) are recorded in questionnaires&#xD;
      before and after trajectories in conventional mono-disciplinary outpatient clinics are&#xD;
      converted to trajectories in the multidisciplinary outpatient pathway. Questionnaires are&#xD;
      compiled according to the literature of existing, validated questionnaires and supplemented&#xD;
      by ad hoc questions when no existing questionnaire exists). Questionnaires are set up in the&#xD;
      processing program, REDCap and sent through &quot;e-boks&quot; merged with doc2mail where replies are&#xD;
      entered directly in REDCap through a link. Questionnaires will also be sent by letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will be followed for one year for data collection on health care utilisations&#xD;
      (e.g. admissions, visits to outpatient clinics, redeemed prescriptions, contacts to general&#xD;
      practice or emergency medical services, hospital activity/examinations). A control group of&#xD;
      patients from other hospitals with trajectories in outpatient clinics are matched by gender,&#xD;
      age, disease, comorbidity, and length of disease. Difference-in-difference comparisons are&#xD;
      made on healthcare utilizations one year prior to the index date (first consultation with the&#xD;
      new pathway). Data is retrieved from national registers.&#xD;
