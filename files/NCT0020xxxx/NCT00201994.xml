      This study's purpose is to determine whether tolvaptan can safely and effectively return the&#xD;
      body's balance of sodium and water toward normal, and to characterize and quantify the&#xD;
      potential clinical benefits of this treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration below the lower limit of normal and&#xD;
      is the most frequently encountered electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients.&#xD;
      Generally speaking, most cases of hyponatremia are mild. However, as the serum sodium falls&#xD;
      below 130 mEq/L, the possibility of significant morbidity and mortality increases, and most&#xD;
      clinicians will initiate corrective therapy for serum sodium values approaching 130 mEq/L and&#xD;
      lower. The reasons for treating hyponatremia relate both to the symptoms, which may be quite&#xD;
      disturbing to patients, as well as to potential outcomes including permanent neurological&#xD;
      damage and death. there is also growing awareness of the association between hyponatremia and&#xD;
      increased mortality in patients with heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common theme underlying the occurrence of hyponatremia whether in the setting of congestive&#xD;
      heart failure, hepatic failure with ascites, or the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic&#xD;
      hormone (SIADH) is the non-osmotic secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The presence of&#xD;
      excess AVP leads to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Agents that antagonize AVP, causing&#xD;
      proportionally more water diuresis than solute excretion, could offer a significant treatment&#xD;
      option for patients with hyponatremia, compared to fluid restriction alone. Treatment of&#xD;
      hyponatremia, particularly in clinical settings such as decompensated congestive heart&#xD;
      failure, is difficult as conventional diuretics cause neurohormonal activation and further&#xD;
      stimulate the inappropriate release of vasopressin, leading to additional retention of free&#xD;
      water and aggravation of hypoosmolality. Similarly, for cirrhosis with ascites and SIADH,&#xD;
      conventional diuretics are either minimally effective or completely contraindicated. An&#xD;
      alternative approach to symptom relief and treatment of hyponatremia may be the use of&#xD;
      vasopressin antagonists, which increase free water clearance with proportionally less effect&#xD;
      on sodium excretion. Tolvaptan is an oral vasopressin antagonist with relative affinity for&#xD;
      the V2 receptor which has been shown to induce a diuresis with proportionally more free-water&#xD;
      than sodium loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is being undertaken in order to evaluate whether tolvaptan, an oral AVP&#xD;
      inhibitor, will be effective in correcting mild to moderate hyponatremia, and to elucidate&#xD;
      the effect of this correction on the subject's well-being.&#xD;
