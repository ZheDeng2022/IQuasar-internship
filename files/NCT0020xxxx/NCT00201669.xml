      This study will determine the efficacy of clofarabine as measured by response rate in&#xD;
      patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Two Food and Drug Administration drugs approved for blood cancers such as&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) include fludarabine (Fludara) and cladribine (Leustat). The drug&#xD;
      offered in the current study, clofarabine was designed to combine the anti-cancer strength of&#xD;
      both fludarabine and cladribine. Laboratory research suggests that clofarabine targets&#xD;
      anti-cancer mechanisms in cells, helps repair DNA, and inhibits tumor growth. Research also&#xD;
      indicates that clofarabine has some efficacy against a variety of blood cancers and solid&#xD;
      tumors. Numerous tumor responses have been observed with high doses of clofarabine in heavily&#xD;
      pretreated patients with different types of lymphoma. The current study build on this&#xD;
      previous research to test clofarabine in patients with aggressive NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of clofarabine for aggressive NHL.&#xD;
      Toxicities resulting from the combination of clofarabine and the supportive care drug GM-CSF&#xD;
      will also be analyzed in patients. GM-CSF is a blood-forming agent that stimulates the&#xD;
      production of white blood cells. In addition, several tests, including blood and tumor tissue&#xD;
      analysis, will assess immune response and biological changes to the tumor as a result of&#xD;
      study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Patients in this study will be given clofarabine through intravenous infusions.&#xD;
      This drug will initially be provided to patients for five consecutive days. Several tests&#xD;
      will then be conducted and supportive care agents will be administered to stabilize patients'&#xD;
      blood cell counts, immune response, and reduce the risk of infection. The first ten patients&#xD;
      in this study will be hospitalized until recovery from the first five days of clofarabine to&#xD;
      carefully monitor any additional toxicities resulting from the dosing regimen. Patients will&#xD;
      receive another five day treatment cycle with clofarabine within seven days after recovering&#xD;
      from each previous cycle and no more than four weeks from the start of the previous cycle.&#xD;
      Disease response will be measured after every two cycles of treatment with clofarabine.&#xD;
      Patient with stable or reduced disease will receive a maximum of six treatment cycles with&#xD;
      clofarabine. Treatments will be discontinued due to disease growth, unacceptable side&#xD;
      effects, or a treatment delay of more than 21 days.&#xD;
