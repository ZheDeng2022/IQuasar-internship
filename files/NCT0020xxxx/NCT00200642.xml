  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a frequent disease and which heavily affects the patients'&#xD;
      quality of life. To alleviate symptoms and ease the healing of lesion, patients very often&#xD;
      need to continuously take anti-secretory drugs (Proton pump inhibitors or PPIs), which,&#xD;
      despite their efficiency, do not cure the disease. For these PPI dependent patients, an&#xD;
      anti-reflux surgery (fundoplication often made by coelioscopy) is a possible alternative but&#xD;
      it has a significant morbidity rate and even an estimated post-operative mortality of 0.8%&#xD;
      outside of expertise centres. Therefore, new therapeutic endoscopic approaches, supposed to&#xD;
      be less invasive and less expensive than surgery have been developed during the last three&#xD;
      years. Among them, radiofrequency (Stretta® procedure) consists in administering a high&#xD;
      frequency current in the cardia area, in order to induce thanks to a thermal effect a&#xD;
      sub-mucous remodelling and a modification of the compliance of the cardia regionThe aim of&#xD;
      this project carried out in 8 French centres and 2 European centers is to assess through a&#xD;
      randomised trial, the efficiency of radiofrequency on PPI dependent patients. The study will&#xD;
      be carried out in 2 phases with patients who have been fully informed of the project&#xD;
      statement, and particularly of the potential risks of the radiofrequency technique and have&#xD;
      given their written acceptation to participate to the study.The first phase, which will last&#xD;
      6 to 11 weeks, will aim at making sure that patients are PPI dependent and define their&#xD;
      needs. After this initial phase, patients will be randomised between those who will carry on&#xD;
      with the PPI treatment or the radiofrequency treatment. The follow up after this&#xD;
      randomisation will last one year. The first assessment of the therapeutic efficiency will be&#xD;
      done at 6th month. The 6 additional follow up months will be required for the assessment of&#xD;
      mid-term side effects of the treatment and the rate of symptomatic recurrences.&#xD;
