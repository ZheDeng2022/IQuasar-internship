    <textblock>
      Abnormalities in peripheral glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes can occur more commonly in&#xD;
      individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy subjects or in other psychiatric conditions.&#xD;
      Antipsychotic treatment may contribute significantly to abnormalities in glucose regulation.&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia can contribute to long-term cardiovascular disease risk that may already be&#xD;
      increased in patients with schizophrenia due to higher rates of smoking, sedentary life&#xD;
      style, obesity and under-treated hypertension and dyslipidemia. This project will&#xD;
      characterize the effects on glucose control of the two most commonly prescribed newer&#xD;
      antipsychotic medications, ziprasidone and olanzapine, in patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;

      This proposal aims to use a well-characterized procedure, the modified Frequently Sampled&#xD;
      Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test (FSIGTT), to characterize the glucoregulatory effects of&#xD;
      the two most commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications, ziprasidone and&#xD;
      olanzapine, in comparison to the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol. Abnormalities in&#xD;
      peripheral glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes can occur more commonly in individuals with&#xD;
      schizophrenia than in healthy subjects or in other psychiatric conditions. While&#xD;
      abnormalities in glucose regulation were first reported in schizophrenia prior to the&#xD;
      introduction of antipsychotic medications, antipsychotic treatment may contribute&#xD;
      significantly to abnormalities in glucose regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the adverse effect of antipsychotic medications on systemic glucose regulation has&#xD;
      received increased attention as investigators noted prominent adverse glucoregulatory effects&#xD;
      associated with certain newer antipsychotic medications. Abnormal glucose regulation and&#xD;
      new-onset type 2 diabetes have been reported during clozapine and olanzapine treatment.&#xD;
      Complicating the study of antipsychotic-induced changes in glucose regulation, increased&#xD;
      adiposity can decrease insulin sensitivity, and antipsychotics can increase adiposity and&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI). However, abnormal glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes can occur&#xD;
      during clozapine treatment in the absence of weight gain, suggesting that changes in glucose&#xD;
      regulation can occur independent of drug-induced increases in BMI. Consistent with this, our&#xD;
      preliminary studies indicate that important effects of clozapine and olanzapine on glucose&#xD;
      regulation are not accounted for by differences in BMI. This proposal will compare the&#xD;
      effects of olanzapine, ziprasidone and haloperidol on well-defined measures of glucose&#xD;
      regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal specifically hypothesizes that olanzapine treatment will be associated with&#xD;
      decreases in insulin sensitivity (SI), without effects on insulin secretion.&#xD;
      Treatment-related effects on glucose effectiveness (SG) will be explored.&#xD;
