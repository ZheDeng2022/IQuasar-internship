  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an SSRI, sertraline for the use&#xD;
      of post-concussive symptoms following a traumatic brain injury. the study also seeks to&#xD;
      investigate the relationship between irritability and aggression and anosmia in individuals&#xD;
      who have suffered a traumatic brian injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this protocol are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the efficacy of sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor&#xD;
           (SSRI), in treating neurobehavioral sequelae of irritability, depression, frustration,&#xD;
           anxiety and other post-concussive symptoms following traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore possible relationships between anosmia (deficits in smell) and irritability/&#xD;
           aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sertraline is effective in treating Post TBI neurobehavioral symptoms of irritability,&#xD;
      depression, frustration, anxiety, and other elements of the postconcussive syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receive sertraline will have significantly less post-concussive symptoms at 12&#xD;
      weeks than patients who received placebo. Post-concussive symptoms will be measured by the&#xD;
      Gouvier Post-Concussive Syndrome Scale (PCSC) and the Affective Cluster score of the Cicerone&#xD;
      Post Concussive Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with anosmia will have greater irritability and aggressive symptoms than those&#xD;
      without anosmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Subjects: One hundred people will take part in this study: approximately 50 subjects will&#xD;
      take sertraline and 50 will take placebo. These patients will be selected from referrals to&#xD;
      the Defense and Veterans Head Injury Program at WRAMC. Patients will be active duty or other&#xD;
      military beneficiaries, between 18 and 65 years of age. Males and non-pregnant females may&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Traumatic brain injury patients within 6 months of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Traumatic brain injury with:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Minimum severity - TBI with post traumatic amnesia. Maximum severity - recovery to&#xD;
                a Rancho los Amigos (see Appendix II) level 7 or 8 by six months after injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The C Criterion of DSM IV diagnosis of Post Concussive Disorder (PCD- Research&#xD;
                Criteria), with symptoms persisting for a minimum of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Military beneficiary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Severe prior neurologic or psychiatric illness, such as stroke or psychosis.&#xD;
                (Previous nonpsychotic depression is not an exclusion criterion)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Contraindication to the use of sertraline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Previous severe traumatic brain injury (defined as TBI with period of&#xD;
                unconsciousness greater than 1 week prior. This exclusion refers only to TBI's&#xD;
                prior to the current injury, which is within the past 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Current active suicidal ideation&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. Study Design: This study will be a prospective, double-blind, randomized 1:1 control&#xD;
           trial study with two groups: active drug and placebo. Block randomization will be used&#xD;
           so neither the patient nor the study physician will be able to guess the study drug&#xD;
           assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d. Methodology: Patients will receive a multidisciplinary evaluation consisting of&#xD;
           neurology exam, neuropsychology, psychiatry, speech and language, psychosocial,&#xD;
           rehabilitation medicine (FIM/FAM), EEG, MRI, phlebotomy, and family interview. Blood&#xD;
           samples will be kept at the DVHIP labeled with the patient's study number for possible&#xD;
           future use in studies to better understand recovery from head injury. No studies would&#xD;
           be performed on the blood samples until the patients have signed an additional informed&#xD;
           consent with additional details on the blood studies planned. After signing the&#xD;
           volunteer informed consent for the current sertraline protocol, evoked potentials and&#xD;
           the smell test ( see Appendix III) will be administered and patients will be randomized&#xD;
           into an active drug or placebo group. Patients will receive an increasing dose of&#xD;
           sertraline or placebo up to a dose of 200 mg of sertraline. See Table I, Appendix I, for&#xD;
           dosing schedule. All patients will receive a two part counseling session regarding brain&#xD;
           injury and recovery from brain injury. The first session will cover the types of&#xD;
           symptoms that may be experienced after brain injury, the expected course of recovery,&#xD;
           and recommendations for symptom management. The second will begin with a brief&#xD;
           assessment of material retained from the first counseling session, and continue with&#xD;
           specific recommendations that match general principles to the patient's specific life&#xD;
           situation. A brief pre-test and post-test (see Appendix IV) on general TBI information&#xD;
           will be given with the first counseling session; a pre-test will be administered prior&#xD;
           to the second session. These tests will permit better understanding of how much&#xD;
           information patients have regarding TBI and how much is retained after a first&#xD;
           counseling session.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The medication phase will last 12 weeks. Patients will receive standard TBI care during&#xD;
           this period. Current standard of care for patients with moderate-severe TBI following a&#xD;
           full evaluation with medical/surgical treatment of any acute medical/surgical conditions&#xD;
           is approximately 8 weeks of Convalescent Leave Home (CVL) followed by a gradual return&#xD;
           to duty. Mild TBI patients typically receive 1-4 weeks of CVL followed by a gradual&#xD;
           return to duty. Civilians would have similar schedules for resumption of activities.&#xD;
           From current referral patterns, we expect most patients to have moderate traumatic brain&#xD;
           injuries. The DVHIP experience suggests that patients are virtually never referred to&#xD;
           DVHIP severely depressed and already on therapeutic levels of antidepressants. More&#xD;
           commonly, patients are referred with mild-moderate symptoms of sleep difficulties,&#xD;
           headache, irritability and/or depression. Because no randomized, controlled trials exist&#xD;
           to suggest that current medical treatment is effective in these patients, and because a&#xD;
           substantial placebo effect is a known reality, the design of this study (randomization&#xD;
           to sertraline or placebo) is appropriate. Also, we have cared for a few patients who,&#xD;
           although clinically depressed, refused medications. We worked with them in a supportive&#xD;
           educational framework, and in some cases, their depressions remitted. Thus, the best&#xD;
           treatment for these patients is far from established. It is likely that future research&#xD;
           will help clarify which treatments are best for which patients. For this study, patients&#xD;
           who may have been started on a tricyclic antidepressant (e.g., for headache) or an SSRI&#xD;
           will be withdrawn from these medications for 10 days prior to the start of the study&#xD;
           medication. Patients will be informed of concomitant medication options if the test&#xD;
           article (sertraline or placebo) is not sufficient for treating their symptoms, or if&#xD;
           they feel they need medication prior to the start of the test article. All patients will&#xD;
           be contacted weekly during the medication phase to assess general condition, current&#xD;
           symptoms, and assessment of compliance. Patients will be rated for improvement at weeks&#xD;
           3, 6, and 9 for possible medication adjustment. The determination of medication&#xD;
           adjustment will be made by study personnel at Walter Reed only. If patients require a&#xD;
           clinical medical appointment during the 12 weeks, patients will be seen at WRAMC if&#xD;
           possible. If not possible, study personnel will be available to speak with the patient's&#xD;
           clinician at a local medical facility. Patients will return to WRAMC at 12 weeks for a&#xD;
           follow-up evaluation of their symptoms, or they will be contacted by phone if unable to&#xD;
           return to WRAMC for their 12 week evaluation. After the 12 week evaluation, patients&#xD;
           will be tapered off sertraline or placebo over 2 weeks. Tapering and discontinuation of&#xD;
           the study medication or placebo will be done on a gradual basis over the 2 weeks (e.g.,&#xD;
           If the patient is on 150 mg, s/he could take 100 mg for 1 week, 50 mg for one week, then&#xD;
           D/C). If, following the 12 week evaluation, subjects have recurrent symptoms which are&#xD;
           distressing to them, or believe they need medication to keep their symptoms from&#xD;
           recurring, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments will be discussed with them.&#xD;
           Patients will be offered appropriate treatment, including sertraline, if medically&#xD;
           indicated. The blind will not yet be broken, that is, patients will not be able to learn&#xD;
           if they were being treated with placebo or sertraline. Subjects will then be contacted&#xD;
           by phone or seen at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following their 12 week follow-up evaluation&#xD;
           for an assessment of their symptoms and general level of functioning. If patients are in&#xD;
           the area, these follow-up evaluation may be done in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concomitant medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with difficulty sleeping will be instructed in sleep hygiene, interviewed for&#xD;
           possible deterrents to sleep induction, and encouraged to permit the test medication&#xD;
           time to begin if depression is felt to contribute to the sleep disturbance. If&#xD;
           difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep persist, Ambien 5-10 mg po qd (a&#xD;
           non-serotoninergic hypnotic) will be offered. Benadryl 25-50 mg may also be considered&#xD;
           for sleep induction. If clinically indicated, other medication may be prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with headaches will be counseled about precipitants in an attempt to maximize&#xD;
           non-pharmacologic management of headache. If pain persists, enteric-coated ASA will be&#xD;
           prescribed. For patients non-responsive to ASA (headache or other pain syndromes),&#xD;
           non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications will be permitted. For vascular headaches,&#xD;
           Midrin or sumatriptin may be used. If clinically indicated, other medication may be&#xD;
           prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a patient has severe depression not responding to test article/placebo, and the&#xD;
           treating physician deems antidepressant medication necessary, a non-SSRI medication,&#xD;
           nortriptyline, will be used as the first line medication. Nortriptyline has been shown&#xD;
           effective in post stroke depression (18), and may be monitored by plasma levels, thus&#xD;
           being a good medication to combine with either placebo or sertraline. If nortriptyline&#xD;
           is not effective (or if nortriptyline is not appropriate for that particular patient),&#xD;
           the treating physician will chose whatever antidepressant is clinically indicated.&#xD;
           Appropriate clinical care of the patient is the first priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pregnant women may not participate in this study. Women of childbearing age will take a&#xD;
           urine or blood pregnancy test before starting this study to confirm they are not&#xD;
           pregnant. As part of the informed consent, women are advised to avoid pregnancy for at&#xD;
           least 6 weeks after receiving the drug treatment and will be advised about reliable&#xD;
           methods of birth control. Breast-feeding women will also be excluded.&#xD;
