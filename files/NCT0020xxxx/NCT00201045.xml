      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Healthy People 2010 target calls for controlled BP in 50% of the 50 million Americans&#xD;
      with hypertension. BP is currently controlled in only 27% of the population. These population&#xD;
      figures are in contrast to data from clinical trials (efficacy) in which BP has been&#xD;
      controlled in 70 to 80% of study participants. Poor BP control exists in spite of six sets of&#xD;
      guidelines generated over the last 30 years in the United States. While there are many causes&#xD;
      for poor control, several studies have found that physicians are frequently satisfied with&#xD;
      uncontrolled BPs. Numerous strategies exist to assist physicians with achieving better BP&#xD;
      control, but a consistent, effective approach to solving the problem has not been found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to test whether BP control can be improved by physician&#xD;
      education and feedback provided through the development of physician/pharmacist collaborative&#xD;
      teams. The rationale for this proposal is generated from studies demonstrating that physician&#xD;
      knowledge, quality of prescribing, and attainment of treatment goals can be improved when&#xD;
      physicians collaborate with clinical pharmacists. Previous studies have suffered from&#xD;
      insufficient sample size and controls and did not include a structured intervention. This&#xD;
      study will address these gaps in knowledge by conducting a randomized, prospective study in 5&#xD;
      clinics (2 intervention and 3 control) with 27 physicians who care for 180 patients with&#xD;
      uncontrolled BP. The structured intervention will involve clinical pharmacists who evaluate&#xD;
      BP therapy and treatment strategies and make specific recommendations to the physician.&#xD;
      Patients will be seen at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 months, at which time random zero&#xD;
      BP measurements will be performed. The specific aims of this study are (1) to determine if&#xD;
      better BP control can be achieved by the use of physician/pharmacist teams that utilize&#xD;
      physician education and feedback when compared to usual care, (2) to determine if&#xD;
      improvements in BP control are related to an increase in physician knowledge of and adherence&#xD;
      to BP guidelines when they are involved in physician/pharmacist teams, and (3) to determine&#xD;
      if changes in BP control are associated with the level and scope of the physician/pharmacist&#xD;
      relationships. This model utilizes an innovative system approach to improve BP control. This&#xD;
      intervention has the potential to achieve marked improvements in BP control. This model could&#xD;
      become one additional strategy to help achieve the BP goals for Healthy People 2010.&#xD;
