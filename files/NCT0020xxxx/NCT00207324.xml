      The hypothesis is that silver leaf nylon dressing reduces the percentage of patients&#xD;
      developing brisk erythema and moist desquamation while undergoing whole breast radiotherapy.&#xD;
      The secondary hypothesis is that silver leaf nylon dressing reduces breast-related symptoms&#xD;
      of pain, itching and burning sensation in patients receiving whole breast radiotherapy.&#xD;

      Purpose: The delivery of whole breast radiotherapy to women with a deep inframammary fold&#xD;
      frequently results in a marked skin reaction (brisk erythema and/or moist desquamation). The&#xD;
      main aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of prophylactic silver leaf nylon dressings&#xD;
      with standard skin care against standard skin care alone in the prevention of brisk erythema&#xD;
      and moist desquamation. A secondary aim of the study is to assess whether the use of silver&#xD;
      leaf nylon dressings can reduce breast-related symptoms of pain, burning sensation and&#xD;
      itching in women undergoing whole breast radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that silver leaf nylon dressing reduces the percentage of&#xD;
      patients developing brisk erythema and moist desquamation while undergoing whole breast&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The secondary hypothesis is that silver leaf nylon dressing reduces&#xD;
      breast-related symptoms of pain, itching and burning sensation in patients receiving whole&#xD;
      breast radiotherapy. The null hypotheses are that there is no reduction in brisk erythema,&#xD;
      moist desquamation or breast-related symptoms in patients undergoing whole breast&#xD;
      radiotherapy with the use of silver leaf nylon dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Severe skin reactions are common in patients with a deep inframammary fold who&#xD;
      undergo whole breast radiotherapy. It may be possible to reduce the severity of skin&#xD;
      reactions in this population of patients with the use of silver leaf nylon dressing. This&#xD;
      might make whole breast radiotherapy more tolerable for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objectives of this study are to compare the severity of skin reactions of&#xD;
      patients with a deep inframammary skin fold undergoing whole breast radiotherapy (using the&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system, as well as a supplementary scoring system)&#xD;
      between the experimental arm and the control arm, and to compare the severity of breast-&#xD;
      related symptoms (using visual analogue scales), topical steroid use and analgesic use&#xD;
      between the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method: This will be a single blind randomised controlled trial. The target&#xD;
      population comprises patients with a deep inframammary fold undergoing whole breast&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Patients will be randomised to follow standard skin care recommendations&#xD;
      throughout radiotherapy treatment (control arm) or to follow these recommendations in&#xD;
      addition to using a silver leaf nylon dressing (experimental arm). Randomisation will be&#xD;
      stratified for the delivery of prior chemotherapy and for the radiotherapy fractionation&#xD;
      schedule (extended versus standard).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women diagnosed with completely excised stage I or II invasive breast cancer, or DCIS,&#xD;
             who have undergone breast-conserving surgery and are scheduled to undergo adjuvant&#xD;
             breast radiotherapy will be eligible for this study if they are at increased risk of&#xD;
             radiodermatitis at the inframammary fold due to breast size or shape (i.e at least 2cm&#xD;
             of skin apposition at the inframammary fold, and/or brassiere cup size C or greater).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients undergoing nodal radiotherapy are eligible if criterion 1 is met&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients undergoing boost radiotherapy are eligible if criterion 1 is met, but only if&#xD;
             the boost volume does not include any part of the breast inferior to the nipple line&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients may be entered into other local or national trials unless these involve an&#xD;
             alteration to standard skin care or altered breast radiotherapy technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  inability to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  inability to comply with experimental arm of trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  failure of healing of the surgical scar or significant post-operative infection of the&#xD;
             wound&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  prior radiotherapy to either breast or to the chest&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  presence of significant connective tissue disease (e.g. systemic sclerosis, systemic&#xD;
             lupus erythematosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  known radiation hypersensitivity phenotype (e.g. ataxia telangiectasia etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  inability to return for assessment at one week following completion of radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  allergy to silver&#xD;
