      The purpose of this study is to assess the acute and chronic effectiveness of the Advanced&#xD;
      Bionics Precision(TM) Spinal Cord Stimulation System in subjects with failed back surgery&#xD;
      syndrome and associated low back axial pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a temporary or permanent trial to assess their candidacy for placement&#xD;
      of an implantable pulse generator. Those who demonstrate a significant clinical reduction in&#xD;
      pain will be enrolled in the chronic study. Subjects will be followed for 12 months post&#xD;
      implantation to assess the long-term effectiveness of the therapy.&#xD;
