  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double -blind randomized crossover study to provide evidence for the expert advice&#xD;
      based recommendation of the Expert Working Group of the European Association for Palliative&#xD;
      Care (EAPC) that patients during treatment with IR morphine are given a double dose at&#xD;
      bed-time that replaces the next 4-hourly dose during night. In addition to the primary,&#xD;
      blinded clinical part of the study, an experimental part is also included. This part consists&#xD;
      of two open study days were morphine IR is given in the same fashion as the clinical study.&#xD;
      The aim is to study whether pharmacokinetic data supports the clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a double-bedtime IR morphine dose is equal to regularly scheduled IR morphine&#xD;
      every 4-hour during night in respect to pain relief during night for patients with pain&#xD;
      caused by malignant disease&#xD;

      PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double bedtime dosing during immediate-release morphine administration to cancer patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, double-blind cross-over comparison of a double bedtime dose versus two standard&#xD;
      doses at bedtime and at night&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral morphine is recommended by the World Health Organization for pain control in moderate or&#xD;
      strong cancer pain 1. At our hospital we use the practice recommended by the Expert Working&#xD;
      Group of the European Association for Palliative Care for introduction of strong opioids with&#xD;
      titration with immediate-release (IR) morphine dosed every 4 hour until an optimal balance&#xD;
      between analgesia and side effects is achieved. After the optimal daily dose is defined&#xD;
      slow-release (SR) morphine in the same total daily morphine dose is started 2. One of the&#xD;
      features of the EPAC guidelines is that patients during treatment with IR morphine are given&#xD;
      a double bed-time that replaces the next 4-hourly dose during night 2. The rationale behind&#xD;
      this recommendation is that giving a double dose will prolong duration of morphine analgesia&#xD;
      and eliminate the need for awaking the patient during night. However, this recommendation is&#xD;
      based on expert opinion and not evidence from clinical studies 2. Todd et al. has recently&#xD;
      presented results that challenge this approach from a cross-over study in which the patients&#xD;
      received either a double bedtime dose or regular doses every 4-hour 3. This study showed that&#xD;
      patients receiving a double bedtime dose reported more pain, more use of rescue medications&#xD;
      and reported inferior sleep quality compared to patients receiving regularly scheduled doses.&#xD;
      A limitation of this study was that they did not perform the study blinded and thus&#xD;
      consequently the results are subject to bias. It is a need for a placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      before the evidence carries enough weight to change current recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides a clinical study it is also relevant to obtain pharmacokinetic observations during&#xD;
      double bedtime and regularly IR morphine dosing. Repeated blood sampling will disturb the&#xD;
      patients during night and hence confound the clinical observations (e.g. sleep quality).&#xD;
      Consequently, the blood samples will not be obtained in the same dosing interval where the&#xD;
      clinical data are obtained.&#xD;
