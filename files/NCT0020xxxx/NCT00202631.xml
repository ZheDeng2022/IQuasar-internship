  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with high spinal lesions are at risk of respiratory complications because they have&#xD;
      partial or complete paralysis of breathing muscles. Previous work has shown that tetraplegic&#xD;
      lung volumes can be increased by using abdominal FES during expiration. The technique is&#xD;
      attractive because it is non-invasive, painless in tetraplegia and completely reversible. It&#xD;
      may provide a treatment for augmenting the patient's breathing both in the acute presentation&#xD;
      of spinal injury (when half of cervical injuries require ventilation) and in long term&#xD;
      management of tetraplegia and high paraplegia. We propose a pilot study in a small group of&#xD;
      subjects to see if the technique is feasible from both a clinical and engineering viewpoint.&#xD;
      The aims of the study are: 1)To examine the effects of abdominal FES on lung mechanics and&#xD;
      gas exchange in tetraplegic subjects. 2)To optimise the stimulation pattern and intensity via&#xD;
      electronic stimulators and to design a trigger to allow the FES to follow the subject's own&#xD;
      breathing cycle automatically.&#xD;

      Patients with high spinal cord injury (SCI) usually have paralysed intercostal muscles and&#xD;
      rely on diaphragm function alone for respiration. They have low tidal volumes and inadequate&#xD;
      cough. These patients are vulnerable to respiratory complications in the immediate&#xD;
      post-injury phase and remain at life-long risk of chest problems. Usual treatments include&#xD;
      intensive physiotherapy and intermittent positive pressure ventilation to augment the&#xD;
      patient's tidal volume and to help clear excess secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tidal volumes can also be increased by electrical stimulation of the surface of abdominal&#xD;
      muscles during expiration. During stimulation the patient expires below functional residual&#xD;
      capacity (the amount of air left after normal expiration). The natural elasticity of the&#xD;
      chest wall then causes a recoil increase in the size of the next inspired breath. Functional&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (FES) of the abdominal muscles is theoretically an attractive&#xD;
      technique to augment respiration. It is non-invasive, it mimics natural physiological&#xD;
      processes and tetraplegic patients cannot sense abdominal discomfort. There are potential&#xD;
      applications in acute SCI patients to prevent the need for artificial ventilation and to aid&#xD;
      ventilator weaning. The technique could also be used in chronically injured patients to&#xD;
      augment ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical staff at the Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Injuries Unit have collaborated&#xD;
      extensively with engineering and bioengineering teams from Glasgow University and the&#xD;
      University of Strathclyde in the use of FES in SCI. FES is already being used successfully in&#xD;
      the Unit for paraplegic cycling and upper limb exercise in tetraplegia. We have performed&#xD;
      abdominal FES on one SCI subject with complete diaphragm paralysis and produced a tidal&#xD;
      volume of one hundred millilitres (McLean and Hunt, unpublished observation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting a large scale project it is important to confirm whether we can reliably&#xD;
      reproduce at least some of the findings of Stanic et al. It would be very interesting if we&#xD;
      could show any change in gas exchange as well as simply increasing tidal volume. Engineering&#xD;
      issues include optimisation and programming of the FES stimulus. We propose a pilot study in&#xD;
      QENSIU to establish whether the technique is of practical benefit to spinal cord injured&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
