      TITLE: Aripiprazole effects on reward processing in deficit syndrome schizophrenia Principal&#xD;
      Investigator: Erica Duncan, M.D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background- This is a study of the way people with schizophrenia may feel when they get&#xD;
      rewards. Certain parts of the brain play a part in people feeling happy when they win some&#xD;
      sort of reward or have a good thing happen to them. Some people with schizophrenia may have&#xD;
      trouble feeling pleasure because part of their brains, the frontal cortex, may not work&#xD;
      properly. We are doing this study to understand how the frontal cortex works in people with&#xD;
      and without schizophrenia when they are trying to win a reward. We will use a special kind of&#xD;
      brain scan called Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to show the brain working in&#xD;
      action. fMRI scanning uses a big magnet to take special pictures of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new medicine called aripiprazole has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for&#xD;
      treating symptoms of schizophrenia. This medicine has a new mechanism of action that helps&#xD;
      neural functioning in the part of the brain that is involved with planning and goal setting.&#xD;
      We think this new medication may help with brain processing of rewards. We are therefore&#xD;
      studying the brain with fMRI scans before and during treatment with this aripiprazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective- The objective of this study is to determine whether subjects with negative&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia have abnormal functioning of brain circuits relevant to reward&#xD;
      processing, and to determine whether any such abnormalities are normalized by treatment with&#xD;
      aripiprazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan-Aim 1. Define impairments in the neural correlates of reward processing in&#xD;
      primary deficit syndrome schizophrenics compared to normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten stable outpatients with primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia will be compared to ten&#xD;
      normal controls in a BOLD contrast fMRI experiment constructed to assess in a parametric&#xD;
      design the recruitment of reward circuitry in response to increasing monetary reward. We&#xD;
      predict that frontal cortical areas important in reward processing such as the OFC and ACC&#xD;
      will have reduced activation in the schizophrenic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Assess the ability of aripiprazole to normalize reward circuit functioning in deficit&#xD;
      syndrome schizophrenia, and correlate fMRI changes with clinical changes in negative&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ten schizophrenic subjects in Aim 1 will be switched from standard antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment to twelve weeks of open label aripiprazole and retested with the fMRI monetary&#xD;
      reward task. We predict that twelve weeks of aripiprazole treatment will normalize the&#xD;
      activation of OFC and ACC in response to monetary reward stimuli. We further predict that the&#xD;
      degree of normalization in fMRI activation will correlate with negative symptom improvement&#xD;
      on aripiprazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods- Up to 25 volunteers with schizophrenia and 25 volunteers without a psychiatric&#xD;
      disorder will participate in this study at the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Subjects will first&#xD;
      be interviewed about their medical and psychiatric history, and any current symptoms they are&#xD;
      having. They will receive an fMRI scan during which they will play a computer game that&#xD;
      rewards correct responses with money. This fMRI session will allow for the assessment of&#xD;
      which parts of the brain are functioning during rewarding conditions. The results will be&#xD;
      compared for subjects with and without schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects with schizophrenia will have their antipsychotic medication tapered and switched&#xD;
      to aripiprazole during a twelve week treatment phase. They will be seen at the end of Week 1,&#xD;
      Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10, and Week 12. At the last visit the fMRI scan will be&#xD;
      repeated during the same reward task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relevance- The inability to experience pleasure and the inability to pursue goals is&#xD;
      an important symptom of schizophrenia. These symptoms probably play a huge role in preventing&#xD;
      many people with schizophrenia from leading full and fulfilling lives. A central defect in&#xD;
      reward processing pathways in the brain may account for these symptoms. If aripiprazole can&#xD;
      be demonstrated to improve functioning in these brain pathways, this would greatly advance&#xD;
      our understanding of schizophrenia and could bring greater functioning to patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;

      ARIPIPRAZOLE EFFECTS ON REWARD PROCESSING IN DEFICIT SYNDROME SCHIZOPHRENIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Investigator: Erica Duncan, MD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chronic negative symptoms of schizophrenia remain poorly responsive to&#xD;
      psychopharmacologic treatment. The impaired motivation of primary deficit syndrome patients&#xD;
      prevents them from pursuing social and occupational goals and prevents them from developing&#xD;
      meaningful and productive lives. This proposal is based on the test of a hypothesis that&#xD;
      schizophrenic patients with enduring deficit symptoms suffer from impairments in reward&#xD;
      processing and the translation of perceived reward salience into goal-oriented behavior.&#xD;
      Preclinical and clinical research has revealed the functioning of a distributed neural&#xD;
      network in the processing of reward stimuli. Regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) such as&#xD;
      orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are key frontal cortical&#xD;
      elements of a neural circuit that mediates reward salience, reward expectation, and reward&#xD;
      approach behavior. Aripiprazole, in virtue of its' activity as a dopamine (DA) partial&#xD;
      agonist, is uniquely suited to enhance functioning of these frontal areas crucial to reward&#xD;
      processing. We hypothesize that primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia is associated with&#xD;
      functional deficits in reward circuitry detectable by fMRI scanning during a monetary reward&#xD;
      task. We further hypothesize that treatment with aripiprazole will normalize reward circuit&#xD;
      function in these subjects and thus contribute to improvements in negative symptoms. The&#xD;
      following specific aims will test these hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Define impairments in the neural correlates of reward processing in primary deficit&#xD;
      syndrome schizophrenics compared to normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten stable outpatients with primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia will be compared to ten&#xD;
      normal controls in a BOLD contrast fMRI experiment constructed to assess in a parametric&#xD;
      design the recruitment of reward circuitry in response to increasing monetary reward. We&#xD;
      predict that frontal cortical areas important in reward processing such as the OFC and ACC&#xD;
      will have reduced activation in the schizophrenic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Assess the ability of aripiprazole to normalize reward circuit functioning in deficit&#xD;
      syndrome schizophrenia, and correlate fMRI changes with clinical changes in negative&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ten schizophrenic subjects in Aim 1 will be switched from standard antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment to twelve weeks of open label aripiprazole and retested with the fMRI monetary&#xD;
      reward task. We predict that twelve weeks of aripiprazole treatment will normalize the&#xD;
      activation of OFC and ACC in response to monetary reward stimuli. We further predict that the&#xD;
      degree of normalization in fMRI activation will correlate with negative symptom improvement&#xD;
      on aripiprazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative Symptoms as a Deficit in Reward Processing Antipsychotic medications are often able&#xD;
      to relieve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations, delusions, and&#xD;
      disorganization. However the response of deficit symptoms to psychopharmacology remains&#xD;
      disappointing. Many patients with minimal active psychotic symptoms are severely impaired in&#xD;
      their functioning because of enduring deficit syndrome features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key component of the deficit syndrome is a lack of motivation to pursue goals in&#xD;
      educational, occupational, social, and recreational domains. This proposal rests on the&#xD;
      hypothesis that a core feature of the amotivational component of the deficit state is a&#xD;
      deficiency in reward processing. This deficiency in turn fails to provide sufficient&#xD;
      stimulation of conditioning reinforcement of approach behavior serving the pursuit of&#xD;
      rewards. In most patients the impairment is not so severe that the patients fail to pursue&#xD;
      the primary rewards of food and drink. But motivation to pursue more complex secondary&#xD;
      reinforcers such as economic success, stable loving relationships, avocations, intellectual&#xD;
      fulfillment and other uniquely human goals are strikingly lacking in deficit syndrome&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frontal Cortical Hypofunction in Negative Symptoms Refinements in the DA hypothesis have&#xD;
      emphasized an imbalance between mesocortical and subcortical/mesolimbic DA activity.&#xD;
      Hyperactivity of the mesolimbic DA system has been implicated in the positive symptoms of the&#xD;
      illness; hypofunctioning of the mesocortical DA pathway has been implicated in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of negative symptoms (Weinberger 1987; Davis et al.1991). The finding of&#xD;
      neurophysiologic hypofunction of the frontal cortex during cognitive activation studies in&#xD;
      schizophrenic subjects has given rise to the concept of hypofrontality (Weinberger et al.&#xD;
      1986; Berman et al. 1986; for review see Weinberger et al. 1994). Furthermore, frontal&#xD;
      hypofunction has been linked specifically to negative symptoms irrespective of the severity&#xD;
      of positive symptoms in unmedicated schizophrenics (Wolkin et al. 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neural Circuitry of Reward Processing Research into the neural correlates of reward&#xD;
      processing indicates the importance of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons and distributed reward&#xD;
      circuits to the coding of reward anticipation and salience, and the translation of motivation&#xD;
      into approach behavior. Key structures that have been implicated in reward processing on the&#xD;
      basis of animal studies include DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia&#xD;
      nigra and their target areas such as the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), amygdala, and OFC (Wise&#xD;
      1980; Wise and Hoffman 1992; Koob 1992; Robbins and Everitt 1996; see Schultz 2000, 2001 for&#xD;
      review). Circuitry linking these areas is hypothesized to mediate several aspects of reward&#xD;
      processing such as the detection of primary or secondary reward stimuli, prediction of&#xD;
      expected future rewards, and the use of information to control goal-directed or motivated&#xD;
      behavior (Schultz 2000). Recently developed methods are being used to study the reward&#xD;
      pathways in normal humans and subjects with substance abuse disorders in the fMRI&#xD;
      environment. These studies implicate the mesocorticolimbic DA system and functionally&#xD;
      connected areas: OFC, ACC, dorsolateral PFC, amygdala, NAcc, and insula (Grant et al. 1996;&#xD;
      Childress et al. 1999; Maas et al. 1998; Garavan et al. 2000; Kilts et al. 2001; Wexler et&#xD;
      al. 2001). fMRI paradigms using money as a secondary reinforcer reveal activations in many of&#xD;
      these same areas: amygdala, NAcc, ventral striatum, and areas of PFC (Thut et al. 1997;&#xD;
      Elliott et al. 2000; Elliott et al. 2003). The fact that very similar areas are activated by&#xD;
      primary reinforcer paradigms in animal studies, drug cue studies in substance abusers, and&#xD;
      monetary reward paradigms in normal controls suggests that the study of monetary reward&#xD;
      processing is a valid strategy to assess the integrity of reward circuitry in experimental&#xD;
      paradigms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overlap of Reward Circuitry and Areas Implicated in Negative Symptoms As indicated above,&#xD;
      dopaminergic hypofunction in the PFC is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      negative symptoms. The presentation of reward or stimuli that predict reward stimulates the&#xD;
      phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain (Shultz 2000) that innervate the&#xD;
      PFC. Hence there is a critical overlap of circuitry implicated in negative symptoms and&#xD;
      circuitry that subserves reward processing. This overlap supports the use of reward paradigms&#xD;
      to explore the functional integrity of mesocortical DA inputs and PFC function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aripiprazole and Negative Symptoms The novel antipsychotic, aripiprazole, has a unique&#xD;
      pharmacological mechanism of action that makes it potentially unique for the amelioration of&#xD;
      negative symptoms. Aripiprazole is thought to increase DA activity in the PFC by virtue of&#xD;
      its' activity as a partial agonist at post-synaptic DA2 receptors (Burris et al. 2002). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that treatment with aripiprazole will normalize the function of PFC reward&#xD;
      circuitry through increased DA functioning in frontal cortical regions (OFC, ACC) that&#xD;
      subserve reward processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Importance of Proposal for Treatment Indications of Aripiprazole The severe&#xD;
      impairment of motivated behavior in patients with deficit syndrome schizophrenia is strongly&#xD;
      suggestive of an abnormality in the neural circuits that mediate reward processing and the&#xD;
      translation of reward salience to motivated behavior. To date there are no published fMRI&#xD;
      studies of the functioning of reward circuits in subjects with deficit syndrome&#xD;
      schizophrenia. We hypothesize that negative symptom schizophrenics will exhibit impaired fMRI&#xD;
      estimated activation of reward circuitry compared to normal controls, and that aripiprazole&#xD;
      treatment will normalize functioning of this circuitry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demonstration of improvements in negative symptoms in medication trials has been elusive.&#xD;
      Even an agent capable of improving reward processing might not produce detectable decreases&#xD;
      in rating scales designed to measure negative symptoms over the short term. This is because&#xD;
      patients with chronic deficit states have compromised functioning due to the cumulative&#xD;
      effects of social and occupational dysfunction. In patients such as these, the normalization&#xD;
      of reward processing circuits by a medication such as aripiprazole would only be the first&#xD;
      step. These patients are likely to require considerable psychosocial rehabilitation to recoup&#xD;
      occupational and social functioning and achieve meaningful gains in negative symptom rating&#xD;
      scales. However, normalization of reward circuitry function would strongly suggest that&#xD;
      aripiprazole has potential to improve chronic negative symptoms when combined with a&#xD;
      supporting rehabilitative program. Significant changes in reward circuit function would also&#xD;
      strongly support the early intervention potential for aripiprazole to prevent chronic&#xD;
      deterioration in function if first break patients were treated with this agent early in their&#xD;
      course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Ten male schizophrenic subjects ages 18-60 will be recruited. Diagnosis will be&#xD;
      confirmed by structured diagnostic interview (SCID-I). Primary deficit syndrome will be&#xD;
      confirmed by rating with the Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome (SDS), a scale that defines&#xD;
      schizophrenic subjects according to whether they have chronic negative symptoms even across&#xD;
      periods when positive symptoms are in remission (Kirkpatrick et al. 1989). This scale thus&#xD;
      allows for the differentiation of those patients who have negative symptoms consistently&#xD;
      across clinical states from those whose negative symptoms emerge when they are acutely&#xD;
      psychotic and remit when positive symptoms remit. Additionally, subjects must have a minimum&#xD;
      score of 30 on the SANS. Subjects will be excluded for clinically significant unstable&#xD;
      medical illness, history of neurological disease including head trauma with loss of&#xD;
      consciousness &gt;5 minutes, active substance abuse or dependence within the prior three months,&#xD;
      any contraindication to fMRI, left handedness, mental retardation, color blindness,&#xD;
      antipsychotic treatment resistance, or known allergy to or nonresponse to aripiprazole.&#xD;
      Subjects with schizophrenia will be excluded if they do not have a working telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten male normal comparison subjects will recruited, matched in mean age and ethnicity to the&#xD;
      schizophrenic group. Absence of psychopathology will be confirmed by SCID-I, NP version.&#xD;
      Subjects will be excluded for clinically significant unstable medical illness, history of&#xD;
      neurological disease including head trauma with loss of consciousness &gt;5 minutes, active&#xD;
      substance abuse or dependence within the prior three months, any contraindication to fMRI,&#xD;
      left handedness, color blindness, or mental retardation. Normal controls will be matched to&#xD;
      schizophrenic subjects with regard to monthly income so that monetary rewards during the task&#xD;
      will have comparable reinforcement value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment Prior to fMRI scanning all subjects will be assessed for smoking status&#xD;
      by means of the Fagerstrom Smoking Tolerance Questionnaire (Fagerstrom 1978) and nicotine&#xD;
      dependent subjects will be instructed to smoke their usual amount prior to reporting for&#xD;
      scanning. Screening for intact vision (≥ 20/25 uncorrected or corrected with eyeglasses or&#xD;
      contact lenses) by means an eye chart will be conducted. Cognitive status will be assessed in&#xD;
      the following domains: attention (Continuous Performance Test), psychomotor reaction time&#xD;
      (finger tapping test), memory (California Verbal Learning Test), IQ (Weschler Abbreviated&#xD;
      Scale of Intelligence, vocabulary and matrices subtests), and executive function (Stroop&#xD;
      Task). The schizophrenic subjects will be rated for severity of psychopathology by means of&#xD;
      the PANSS, Abrams and Taylor Rating Scale for Emotional Blunting (A&amp;T), SANS, Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression Scale (CGI), and the Quality of Life Scale. Current side effects to antipsychotics&#xD;
      will be assessed by means of the Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Simpson Angus Scale.&#xD;
      Schizophrenic subjects will have 30cc of blood drawn for CBC and SMA-12 to ensure stable&#xD;
      baseline medical status prior to switching to aripiprazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Task Meaningful comparisons of schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic subjects by a&#xD;
      cognitive task necessitates the use of a simple task to minimize confounds related to group&#xD;
      differences in cognitive ability. A parametric manipulation of reward contingency will&#xD;
      control for group differences in task performance. The proposed monetary incentive task,&#xD;
      adapted from that of Elliott et al. (2003), is chosen because of its simplicity and&#xD;
      parametric design. The subjects will be given a simple target detection task in which they&#xD;
      will be instructed to squeeze a response bulb when they see a red or blue square. Different&#xD;
      colored squares will be presented on a screen for 1.3 sec each. When they correctly signal&#xD;
      the target stimuli they will see a reward stimulus informing them of how much money they have&#xD;
      won on that trial. For trials with non-targets (paying no reward if the subject squeezes the&#xD;
      bulb) the subjects will see a neutral text telling them to wait. The reward amounts will vary&#xD;
      from 5¢ to $1 per trial (5¢, 25¢, 50¢, 75¢, or $1). The task will be divided into five blocks&#xD;
      separated by 30 sec rest periods. Each block will contain 40 trials. Trial types will be&#xD;
      presented in randomized order within each block: 30% of trials will contain one of the two&#xD;
      target stimuli. Each block will pay correct responses at one of the five monetary reward&#xD;
      levels. The task is designed specifically to allow for both an &quot;on-off&quot; assessment of&#xD;
      activations in the presence or absence of reward, but also for a parametric analysis of brain&#xD;
      areas that increase their activation with increased reward levels. The subjects will be told&#xD;
      that their payment for participation in the fMRI scan will be the total money they accumulate&#xD;
      by correct responses during the task. This latter point is important in that the money won&#xD;
      during task performance has a real world salience more likely to enhance reward-related&#xD;
      activations than if all subjects automatically were paid the same amount regardless of their&#xD;
      accuracy. Thus the subjects receive actual rather than simulated reward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI Scanning Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI scanning will be performed on a&#xD;
      research dedicated Siemens 3T whole body MRI scanner located in the Emory Hospital MRI&#xD;
      Center. Foam padding will be used to restrict the subjects' head motion within the magnet. 30&#xD;
      axial slices of 3 mm thickness will be acquired parallel to the AC-PC line with a matrix size&#xD;
      of 64 x 64 over a field of view of 22 x 22 cm, using a TE of 30 msec. With this protocol we&#xD;
      have successfully imaged the orbitofrontal cortex with minimal magnetic susceptibility&#xD;
      artifacts. The functional images will be obtained using a T2* weighted spiral-scan pulse&#xD;
      sequence (TR 3000 msec, TE 25 msec, flip angle 60 deg). High resolution anatomical&#xD;
      T1-weighted MR images will be acquired for localization of task-related neural activations&#xD;
      (TR =10 msec, TE = 4.5 msec, TI=900 msec, FOV=24 cm, 256 x 256 matrix, contiguous 3 mm slices&#xD;
      covering the whole brain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aripiprazole Treatment After receiving the first scan, the schizophrenic subjects will be&#xD;
      started on open label aripiprazole 15 mg po qd. Over the subsequent six weeks they will be&#xD;
      titrated to a target dose of 30 mg po qd and maintained on this dose for the next six weeks.&#xD;
      The aripiprazole titration schedule will be as follows: 15 mg Weeks 1-2, 20 mg Weeks 3-6, and&#xD;
      then 30 mg. During the first six weeks of the treatment phase their prior antipsychotic will&#xD;
      be gradually tapered down (75% of total daily dose in Week 1 and 2, 50% of total daily dose&#xD;
      in Weeks 3 and 4, 25% of total daily dose in Week 5 and 6) and then discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be brought in for study visits at the end of Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week&#xD;
      6, and Week 8, Week 10, and Week 12. At each study visit they will be rated with the PANSS,&#xD;
      SANS, CGI, and A&amp;T. Extrapyramidal side effects and akathisia will be rated with the Simpson&#xD;
      Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale respectively. The Quality of Life Scale, the CVLT,&#xD;
      CPT, and Stroop Test will be repeated at the end of Week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rules for Subjects with Schizophrenia There is a risk of symptom exacerbation when&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication is switched. For this reason, several safeguards will be put into&#xD;
      place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will be excluded if they have a history of suicidal, or assaultive behavior&#xD;
           during psychotic decompensations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The subjects will be given a cross-titration whereby their prior antipsychotic&#xD;
           medication is gradually tapered over six weeks while aripiprazole is being titrated to&#xD;
           maximum dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects in the schizophrenia group will be closely monitored during the treatment&#xD;
           phase. They will be given reminder calls the day before each study visit. If they do not&#xD;
           come for a scheduled visit, the study staff will call and reschedule for the soonest day&#xD;
           they can come in. Subjects without a working telephone will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At each visit subjects will be rated with the CGI. If the CGI Global Improvement Scale&#xD;
           is rated 6 (Much Worse) or 7 (Very Much Worse) at any visit, they will be dropped from&#xD;
           the study and their previous antipsychotic will be resumed at the dose prior to&#xD;
           enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI Image Analysis Imaging data will be analyzed by means of MATLAB and statistical&#xD;
      parametric mapping software (SPM99). The images will be resliced and corrected for motion by&#xD;
      registration to the first functional image acquired for each subject using a 6 parameter&#xD;
      transformation (Friston et al 1995). Images will be spatially normalized to a Montreal&#xD;
      Neurological Institute template. A high-pass filter will be used to remove low frequency&#xD;
      noise. Image smoothing using a 6 mm Gaussian kernel will be used to enhance signal-to-noise&#xD;
      ratios and accommodate differences in neuroanatomy to facilitate group comparisons. The&#xD;
      delayed cerebral blood flow response to activation conditions will be modeled using the&#xD;
      standard hemodynamic response function. Statistical analysis will proceed using a random&#xD;
      effects model to examine outcomes of the parametric design of the experiment (Buchel et al.&#xD;
      1998). We will model both linear and nonlinear hemodynamic responses in regions of interest:&#xD;
      Nacc, amygdala, striatum, thalamus, OFC, ACC, and hippocampus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Behavioral Data For Aim 1, cognitive data will be analyzed with a between&#xD;
      subjects MANOVA to compare neurocognitive results between schizophrenics and normal controls.&#xD;
      For Aim 2, behavioral rating scale data and repeated cognitive test scores (for CVLT, Stroop&#xD;
      Test, CPT) will be analyzed with a repeated measures MANOVA model using timepoint as a within&#xD;
      subjects factor.&#xD;

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Although the study was planned as a repeated measures study with fMRI testing at baseline and after 3 months, difficulty with recruitment and technical difficulties with obtaining fMRI data relegated the study to a single baseline timepoint.</limitations_and_caveats>
