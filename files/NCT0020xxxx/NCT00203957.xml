  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the long term tolerability and safety of oral 20 or&#xD;
      40 mg/d doses of Istradefylline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III open-label study, in which patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who&#xD;
      have completed a qualifying istradefylline study will be treated with istradefylline for a&#xD;
      period of up to one additional year. Starting dosage of istradefylline will be 40 mg/d and&#xD;
      maintenance dosage will be at the discretion of the Investigator. The available doses for&#xD;
      istradefylline are 20 and 40 mg/d. Open-label istradefylline treatment will be initiated&#xD;
      after a patient has satisfied all criteria for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo screening and baseline evaluations during which they will be assessed&#xD;
      for eligibility. Screening procedures will vary slightly depending upon the allocation of&#xD;
      patients to one of the following two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Patients who have completed double-blind treatment studies 6002-US-0 13, 6002- US-Ol&#xD;
      S or 6002-EU-007 immediately prior to entering this open-label trial and may have had an&#xD;
      interruption of study drug of 14 days or less. The screening visit for these patients will&#xD;
      correspond to the final visit of the previous istradefylline study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Patients who have previously completed double-blind treatment studies 6002-US- 013,&#xD;
      6002-US-O 18 or 6002-EU-007 or discontinued from open-label study 6002-US-007 and have had an&#xD;
      interruption of study drug greater than 14 days. Screening for these patients will occur at&#xD;
      the Week -2 and Day -1 Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits should occur in the ON state and procedures should be conducted in the order&#xD;
      specified, whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety outcomes will be assessed by physical examination (including neurological&#xD;
      examination), clinical laboratory tests and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening and&#xD;
      at selected subsequent scheduled visits. Vital signs, including weight, concomitant&#xD;
      medications, and adverse events will be monitored regularly throughout the trial. Changes in&#xD;
      anti-parkinsonian medications will be permitted at the Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
