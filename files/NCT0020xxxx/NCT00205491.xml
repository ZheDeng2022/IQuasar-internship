      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with venlafaxine reduces symptoms of&#xD;
      depression in persons with traumatic brain injury.&#xD;

      The study evaluates the benefits of a promising antidepressant medication for the treatment&#xD;
      of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and major depressive disorder (MDD). The study&#xD;
      is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of venlafaxine (a serotonin and&#xD;
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, also known as Effexor). Venlafaxine has been well&#xD;
      established in the treatment of MDD in healthy individuals and is a recommended depression&#xD;
      treatment agent for persons with TBI. By using a rigorous scientific methodology, this study&#xD;
      will be an important first step in advancing the treatment of depression in this population&#xD;
      beyond general impressions to proven treatments.&#xD;

             caused by an external mechanical force as evidenced by: loss of consciousness due to&#xD;
             brain trauma, or post traumatic amnesia (PTA), or skull fracture, or objective&#xD;
             neurological findings that can be reasonably attributed to TBI on physical examination&#xD;
             or mental status examination.&#xD;

          -  Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least three months postinjury&#xD;

             Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) interview&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) scores of 18 or greater on two consecutive&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unstable medical condition, defined as any significant medical condition likely to&#xD;
             require hospitalization during the study period, or requiring adjustment in&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active suicidality&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe depression that, in the investigator's professional opinion, will likely&#xD;
             require hospitalization during the study time period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of bipolar disorder, as defined by SCID interview&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, as defined by SCID interview,&#xD;
