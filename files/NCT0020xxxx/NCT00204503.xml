      The purpose of this study is to determine if Divalproex Sodium can be used to Treat and&#xD;
      Prevent Depression in Patients with Bipolar Disorder who have Comorbid Alcohol&#xD;
      Dependence/Abuse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over half of all patients with bipolar disorder have comorbid substance abuse. The most&#xD;
      common substance of abuse is alcohol, which is most commonly associated with the depressed&#xD;
      phase of the illness. Although there are available treatments for bipolar depression, no&#xD;
      studies have been done to evaluate efficacy in bipolar patients with comorbid substance abuse&#xD;
      disorders. Given the independent open-label evidence for efficacy and safety of divalproex&#xD;
      sodium in alcohol abuse and bipolar depression, divalproex sodium is the most likely&#xD;
      candidate for potential success in bipolar depressed patients with comorbid alcohol abuse or&#xD;
      dependence. The purpose of this study is to determine if Divalproex Sodium can be used to&#xD;
      Treat and Prevent Depression in Patients with Bipolar Disorder who have Comorbid Alcohol&#xD;
      Dependence/Abuse.&#xD;
