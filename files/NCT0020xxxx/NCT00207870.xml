  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supracondylar fractures are the most common elbow fractures in children. In the current&#xD;
      orthopedic literature crossed pinning and lateral-only entry techniques are co-gold standards&#xD;
      of operative treatment. The crossed pinning technique has been shown to be biomechanically&#xD;
      superior especially under torsional loading but has a higher incidence of iatrogenic injury&#xD;
      to the ulnar nerve. All studies comparing these techniques to date have been either&#xD;
      biomechanical or retrospective in nature. A randomized, controlled, prospective study&#xD;
      comparing these two popular techniques has not been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the amount of displacement incurred&#xD;
      when treating type III supracondylar humerus fractures in children with crossed pinning&#xD;
      versus lateral-entry only technique. Overall complication rate, loss of reduction, iatrogenic&#xD;
      neurovascular injury, and pin tract infection rates between the two cohorts will be&#xD;
      evaluated. The study population will comprise all patients less than ten years of age&#xD;
      presenting to Scottish Rite Hospital during the study period with a type III supracondylar&#xD;
      fracture managed by the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Orthopedic Group. All patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to one specific treatment arm based on surgeon preference established at the&#xD;
      onset of the study. The hypothesis to be tested is that no difference in amount of&#xD;
      displacement or overall complication rate is present between these two techniques.&#xD;
      Radiographic parameters measured pre-operatively, immediately post-operatively and four weeks&#xD;
      post-operatively will be quantitatively evaluated and compared. Chart reviews to determine&#xD;
      complications during the treatment period will be made. Pre-study power analysis and&#xD;
      post-study statistical analysis will be performed.&#xD;

      Pre-operative consent forms for study participation will be reviewed with all families at the&#xD;
      time of the pre-operative visit. Screening will be performed at the time of evaluation in the&#xD;
      emergency room. Patients will be assigned to a particular group based on the surgeon that&#xD;
      performs their surgery. Each surgeon at the onset of the study will commit to one technique&#xD;
      of operative management with the understanding that this technique may be abandoned by the&#xD;
      surgeon in any case where it is felt to be inadequate. Changing technique will be considered&#xD;
      a failure of the technique. Data regarding the treatment will be collected from the chart and&#xD;
      x-rays at the time of treatment and at follow up visits in the orthopedic office.&#xD;
