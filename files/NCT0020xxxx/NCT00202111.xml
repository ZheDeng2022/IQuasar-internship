      The purpose of this study is to compare the short and long term outcomes of people who have&#xD;
      colon cancers removed either by laparotomy (a large cut in the abdominal wall) or by a&#xD;
      laparoscopic assisted approach (keyhole surgery). This study involves 37 credentialled&#xD;
      surgeons in 20 approved hospitals across Australasia and during the recruitment period (Jan&#xD;
      1998 to March 2005) 601 patients were recruited into the ALCCaS Trial.&#xD;

      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that tumour related disease free&#xD;
      interval and overall survival are equivalent regardless whether patients receive laparoscopic&#xD;
      colon resection (LCR) or open colon resection (OCR) at three and five years post operatively.&#xD;
      The secondary aims of the study are to determine the safety of LCR compared to OCR and 30 day&#xD;
      mortality and compare post operative pain, paralytic ileus, early and late morbidities&#xD;
      (including wound site recurrence), recovery, transfusion requirements, cost and quality of&#xD;
      life scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ALCCaS Trial is an Australasian, multicentred, prospective, randomised clinical study&#xD;
      comparing laparoscopic and conventional open surgical treatments of colon cancer in adults.&#xD;
      This trial has been recruiting patients since 1998.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomised to receive either laparoscopic or conventional open resection for&#xD;
      colon cancer. A Randomisation Centre was established to provide a 24-hour randomisation&#xD;
      service and this centre is situated in Christchurch, New Zealand. The Health Research Council&#xD;
      of New Zealand Data Safety Committee, chaired by Professor Tom Fleming, access the ALCCaS&#xD;
      Trial annually to ensure that it meets strict ethical and research related criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the recruitment period (Jan 1998 to March 2005) 601 patients were recruited into the&#xD;
      ALCCaS Trial. There have been 37 surgeons involved in recruiting patients at 20 hospitals&#xD;
      within Australia and New Zealand. All surgeons participating in the ALCCaS trial are&#xD;
      accredited in laparoscopic surgical techniques. To gain accreditation, a surgeon must have&#xD;
      carried out no less than 20 supervised colon resections and must provide video evidence of&#xD;
      two laparoscopic colonic resections for review. Surgeons from throughout Australia and New&#xD;
      Zealand are participating in this study. The Research Ethics Committees at a variety of&#xD;
      hospitals throughout New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria, Western&#xD;
      Australia and New Zealand have approved the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of colon resection performed by the individual surgeon will follow standard&#xD;
      oncologically safe principles. The following intra-operative details will be collected, the&#xD;
      patient epidemiology, ASA status, previous abdominal surgery, incision type, site of&#xD;
      carcinoma, modality of diagnosis, pre operative haemoglobin and lung function tests, pre&#xD;
      operative blood transfusion, planned operation, planned incision. Intra operatively the date&#xD;
      of the operation, whether DVT prophylaxis has been used, the type of bowel preparation, the&#xD;
      type of operation performed, if the laparoscopic procedure is performed whether it included&#xD;
      mobilisation of the bowel, ligation of main artery and vein, transection of the bowel,&#xD;
      resection of the bowel and anastomosis done as an intraperitoneal procedure are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of cytotoxic irrigation of the peritoneum, wound and colonic lumen is noted.&#xD;
      Estimated surgical blood loss and intra operative blood transfusion is recorded. The post&#xD;
      operative position of the tumour is noted. The type of incision and size of incision is&#xD;
      recorded. Any reason for change in planned incision is recorded and the theatre utilisation,&#xD;
      and total anaesthetic time and duration of the operative procedure are recorded. Intra&#xD;
      operative temperature record is kept. Reason for stoma formation, if applicable, is recorded.&#xD;
      The intra operative costs and disposable items are identified. Intra operative complications&#xD;
      are identified as well as adverse events involving surgical equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post operative phase the total intravenous fluid requirement, blood transfusion, pain&#xD;
      scores, amount of Morphine used, whether the patient vomited and whether nasogastric tube is&#xD;
      required as well as lung function tests and any adverse events are noted at 30 minutes&#xD;
      following the procedure, 6 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 120 hours, 144&#xD;
      hours, 168 hours and continued daily until the patient is discharged if not already&#xD;
      discharged at that time. At discharge from hospital, total hospital days are identified as&#xD;
      well as time in high dependency unit or intensive care unit, reason for delay in discharge is&#xD;
      noted, post operative events including cardiac, respiratory, renal, ileus, wound infection,&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage and other events are identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathology includes the site of tumour, TNM staging, ACPS staging, length of resected colon,&#xD;
      proximal clearance, distal clearance, number of nodes obtained, tumour differentiation,&#xD;
      venous invasion, perineal invasion and histological type. Adjuvant chemotherapy if planned is&#xD;
      noted. Patients in the study may be entered into an adjuvant chemotherapy trial following&#xD;
      surgery provided the subsequent trial does not have radiation as a component of therapy and&#xD;
      that the chemotherapy trial allows entering of patients from both surgical arms of the study.&#xD;
      Follow up is quarterly for the first year, 6 monthly for year two and three and then annually&#xD;
      until year five. At follow up wounds are check for any evidence of recurrence. A colonoscopy&#xD;
      is performed 12 months following resection and then every three years following that if&#xD;
      negative. Chest xray, abdominal CT or liver ultrasound, a complete blood picture are&#xD;
      performed if clinically indicated, CEA's performed six monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for tumour recurrence and survival. Patients are advised on, and&#xD;
      offered standard treatment with, adjuvant therapy. Follow-up is standardised to provide&#xD;
      accurate data on recurrence and survival and more frequent examinations and investigations&#xD;
      are performed if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency of Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum number of follow-up evaluations is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  every 3 months for the lst year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  every 6 months for the 2nd and 3rd years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  annually for the 4th and 5th years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimal requirements for follow-up investigations are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and examination with a specific check for tumour wound recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colon evaluation including colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy plus barium enema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Annual examination if positive for neoplasia (earlier if preoperative proximal&#xD;
           examination is incomplete for technical reasons); examination every 3 years if negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  haemoglobin and white cell count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  creatinine, SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, CEA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal CT scan or liver ultrasound annually for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life and Complications documentation postoperatively at 2 days, 2 weeks, 2&#xD;
           months and 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE AND OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will determine the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic assisted resection of&#xD;
      colonic adenocarcinoma. It will also answer questions of cost effectiveness and quality of&#xD;
      life improvement. It will determine if port site recurrence is a real issue in this type of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also give valuable data about the outcomes of patients undergoing laparotomy&#xD;
      in regard to current length of hospital stay, effectiveness of post-operative analgesia, in&#xD;
      hospital complications and transfusion requirements.&#xD;
