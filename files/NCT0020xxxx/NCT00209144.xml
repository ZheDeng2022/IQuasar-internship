      The purpose of this study is to determine if intense control of high glucose levels in&#xD;
      patients treated with angioplasty for heart attack has anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two out of three heart attack patients have high blood sugar. Half of these patients have&#xD;
      diabetes and the other half have what is called pre-diabetes, meaning that they have higher&#xD;
      blood sugar than normal but not high enough to have diabetes. Over 40 million Americans have&#xD;
      pre-diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For more than 70 years, doctors have known that patients with high blood sugar do not survive&#xD;
      or recover from heart attacks as well as patients with normal blood sugar. Doctors have not&#xD;
      figured out the reason for this difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best treatment available for heart attacks is called angioplasty. Angioplasty means that&#xD;
      doctors put a small balloon into a blocked blood vessel, blow up the balloon to open the&#xD;
      blockage, and then insert a small wire tube called a stent to hold the blockage open. Blood&#xD;
      thinners and other heart medicines are also given to these patients to help blood get through&#xD;
      the blocked blood vessel. Angioplasty and these medicines have helped many people survive and&#xD;
      recover from heart attacks. But even when doctors use these drugs, balloons and stents,&#xD;
      patients who have high blood sugar still do worse than patients with normal blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to figure out why high blood sugar is bad for patients with heart attacks. Past&#xD;
      research tells us there might be two reasons. The first is that high blood sugar increases&#xD;
      inflammation which is part of the body's natural response to heart attack. Inflammation is&#xD;
      what causes a person's skin to turn hot and red after it is injured. Although inflammation is&#xD;
      part of the body's natural healing process, too much inflammation can be harmful. We think&#xD;
      that patients with high blood sugar during heart attacks have too much inflammation. The&#xD;
      second reason why high blood sugar might be bad for heart attack patients is that high blood&#xD;
      sugar makes blood thicker. When a blood vessel is blocked, thick blood makes it harder for&#xD;
      the heart to get the blood flow it needs. This is why doctors use aspirin and other blood&#xD;
      thinners when they treat patients with heart attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of inflammation and thickness in a person's blood can be measured in a laboratory.&#xD;
      In this study, we want to measure the amount of inflammation and thickness in patients' blood&#xD;
      to see if there is a difference between patients with normal blood sugar, patients with&#xD;
      pre-diabetes, and patients with diabetes. If we can show that there is a difference, this&#xD;
      will help us to understand why high blood sugar is bad for patients with heart attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also want to see if lowering a patient's high blood sugar is helpful during a heart&#xD;
      attack. The standard therapy for lowering blood sugar in diabetic patients with heart attacks&#xD;
      is to check their blood sugar four times each day while they are in the hospital, and to give&#xD;
      them a shot of a medicine called insulin that helps bring the blood sugar level down if it is&#xD;
      high. However, research tells us that this way of treating diabetic patients doesn't get&#xD;
      their blood sugar low enough. Also, patients with pre-diabetes and patients who have diabetes&#xD;
      but don't know it usually don't get any insulin, so their sugar levels are usually allowed to&#xD;
      run high while they are in the hospital. In this study, we will treat half of diabetic and&#xD;
      pre-diabetic patients the usual way and give the other half insulin through an IV for the&#xD;
      first 24 hours that they are in the hospital. If we compare the inflammation and blood&#xD;
      thickness between patients treated the usual way and patients treated with more insulin, we&#xD;
      can figure out if lowering blood sugar more than usual is helpful to patients with heart&#xD;
      attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we can find out why high blood sugar is harmful to patients with heart attacks, and if we&#xD;
      can show that treating these patients with more insulin than usual lessens these harmful&#xD;
      effects, then we will be able to improve the way that these patients are treated. This could&#xD;
      result in better survival and recovery for many heart attack patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who volunteer for this study will get the best treatment available for heart&#xD;
      attack- angioplasty, blood thinners, and the other heart medications that are usually given&#xD;
      to these patients. Patients who have high blood sugar will be divided into two groups. One&#xD;
      group will have their blood sugars measured and treated in the usual way. The other group&#xD;
      will be treated with insulin run through an IV for 24 hours. After 24 hours, all patients&#xD;
      will be treated in the usual way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About one tablespoon of blood will be drawn from each patient at the time they sign up for&#xD;
      the study and then 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours later. This blood will be used to test for&#xD;
      inflammation and blood thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only ways in which patients who volunteer for this study will be treated differently from&#xD;
      the standard of care are that they might receive more insulin than usual and they will have&#xD;
      more blood drawn than usual. Giving extra insulin to these patients should not cause them&#xD;
      harm, and may even help them. Since only about 5 tablespoons of extra blood will be drawn&#xD;
      from each patient, this should not cause patients any harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To see what happens to blood inflammation and thickness in heart attack patients with&#xD;
           normal blood sugar and compare this to patients with high blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To find out lowering patients' blood sugar levels more than we currently do will result&#xD;
           in less blood inflammation and thickness.&#xD;
