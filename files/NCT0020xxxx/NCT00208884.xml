  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the risks associated with heart transplantation is failure of the graft. A graft is&#xD;
      where the new heart is attached to the original vessels in the body. Approximately 10% of&#xD;
      children suffer graft failure which, leads to heart failure and possible death. The problem&#xD;
      is that we do not know some of the causes of graft failure thus, it is difficult to diagnose&#xD;
      early and treat. Due to graft failure, lots of children are placed back on the transplant&#xD;
      list and receive another new heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we plan to perform a retrospective chart review looking to see if we can&#xD;
      correlate graft failure with a problem with the vessels called coronary allograft&#xD;
      vasculopathy or rejection. In order to do this, we will collect data from patient's charts&#xD;
      that have been diagnosed with graft failure and compare their clinical presentation/data to&#xD;
      pathology reports of the explanted hearts from these children. Explanted hearts are the old&#xD;
      transplanted hearts that are removed in order to put a new heart into the body. Explanted&#xD;
      hearts at our institution are always sent to pathology for analysis thus it will be quite&#xD;
      easy to perform this review.&#xD;

      The objectives are to describe the pathology findings from the examination of the explanted&#xD;
      heart and correlate them with clinical variables such as catheterization data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children's Healthcare of Atlanta performs approximately 12-15 heart transplants a year. To&#xD;
      date, there have been 19 re-transplantations for late graft failure at Children's. The&#xD;
      pathologic and clinical records of these 19 patients will be studied. All data collected will&#xD;
      be entered into a database for future analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective review of standard pathology findings from the examination of the explanted&#xD;
      hearts will be conducted in order to determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evidence of CAV (coronary allograft vasculopathy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evidence of Endocardial fibroelastosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evidence of Rejection (acute and chronic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evidence of Myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evidence of Fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evidence of Fatty infiltration&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective review of patient charts will also be utilized to compare the pathologic&#xD;
      findings to clinical data obtained prior to re-transplantation. The following information&#xD;
      will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type of transplant method&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient age at time of transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Echocardiographic Data including Tissue Doppler Imaging (if available)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Catheterization data&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. CAV as identified by coronary angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Ventricular end-diastolic pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Cardiac index&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical rejection history&#xD;
