      I. SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the safety of clinical use of ziprasidone in children&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the dosages that have been employed clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ziprasidone, a recently released atypical agent is likely to be as effective as other&#xD;
      neuroleptics in treating psychiatric symptoms in children, but may have the considerable&#xD;
      health advantage of not causing weight gain. Ziprasidone administration has been associated&#xD;
      with prolongation of the QTc interval (mean=20 msec), an electrocardiographic measure of&#xD;
      ventricular repolarization (Federal Drug Administration, 2000). There are no reports&#xD;
      regarding the use of ziprasidone in autism, and data regarding the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      ziprasidone in children is extremely limited. The only published study of ziprasidone in&#xD;
      children found that it was safe and effective in treating Tourette's syndrome in children&#xD;
      aged 7 to 17 years of age (Sallee et al, 2000). Because children are being treated with&#xD;
      ziprasidone despite a paucity of safety data, it is important to begin to collect and review&#xD;
      available data, including that from clinical usage. Some children who receive services within&#xD;
      the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services of Drexel University College of Medicine have&#xD;
      been treated with ziprasidone. The charts of the children and adolescents will contain data&#xD;
      regarding exposure to ziprasidone and laboratory data and ECG's that can be reviewed to&#xD;
      determine whether ziprasidone treatment has been associated with changes in weight,&#xD;
      laboratory values and ECG's. We propose to review the charts of patients who have been&#xD;
      treated with our services since March 1, 2001 XXX because such patients may have been exposed&#xD;
      to ziprasidone (ziprasidone received FDA approval on February 5, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Setting: The setting for this study will be the Specialty Clinic for Pervasive&#xD;
      Developmental Disorders, part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at&#xD;
      Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Subjects: Subjects will be 15 children and adolescents who meet the DSM-IV Criteria for&#xD;
      Pervasive Developmental Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Design: This is a 6-week pilot study employing open treatment with ziprasidone. Subjects&#xD;
      will be rated at baseline and thereafter assessed weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Medication: Subjects will be treated openly with ziprasidone. Should untoward effects&#xD;
      occur, the dosage of the medication will be reduced or the medication will be discontinued,&#xD;
      as clinically appropriate. Subjects will not receive other concomitant psychotropic&#xD;
      medication during the study. Medication will be taken concomitant with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ziprasidone Dosing Strategy: Ziprasidone tablets (5, 10, and 20 mg) will be employed for the&#xD;
      study. The dosage range for ziprasidone will be 5 mg/day to 40 mg/day. Every effort will be&#xD;
      made to reach and maintain a therapeutic dosage by week four of the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For subjects who weigh less than 25 kg, starting dosage will be 5 mg/every other day.&#xD;
           After 3 days, the dosage can be increased to 5 mg. By week 2, subjects can be increased&#xD;
           to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For subjects who weigh greater than 25 kg, the starting dosage will be 5 mg/day. After&#xD;
           three days, the dosage can be increased to 10 mg/day. By week two, subjects can be&#xD;
           increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg&#xD;
           increments weekly as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Should 5 mg tablets not be available, the dosing schedule will be altered to have a&#xD;
      starting dosage of 10 mg, and dosage increases will be made in 10 mg increments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary efficacy measure: The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Psychopharmacology&#xD;
           Bulletin, 1985). The efficacy of treatments can be judged on their ability to enhance&#xD;
           global functioning, an assessment that is particularly relative in a pilot study. The&#xD;
           CGI consists of three global scales measuring severity of illness, global improvement,&#xD;
           and drug effect, and has been useful in measuring drug treatment effect in this&#xD;
           population (see Campbell and Palij, 1985). The PI and another trained rater will&#xD;
           complete this scale. Although only members of the research team generally complete this&#xD;
           scale, it will additionally be completed by the subject's parent/caretaker. Having it&#xD;
           completed by the parent/caretaker will take only minutes and may result in useful data.&#xD;
           This measure will be completed weekly beginning at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary efficacy measure: Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (Psychopharmacology&#xD;
           Bulletin, 1985). The CPRS was developed by the Psychopharmacology Branch of the NIMH to&#xD;
           rate childhood psychopathology. Each of the items is rated from &quot;1&quot; (not present) to &quot;7&quot;&#xD;
           (extremely severe). The first 28 items of this scale require no verbal response on the&#xD;
           part of the subject, making them appropriate for rating children and adolescents with&#xD;
           Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Of these 28 items, 14 are particularly relevant in&#xD;
           autism (see Campbell and Palij, 1985): they assess the symptoms for which drug treatment&#xD;
           is indicated including hyperactivity, aggression, self-abusive behavior, temper&#xD;
           tantrums, lability of mood, irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypies. A&#xD;
           composite sum of these 14 items, the CPRS-14, will be constructed and employed as a&#xD;
           secondary outcome measure, a procedure used by a number of investigators (Anderson et&#xD;
           al, 1989; Campbell et al, 1986, 1989, 1993; Findling et al, 1997; Sanchez et al, 1996).&#xD;
           We analyzed our data using the CPRS-14; the ICC was 0.8978. In addition, 4 factors&#xD;
           derived from these 14 items will be examined. They include: autism,&#xD;
           anger/uncooperativeness, hyperactivity, and speech deviance (Overall and Campbell,&#xD;
           1988). This measure will be completed at baseline and at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Safety measures: (1) A physical exam will be completed at baseline. (2) Height, weight,&#xD;
           blood pressure, and pulse will be obtained and recorded at baseline and at each visit&#xD;
           during the study. (3) The following laboratory measures will be obtained at baseline and&#xD;
           repeated at the end of the treatment phase: complete blood count with differential,&#xD;
           liver functions, and electrocardiogram. Serum prolactin will be obtained at baseline and&#xD;
           at the end of the treatment phase. These laboratory studies will be repeated at the end&#xD;
           of the treatment phase of the study. Any other clinically appropriate tests and&#xD;
           evaluations will also be completed whenever needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Untoward effects will be measured and recorded at each visit employing the following&#xD;
      measures: (1) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES); (2) Treatment&#xD;
      Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS); (3) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (all from&#xD;
      Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985); and (4) the Neurologic Rating Scale (Simpson and Angus,&#xD;
      1970). The DOTES and TESS measure a wide range of possible untoward effects. The AIMS&#xD;
      measures dyskinesias. The Neurologic Rating Scale measures other forms of extrapyramidal&#xD;
      effects that can occur with neuroleptics such as dystonias, parkinsonian effects, and&#xD;
      akathisia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Procedures: All patients appropriate to the study and their parent/caretakers will be&#xD;
      approached and informed consent and assent (in subjects under 14 years) will be obtained.&#xD;
      Subjects meeting the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion Criteria, will enter the&#xD;
      baseline period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (week 0): Subjects will be rated at baseline employing the CGI and the CPRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Treatment (week 6): At the end of the treatment period, subjects will again be rated&#xD;
      employing the CGI and the CPRS (selected items).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, each subject will be rated on the CGI at each visit so that data from the last&#xD;
      visit is available should the subject terminate the study prematurely. If it is known that a&#xD;
      subject will terminate the study at a visit before week 6, the subject will be rated with the&#xD;
      CGI and the CPRS at that visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All safety measures will be completed at each visit. Laboratory measures and EKG will be&#xD;
      obtained in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Analysis: This is a pilot study whose purpose is to get initial safety and efficacy data&#xD;
      with ziprasidone in children with autism. We will perform an ANOVA, repeated measures, for&#xD;
      CGI severity scores, the CPRS-14 and the CPRS factors. Similar analyses will be performed for&#xD;
      safety measures including for weight, prolactin and other laboratory measures, and EKG&#xD;
      indices.&#xD;
