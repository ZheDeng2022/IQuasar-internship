    <textblock>
      Previous studies using topiramate in Tourette subjects have shown that with the use of this&#xD;
      medication subjects report that their tics get better. The purpose of this study is to study&#xD;
      if topiramate improves the symptoms of Tourette syndrome, such as motor tics, or other&#xD;
      associated symptoms such as attention or obsessive-compulsive problems.&#xD;

      This study consists of three phases: Screening/Washout Phase, Double-Blind Phase and Taper&#xD;
      Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING/WASHOUT PHASE: Your study doctor or his staff will review with you any medications&#xD;
      that you are currently taking and may instruct you, if appropriate, to discontinue taking&#xD;
      certain medications. Your study doctor or his staff will explain how long you need to stop&#xD;
      taking each drug before you can start the study. Depending on the type of medications you may&#xD;
      be taking, the Screening/Washout Visit (Visit 1 of the study) may have to be completed in two&#xD;
      visits. The screening/washout phase may take up to 90 days. If you agree to participate, the&#xD;
      study doctor or his staff will carry out tests to see if you are eligible for this study. At&#xD;
      the Screening/Washout Visit, you will have a medical and psychiatric history review&#xD;
      (including medications you have taken for treating Tourette Syndrome) and a physical&#xD;
      examination (including sitting blood pressure, pulse, temperature, weight and height). A&#xD;
      blood sample will be taken (approximately 2-3 teaspoons) and tested to rule out any&#xD;
      abnormalities. You will be asked to give a urine sample that will be tested for drug use and,&#xD;
      if you are a female that is capable of having a child, to ensure that you are not pregnant at&#xD;
      the time of study entry. The pregnancy test must be negative for you to continue in the&#xD;
      study. Additionally, you may not currently be breastfeeding to continue in the study. You&#xD;
      will undergo a medical and psychiatric evaluation. You will be asked to answer questions&#xD;
      using scales, including one that measures the severity of your symptoms of Tourette Syndrome&#xD;
      and one that measures your symptoms, if any, of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&#xD;
      (A-D/HD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TITRATION/MAINTANENCE PHASE: If you continue to qualify for the study after the Visit 1 tests&#xD;
      have been reviewed by the study doctor or his staff and you have completed the washout phase,&#xD;
      you will return to your study doctor's office for Visit 2. The length of time between Visit 1&#xD;
      and Visit 2 will depend on the kind of medications you are taking (and may need to stop&#xD;
      before entering this study). At Visit 2, you will have your blood pressure, pulse and weight&#xD;
      measured. You will be asked to answer questions for the same two scales that you completed at&#xD;
      Visit 1. You are asked to return all medication bottles (even if empty, partially used or&#xD;
      unused) to each study visit. It is very important for us to be able to check study drug&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked questions about how you are feeling and if you have started taking any new&#xD;
      medications or had changes in other medications you may be taking since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you continue to meet eligibility requirements for the study, you will enter the study. You&#xD;
      will be assigned by chance to one of two treatment groups. You may receive either topiramate&#xD;
      or placebo (an inactive substance). This makes the assessment of the study drug much fairer.&#xD;
      The chances you are receiving the study drug versus placebo are 1 to 1 or equal (50% chance&#xD;
      that you will receive topiramate and 50% chance that you will receive placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last approximately 10 weeks. You will begin the study by taking 1 tablet of&#xD;
      study medication (topiramate 25 mg or placebo) in the evening. This will be Day 1 of the&#xD;
      study. After one week of this phase of the study, your study medication dose will be&#xD;
      increased to 2 tablets (topiramate 50 mg or placebo) one tablet in the morning and one in the&#xD;
      evening. Your study medication dose may continue to be increased until you have reached the&#xD;
      dose level the study doctor determines to be appropriate for you, or, you are taking a&#xD;
      maximum dose of 200 mgs per day of study medication (topiramate or placebo). Your study&#xD;
      doctor may adjust your study medication dose as necessary. Study medication will be provided&#xD;
      in 25 mg tablets of topiramate or placebo. Medication is provided in child-resistant bottles.&#xD;
      All bottles should be returned (regardless of whether they are partial, empty or full) at&#xD;
      each visit. It is important that you follow your study doctor or his staff's instructions on&#xD;
      when and how to take the study medication. You will be expected to visit your study doctor or&#xD;
      his staff again on Day 28 (Visit 3), Day 56 (Visit 4) and Day 70 (Visit 5) after beginning&#xD;
      treatment. At Visit 5 (Day 70), you will be given instructions about reducing your study&#xD;
      medication gradually for the next week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, you will have your blood pressure, pulse, temperature and weight measured. You&#xD;
      will be asked how you are feeling and if you have started taking any new medications or had&#xD;
      changes in other medications you may be taking. At Visits 3 and 5 you will be asked again to&#xD;
      answer questions for all of the scales that you completed at Visit 2. At Visits 3, 4 and 5,&#xD;
      the study doctor or his staff will complete the scale that assesses the severity of your&#xD;
      condition. At Visits 3 and 5, the study doctor or his staff will complete one scale that&#xD;
      assesses the severity of your Tourette Syndrome symptoms. At Visits 3, 4 and 5 you will have&#xD;
      a urine pregnancy test performed again if you are a female capable of bearing a child. The&#xD;
      test must be negative to continue in the study. You will have blood drawn again&#xD;
      (approximately one teaspoon) at Visits 3 and 5 to make sure that your liver is functioning&#xD;
      properly and that your electrolytes (blood chemistry measurements) are also within normal&#xD;
      range. At Visit 5 you will have another physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be called weekly between Visits 2 and 3 (Days 7, 14 and Day 21 of the study) and&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4 (Days 35 and 42 of the study) on the telephone by one of the people working on&#xD;
      this study. During these phone calls you will be asked how you are feeling, if you have had&#xD;
      any changes in medications you are taking and how you are doing with the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAPER PHASE: You will visit the study doctor or his staff again on Day 77 (Visit 6) after you&#xD;
      have completely stopped taking the study medication. You must keep all medication packaging&#xD;
      and any unused medication, and bring it back to the study doctor or his staff at each visit.&#xD;
      At this visit, you will have your blood pressure and pulse taken and your weight measured.&#xD;
      You will be asked again to answer questions for the scale that measures the severity of your&#xD;
      symptoms of Tourette Syndrome. If you are a female capable of bearing a child, a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test will be performed. You will be asked how you are feeling and if you have&#xD;
      started taking any new medications or had changes in other medications you may be taking.&#xD;
