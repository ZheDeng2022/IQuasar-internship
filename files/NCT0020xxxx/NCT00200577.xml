      The objective of this multicentric Phase III study is to confirm the results of the phase&#xD;
      I-II study (Dreno B &amp; Al. Cancer Immunol Immunother 2002; 51: 539-456) which demonstrated the&#xD;
      preventive effect of a treatment by TIL (Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes) combined with IL2&#xD;
      (Interleukin 2; low dose injected subcutaneously) on the metastatic relapse in the stage III&#xD;
      melanoma patients with only one invaded lymphnode.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this open, multicentric (Grenoble, Montpellier, Nantes, Angers, Caen, Le Mans, Poitiers,&#xD;
      Rennes, Tours) randomized study, selected patients with only one invaded lymphnode confirmed&#xD;
      by anatomopathological exam will be randomized to one of the following arms: 1-Control group:&#xD;
      patients of this group will not receive any treatment and will have the same clinical&#xD;
      follow-up as the treated group. 2- TIL-IL2 group: treated patients will receive two&#xD;
      injections of TIL combined with IL2. Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes will be obtained from a&#xD;
      small piece of tumour tissue removed from the invaded lymphnode after surgery. TIL will be&#xD;
      grown in larger number in laboratory during 6 weeks. Patients randomized in treatment arm&#xD;
      will receive two injection of TIL (the first about 6 and the second about 10 weeks&#xD;
      post-surgery). Administration of TIL will be combined with a low dose of IL2 (6 million U.I.&#xD;
      per day) injected subcutaneously from J1 to J5 and J8 to J12 following the day of TIL&#xD;
      infusion. The same dose and duration of IL2 treatment will be used for the second injection&#xD;
      of TIL performed one month later. After 2 months adjuvant therapy, patients received no other&#xD;
      treatment. Only a regular follow-up was performed.&#xD;
