      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension affects 25% of adults in the United States and remains a leading cause of heart&#xD;
      disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Despite numerous effective treatments, only 25% of&#xD;
      people with hypertension are at goal blood pressure (BP). The chronic care model suggests&#xD;
      that BP control can be achieved by improving patient self-care and the systems through which&#xD;
      care is delivered. Patient self-care efforts should be directed at counteracting the effects&#xD;
      of obesity, physical inactivity, poor dietary pattern, and non-adherence to prescribed&#xD;
      medications on BP. In addition, efforts should be directed at the use of quality improvement&#xD;
      systems that can counteract the well-documented non-adherence of primary care MDs to&#xD;
      established clinical practice guidelines. In addition to improving BP control, these&#xD;
      approaches can also reduce costs associated with hypertension and its consequences. However,&#xD;
      given the resources that would be required to implement such approaches, it is critical that&#xD;
      their effectiveness be rigorously established. This controlled study will test the separate&#xD;
      and combined effects of a behavioral intervention for patients and a CQI intervention for MDs&#xD;
      on BP control. The patient intervention will employ proven behavioral methods for promoting a&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle and adherence to medication regimens. The MD intervention will use a CQI&#xD;
      approach to provide training, motivation, and feedback on performance in a non-threatening&#xD;
      way to promote continuous self-improvement and adherence to clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hypertension Improvement Project (HIP) is a randomized, controlled study that will test&#xD;
      the separate and combined effects of a CQI intervention for MDs and a behavioral intervention&#xD;
      for patients on BP control. MDs will be selected from practices in the Duke Primary Care&#xD;
      Research Consortium that serve low-income and minority populations. Practices will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the MD intervention or to the MD control condition. Within these&#xD;
      practices, all MDs will receive the same intervention and their patients will be individually&#xD;
      randomized to the patient intervention or to the patient usual care condition. The MD&#xD;
      intervention consists of the following three main elements: 1) on-line training modules; 2)&#xD;
      an evaluation and treatment algorithm for use in the clinic; and 3) a CQI procedure involving&#xD;
      assessment of clinical performance measures and feedback to MDs on their adherence to&#xD;
      guidelines. The performance data will be collected for 18 months and feedback will be&#xD;
      provided to MDs every 3 months. Patients from these practices (approximately 50% women, at&#xD;
      least 40% African American, and 90% low-income) will be randomly assigned to patient&#xD;
      intervention or usual care. The patient intervention consists of a 6-month behavioral&#xD;
      intervention aimed at lifestyle changes to lower BP and promote adherence to prescribed BP&#xD;
      medications. BP and other follow-up measurements will be performed at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention and a year later (at 6 and 18 months post-randomization). The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be the proportion of patients in each treatment group that have adequate BP control at 6&#xD;
      months. BP control is defined by the Joint National Committee 6 (JNC-6) goals (systolic BP&#xD;
      less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP less than 90 mm Hg for most patients; lower goals for&#xD;
      patients with cardiovascular or renal disease, or diabetes). Other outcomes of this study&#xD;
      will include BP control at 18 months, MD adherence to national guidelines, and patient&#xD;
      adherence to lifestyle recommendations and medication regimens. A cost analysis will also be&#xD;
      done. The study will enroll 500 patients in 10 practices (approximately 20 MDs), and will&#xD;
      have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.3 for the primary outcome. The HIP study will&#xD;
      test practical interventions for improving hypertension control that can be broadly&#xD;
      implemented and can reduce CVD risk.&#xD;
