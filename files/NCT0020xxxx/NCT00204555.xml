  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Results from a pilot study demonstrated that topical imiquimod could clear superficial and&#xD;
      nodular BCCs. Three phase II dose response studies in subjects with nodular BCC (nBCC) showed&#xD;
      that the histological cure rates with imiquimod depend on the doses applied per week and the&#xD;
      duration of treatment. Daily dosing or 5 times per week applications showed higher total&#xD;
      clearance rates than 3 times per week dosing or less frequent dosing. Furthermore, a 12 week&#xD;
      treatment period resulted in better efficacy results than a duration of only 6 weeks. On the&#xD;
      other hand, local skin reactions increased with the doses applied per week. So a prolonged&#xD;
      treatment period of 8 or 12 weeks with an application frequence of 3 times a week seems to be&#xD;
      a good compromise between efficacy and safety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a malignant skin cancer that is believed to develop from the&#xD;
      basal layer of the epidermis. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the primary cause of BCC. It&#xD;
      induces local and systemic immuno-suppression, p53 mutations, pyrimidine covalent dimers in&#xD;
      desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and bcl-2 overexpression. All of these UV-induced changes are&#xD;
      believed to be critical in the pathogenesis of BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical application of imiquimod induces local interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), interleukin-12&#xD;
      (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), with a resulting cytokine cascade that&#xD;
      may induce and/or support a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (Th1) immune response. Intralesional&#xD;
      IFN-alpha has been shown to be effective for the treatment of BCC. Imiquimod may be an&#xD;
      effective therapy for BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from a pilot study demonstrated that topical imiquimod could clear superficial and&#xD;
      nodular BCCs. Three phase II dose response studies in subjects with nodular BCC (nBCC) showed&#xD;
      that the histological cure rates with imiquimod depend on the doses applied per week and the&#xD;
      duration of treatment. Daily dosing or 5 times per week applications showed higher total&#xD;
      clearance rates than 3 times per week dosing or less frequent dosing. Furthermore, a 12 week&#xD;
      treatment period resulted in better efficacy results than a duration of only 6 weeks. On the&#xD;
      other hand, local skin reactions increased with the doses applied per week. So a prolonged&#xD;
      treatment period of 8 or 12 weeks with an application frequence of 3 times a week seems to be&#xD;
      a good compromise between efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current safety and efficacy study of imiquimod 5% cream in the treatment of nodular basal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (nBCC) will use a composite endpoint including both a clinical (visual)&#xD;
      assessment of the target tumor site and a histological evaluation of an excisional surgery&#xD;
      taken from the target tumor site for primary assessment of complete tumor clearance 8 weeks&#xD;
      post treatment.&#xD;
