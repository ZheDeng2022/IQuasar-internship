  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We, the researchers at Centre National de Greffe de Moelle Osseuse, have shown in a&#xD;
      randomised study (in press), that a low dose of unfractionated heparin (100 IU/kg/daily) was&#xD;
      safe and effective to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infection in patients with&#xD;
      haemato-oncological disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective randomised controlled trial is to compare the incidence of&#xD;
      catheter-related bloodstream infection in 2 groups of patients with haemato-oncological&#xD;
      disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: heparin impregnated catheters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: low-dose unfractionated heparin (100 IU/kg/daily)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Studies have shown that catheter-related infection may be due to fibrin deposition associated&#xD;
      with catheters. Interventions designed to decrease fibrin deposition and thrombus formation&#xD;
      have the potential to reduce catheter-related infections. Seven randomised studies have been&#xD;
      performed to assess the safety and efficacy of heparin (either as an infusion or bonded to&#xD;
      central venous catheter) on central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections. Although&#xD;
      a meta-analysis of 4 studies looking at heparin either as an infusion or bonded to central&#xD;
      venous catheter showed a strong trend for a reduction in catheter-related bloodstream&#xD;
      infection with the use of heparin, these studies used variable definitions of&#xD;
      catheter-related infections.&#xD;
