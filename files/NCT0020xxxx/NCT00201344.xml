      -  To investigate the efficacy of adjuvant PFL chemotherapy after radiotherapy vs&#xD;
           radiotherapy alone in AJC stage IV nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. The endpoints of&#xD;
           the study includes : overall survival, relapse free survival, distant metastasis and&#xD;
           local-regional control rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the toxicities of the two treatment methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The head and neck contracts study tested induction and maintenance chemotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with advanced head and neck cancers.There were no significant differences in survival between&#xD;
      the two groups, but disease free survival was prolonged in the maintenance arm and not in the&#xD;
      induction arm. Time to and frequency of distant metastases as the first site of relapse were&#xD;
      significantly better for those on the maintenance arm. Many trials, designed several years&#xD;
      ago, delivered single agent chemotherapy and were not particularly intensive. Most clinical&#xD;
      trials were dealing with a heterogenous group of head and neck cancer patients. We felt that&#xD;
      a better choice of adjuvant chemotherapy on cancers should include: (1) localized cancers&#xD;
      with high metastatic potential following effective local treatment; (2) effective&#xD;
      chemotherapy available; (3) chemotherapy should be intensive and effective enough to avoid&#xD;
      the development of drug resistance. Of course, NPC had long been regarded as one of the most&#xD;
      suitable head and neck cancers that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy due to its unique&#xD;
      high response rate to chemotherapy and high metastatic potential after radiotherapy for&#xD;
      localized, advanced staged disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If radiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy can improve the treatment results of standard&#xD;
      radiotherapy by increasing the survival rate, decreasing the metastatic rate and local&#xD;
      recurrence rate, then many NPC patients may benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose this phase III study of radiotherapy with or without adjuvant PFL&#xD;
      chemotherapy in advanced stage NPC patients.&#xD;
