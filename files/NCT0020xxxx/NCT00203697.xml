  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary fibrosis is essentially scarring in the lungs. Some types (DIP, NSIP) most often&#xD;
      respond to therapy. Others like UIP (usual interstitial pneumonitis) rarely respond. UIP&#xD;
      frequently progresses and has a poor prognosis with a survival of three to five years. In&#xD;
      UIP, most often the cause cannot be determined and is therefore called Idiopathic Pulmonary&#xD;
      Fibrosis (IPF). A prevalence rate of 27-29 cases/100,000 has been reported that may even be&#xD;
      as high as 250 cases/100,000 in individuals 75 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal pulmonary disorder. Conventional&#xD;
      treatment with immunosuppressive therapy has been disappointing, with a median survival of&#xD;
      &lt;40% at five years after diagnosis. Moreover, this therapy may lead to premature deaths that&#xD;
      are a result of immunosuppression and susceptibility to infectious disease. Another problem&#xD;
      related to IPF, is that we have an incomplete picture of the natural history of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of this disorder. Clearly, new strategies for therapy are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published evidence suggests that less than 20% of patients with IPF respond to&#xD;
      corticosteroids (prednisone). In patients that fail steroids, immunosuppressant drugs such as&#xD;
      azathioprine or cyclophosphamide are used. An international consensus statement recommends&#xD;
      both steroids and azathioprine or cyclophosphamide from the onset of treatment. Unfortunately&#xD;
      a large number of trials have shown little or no effect of these drugs on the progression of&#xD;
      disease. There are currently no FDA approved drugs for the treatment of IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory findings establish that human specimens of Interstitial Lung Diseases including&#xD;
      IPF demonstrate an impalance in expression of proteins (Th2 Cytokines, CC Chemokines, and CXC&#xD;
      Chemokines). When these protein levels are in excess or low, they alter the normal lung&#xD;
      mechanism, causing angiogenesis (abnormal blood vessel formation), inflammation, scar tissue&#xD;
      formation and impaired immunity of the patient. We hope to establish that the efficacy of&#xD;
      anti-angiogenetic agent as an add on therapy for IPF patients, will prove to bring&#xD;
      stabilization or improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minocycline has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis (new abnormal blood vessel formation) and&#xD;
      thus affect the fibrotic process (prevent scar tissue formation). Laboratory and animal&#xD;
      studies support a potential therapeutic role for Minocycline in IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minocycline is a semi synthetic derivative of tetracycline. It was first marketed as an&#xD;
      antibiotic in 1972. Clinical trials of minocycline have mainly been performed in sexually&#xD;
      transmissible diseases and in acne. Minocycline is also used to treat several other diseases&#xD;
      such as nocardiasis, mycobacteriosis, leprosy, lyme disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, autoimmune&#xD;
      bullous dermatitis, carteaud disease, and prurigo. The usual side effects of minocycline are:&#xD;
      lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo and pigmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will investigate genetic, molecular, cellular, whole animal models, and human specimens&#xD;
      from patients with fibrotic lung disease to test our prediction: The pathogenesis of&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring) is due to &quot;multiple hits&quot; that causes an inbalance of&#xD;
      certain mediators (proteins) that are responsible for abnormal blood vessel formation, scar&#xD;
      tissue formation (with and without inflammation inside the lungs) and impaired immunity of&#xD;
      the patient. Each of the 3 projects in this proposal have a direct link to other projects and&#xD;
      clinical core. The SCOR clinical core will identify and enroll patients with Interstitial&#xD;
      Lung diseases (ILD), including IPF. The clinical core will collect clinical data, as well as&#xD;
      obtain fluids from lung washings and human lung tissue specimens. Each project will use human&#xD;
      specimens as indicated in each of their specific aims to correlate their findings with&#xD;
      response to therapy.&#xD;
