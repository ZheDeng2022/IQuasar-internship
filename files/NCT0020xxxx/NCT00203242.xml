      The purpose of this study is to collect and evaluate information on the use of Depakote&#xD;
      Extended Release (ER) and Depacon Intravenous (IV) in patients with cluster headaches.&#xD;
      Patients who are currently in a cluster cycle will be treated with 2 consecutive days of IV&#xD;
      Depacon followed by oral Depakote ER. Patients will receive a total of 1,000mg of Depacon and&#xD;
      1,000mg of Depakote ER each day. Patients may have a 3rd day of IV Depacon followed by oral&#xD;
      Depakote ER if the primary investigator believes it to be beneficial. The patient is then&#xD;
      sent home on oral Depakote ER. The dose of Depakote ER can range from 500mg to 2,000mg this&#xD;
      dose is to be determined by the primary investigator. The patient will continue the oral&#xD;
      Depakote ER until the end of their cluster cycle or for a maximum of 6 weeks, which ever&#xD;
      comes first.&#xD;

      This study will consist of four visits (3 visits if the screening visit and first treatment&#xD;
      visit are on the same day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening visit can be performed either before an active cluster period or once the&#xD;
      cluster period has already started. If the subject agrees to participate, the study doctor&#xD;
      will determine if they are eligible for this study. The subject will be asked about their&#xD;
      headache history, and medical history including all medications they are currently taking. A&#xD;
      brief physical examination and neurologic examination will be performed and vital signs&#xD;
      (pulse and blood pressure) will be measured. If the subject is a woman who is capable of&#xD;
      bearing children, they will be asked to provide a urine sample for a routine pregnancy test.&#xD;
      A blood sample (approximately 2 teaspoons) will also be obtained. Blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      for a liver function test (LFT), complete blood count (CBC) with differential, chemistry&#xD;
      profile, prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).If the screening visit&#xD;
      is the same day as the first treatment visit, this blood work will be sent for immediate&#xD;
      analysis. The results must be reviewed and approved by the study physician prior to the&#xD;
      subject being administered study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit One:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject does not undergo treatment at the screening visit because they are not in an&#xD;
      active cluster period, the subject will be asked to contact the site once their next cluster&#xD;
      period begins. Subjects will be scheduled to come for their first treatment visit as soon as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the screening visit is not the same day as the first treatment visit, the study physician&#xD;
      and or delegated research staff will re-explain the informed consent, ask the subject to&#xD;
      re-read the informed consent and verbally re-confirm their agreement to participate in this&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff will then determine whether the subject continues to qualify for the&#xD;
      research trial. They will ask the subject about any changes in their medications since their&#xD;
      last visit and/or any changes in their medical conditions since their last visit. Vital signs&#xD;
      will be measured and if the subject is a woman of childbearing potential a urine sample will&#xD;
      be obtained for routine pregnancy testing. A brief physical examination and neurologic&#xD;
      examination will be performed by the study physician. The subject will be given a diary to&#xD;
      take home with instructions on how to complete it. The subject will be scheduled to return to&#xD;
      the study office the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all of the above procedures have been completed, the research staff will then ask the&#xD;
      subject to lie down in an exam room. They research nurse or study physician will then&#xD;
      administer one of the study medications (Depacon) through an IV placed in their arm. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive 1000mg of Depacon IV. This medication will be infused (administered) over a five&#xD;
      minute period. The subjects' vital signs will be measured at 3 minutes, 5 minutes and 15&#xD;
      minutes after the medication has been completely administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will remain in the study office for one hour for observation. Subjects will be&#xD;
      closely monitored and repeatedly queried for the development of adverse events. Appropriate&#xD;
      intervention and follow-up will be applied as deemed necessary by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to leaving the office, the research nurse or study physician will give the subject an&#xD;
      oral dose of the second study medication, 1000mg of Depakote ER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit Two:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will return to the study office the next day for their second treatment visit.&#xD;
      The study staff will review the subject's diary and record their vital signs. The subject's&#xD;
      take home diary will be re-dispensed. The subject will then undergo the same infusion&#xD;
      procedure as in their first treatment visit. Subjects will again receive a total of 1000mg of&#xD;
      Depacon IV. Subjects will be closely monitored and repeatedly queried for the development of&#xD;
      adverse events. Appropriate intervention and follow-up will be applied as deemed necessary by&#xD;
      the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to leaving the office, the research nurse or study physician will give the subject an&#xD;
      oral dose of the second study medication, 1000mg of Depakote ER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject may or may not be asked to return the next day for a third treatment day&#xD;
      depending on the study physicians' review of their response to study treatment. If it is&#xD;
      determined that the subject does not need to return for a third treatment day, a blood sample&#xD;
      will be obtained from a vein in their arm. The subject will also be given a take home supply&#xD;
      of the oral study drug Depakote ER with instructions. The subject will be scheduled to return&#xD;
      to the study office in 6 weeks OR when their current cluster cycle ends, whichever comes&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff will contact the subject bi-weekly to see how they are doing and to&#xD;
      confirm that they are taking your study drug appropriately. The research staff will also ask&#xD;
      the subject if they have had any unwanted experiences since their last contact with the site.&#xD;
      The subject will be instructed to call the study site should they have any questions or have&#xD;
      any unwanted experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit Three:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study physician determines that the subject should return for a third treatment day,&#xD;
      the subject will return to the study office the day after their second treatment visit. The&#xD;
      same infusion procedures will be performed. The study staff will review the subject's diary&#xD;
      and record their vital signs. A blood sample (2 teaspoons) will be obtained from a vein in&#xD;
      their arm. Prior to leaving the office, the research nurse or study physician will give the&#xD;
      subject an oral dose of the second study medication, Depakote ER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be given a take home supply of the oral study drug Depakote ER with&#xD;
      instructions. Subjects will be instructed to take 2000mg of Depakote ER once a day. The&#xD;
      subject will be scheduled to return to the study office in 6 weeks OR when their current&#xD;
      cluster cycle ends, whichever comes first. The research staff will contact the subject&#xD;
      bi-weekly to see how they are doing and to confirm that they are taking your study drug&#xD;
      appropriately. The research staff will also ask whether or not the subject had any unusual&#xD;
      symptoms, or out of the ordinary experiences since their last contact with the site. The&#xD;
      subject will be instructed to call the study site should they have any questions or have any&#xD;
      unwanted experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final visit to the study office will occur either 6 weeks after the subjects last&#xD;
      treatment visit OR when the subjects current cluster cycle ends, whichever comes first. At&#xD;
      this visit, the study staff will collect and review the subject's diary as well as any unused&#xD;
      study medication. The subject will be asked about any changes in medications and/ or medical&#xD;
      conditions since their last contact with the site. The subject will also be asked about any&#xD;
      unusual symptoms, or out of the ordinary experiences since their last contact with the site.&#xD;
      The subject will be asked to report how they felt they responded to the study medication. The&#xD;
      subject's vital signs will be measured and a blood sample (2 teaspoons) will be obtained from&#xD;
      a vein in their arm.&#xD;

        <description>Severity: measured on an 11 point scale, where 0 = no pain and 10= excruciating pain. Outcome is time to 50% reduction in severity (or frequency) compared to baseline (prior to treatment).Frequency: Number of attacks per day.The Time to significant response was measured 2 ways: significant initial response and significant maintained response. For initial response, the time to significant response was: Mean of 2.1(1.5) days for severity and 1.9 (1.6) days for frequency. The time to significant response maintained was 29.7 (13.8) for severity and 29.0 (14.3) for frequency.</description>
