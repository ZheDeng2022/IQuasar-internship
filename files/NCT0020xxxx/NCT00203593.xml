  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether eight weeks of exercise performed at an&#xD;
      intensity of approximately 65% VO2max will improve symptoms associated with fainting&#xD;
      (vasovagal syncope).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Vasovagal syncope affects 20-30% of the population, and for those who faint&#xD;
      recurrently it causes a significant reduction in the quality of life. Although significant&#xD;
      progress has been made in the past 15 years in our understanding of its diagnosis and&#xD;
      prognosis, our therapeutic attempts often end in failure. Many patients who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with vasovagal syncope have a reduced orthostatic tolerance. Improved orthostatic&#xD;
      tolerance has been achieved through exercise in a number of studies on healthy individuals.&#xD;
      However, its efficacy as a means of treatment for those with vasovagal syncope has not been&#xD;
      thoroughly explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups: an exercise group or control.&#xD;
      The exercise group will be asked to train at a target of approximately 65% of their maximum&#xD;
      exercise capacity (VO2max) for 8 weeks/3 times per week. The control group will be asked to&#xD;
      perform a series of neck rotation exercises. Orthostatic tolerance will be examined in both&#xD;
      groups pre and post intervention.&#xD;
