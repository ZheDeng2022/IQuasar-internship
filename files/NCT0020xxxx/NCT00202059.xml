      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of zoledronic acid and physical activity&#xD;
      on preventing bone loss in women aged 40 - 55 who are receiving chemotherapy for breast&#xD;
      cancer. The primary objective is to compare the percent change in the lumbar spine bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) from baseline to 12 months for women who are randomized to either:&#xD;
      Group A) intravenous zoledronic acid, oral calcium carbonate, and vitamin D, or Group B) a&#xD;
      prescribed physical activity program, oral calcium carbonate and vitamin D.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Breast cancer diagnosis accounts for 32% of all new cancer cases in US women,&#xD;
      with approximately 211,300 women diagnosed in 2003. The majority of these women receive&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy, which may lead to chemotherapy-induced menopause (CIM) in&#xD;
      premenopausal women. CIM often leads to accelerated bone loss, osteopenia, and eventual&#xD;
      osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of zoledronic acid and physical&#xD;
      activity on preventing bone loss in women aged 40 - 55 who are receiving chemotherapy for&#xD;
      breast cancer. The primary objective is to compare the percent change in the lumbar spine&#xD;
      bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to 12 months for women who are randomized to either:&#xD;
      Group A) intravenous zoledronic acid, oral calcium carbonate, and vitamin D, or Group B) a&#xD;
      prescribed physical activity program, oral calcium carbonate and vitamin D. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to compare the percent change between the groups in total hip BMD, the&#xD;
      incidence of vertebral fractures, fatigue, functional status, and other cancer-related&#xD;
      symptoms between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Seventy-two women will be enrolled and randomized to one of two treatment groups.&#xD;
      For participants randomized to Group A, intravenous zoledronic acid will be given every 3&#xD;
      months for the 12 month study period, along with 2 tablets of calcium carbonate (600&#xD;
      mg)/vitamin D (200 IU) daily. For participants randomized to Group B, a physical activity&#xD;
      intervention designed to improve BMD will be prescribed and administered through the&#xD;
      occupational rehabilitation department. Group B participants will also take 2 tablets of&#xD;
      calcium carbonate (600 mg)/vitamin D (200 IU) daily. BMD measurements at the lumbar spine and&#xD;
      hip, and an AP and lateral X-ray will be done at baseline and at 12 months after enrollment&#xD;
      in the study, using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Serum bone-specific alkaline&#xD;
      phosphotase, and N-telopeptide urine tests will be conducted at baseline and 12 months to&#xD;
      evaluate bone resorption activity. Other measures that will be assessed via questionnaires&#xD;
      include fatigue (Schwartz Cancer Fatigue Scale), functional status (SF-36), a 4-day food&#xD;
      record, and other cancer-related symptoms (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Results will be analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Descriptive statistics will&#xD;
      be used to analyze demographic data, tumor information, dietary information and baseline BMD.&#xD;
      Differences between baseline means will be analyzed by t-tests. The percent change in BMD&#xD;
      between the two groups will be analyzed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Differences in&#xD;
      other measures will be analyzed by t-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Results of this study will be used to determine if zoledronic acid or physical&#xD;
      activity affect BMD in young women who are receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
