    <textblock>
      We are comparing the efficacy of Lamotrigine to that of Standard of Care Sodium Valproate for&#xD;
      the treatment of Mixed Mania. The study hypothesis is that Lamotrigine will be more&#xD;
      efficative for treating mixed mania in patients with Bipolar Disorder.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mixed mania is a clinically distinct affective state which is likely to be more severe than&#xD;
      classical euphoric mania and to have longer episode duration. Mixed mania is associated with&#xD;
      longer duration of illness, suicidality, and poor outcome (McElroy et al, 1995). Although at&#xD;
      present there is no universally agreed on definition for mixed states, 40-60% of patients in&#xD;
      acute manic states also meet criteria for either major depression or dysphoria (Dilsaver et&#xD;
      al,1999; Calabrese et al, 1999; Secunda et al,1985; Sporn and Sacks,1997). Dilsaver at al&#xD;
      (1999) in their factor analytic study of manic symptoms were able to differentiate dysphoric&#xD;
      and depressed mania. Patients with depressed mania (30% of all patients with mania) were as&#xD;
      manic as patients with euphoric mania and also met criteria for the Major depressive&#xD;
      disorder. Patients with dysphoric mania were less manic and less depressed, but more&#xD;
      irritable than both depressed and euphoric manic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present there is no accepted treatment algorithms for mixed affective states including&#xD;
      depressed and dysphoric mania in Dilsaver definition. Currently used antimanic agents&#xD;
      (lorazepam, typical antipsychotics, olanzapine) and mood stablizers (lithium, divlaproex&#xD;
      sodium) have little or no antidepressant activity. Therefore, treatment of mixed mania&#xD;
      frequently results in emergence of bipolar depression that is often treatment-refractory.&#xD;
      Thus is an urgent need for effective treatment of mixed mania that will not result in bipolar&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant that prolongs the refractory phase of voltage sensitive&#xD;
      channels, an action that is associated with antimanic properties (Hurly, 2002; Sporn and&#xD;
      Sacks, 1997; Calabrese et al; 1999, Normann et al; 2002). Lamotrigine was postulated to&#xD;
      decrease glutamate release by acting at voltage-sensitive sodium channel in their refractory&#xD;
      phase, stabilizing presynaptic neuronal membranes and inhibiting pathologic release of&#xD;
      glutamate. As abnormalities in glutamatergic system have been implicated in depression, and&#xD;
      NMDA receptor antagonists reverse anxiety or depression in various stress models, lamotrigine&#xD;
      could act as an antidepressant. . Thus, lamotrigine has a potential to have both antimanic&#xD;
      and antidepressant activity (for refs, see Sporn and Sacks, 1997), and in theory should be&#xD;
      uniquely effective for mixed mania (Dilsaver et al, 1999). Indeed, clinical trials reviewed&#xD;
      in detail by Hurley (2002), demonstrated that lamotrigine is somewhat effective an antimanic&#xD;
      agent, and has significant antidepressant activity in bipolar depression. Lamotrigine was&#xD;
      used in a combination with other agents or as monotherapy, and the response rates for&#xD;
      depressed, mixed and rapid cycling states were similar, ranging from 52% to 63%. With slow&#xD;
      dose titration (6 weeks), side effects were few and the incidence of exfoliative dermatitis&#xD;
      was 1 in 500. Of note, although Sporn and Sachs (1997) reported a switch from depression to&#xD;
      rapid cycling, such incidences were few. In our institution, lamotrigine was effective for&#xD;
      treatment of mixed mania and bipolar depression in patients receiving standard maintenance&#xD;
      treatment for Bipolar Mood Disorder. Lamotrigine did worsen agitation in two elderly patients&#xD;
      with symptoms of irritable mania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above evidence, it appears that lamotrigine, either in combination with a proven&#xD;
      antimanic agent or in monotherapy, is uniquely suited to be the agent of choice for treatment&#xD;
      of mixed mania. Therefore, we here propose a randomized open-label trial of lamotrigine vs.&#xD;
      standard of care sodium valpoate for treatment of mixed mania. Within this framework, the&#xD;
      following are the study's hypotheses and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Objectives Objective One. To compare the efficacy of the lamotrigine with sodium&#xD;
      valproate (standard of care) for treatment of depressive symptoms of acute mania in patients&#xD;
      with Bipolar Mood Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis One:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lamotrigine will be more effective than sodium valproate in treatment of depressive symptoms&#xD;
      in acute mixed mania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Two. To compare the efficacy of the lamotrigine with that of sodium valproate for&#xD;
      treatment of manic symptoms in acute mixed mania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Two:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lamotrigine and sodium valproate will be equally effective in treatment of manic symptoms in&#xD;
      acute mixed mania as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Three. To compare the efficacy of lamotrigine to that of sodium valproate in&#xD;
      maintenance treatment of patients with bipolar mood disorder and a recent past episode of&#xD;
      mixed mania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Three:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i)The lamlotrigine will be more efficacious than sodium valproate in maintenance treatment&#xD;
      of patients with bipolar mood disorder and a recent past episode of mixed mania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) The lamotrigine patients will have lower relapse rate. (iii) The lamotrigine patients&#xD;
      will have lower rates of depression than patients treated with sodium valproate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Four: To compare the side effect profile of lamotrigine treatment of mixed mania to&#xD;
      sodium valproate treatment of mixed mania in patients with bipolar mood disorder and a recent&#xD;
      past episode of mixed mania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis four:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lamotrigine acute treatment will result in comparable side effect profile with that of sodium&#xD;
      valproate while lamotrigine maintenance treatment will be superior to that with sodium&#xD;
      valproate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods We plan to study two eighteen-subject groups (36 subjects total) of male and female&#xD;
      study participants between ages 18 and 65 over a 1 1/2 year period. The subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled from the inpatient units at the Beth Israel Medical Center and at the St.&#xD;
      Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center (Continuum Health Partners) and will be followed at the&#xD;
      Center for Treatment of the Affective Disorders in the Department of Psychiatry at BIMC. An&#xD;
      independent evaluator (Paul Teusink, M.D.) not affiliated with the study will determine&#xD;
      capacity of consent. We will select patients who would have had at least one prior manic&#xD;
      episode and who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria for depressed acute mania (Dilsaver et&#xD;
      al, 1999). The study criteria for an acute episode of irritable depressed mania will be a&#xD;
      Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score of at least 11 and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      (HDRS) score of at least 18 with 72 hours prior to entering the study. Patient could be&#xD;
      randomized on study medication if she/he came to clinic on lamotrigine or Sodium valprole,&#xD;
      but she/he has low blood level of this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1, The Acute Phase. Index medications schedule. Following randomization, during the&#xD;
      first 8-week phase, the index manic episode will be treated with either adjust lamotrigine or&#xD;
      sodium valproate will be started at 25 mg po daily and will be increased biweekly until a&#xD;
      maximal dose of 200 mg/day. Dose escalation schedule: weeks 1-2 25 mg po qd, week 3-4 25 mg&#xD;
      po bid, weeks 5-6 50 mg po bid, weeks 7-8 100 mg po bid. The dose could be decreased to as&#xD;
      low as 50 mg/day to reduce side effects other than rash. The sodium valproate treatment will&#xD;
      be initiated with a loading dose of 20 mg/kg, and the dose will be adjusted in 250 mg/day&#xD;
      increments to achieve a therapeutic level of 100-120 mcg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant medications schedule. If a patient is receiving mood stabilizers such as lithium,&#xD;
      , carbamazepine, gabapentine, trileptal, lamotrigine or sodium valproate at the beginning of&#xD;
      the study, these medications will be discontinued in 72 hours informed consent is provided.&#xD;
      The following medications will not be permitted during the acute phase of the trial:&#xD;
      clozaril, depot neuroleptics antipsychotic, antidepressant and benzodiazepines other than&#xD;
      lorazepam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue medications. Since neuroleptics and lorazepam will be liberally allowed for treatment&#xD;
      of acute manic symptoms, no rescue medications will be necessary in the acute phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crossover design for subjects with treatment failure. If subject's condition deteriorates&#xD;
      after randomization to lamotrigine or valporate, subject will be crossed over to the other&#xD;
      arm of the study, i.e. those who failed sodium valproate will be treated with lamotrigine and&#xD;
      vise versa and vise versa. Subjects who will have failed the crossover switch will be removed&#xD;
      from the study. Deterioration will be defined as a three-point worsening in the patient's&#xD;
      YMRS score lasting more than 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures. The severity of illness will be measured with Young Mania Rating Scale&#xD;
      (MRS), Hamilton Rating scale for depression, and the CGI rating scale. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measures will be the YMRS total score change from baseline until the endpoint of Phase 1. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures will be the HRSD total score change and the CGI score change from&#xD;
      baseline until the Phase 1 endpoint. Other secondary outcome measures will be the amount the&#xD;
      incidences of seclusion and restraint, the length of hospital stay, and the medical indeces&#xD;
      such as HgA1C, weight changes, and lipid profile&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2, The Maintenance Phase. If after two month of treatment patient improve on 50%&#xD;
      compare to initial level of YMRS , HDRS and YMRS&lt;11, HDRS&lt;18 patient will be transferred to&#xD;
      the Maintenance Phase. Index Medication Schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute phase will be followed by the 4 months maintenance phase. In the maintenance phase,&#xD;
      all medications but lorazepam (&lt; 4 mg/ day dose) and lamotrigine or sodium valproate will be&#xD;
      typed over for initial 4 weeks period. In the last 3 month of the study the lamotrigine&#xD;
      subjects will receive only lamotrigine monotherapy. The dose will be adjusted by the study&#xD;
      physicians as clinically necessary within the same dose range as in the Phase 1. The sodium&#xD;
      valproate dose will be maintained to achieve a therapeutic level of 50-100 mcg/ml. The&#xD;
      subjects will be followed weekly for the first 5 weeks of the study. For the rest of the&#xD;
      study the subjects will be followed biweekly&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue medications schedule. During the maintenance phase, lorazepam will be tapered to a&#xD;
      minimal dose that would allow nightly sleep of at least 8 hrs. The dose adjustment will be&#xD;
      done weekly according to the following dose reduction schedule: 4 mg - 3 mg - 2 mg - 1 mg - 0&#xD;
      5 mg - 0 mg and will take up to five weeks depending on the initial dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures. The primary outcome measures will be the number and the time to either&#xD;
      manic or depressive episodes. The secondary outcome measures will be an average change from&#xD;
      baseline in YMRS, HRSD, and CGI scores from baseline until the endpoint of Phase 2. We will&#xD;
      also evaluate medication side effects, the need for adjunct lorazepam treatment, the reasons&#xD;
      for premature discontinuation, the demographic data, and the medical endpoints (HgbA1C,&#xD;
      weight changes, lipid profile). We will use SPSS and appropriate statistical methods for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population will consist of psychiatric inpatients at the Beth Israel Medical&#xD;
      Center and the St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center, who meet criteria for the DSM-IV&#xD;
      diagnosis of Bipolar Mood Disorder I, manic episode. At present, the patient ethnic and&#xD;
      racial mix is 26% Hispanic, 30% African American, and 45% Caucasian. The gender distribution&#xD;
      is 46% male, 54% female. The inpatient payer mix is 26% Medicare and 50% Medicaid. The&#xD;
      average length of stay for the three units is 19 days for all patients and 26 days for&#xD;
      patients without co-morbid substance use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1999-2001, inpatient units at the BIMC registered on average 1500 yearly admissions, 1350&#xD;
      of them ages 17-65. Upon admission, approximately 200 patients carried a diagnosis of Bipolar&#xD;
      Mood Disorder I, manic episode, without comorbid substance abuse. The inpatient units at&#xD;
      Saint Lukes Roosevelt admit 100 manic patients yearly. If the admission demographics remain&#xD;
      unchanged for 2003, we expect that 40 patients per year will meet diagnostic inclusion&#xD;
      criterion for the study. Based on our previous experience with recruitment for research&#xD;
      studies, we expect that 30 % of patients meeting the diagnostic criteria will also meet other&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, will sign the inform consent and participate in the study.&#xD;
      Therefore we expect to recruit 36 patients per year and to complete the study accrual in 18&#xD;
      months. We plan to complete the data analysis for the acute phase within one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Males and females, ages 18-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ability to sign an informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnosis of Bipolar Mood Disorder I, manic episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mania Rating Scale (MRS) score of at least 11&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. HDRS score of at least 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Global Assessment Scale (GAS) scores more than 60. Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Alcohol or substance abuse within the last 6 months 2) Current diagnosis of&#xD;
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder 3) Current diagnosis of Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective&#xD;
      Disorder 4) Previous adverse reaction or allergies to lamotrigine or sodium valproate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Drug Regimens The study will be months open label parallel comparison (with&#xD;
      a blinded rater) of combination therapy lamotrigine 25-200 mg/day(flexible dosing) and sodium&#xD;
      valproate (flexible dosing) monotherapy for treatment of mixed mania in two groups of&#xD;
      patients with Bipolar Mood Disorder I. The study will have acute and maintenance phases. Each&#xD;
      group will consist of 18 subjects matched for age, gender, and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who were randomly assigned to treatment groups and had at least one&#xD;
      post-baseline assessment will be included in the efficacy analysis. The primary time points&#xD;
      will be the endpoints of Phases 1 and 2 (i.e. the last available observation during Phases 1&#xD;
      and 2). The primary comparison will be between the lamotrigine/ sodium valproate groups. The&#xD;
      analysis of covariance model will be used to test differences between treatments at endpoint.&#xD;
      The model will include factors for treatment, and baseline scores on MRS and HRDS as a&#xD;
      covariate. MRS scores at all time points will be analyzed jointly by means of repeated&#xD;
      measures model. HRDS scores will be analyzed in the same way as MRS scores. Treatment over&#xD;
      time will be used as a factor in the model. Gehan's generalized Wilcoxon test will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate differences in time to discontinuation (ref from Sachs), and Van Elteren test will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate differences in the CGI scores (ref from Sachs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Relevance and Health Implications&#xD;
&#xD;
      The successful completion of this study will indicate that lamotrigine combination should be&#xD;
      the preferred first-line treatment for mixed mania that should be continued as the preferred&#xD;
      maintenance treatment for mixed mania.&#xD;
