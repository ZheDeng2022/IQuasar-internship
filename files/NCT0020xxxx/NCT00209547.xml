  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anticipation of pain and discomfort, a diagnosis, and other intrinsic unknowns make&#xD;
      patients anxious both prior to and during a procedure. Therefore, the main goal of sedation&#xD;
      with analgesia used during various diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures is to&#xD;
      relieve this anxiety, discomfort, and pain, which are all interrelated. The optimal level of&#xD;
      sedation for any given patient is one that allows the patient to tolerate the procedure and&#xD;
      provides an appropriate safety margin. This was a study designed to examine the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of AQUAVAN® Injection versus a commonly used approved sedative drug, midazolam HCl&#xD;
      following pretreatment with fentanyl citrate injection (for pain relief) in producing&#xD;
      sedation in patients undergoing single cardiac catheterization procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, open-label study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      AQUAVAN® Injection (hereafter referred to as AQUAVAN) versus the reference drug, midazolam&#xD;
      HCl (hereafter referred to as midazolam) following pretreatment with fentanyl citrate&#xD;
      injection (hereafter referred to as fentanyl) in producing sedation in male and female&#xD;
      patients undergoing single PC procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessments were done within 2 weeks of scheduled procedures. After completion of&#xD;
      preprocedural sedation assessments, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment&#xD;
      groups at a 3:1 (AQUAVAN: midazolam) allocation ratio on the day of the scheduled procedure&#xD;
      (Day 0) via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). Randomization was stratified by&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, regardless of treatment group assignment, received fentanyl as an analgesic&#xD;
      pretreatment. Supplemental doses of fentanyl could be administered if the patient reported&#xD;
      pain or if analgesia was inadequate, as demonstrated by increased heart rate and/or blood&#xD;
      pressure in the presence of adequate sedation. At no time was fentanyl to be administered to&#xD;
      increase sedation levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AQUAVAN or midazolam was administered by intravenous (i.v.) bolus to induce a state of&#xD;
      minimal-to-moderate (procedural) s sedation, defined as a score of ≤4 on the Modified&#xD;
      Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale. Supplemental doses were&#xD;
      administered, if necessary, to increase the depth or duration of sedation. Supplemental doses&#xD;
      were not administered if the Modified OAA/S score was ≤2 or if there was no purposeful&#xD;
      response to stimulation. Patient and Investigator assessments were used to confirm that the&#xD;
      depth of sedation met the goals of sedation, reduced anxiety, and awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up patient assessments were conducted in a telephone interview 24 hours following&#xD;
      treatment and during a clinic visit 2 to 5 days following treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient provided signed/dated Informed Consent and HIPAA authorization after receiving&#xD;

             [dated 04 February 2005], the patient was required to be between 18 and 65 years of&#xD;
             age, inclusive. Three subjects were randomized under this earlier inclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If female, patient was surgically sterile, postmenopausal or not pregnant or lactating&#xD;
