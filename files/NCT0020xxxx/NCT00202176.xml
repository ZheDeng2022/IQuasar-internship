  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In people with mild COPD, the ability to exhale air from the lungs is partly limited because&#xD;
      of narrowing and collapse of the airways. This results in the trapping of air within the&#xD;
      lungs and over-distention of the lungs and chest (lung hyperinflation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing at high lung volumes (hyperinflation) is an important cause of breathing discomfort&#xD;
      (dyspnea) in people with COPD. Bronchodilators help to relax muscles in the airways or&#xD;
      breathing tubes. Bronchodilators are often prescribed if a cough occurs with airway narrowing&#xD;
      as this medication can reduce coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. Bronchodilators can&#xD;
      be taken orally, through injection or through inhalation and begin to act almost immediately&#xD;
      but with the effect only lasting 4-6 hours. The main purpose of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      effects of inhaled bronchodilators on breathing discomfort and exercise endurance in patients&#xD;
      with mild COPD.&#xD;

      In people with mild COPD, the ability to exhale air from the lungs is partly limited because&#xD;
      of narrowing and collapse of the airways. This results in the trapping of air within the&#xD;
      lungs and over-distention of the lungs and chest - this is known as lung hyperinflation. We&#xD;
      believe that breathing at high lung volumes (hyperinflation) is an important cause of&#xD;
      breathing discomfort (dyspnea) in people with COPD. Bronchodilators help to relax muscles in&#xD;
      the airways or breathing tubes. Bronchodilators are often prescribed if a cough occurs with&#xD;
      airway narrowing; this medication can reduce coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.&#xD;
      Bronchodilators can be taken orally, through injection or through inhalation and begin to act&#xD;
      almost immediately but with the effect only lasting 4-6 hours. The main purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to examine the effects of inhaled bronchodilators on breathing discomfort and exercise&#xD;
      endurance in patients with mild COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will attend 4 visits to the laboratory. Visit 1 (screening visit) will involve a&#xD;
      record of medical history, medications used, anthropometrics measurements, questionnaires,&#xD;
      breathing tests, an incremental cycle exercise test and a constant-workload cycle exercise&#xD;
      test. Visit 2 will involve breathing tests and a constant-workload cycle exercise test.&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4 will involve breathing tests and a constant-workload cycle exercise test after&#xD;
      subjects have been randomized to either placebo or Atrovent. These visits will be done on&#xD;
      separate days and subjects will receive the two above treatments in random order.&#xD;
