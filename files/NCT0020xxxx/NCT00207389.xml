  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a multinational epidemic. There is evidence that despite educational measures and&#xD;
      increased public awareness, the number of obese individuals continues to increase. Of the&#xD;
      numerous obesity-related comorbidities, type 2 diabetes remains one of the most significant&#xD;
      in terms of mortality and health care costs. Gastric Bypass Surgery (GBS) not only offers an&#xD;
      effective form of therapy for morbid obesity, but also amelioration of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. The normalization of glucose levels in GBS patients occurs within days after&#xD;
      surgery and has been shown in surgical literature to be independent of the weight loss after&#xD;
      surgery. The proximal gut, the site of release of certain incretins, may play a role in&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. One such incretin is&#xD;
      GIP, which when released into the circulation during the immediate postprandial period,&#xD;
      accentuates the insulin response to a glucose meal. It is hypothesized that overactivity of&#xD;
      this enteroinsular axis in obese individuals produces cell resistance to insulin and&#xD;
      subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus. A previous study reported elevated fasting GIP levels,&#xD;
      as well as an exaggerated GIP response to a glucose meal, in obese subjects, which was&#xD;
      significantly reduced months after GBS following weight loss. This pilot study of obese&#xD;
      patients scheduled for GBS will compare the serum levels of certain peptides, including GIP,&#xD;
      following a glucose meal before and after GBS, before weight loss has occured. In order to&#xD;
      reproduce the preoperative state, and therefore to demonstrate the physiologic change, a&#xD;
      small group of subjects who undergo open surgery will undergo the same measurements after&#xD;
      surgery, but using a model in which the meal traverses the stomach, duodenum and jejunum with&#xD;
      the aid of a gastrostomy tube.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to collect the relevant information for planning a larger and more&#xD;
      definitive investigation. A total of thirty subjects will be evaluated in this study to be&#xD;
      conducted at the Boston Medical Center. The study population will consist of obese patients&#xD;
      who meet the criteria and have been scheduled by their surgeon for GBS. We plan to enroll a&#xD;
      total of 30 subjects scheduled for GBS. Patients will be assigned according to standard&#xD;
      surgical care to either open or laparoscopic surgery. We plan to enroll 20 subjects who&#xD;
      undergo laparoscopic GBS (LAP) and 10 subjects who undergo open GBS (OPEN). All potential&#xD;
      subjects will have undergone baseline screening as a part of their routine medical evaluation&#xD;
      performed by Dr. Apovian or Dr. McDonnell in the Nutrition Center at BMC. This standard&#xD;
      testing includes medical history, physical examination, complete blood count, serum&#xD;
      electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin. If patients&#xD;
      are identified as having type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance, they will be provided&#xD;
      informed consent. If consented subjects meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, each&#xD;
      will undergo a baseline oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) approximately one week before&#xD;
      surgery. Plasma concentrations of insulin, GIP, glucagon, and GLP-1 will also be measured&#xD;
      along with glucose levels and other peptides (CCK, ghrelin, c-peptide) at the same intervals,&#xD;
      using commercially available assay kits. Post-operatively, subjects in the LAP group will&#xD;
      undergo 2 OGTTs, while subjects in the OPEN group will undergo 2 OGTTs and one glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test through the gastrostomy tube (GGTT). The results of the postoperative OGTTs&#xD;
      will be compared with baseline OGTTs. In a separate analysis, the results of the GGTTs will&#xD;
      be compared with the baseline and postoperative OGTTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Patients 21-64 y ears of age with obesity (defined as a body mass index,&#xD;
      BMI, &gt; or = 30) and type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, who have been selected and&#xD;
      scheduled for gastric bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Substance abuse, consumption of more than two alcoholic drinks per day,&#xD;
      use of more than 20 units of insulin (any brand or type) per day, and having a fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose &gt;180mg/dl on screening bloodwork.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F2. Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a total of 3 OGTTs, 1 before surgery and 2 after. The OPEN group&#xD;
      will also have a glucose tolerance test via a gastrostomy tube (GGTT) placed in the duodenum&#xD;
      (per routine surgical procedure) as described below. The OGTT consists of a 12-hour overnight&#xD;
      fast followed by drinking a 225 ml of solution containing 75 grams of a glucose (Glucola),&#xD;
      over 30 minutes. 30 minutes is the average time a patient requires in order to drink a 225ml&#xD;
      Glucola drink after gastric bypass surgery. In order to be able to make a valid comparison of&#xD;
      the three OGTTs, each OGTT will require that the subject drink over 30 minutes. Blood samples&#xD;
      are obtained from an intravenous catheter at various time intervals: 5 minutes and&#xD;
      immediately before drinking the Glucola, and 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes&#xD;
      afterwards. Blood levels of glucose, insulin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide&#xD;
      (GIP), glucagon, and Glucagon-Like Peptide (GLP-1), CCK, ghrelin and c-peptide will be&#xD;
      determined from the samples obtained. In addition, at hour 2 during the OGTT (when glucose&#xD;
      peaks) we will obtain a real-time glucose level with a drop of blood from the indwelling&#xD;
      line. The GGTT follows that same protocol as the OGTT, but the Glucola is administered via a&#xD;
      gastrostomy tube, placed per routine surgical procedure in patients undergoing open GBS.&#xD;
      Approximately 1 week before surgery, all subjects will undergo an OGTT in the GCRC. Between&#xD;
      day 6 and 10 after their surgery, when subjects are tolerating their standard 240cc liquid&#xD;
      meals 3-4 times daily, subjects will undergo the third OGTT. Although most subjects are&#xD;
      discharged on day 3 or 4 after surgery, and will be asked to return to the GCRC, those&#xD;
      subjects who remain in the hospital through day 5 will have the option to remain in the&#xD;
      hospital for an additional time (1-2 days) or to go home and return to the GCRC within 5 days&#xD;
      (no later than POD 10) The additional hospital days will be paid for by the GCRC. After&#xD;
      surgery, subjects in LAP group will have one OGTT. Subjects in the OPEN group will have a&#xD;
      GGTT on one day and an OGTT on the following day. Subjects will be weighed before surgery and&#xD;
      every day during the first week after surgery and before each glucose tolerance test. All&#xD;
      subjects will undergo a final OGTT approximately 3 -4 weeks after surgery. This will take&#xD;
      place in the GCRC on the same day as a routine follow up visit to their surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by telephone for assessment approximately 24 hours before and&#xD;
      after each GTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 primary outcomes: 1) Change in plasma GIP response to glucose after GBS and 2)&#xD;
      change in insulin sensitivity after GBS, as measured by an area-under-the-curve equation for&#xD;
      a standardized 180-minute oral glucose tolerance test. Secondary outcomes include 1) Change&#xD;
      in plasma GLP-1 response to glucose after GBS and 2) change in plasma glucagon response to&#xD;
      glucose after GBS, as measured by the equation used for the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that our enrollment period will be 18 months to 24 months. The estimated duration&#xD;
      of the entire study is 28 months&#xD;
