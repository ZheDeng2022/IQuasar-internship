  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if the addition of rosiglitazone to subjects with&#xD;
      fair glucose control on other oral agents improves endothelial function, a surrogate marker&#xD;
      of vascular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that improving whole body insulin sensitivity with combination therapy&#xD;
      including rosiglitazone will restore the vascular actions of insulin and improve&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent vasomotion more effectively than placebo in patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vascular endothelium has emerged as a critical determinant of cardiovascular health and&#xD;
      disease, and improving endothelial function is an important target for therapy. Accumulating&#xD;
      evidence suggest that insulin resistance in patients with diabetes and the metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      may impair endothelial function, uncovering a proinflammatory, and proatherosclerotic&#xD;
      vascular phenotype. The GATE study (Glitazones And The Endothelium) is a randomized, double&#xD;
      blind study to evaluate the effects of rosiglitazone vs. placebo on endothelial function when&#xD;
      employed as an add-on therapy in diabetic patients currently treated with oral therapy. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone, will improve endothelium-dependent&#xD;
      vasodilatation, and that this effect will be related to improvements in insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      with concomitant reductions in whole body insulin resistance. Furthermore, the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of rosiglitazone will be additive to existing oral therapies that may modulate&#xD;
      endothelial function, such as metformin. Since endothelial dysfunction plays a pivotal role&#xD;
      in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, these studies may provide the&#xD;
      rationale and impetus for aggressive treatment of insulin resistant patients with glitazone&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients (both men and women) considered for participation in GATE study have to&#xD;
             be non-insulin dependent diabetics (according to Canadian Diabetes Association&#xD;
             criteria, namely a fasting serum glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L on two occasions, a casual&#xD;
             glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/l with symptoms, or a 2-h post-oral glucose tolerance test glucose&#xD;
             of ≥ 11.1 mmol/l) with unsatisfactory glycemic control on oral therapy (HbA1c 6-10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria includes, congestive heart failure (NYHA class III &amp; IV or ejection&#xD;
             fraction less than 35%), poorly controlled hypertension (blood pressure &gt; 160/90),&#xD;
             hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol &gt; 6.2 mmol/l), hypertriglyceridemia&#xD;
             (triglycerides &gt; 4.0 mmol/l), poor or excellent control of DM (HgA1c &lt;6 % or HbA1c &gt;&#xD;
             10% respectively), known diabetic retinopathy, age at diagnosis of diabetes less than&#xD;
             25 years, current participation in another clinical trial and contraindications to&#xD;
             glitazones therapy, including renal (creatinine &gt; 200 micromol/ L) or hepatic (ALT &gt;&#xD;
             2.5 times the upper limit of normal) impairment and/ or known intolerance to&#xD;
             glitazones. Patients must be stable on medications that affect endothelial function&#xD;
             for more than one month. This includes ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,&#xD;
             statins, calcium channel blockers, hormone replacement therapy and anti-oxidant&#xD;
             vitamins, including folates. Patients on insulin will be excluded. Patients in whom it&#xD;
             is felt that attainment of better glucose control is required within 3 months will&#xD;
             also be excluded. Patients with stable coronary disease will be eligible for the study&#xD;
             as long as they are &gt; one month post myocardial infarction, percutaneous intervention&#xD;
             or bypass surgery.&#xD;
