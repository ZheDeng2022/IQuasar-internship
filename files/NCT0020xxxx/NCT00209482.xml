  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      America is facing an epidemic of obesity among its youth. In the last seven years, there has&#xD;
      been a 50% increase in the prevalence of obesity as defined by a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 30&#xD;
      kg/m². For the morbidly obese adult, which is defined as having a BMI &gt; 35 kg/m², mortality&#xD;
      is increased by 152 to 279%. In a Veterans Administration study of obese 25-34 year old&#xD;
      males, there was a 13-fold excess mortality rate over 7½ years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in adults, risks associated with childhood and adolescent obesity include elevated blood&#xD;
      pressure and cholesterol levels, predisposing these individuals to cardiovascular disease. In&#xD;
      addition, a significant number of obese youth have abnormally high concentrations of insulin,&#xD;
      with an attendant increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, limited options are available to help such individuals. While attempts at&#xD;
      lifestyle change (e.g., altering diet and activity level) may have some success in the short&#xD;
      term, attempts at maintaining weight loss over the long term often fail. Furthermore, there&#xD;
      are no current medications that will safely induce significant weight loss over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is an oral antihyperglycemic, insulin-sensitizing agent that has been used in many&#xD;
      countries for treatment of type 2 diabetes for more than 40 years. In March 1995, it was&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Metformin improves insulin sensitivity and reduces insulin resistance by hepatic and&#xD;
      peripheral actions. It does not increase insulin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, metformin decreases hepatic glucose production and results in weight loss. Compared&#xD;
      to available drugs that act similarly, only metformin has weight-lowering activity, perhaps&#xD;
      by increasing nitric oxide production and improving insulin sensitivity. It is also possible&#xD;
      that the mild gastrointestinal side effects of metformin induce weight loss. Metformin is&#xD;
      therefore often the agent of choice in obese, type 2 diabetics. In a study of non-diabetic&#xD;
      obese adults, treatment with metformin resulted in decreased food intake, and decreased body&#xD;
      weight and fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multi-center clinical trial. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure that will be used to test the study hypothesis is change in BMI from&#xD;
      week 0 to week 52, as well as change in BMI from week 0 to week 100. Approximately 135&#xD;
      potential subjects will be screened at the participating institutions, and an expected 76&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized into the study.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be between the ages of 13.00 and 17.99 at week 0 (Baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a BMI ≥ 95th percentile for age and gender using the CDC data (see&#xD;
             Appendix), but must weigh less than 300 pounds (&lt;136 kilograms) when measured during&#xD;
             the initial physical exam at week 0 (Baseline). BMI will be calculated as follows;&#xD;
             weight in kilograms  [height in meters]2. This cutoff has been established due to the&#xD;
             weight-bearing limits of the table used in performing the DXA scan. Once enrolled, if&#xD;
             a subject's weight progresses above 300 pounds, s/he may continue in the study whether&#xD;
             it is possible to perform DXA or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completion of informed consent/assent process&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Other serious medical condition that the Principal Investigator or Lead Site&#xD;
             Investigator determines may put the patient at undue risk if enrolled in the study&#xD;
