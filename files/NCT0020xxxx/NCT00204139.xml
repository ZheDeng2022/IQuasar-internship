  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is debatable whether routine ultrasound scanning of pregnancies at about 20 weeks of&#xD;
      pregnancy has substantive benefits for mothers and babies. Few studies have addressed this&#xD;
      issue in poorly resourced settings. This trial will attempt to determine the benefits, if&#xD;
      any, of a policy of routine ultrasound scanning of normal pregnancies versus a policy of no&#xD;
      routine (only selective) scanning. This will be done by recruiting about 900 women in South&#xD;
      Africa, and randomly allocating about half to routine scanning and half to selective scanning&#xD;
      groups, and following up their pregnancies.&#xD;

      Routine ultrasound scanning in the second trimester of pregnancy has few substantive&#xD;
      benefits, according to the results of number of randomised trials, mostly performed in&#xD;
      industrialised countries. While ultrasound did not seem to prevent fetal death, it was&#xD;
      associated with improved detection of multiple pregnancies, improved detection of congenital&#xD;
      abnormalities and reduced need for postterm labour induction. Only one trial, from Cape Town,&#xD;
      has investigated the benefits of a policy of routine second trimester ultrasound scanning in&#xD;
      an under-resourced setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be cluster randomised controlled trial, performed in the Krugersdorp area of South&#xD;
      Africa, where most health service users are African, working class and dependent on&#xD;
      government health facilities. About 900 low-risk pregnant women at less than 24 weeks&#xD;
      gestation will be recruited, and randomised, in clusters, to either routine scanning or no&#xD;
      scanning with recourse to selective scanning if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be followed up for maternal, fetal and neonatal outcome, and for indices of health&#xD;
      service utilisation. Important outcome measures will be need for subsequent&#xD;
      ultrasound,detection of multiple pregnancy, detection of congenital abnormalities, postterm&#xD;
      pregnancy induction, still birth,and neonatal morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will compare outcomes according to whether routine ultrasound scanning was or&#xD;
      was not done, using standard statistical methods.&#xD;
