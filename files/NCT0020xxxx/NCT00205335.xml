      This study is designed to determine if there is an impact on blood glucose control in&#xD;
      patients who receive free test strips. Patients in the study have no insurance or insurance&#xD;
      that does not cover the purchase of test strips. A comparison of weight, blood pressure, and&#xD;
      Hemoglobin A1C from entry to the final visit will be used to compare patients' management of&#xD;
      their diabetes. Recommended values for these parameters will be used as the standard for&#xD;
      comparisons. The investigators anticipate that patients receiving free test strips will show&#xD;
      an improvement in the listed parameters as well as in satisfaction with their care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, an&#xD;
      estimated 16 million people in the United States have diabetes mellitus. About one third of&#xD;
      these people don't know they have diabetes and are therefore, not receiving treatment.&#xD;
      Another 798,000 people are diagnosed with diabetes each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death in Wisconsin, as stated at the Wisconsin&#xD;
      Department of Health and Family Services website. Diabetes costs an estimated annual $2.1&#xD;
      billion in health care costs and lost productivity. Each year, over 3,600 Wisconsin residents&#xD;
      die from diabetes. Others experience disabling complications, including blindness,&#xD;
      amputations, heart and kidney disease. In 1998, in Dane County alone, the direct costs of&#xD;
      diabetes were estimated at $82.0 million and indirect costs at $100.4 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two landmark studies in the United States and the United Kingdom proved that the level of&#xD;
      blood sugar control predicts the onset and severity of diabetes-related complications for&#xD;
      both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Thus, people who are able to keep their blood sugars as&#xD;
      close to normal as possible can reduce their risks of complications and live relatively&#xD;
      &quot;normal&quot; lives. Moreover, the costs to the community will also be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to do this, persons with diabetes need to test blood sugar levels multiple times per&#xD;
      day. There are a variety of meters available for testing. Many people have insurance that&#xD;
      covers the cost of the meters and related test strips. For those who do not have this&#xD;
      coverage, meters are often available free of charge. Unfortunately, this is not true of the&#xD;
      test strips, which average $1 each. A person testing four times a day, seven days a week&#xD;
      would need almost $1470 to purchase strips for a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past year, the investigators have seen 35 patients followed in either the East or West&#xD;
      Diabetes Clinics who do not have insurance and thus, no way to pay for test strips. It can be&#xD;
      assumed that without an adequate number of test strips, these patients are not getting the&#xD;
      necessary information to achieve optimal blood sugar control. This puts them at risk for more&#xD;
      complications of their diabetes with concurrent emotional and financial costs to them and&#xD;
      their families. Further, the cost to the community in the long run is increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Describe the design of your study. Use care to distinguish experimental interventions from&#xD;
      standard medical treatment. Specifically include the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 35 subjects identified in either the East or West diabetes&#xD;
      clinic who do not have insurance or who are underinsured. Underinsured indicates patients&#xD;
      with insurance that does not cover the purchase of test strips. Certified Diabetes Educators&#xD;
      (CDE) identified other patients after an initial visit when lack of adequate insurance&#xD;
      coverage was noted. The list of identified patients was sent to the patient's physician and&#xD;
      CDE. Two patients were eliminated who are self-pay by choice; they are self-employed and have&#xD;
      adequate resources. Other subjects were eliminated for the following criteria: discharge from&#xD;
      UWHC Diabetes Clinic to a primary care provider; patients whose diabetes is controlled by&#xD;
      diet alone; patients who are incarcerated and currently have coverage through the penal&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be provided a voucher to obtain free test strips. Subjects routinely return to&#xD;
      the clinic at 4-month intervals (study entry, months 4,8,12). During these visits subjects&#xD;
      will undergo a Hemoglobin A1C, check height, weight, and blood pressure and complete&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaires at study entry and month 12. Only the questionnaires would not be&#xD;
      considered standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. What method(s) will you use to recruit subjects? Will these methods involve material&#xD;
      inducements? Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be offered participation.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive testing strips, clinic visits at entry and at months 4,8 and 12 and&#xD;
      Hemoglobin A1C (HA1C) testing at the above intervals free of charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Does your study have a statistical justification for its sample size? For the analysis of&#xD;
      its results? If you answer &quot;yes&quot; to these questions, briefly describe each justification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Identify the potential risks to subjects of participation in your study. Describe the&#xD;
      expected frequency, severity, and reversibility of the major risks you identify. Include&#xD;
      possible late effects of participation (e.g., secondary cancers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subject records will be kept strictly confidential according to HIPPA privacy rules.&#xD;
      Subject records will contain only a study number. The key to the study numbering will be kept&#xD;
      in a locked filing cabinet. Subjects may experience slight pain and bruising from the blood&#xD;
      draws of the HA1C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Identify the expected benefits to subjects of participation in your study. Also identify&#xD;
      any potential scientific benefits produced by your study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive free testing strips and free HA1C testing for a year. Subjects may&#xD;
      experience better control of their diabetes as a result of testing their blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Describe the procedure for obtaining the consent of each subject or the subject's parent&#xD;
      or representative. Confirm that you have attached a copy of each consent form. The form&#xD;
      should include all the elements of consent listed in the HSC Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be given the informed consent and allowed ample time to read the informed&#xD;
      consent or have it read to them. Once the consent form has been read subjects will have as&#xD;
      much time as needed to ask any questions they may have. Once the subject has had all of their&#xD;
      questions answered and agrees to participate the subject will sign the consent form in the&#xD;
      presence of the PI or a delegate. Subjects will be given a copy of the signed consent form&#xD;
      for their records.&#xD;
