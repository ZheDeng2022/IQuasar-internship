  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a common problem in Canada with a prevalence of about 15%. The goal of&#xD;
      hypertension therapy should be to maximize blood pressure control. Home blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring (HBPM) devices are available and many patients are using them. The role that&#xD;
      self-monitoring of blood pressure can play in optimizing blood pressure control is unclear.&#xD;
      We hope to clarify the role of home blood pressure monitoring in the treatment of&#xD;
      hypertension and explore how it may affect patient and physician behaviours related to blood&#xD;
      pressure management. This study will compare a group of hypertensive patients who use HBPM&#xD;
      with those who do not use these devices. The intervention (HBPM) group will measure their&#xD;
      blood pressure at home a minimum of once weekly and will report these measurements to their&#xD;
      family doctor at each visit. The control group will receive usual care as delivered by their&#xD;
      family doctor. Outcomes of blood pressure control will be measured over a 12 month period.&#xD;
      Outcomes will be determined primarily by 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and by&#xD;
      reviewing data in patient's charts located in family physicians office. Fifty family&#xD;
      physicians from the Kingston area have agreed to participate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to measure the effect of home (self) blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
      on control of hypertension in a primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is important for several reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Lack of control of hypertension is common and is associated with morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) The costs of managing hypertensions are high, not only because of the prevalence of&#xD;
      hypertension, but also because maintenance of control must exist over many years for most&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Home blood pressure monitoring is increasingly being used by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Guidelines for home blood pressure monitoring are already being developed and&#xD;
      distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) While it would seem helpful to increase self-care by patients, there is currently&#xD;
      conflicting or inadequate evidence that home monitoring is useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of the study is that, compared to patients who receive usual care,&#xD;
      patients who use home monitoring will have lower blood pressure levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary hypothesis is that HBPM changes physician and patient behaviours in ways that&#xD;
      would result in better control of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology uses cluster randomization. Physicians will be randomly allocated to either&#xD;
      have their patients use the intervention or to continue with usual care. The intervention for&#xD;
      the experimental group is the provision of a home blood pressure monitor to patients with a&#xD;
      request that they record weekly blood pressure measurements and report them to their family&#xD;
      physician at their regular hypertension follow-up visits. The physicians will be informed of&#xD;
      current guidelines for target levels for home monitored blood pressure. The control group&#xD;
      will receive usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measures will be blood pressure level (by 24 hour ambulatory monitoring) at&#xD;
      baseline, 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to measure the effect of home monitoring on&#xD;
      physicians' and patients' behaviours related to hypertension control. Behaviours that will be&#xD;
      measured include the intensity and type of pharmacological treatment, compliance with&#xD;
      antihypertensive medication and changes in patient's lifestyle.&#xD;
