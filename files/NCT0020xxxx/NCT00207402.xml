  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients who did not respond (did not lose virus during&#xD;
      treatment) or relapsed (virus went away on treatment but came back after treatment was&#xD;
      stopped) after treatment with at least twelve weeks of a pegylated (long-acting) interferon&#xD;
      and ribavirin will be considered for this study. There are two purposes to this study: first,&#xD;
      to determine how rosiglitazone, a medicine used to treat diabetes, affects the HCV viral&#xD;
      load; and second, to determine if treatment of insulin resistance with rosiglitazone prior to&#xD;
      therapy for HCV will improve sustained virologic response (loss of virus that continues&#xD;
      beyond six months after completion of HCV therapy) to HCV therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study will demonstrate the efficacy of treating insulin resistance with rosiglitazone in&#xD;
      CHC, genotype 1 patients who have failed previous treatment with pegylated interferon and&#xD;
      ribavirin. Pre-treatment with rosiglitazone may become the new standard of care prior to HCV&#xD;
      therapy for those patients who are insulin resistant, increasing their chance for achieving&#xD;
      an SVR on interferon alfacon-1 combination therapy and decreasing the morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      associated with chronic hepatitis C.&#xD;
