  <brief_title>A Study of Mycophenolate Mofetil and Cyclosporin, Without Concomitant Corticosteroids, After a First Renal Transplant</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is planned as a multicentric, randomized, prospective, open study in accordance&#xD;
      with a 1/1 plan, on parallel groups and 2 arms of treatment. A total of 200 patients with&#xD;
      chronic renal insufficiency, included in the French national waiting list of the&#xD;
      Establishment Français des Greffes [French Transplants Institution] and receiving a first&#xD;
      renal transplant will be included, after signed agreement, in this study. All the patients&#xD;
      will receive organs taken from brain-dead subjects. The patients will be given&#xD;
      immunosuppressant treatment based on rabbit anti-T lymphocyte serum, CellCeptÒ and NeoralÒ&#xD;
      cyclosporin. One group of 100 randomised patients will be given standard corticosteroid&#xD;
      therapy as well during the first six months following the transplant. This group will be&#xD;
      compared with a second group of 100 randomised patients who will be given a single dose of&#xD;
      corticosteroids. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the number of acute rejection&#xD;
      episodes in patients given a first renal transplant and subjected to an immunosuppressant&#xD;
      protocol not containing corticosteroids. The hypothesis which is proposed is that, in the&#xD;
      absence of corticosteroids and/or calcineurin inhibitors (i.e. cyclosporin and tacrolimus),&#xD;
      antilymphocyte serum results in a certain state of &quot;tolerance&quot; in respect of the allograft.&#xD;
      The second objective concerns the beneficial effect which the absence of corticosteroids may&#xD;
      have on short- and long-term postoperative morbidity and mortality. One may in fact assume&#xD;
      that the absence of corticosteroids will result in an extension of the transplant patient's&#xD;
      life expectancy as a result of the reduction in cardiovascular complications. Cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications are the most frequent cause of death after a renal transplant.&#xD;
