      Excitatory amino acids may be involved in secondary neuronal damage after traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury. The amount of microglia activation is an indirect measure of neuronal damage.&#xD;
      Micorglia activation will be measured R)-[11C]PK11195 PET 1 week, 1 month and 6 months after&#xD;
      brain injury.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glutamate and aspartate have been identified as the major excitatory neurotransmitters in the&#xD;
      central nervous system. A massive increase in the release of these excitatory amino acids&#xD;
      (EEA) has been described following traumatic brain injury. The resulting overstimulation of&#xD;
      neuronal EAA receptors, particularly the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors, leads to&#xD;
      excessive influx of calcium through receptor gated ion-channels, causing metabolic&#xD;
      derangement and finally cell death. Although the exact role of EEA in patients who have&#xD;
      suffered severe head injury remains to be established, it has been shown that sustained high&#xD;
      intracranial pressure (ICP) and poor outcome are significantly correlated to high levels of&#xD;
      EEA using microdialysis. Disadvantages of microdialysis are that it can only be used to&#xD;
      evaluate a limited part of the brain and that it can only be applied in the acute phase&#xD;
      following injury. The same limits also apply to ICP measurements. Therefore, methods which&#xD;
      evaluate both the extent and time course of damage in vivo are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites are a potential candidate for monitoring&#xD;
      neuronal damage. They are not normally present in cerebral tissue, but following neuronal&#xD;
      damage, the cells involved in the ensuing gliosis show marked expression of these sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (R)-PK11195 is a ligand that selectively binds to peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors.&#xD;
      Labeled with carbon-11 its uptake can be measured with Positron Emission Tomography (PET).&#xD;
      Thus, (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET can be used to monitor in-vivo gliosis after brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of twenty patients with traumatic brain injury will be included in this study. A&#xD;
      microdialysis probe will be placed in the brain parenchyma to continuously measure EEA until&#xD;
      the first PET scan is performed. Several cerebral and haemodynamic parameters, such as ICP&#xD;
      and mean arterial blood pressure, will be registered. All patients will receive two Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to evaluate the extent and anatomical localization of cerebral&#xD;
      damage. Three (R)-[11C]PK11195 PET scans will be performed: 1 week, 1 month and 6 months&#xD;
      after the injury. Outcome will be determined using several outcome scales, including the&#xD;
      Glasgow Outcome Scale at six months. In addition, patients will be investigated by repeated&#xD;
      neuropsychological examinations.&#xD;
