  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We want to compare Taxol given weekly with Taxotere given every 3 week both in comination&#xD;
      with Xeloda. We are going to compare time to treatment failure and quality of life.&#xD;

      Open labeled randomized multicentre phase II/III trial. It is intended to include patients&#xD;
      who are not usually included into clinical trials because they are not having disease with&#xD;
      measurable lesions. In breast cancer the bulk of patients with metastatic disease is&#xD;
      presenting with bone metastases which is difficult to evaluate with respect to response. In&#xD;
      this study it is one of the main objectives to include this kind of everyday patients that we&#xD;
      see in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of this we will be using TTF as the primary endpoint. Skeletal events requiring&#xD;
      radiotherapy or major changes in pain medications are defined as treatment failures causing&#xD;
      stop in treatment even in the absence of radiological findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: weekly Taxol® plus Xeloda® on days 1-14 q 3w B: Taxotere® q 3w plus Xeloda® on days 1-14 q&#xD;
      3w&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized equally between the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant therapy: Simultaneous use of bisphosphonates is allowed, if this treatment has&#xD;
      been initiated at least four weeks before study entry.&#xD;
