    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to 1) evaluate the possible usefulness of a panel of&#xD;
      cardiac markers in assessing emergency department patients with possible acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome, 2) evaluate the usefulness of BNP in assessing emergency department patients with&#xD;
      possible acute coronary syndrome, 3) determine if BNP can be used to predict adverse events&#xD;
      during hospitalization and in the emergency department, and 4) evaluate how a Point-of-Care&#xD;
      testing platform affects resource utilization in the emergency department.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The correct diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains a frequent significant&#xD;
      challenge for emergency physicians. Over eight million chest pain patients present annually&#xD;
      and despite promising advances in diagnosis, over four percent of ACS patients are mistakenly&#xD;
      discharged home. While the history and physical, cardiac risk factor assessment, ECG, and&#xD;
      cardiac marker determination are all included in the assessment and risk stratification of&#xD;
      patients presenting with possible ACS, this assessment is clearly far from perfect. Improved&#xD;
      rapid and accurate means of assessment in this population in the ED are clearly needed.ED&#xD;
      patients with chest discomfort will be screened and approached for study enrollment.&#xD;
      Consenting patients meeting the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Point-of-care serial cardiac marker measurements will be performed. Based on a web-based&#xD;
      computerized randomization system, half (50%) the patients willundergo routine central&#xD;
      laboratory testing only. Half (50%) of the patients will undergopoint-of-care markers&#xD;
      performed in the ED in addition to routine central laboratory testing.In this second group,&#xD;
      central laboratory test results will be blinded from the ED physicianuntil the disposition&#xD;
      time. BNP will be blinded and not reported to physicians for the first 500 patients (Phase&#xD;
      I). After the first 500 patients have been enrolled, an interim analysis will be performed to&#xD;
      determine the clinical utility of BNP in patient assessment. After physician education of&#xD;
      these results, the trial will resume for the remaining 500 patients (Phase II). In Phase II,&#xD;
      BNP levels will be provided to the physicians using the same time and randomization&#xD;
      format.The patients and their medical records will be followed for a period of thirty days&#xD;
      and sixmonths after enrollment.&#xD;
