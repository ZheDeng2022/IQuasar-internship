    <textblock>
      Prior to the first infusion, patients will be randomized into one of two groups (placebo or&#xD;
      infliximab). All patients will continue to receive the same does of methotrexate (MTX) during&#xD;
      the study as received prior to the study. The objective of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety result of infliximab with Korean patients in reducing clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at 30 weeks following the onset of treatment and to&#xD;
      review whether the result is comparable to the result of the ATTRACT trial.&#xD;
