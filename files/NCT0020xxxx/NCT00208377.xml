  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance and determine the metal ion release&#xD;
      of the DePuy ASR™ System in the treatment of patients with hip joint disease requiring hip&#xD;
      resurfacing surgery. Patients who enter the study will be evaluated at regular intervals&#xD;
      following hip surgery using patient, clinical and x-ray assessments. A subset of patients&#xD;
      will also have blood samples taken at regular intervals to allow the metal ion levels to be&#xD;
      determined and undergo scans to allow the bone mineral density of the bone surrounding the&#xD;
      implant to be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DePuy decided to close this Study in 4Q 2009. The Study was terminated with effect from&#xD;
      December 2010 to allow for the completion of the 5 year follow up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note that subsequent to this decision DePuy voluntarily recalled the ASR products on&#xD;
      24 August 2010. Additional information regarding this voluntary recall and the follow-up of&#xD;
      patients affected by the recall can be found at the following links&#xD;

        the last 6 month(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        ix) Subjects who are currently, or have been in the last 12 months, participating in a&#xD;
