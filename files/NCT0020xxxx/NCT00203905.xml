      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate time to progression in eligible patients&#xD;
      with cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, paranasal sinuses, and cervical esophagus&#xD;
      when treated with the concomitant chemoradiotherapy regimen of bevacizumab/5-fluorouracil&#xD;
      (5-FU)/hydroxyurea/radiation therapy (B-FHX) in comparison to 5-fluorouracil hydroxyurea&#xD;
      (FHX) alone.&#xD;

      In this study, we intend to explore the feasibility and the effects of adding bevacizumab to&#xD;
      Fl-TX in patients with intermediate stage head and neck cancer and selected patients with&#xD;
      stage IV disease. As mentioned previously, although single modality therapy (surgery or&#xD;
      radiotherapy alone) is often used to treat patients with Stage II head and neck malignancies,&#xD;
      with substantial success, still there is a sizeable group of patients (approximately 30% or&#xD;
      40%) who fail these treatments, and represent with locoregional recurrences which are much&#xD;
      more difficult to treat. Furthermore, the common use of radical surgery in many instances&#xD;
      leads to loss of organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this knowledge, we feel that it is justifiable to include stage II patients (T2NO)&#xD;
      in combined chemoradiation studies. Our extensive experience using chemoradiotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with regionally advanced non-metastatic Stage 4 cancers of the head and neck area&#xD;
      suggests that selected patients with low nodal status (Nondisease) including those with T4&#xD;
      primaries (i.e. T4 NO MO and T4 Nl MO) have a lower risk of distant failure than patients&#xD;
      that present with higher nodal status (N2 and N3 disease). Aggressive combined locoregional&#xD;
      therapies such as the one that will be administered in the study, are in our opinion&#xD;
      appropriate for this group of patients as they address the major concern which is&#xD;
      locoregional failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study is exploration of the pharmacodynamic effects of bevacizumab&#xD;
      (10 mg/kg) on appropriate markers of angiogenesis in tumor tissue in comparison to a&#xD;
      non-bevacizumab containing chemoradiation regimen (FHX alone). These results will be&#xD;
      correlated with a number of clinical endpoints including rapidity of clinical response,&#xD;
      locoregional control rates, time to progression, need of salvage surgery, overall survival&#xD;
      and measures of QOL and organ function. The predictive and prognostic value of specific&#xD;
      molecular markers in patients with HNC will also be evaluated. In order to shorten the total&#xD;
      duration of treatment without affecting the total administered dose, we have modified our&#xD;
      traditional radiation schedule in FHX to include two treatment daily fractions as opposed to&#xD;
      one. This modification will allow for the completion of all treatment in 4 to 5 cycles as&#xD;
      opposed to the traditional 6 to 7 cycles. Given this modification in the radiation schedule,&#xD;
      we considered it prudent to include a control arm (modified FHX) in addition to B-FHX, within&#xD;
      a randomized design. The control arm will also help with the interpretation of the results&#xD;
      obtained with the measurement of the correlative markers of angiogenesis.&#xD;
