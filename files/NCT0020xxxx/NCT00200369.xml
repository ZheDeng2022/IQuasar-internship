  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that the level of adherence necessary to achieve HIV&#xD;
      virologic suppression with a ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor regimen (i.e.&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir) is less than the 95% rate observed in the published literature with&#xD;
      unboosted regimens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The existing dogma is that patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to&#xD;
      treat their HIV infection must take at least 95% of prescribed doses in order to maintain&#xD;
      full suppression of viral replication. This belief is largely based on a single study that&#xD;
      was performed between 1997 and 1999 (Ann Int Med 2000;133:21-30). The vast majority of&#xD;
      patients in this study were receiving regimens based on either indinavir, nelfinavir,&#xD;
      ritonavir, or saquinavir. All of these agents have relatively short half-lives, and therefore&#xD;
      must be taken on time two or three times per day. Newer medications such as&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) feature much more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. On the&#xD;
      basis of improved pharmacokinetics, there is reason to believe that regimens built around&#xD;
      such agents may be more forgiving of missed medication doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to enroll 90 patients from the MMC I.D. Clinic who are either receiving or&#xD;
      are about to receive Kaletra. Patients who agree to participate will be furnished with a MEMS&#xD;
      cap, a bottle cap that electronically records each time that the bottle is opened and stores&#xD;
      the data for computer download, and will undergo electronic monitoring of their Kaletra&#xD;
      adherence for a period of siz months. Adherence data will not be reviewed during the study,&#xD;
      but at study end (and at interim time points), the investigators will analyze the MEMS cap&#xD;
      data from patients who have completed the study in order to determine the threshold value of&#xD;
      adherence necessary to achieve satisfactory rates (i.e. 70-80%) of complete virologic&#xD;
      suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional aim of the study is to collect specimens from patients receiving Kaletra based&#xD;
      regimens who experience virologic failure and to archive them for possible studies of&#xD;
      genotypic and phenotypic resistance in the future.&#xD;
