  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the 'estrogen-protection' hypothesis by comparing changes in psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms between one group of patients receiving standard antipsychotic drug treatment plus&#xD;
      placebo and a second matched group receiving standard antipsychotic drug treatment plus&#xD;
      100microgram estradiol patch in a double blind controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis : That the women receiving adjunctive estradiol will demonstrate a more rapid and&#xD;
      more substantial decrease in psychotic symptoms over the course of the study than the women&#xD;
      receiving adjunctive placebo.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects up to two percent of the adult&#xD;
      population. Patients present with a variety of symptoms including hallucinations, delusions&#xD;
      and bizarre behaviour while some develop additional &quot;negative&quot; symptoms such as amotivational&#xD;
      states and poverty of thought. Schizophrenia is generally thought to be an organic brain&#xD;
      disorder with psychosocial determinants for course and outcome. The illness appears to be&#xD;
      heterogenous with groups of patients presenting with distinct and differing patterns of&#xD;
      psychopathology and illness course. Part of this heterogeneity includes distinct male and&#xD;
      female subtypes of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent times, gender differences in schizophrenia have received some attention, in&#xD;
      particular from an epidemiological and psychopathological perspective. Hormonal studies have&#xD;
      been utilised to investigate underlying neuroendocrine disturbances in schizophrenia, but&#xD;
      information from these studies has not been used in the development of new gender specific&#xD;
      treatment strategies. Overall the treatment of schizophrenia has remained gender-blind. The&#xD;
      main gender differences observed in schizophrenia that have international consensus include&#xD;
      the later age of onset in women, better response to neuroleptics in women, and more treatment&#xD;
      resistant negative symptoms in men. Women have also demonstrated vulnerability to psychotic&#xD;
      episodes during menopause, the post-partum period and at low estrogen phases of the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From these clinical observations, Seeman and Lang hypothesised that estrogen may provide&#xD;
      &quot;protection&quot; against early onset of severe schizophrenia in women, thereby accounting for&#xD;
      increased vulnerability during both lifetime and monthly low estrogen phases. Findings from&#xD;
      both basic and clinical research warrant further investigation of the hypothesis that&#xD;
      estrogen has a protective effect in women not only over the female life cycle, but also over&#xD;
      the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have been conducting clinical trials in patients with schizophrenia using estrogen as a&#xD;
      treatment for many years, and have an international reputation for work in this area.&#xD;
      Initially, we conducted an open clinical trial with acutely ill schizophrenic women and added&#xD;
      0.02mg of oral estradiol to the antipsychotic drug treatment of 11 women. Their response was&#xD;
      compared to seven women who received antipsychotic drugs alone. The estrogen adjunct group&#xD;
      showed dramatic earlier improvement, with significant reduction in positive psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms by day 3 of treatment. This suggests that estradiol may act as a catalyst for&#xD;
      treatment and could prove to be an important adjunctive treatment in the therapy of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Subsequent to this early pilot study, we conducted a double blind placebo&#xD;
      controlled 3-arm study of 100mcg, 50mcg estradiol and placebo transdermal adjunctive patches.&#xD;
      Published in Schizophrenia Research(2001), our results showed that the 100mcg estradiol&#xD;
      adjunct afforded the best outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the usefulness of estradiol as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia ,by&#xD;
      comparing changes in psychopathology between one group of patients receiving standard&#xD;
      antipsychotic drug treatment plus a placebo skin patch and a second matched group receiving&#xD;
      standard antipsychotic drug treatment plus a 100mcg estradiol patch in a double blind, 28&#xD;
      day, controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS REVIEW AND INFORMED CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for this study has been approved by the Alfred Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients who are able to give informed consent, i.e. able to demonstrate an&#xD;
      understanding of the objectives of the study and the implications of their role in it, will&#xD;
      be recruited into the study. Patients who are extremely psychotic or disturbed will not be&#xD;
      approached to enter the study. Involuntary patients who are able to give informed consent&#xD;
      will be able to participate and where possible a guardian or relative will be contacted and&#xD;
      notified of the patients' involvement. Patients will be advised that their participation is&#xD;
      voluntary and that they are free to withdraw from the study at any stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' identity will remain anonymous at all times. Once a patient agrees to participate&#xD;
      in the study, she will be assigned a code number to ensure anonymity. Information about the&#xD;
      subject will be restricted to the researchers directly involved, unless there are clear&#xD;
      management issues, in which case the information will be shared with the treatment team.&#xD;
      Patients' files will be stored in locked filing cabinets with access available to researchers&#xD;
      only. All test results will be shared with the patient and family / guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A target number of 100 patients will be recruited over a three-year period with equal numbers&#xD;
      being allocated to each group. Patients will be recruited from both inpatient and outpatient&#xD;
      settings and patients may be recruited from other centres providing that approval has been&#xD;
      gained from the appropriate controlling bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female patients who have a current DSM 4 diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective or&#xD;
      Schizophreniform Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female patients with postpartum psychosis or related disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female patients with known abnormalities in the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal-axis,&#xD;
           thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female patients taking estrogen preparations such as the oral contraceptive pill.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female patients whose psychotic illness is directly due to illicit drugs or who have a&#xD;
           history of substance abuse or dependence during the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females with any significant unstable medical illness such as cardiovascular disease, renal&#xD;
      disease, Addisons disease, thromboembolic disorders, epilepsy, diabetes etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Post-menopausal or pre-menarche female patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any stage without offering an explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients experiencing any adverse effects which, in the opinion of the investigator, are&#xD;
      serious (i.e. life threatening, requiring hospitalisation or medical treatment) will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study immediately. All patients withdrawn will be followed up until the&#xD;
      adverse event has resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TREATMENTS CONCOMITANT TREATMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will participate in standard in-patient and outpatient psychosocial therapies&#xD;
      and activities as advised by their treatment team. All patients will receive psychotropic and&#xD;
      non-psychotropic medications as per their treatment teams orders. All medications received&#xD;
      during the study will be recorded to be included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY MEDICATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves the addition of transdermal 100mcg estradiol (or transdermal placebo-&#xD;
      inactive substance) to standard antipsychotic treatment for 4 weeks. The length of the trial&#xD;
      is 1 menstrual cycle, which is a short period of estrogen use. Most side effects commonly&#xD;
      associated with estrogen use are related to long term administration and are thus not&#xD;
      applicable in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY MEASUREMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PANSS (Kay et al. 1987) will be performed at screening/baseline and at each evaluation&#xD;
      visit. The PANSS consists of a Positive Scale (7 positive symptom constructs), a Negative&#xD;
      Scale (7 negative symptom constructs) and a General Psychopathology Scale (16 symptom&#xD;
      constructs). This scale will be the primary outcome measure of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the PANSS, the Adverse Symptom Checklist, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale,&#xD;
      Simpson Angus Scale and serum hormone measurements will be completed at each visit. Cognitive&#xD;
      testing will be performed monthly. Participants will be assessed at baseline, day 7, day 14,&#xD;
      day 21 and day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data gathered will be entered in the patients file under the patients code number. Files&#xD;
      will be stored in the research unit in locked filing cabinets. Data entered on computer will&#xD;
      be done so using the patients code number for identification. A separate booklet will be used&#xD;
      to record data collected at screening, baseline, and evaluation visits. All files will be&#xD;
      retained by the hospital for a period of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
