      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the use of two adjunctive hormonal agents in a 28 day three-arm, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study in the treatment of acute mania/hypomania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      That women receiving adjunctive Tamoxifen or Progesterone will demonstrate a more rapid and&#xD;
      more substantial decrease in manic symptoms over the course of the study than women receiving&#xD;
      adjunctive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty females with a current diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder or Schizoaffective&#xD;
      disorder - Manic Phase, according to the operationalised criteria of the Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV) of the American Psychiatric Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY MEDICATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tamoxifen. One third of patients (twenty) will be randomized to receive adjunctive Tamoxifen&#xD;
      at 40 mg/day for 28 days. The Tamoxifen will be administered within a plain capsule to&#xD;
      maintain &quot;blinding&quot; of treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progesterone. One third of patients (twenty) will be randomized to receive adjunctive oral&#xD;
      Provera (progesterone) at 20 mg/day. The Progesterone will be administered within a plain&#xD;
      capsule identical to that used with Tamoxifen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo. The remaining one third of patients will be randomized to receive adjunctive placebo&#xD;
      (inert substance). The placebo substance will be administered within a plain capsule&#xD;
      identical to that used with Tamoxifen and Progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY EVALUATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected over a 28-day period for each patient. Visits will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline, and then at weekly intervals. A total of five visits will be completed for each&#xD;
      patient. The following evaluations will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric evaluation to determine diagnosis. (Baseline visit only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General clinical evaluation including medical history, current conditions and a&#xD;
           non-invasive physical examination, body weight, vital signs. (Baseline visit only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication history (baseline and evaluation visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics (baseline visits only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of clinical rating scales; CARS-M, PANSS, MADRS, AIMS, Barnes Akathisia scale&#xD;
           (BA), and Simpson-Angus scale (SA) (baseline and evaluation visits). A Menstrual Cycle&#xD;
           Interview and a cognitive assessment (RBANS) will be performed at baseline and endpoint&#xD;
           (day 28) visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory tests including; Serum levels of mood stabilizer, luteinizing hormone (LH),&#xD;
           follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), Estrogen, Progesterone, Prolactin,&#xD;
           dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), Testosterone and protein kinase C(PKC) (baseline and&#xD;
           evaluation visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion/exclusion checklist (baseline visit only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent (baseline visit only).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bipolar Affective Disorder remains an illness with high morbidity and mortality. Mood&#xD;
      stabilizers such as lithium and sodium valproate have been described as having their&#xD;
      anti-manic effect by targeting protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes (Manji and Lenos, 1999). In&#xD;
      rats chronically treated with lithium, there is a reduction of the major PKC substrate MARCKS&#xD;
      and a reduction in the hippocampus of the expression of two protein kinase isozymes, alpha&#xD;
      and epsilon. Manji et al. (1999) further postulated that PKC inhibitors such as tamoxifen and&#xD;
      other estrogen antagonists might represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for the&#xD;
      treatment of mania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical support for the use of &quot;anti-estrogens&quot; in treating mania are found in case reports&#xD;
      such as Nelson (1998), and Goldstein (1986), describing the use of danazol in a case of&#xD;
      mania, and by Chouinard et al (1987) describing the use of estrogen and progesterone in a&#xD;
      case of mania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent preliminary trial by Bebchuk et al, (2000), demonstrated that adjunctive tamoxifen&#xD;
      improved in manic symptoms in seven patients. A limitation of their trial was that they&#xD;
      failed to standardise the other treatment agents used, which included lithium,&#xD;
      antidepressants, anxiolytic and anti-psychotic medications. Mania in women is also noted to&#xD;
      have cyclic variations, which is poorly documented and largely anecdotal. This needs further&#xD;
      study, and since there is a preponderance of affective disorder in women, we propose&#xD;
      conducting a study in women with active symptoms of mania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To test and compare the use of two adjunctive&#xD;
      hormonal agents in a 28 day three-arm double-blind, placebo-controlled study in the treatment&#xD;
      of acute mania or hypomania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To examine the impact of hormonal treatments on PKC pathways in women&#xD;
      with mania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To document any observed cyclical variations in the presentation of mania or hypomania in&#xD;
      women with bipolar affective disorder and schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS REVIEW AND INFORMED CONSENT ETHICS APPROVAL The protocol for this study has been&#xD;
      approved by the Southern Health Multidisciplinary Ethics Committee and The Alfred Ethics&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT Only patients who are able to give informed consent, (ie. Able to&#xD;
      demonstrate an understanding of the objectives of the study and the implications of their&#xD;
      role in it), will be recruited into the study. Patients who are extremely psychotic or&#xD;
      disturbed will not be approached to enter the study. Involuntary patients who are able to&#xD;
      give informed consent will be able to participate and where possible a guardian or relative&#xD;
      will be contacted and notified of the patient's involvement. Patients will be advised that&#xD;
      their participation is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw from the study at any&#xD;
      stage&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY Once a patient agrees to participate in the study, she will be assigned a&#xD;
      code number to ensure anonymity. All files will be identified with the patients code number&#xD;
      only. Patient's files will be stored in locked filing cabinets with access available to&#xD;
      researchers only. Information about the patient will be restricted to the researchers&#xD;
      directly involved and the patient's treating doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION NUMBERS A target number of 60 patients will be recruited over 3 years.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from both inpatient and outpatient settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any stage without offering an&#xD;
           explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients experiencing any adverse effects which, in the opinion of the investigator, are&#xD;
           serious (i.e. life threatening, requiring hospitalisation or medical treatment) will be&#xD;
           withdrawn from the study immediately. All patients withdrawn will be followed up until&#xD;
           the adverse event has resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TREATMENTS CONCOMITANT TREATMENTS All patients will participate in standard in-patient&#xD;
      and outpatient psychosocial therapies and activities as advised by their treatment team. All&#xD;
      patients will receive psychotropic and non-psychotropic medications as per their treatment&#xD;
      teams orders. All medications received during the study will be recorded to be included in&#xD;
      the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY MEDICATION Tamoxifen. One third of patients will be randomised to receive adjunctive&#xD;
      Tamoxifen at 40mg/day for 28 days. The Tamoxifen will be administered within a plain capsule&#xD;
      to maintain &quot;blinding&quot; of the treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progesterone. One third of patients will be randomised to receive adjunctive Provera&#xD;
      (progesterone) at 20mg/day. The Progesterone will be administered within a plain capsule&#xD;
      identical to that used with Tamoxifen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo. The remaining one third of patients will be randomised to receive adjunctive placebo&#xD;
      (inert substance). The placebo substance will be administered within a plain capsule&#xD;
      identical to that used with Tamoxifen and Progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICATION SIDE EFFECTS Medication side effects are minimised in this study by the short&#xD;
      duration of the trial (28 days), the dosing levels used, and by the careful monitoring of&#xD;
      side effects at each visit. Possible side effects of Tamoxifen include; hot flushes, nausea,&#xD;
      liver enzyme changes, fluid retention, spotting, changes to blood clotting profiles, and&#xD;
      light-headedness. Possible side effects of progesterone (medroxyprogesterone acetate)&#xD;
      include; nausea, breast tenderness, changes to liver enzymes, blood clotting profile changes,&#xD;
      acne and light-headedness.Patients can withdraw consent at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY EVALUATIONS STRUCTURED CLINICAL INTERVIEW FOR DSM-IV (SCID) The structured clinical&#xD;
      interview for DSM-III-R (SCID-R Spitzer et al. 1990 see appendix D) will be used to confirm&#xD;
      diagnosis for patients entering the study. This will be performed by the treating doctor&#xD;
      prior to randomisation. It consists of a structured interview in which the doctor asks set&#xD;
      questions regarding symptoms and then rates the reply on a three point scale where 1 = absent&#xD;
      or false and 3 = threshold or true.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICIAN ADMINISTERED RATING SCALE FOR MANIA (CARS - M) The CARS-M is a scale devised&#xD;
      specifically to measure the symptoms of Mania associated with BPAD. It is administered as a&#xD;
      structured clinical interview. The scale comprises of 15 items and assesses the severity of&#xD;
      manic and psychotic symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOM SCHEDULE (PANSS) The PANSS (Kay et al. 1987) will be performed&#xD;
      at screening/baseline and at each evaluation visit. The PANSS consists of a Positive Scale (7&#xD;
      positive symptom constructs), a Negative Scale (7 negative symptom constructs) and a General&#xD;
      Psychopathology Scale (16 symptom constructs). For each patient, the scale should be&#xD;
      administered by the same rater at the same time of day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONTGOMERY ASBERG DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (MADRS) The MADRS is a ten item rating scale for&#xD;
      rating levels of depression. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale from 0 to 6, where 0&#xD;
      indicates absence of the symptom and 6 indicates extreme presence of the symptom. The time&#xD;
      frame for the scale is the previous four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABNORMAL INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENT SCALE (AIMS) The AIMS will be completed at screening/baseline&#xD;
      and at each evaluation visit. The scale consists of 10 items, each to be rated on a 4-point&#xD;
      scale of severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIMPSON-ANGUS SCALE (SAS) The SAS will be completed at screening/baseline and at each&#xD;
      evaluation visit. This scale consists of a list of 10 symptoms, each to be rated on a 5-point&#xD;
      scale of severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BARNES AKATHISIA RATING SCALE The presence and severity of akathisia will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and at each follow-up visit on the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. The scale consists&#xD;
      of four items (objective observation of akathisia by the investigator, subjective feeling of&#xD;
      restlessness by the patient, patient distress due to akathisia, and global evaluation of&#xD;
      akathisia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MENSTRUAL CYCLE INTERVIEW To collect information on patient's menstrual history as well as&#xD;
      their current menstrual status, a Menstrual Cycle Interview will be administered for&#xD;
      pre-menopausal patients. This interview consists of 13 questions related to the patients&#xD;
      menstrual cycle and associated issues. The questionnaire can be used in conjunction with&#xD;
      serum hormone levels to determine menstrual cycle phase. The questionnaire is administered at&#xD;
      baseline and again at the conclusion of the trial. Patients will also be asked to keep a&#xD;
      menstrual calendar to register onset and cessation of menstruation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LABORATORY TESTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be collected at baseline and at each visit to measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serum mood stabiliser levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PKC activity, using 32P-labelled phosphate transfer techniques and platelets. To be&#xD;
           analysed off site at the Mental Health Research Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hormone assays of estrogen, progesterone, luteinising hormone, follicle stimulating&#xD;
           hormone and prolactin. These levels give an indication of anti-estrogen activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REPEATABLE BATTERY FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS (RBANS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate cognitive function the RBANS will be administered at baseline and again at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the trial. The RBANS comprises 12 subtests that are used to calculate five&#xD;
      index scores (Immediate Memory; Visuospatial/Constructional; Language; Attention; and,&#xD;
      Delayed Memory) and a total score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY ASPECTS ADVERSE EVENTS All adverse events will be recorded by the investigator at each&#xD;
      visit. Any adverse events occurring during the course of the study will be followed up once&#xD;
      the patient completes the study until such time that the adverse event has resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHEDULE OF PATIENT VISITS SCREENING Patients will be screened as soon after admission as&#xD;
      possible. After a patient has been deemed eligible to enter the study, informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained. No study procedures will be implemented prior to attainment of informed consent.&#xD;
      Where possible, the baseline visit will be completed at the same time as the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATION VISITS A total of five evaluation visits will be performed at baseline, week 1, 2,&#xD;
      3 &amp; 4. All visits will be performed +/- 2 days of the scheduled visit date. At each&#xD;
      evaluation visit researchers will check and record adverse events, perform psychopathology&#xD;
      rating scales, and collect the blood sample for hormone assay. Participants will be&#xD;
      reimbursed $20 per visit to cover the cost of travel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY MANAGEMENT DATA RECORDING All data gathered will be entered in the patients file under&#xD;
      the patients code number. Files will be stored in the research unit in locked filing&#xD;
      cabinets. Data entered on computer will be done so using the patients code number for&#xD;
      identification. A separate booklet will be used to record data collected at screening,&#xD;
      baseline, and evaluation visits. All files will be retained by the hospital for a period of&#xD;
      15 years after completion or discontinuation of the trial.&#xD;
