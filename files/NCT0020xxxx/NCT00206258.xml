      The purpose of this study is to see if giving pramlintide and insulin before a meal would&#xD;
      lower high blood sugar and if a glucagon (a naturally made hormone in the body but reduced in&#xD;
      diabetes and its role is in prevention of low blood sugar) shot given in the late &quot;after&#xD;
      meal&quot; time would prevent low blood sugar. The studies outlined in this proposal might help in&#xD;
      developing new treatment options to target &quot;after meal&quot; high blood sugar and before meal low&#xD;
      blood sugar in children. This would possibly help improve overall blood sugar control and&#xD;
      prevent the long-term complications of diabetes.&#xD;

      Objective: To develop a new treatment approach in the prevention of hypo and hyperglycemia in&#xD;
      children with type 1diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background/Rationale: The diabetes control and complications trial (DCCT) showed that&#xD;
      improving blood sugar control for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) stopped or delayed&#xD;
      the onset of long-term complications. As a result of the study, intensive management to&#xD;
      control blood sugar and glycosylated hemoglobin as near to normal as safely as possible is&#xD;
      advocated. However, hypoglycemia was increased 3 fold in the DCCT study and is the major&#xD;
      limiting factor in gaining &quot;tight&quot; control of blood sugar in T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Project: In health individuals, &quot;after meal&quot; blood sugar level is very&#xD;
      carefully controlled. Insulin (the hormone that lowers blood sugar) and glucagon (the hormone&#xD;
      that raises blood sugar) play a key role in maintaining this careful balance. Recently we&#xD;
      understand that a hormone called amylin also contributes to this careful after meal blood&#xD;
      glucose balance. Amylin in the immediate after meal period works by reducing glucagon, which&#xD;
      in turn reduces the liver releasing stored sugar into the blood stream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In T1DM, there is the lack of insulin and failure of glucagon suppression leading to&#xD;
      hyperglycemia immediately following when food is eaten. Also, glucagon is not regulated&#xD;
      correctly after a meal. The glucagon normally produced by the body does not increase in&#xD;
      response to hypoglycemia thus interfering with the delicate balance between glucose&#xD;
      production and glucose used. Therefore, it is difficult to get normal blood sugar when&#xD;
      someone has type1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the treatment for mild to moderate hypoglycemia causing a sudden feeling of racing&#xD;
      heart, feeling sweaty, weak or hungry is to eat or drink carbohydrate in the awake person.&#xD;
      Severe hypoglycemia (unconsciousness due to low blood sugar) is treated with a glucagon shot.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there are no treatments to prevent mild or severe hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving pramlintide (manmade amylin) and insulin before&#xD;
      a meal would lower hyperglycemia and if a glucagon shot given in the late &quot;after meal&quot; time&#xD;
      would prevent hypoglycemia and allow the blood sugar levels to improve in people with T1DM.&#xD;
      The studies outlined in this proposal might help in developing new treatment options to&#xD;
      target &quot;after meal&quot; hyperglycemia high blood glucose and before meal hypoglycemia in&#xD;
      children. This study for the first time will investigate the role of glucagon in the&#xD;
      causation of hyperglycemia and its role in the prevention of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance to Type 1 diabetes: Using naturally occurring hormones that are dysregulated or&#xD;
      deficient in T1DM we wish to restore normal glucose concentration in T1DM. Such treatment if&#xD;
      successful would be a major breakthrough in the prevention of hyper and hypoglycemia and in&#xD;
      decreasing both short and long-term complications associated with T1DM.&#xD;
