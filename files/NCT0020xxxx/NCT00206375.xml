  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving growth hormone and Lupron along with thyroid&#xD;
      hormone will improve final height in patients with long term hypothyroidism. Lupron is a&#xD;
      medicine which is used to delay puberty and to prevent early closure of growing bones which&#xD;
      might increase growth potential. Growth hormone is used to restore growth rate. This study&#xD;
      will include children with &quot;short term&quot; and &quot;long term&quot; hypothyroidism.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothyroidism is often associated with growth failure. It takes several years for slow&#xD;
      growth to be noticed. This growth retardation is typically severe and progressive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid hormone is necessary for normal growth. Treatment with thyroxine (thyroid hormone)&#xD;
      results in rapid catch-up growth, which mostly happens during the first 18 months. Growth is&#xD;
      accompanied by increased bone age, which means early fusion (closure of the growing bones) of&#xD;
      the bones and reduced growth potential. For example, a patient, who is 10 years old but has&#xD;
      bone age of 12 years, has growth potential of a 12 year old and will stop growing 2 years&#xD;
      earlier than a 10 year old patient. According to the literature, prolonged juvenile&#xD;
      hypothyroidism (low thyroid condition) resulted in a permanent loss in height and only 70%&#xD;
      catch-up growth was generally achieved with thyroxine replacement.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients should have clinical and biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism, T4 less than&#xD;
             5.0 ng /dl , fT4 less than 1.0 mcg/dl and TSH of more than 10. Patients with prolonged&#xD;
             hypothyroidism should have growth failure and delayed bone age of at least 2 SD from&#xD;
             the mean. Patients with short term hypothyroidism should have normal growth velocity&#xD;
             and bone age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Females 8 to 16 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Males 9 to 17 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients without any chronic medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Availability of a parent or guardian to attend study visits with the patient and to be&#xD;
             actively involved in the patient treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Give written informed consent prior to any study specific screening procedure with the&#xD;
             understanding that the patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time&#xD;
             without penalty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Taking medications that affect their growth. (eg. Systemic corticosteroids, anabolic&#xD;
             steroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Experiencing other health problems/conditions that affect their growth rate such as&#xD;
             growth hormone deficiency, Cushing Syndrome, rickets, and chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with any condition that is a contraindication for GH therapy would include&#xD;
             conditions such as an active tumor, impaired glucose tolerance, neurofibromatosis&#xD;
             (worsening of neurofibromatosis), and hypertrophy of tonsils and adenoids with sleep&#xD;
             apnea. Contraindications for patients for GNRHa therapy would include a severe&#xD;
             systemic reaction to GNRHa which is rare, osteopenia, and osteoporosis, because&#xD;
             delaying puberty will worsen the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Moving to a location that the patient will not be able to be followed by a pediatric&#xD;
             endocrinologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient is not willing to continue with the study. -&#xD;
