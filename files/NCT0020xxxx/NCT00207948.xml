      This was a feasibility study aimed at elevating protease inhibitors (PI) dosage as a part of&#xD;
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). After the pharmacokinetics for the currently&#xD;
      prescribed PI were determined,patients with a vIQ&lt;1 were eligible for a 50% dose increase for&#xD;
      an 8 week time frame after which their vIQ would be reassessed to determine if increasing&#xD;
      their PI dosage thereby increasing the bioavaiability would reduce their viral load.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although, the use of protease inhibitors (PI) containing highly active antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (HAART) has led to a remarkable improvement in the prognosis and outcome of HIV infection,&#xD;
      only 45% to 70% of treatment-na√Øve patients who commence HAART achieve complete virological&#xD;
      suppression. The emergence of HIV resistance to antiretroviral drugs is one of the main&#xD;
      obstacles to the successful long-term suppression of HIV replication. Poor adherence and&#xD;
      unfavorable pharmacokinetics (PK) caused by altered absorption, genetic variations in&#xD;
      metabolism and drug-drug interactions frequently lead to antiretroviral drug concentrations&#xD;
      below the inhibitory concentration for 50% of the viral quasispecies (IC50) and loss of viral&#xD;
      suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enzymes of the cytochrome (CYP) P450 (CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5) family located in the liver&#xD;
      and small intestine are responsible for the metabolism of PIs. The absence of expression of&#xD;
      certain enzymes from this family was recently correlated with a genetic polymorphism, which&#xD;
      may have a major role in variation of cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism. Results of&#xD;
      these studies suggest significant differences in the distribution of the polymorphism&#xD;
      associated alleles between ethnic groups, in particular between Caucasians and African&#xD;
      Americans. Detection of cytochrome P450 variant alleles and more detailed data on their&#xD;
      allelic frequency in various ethnic groups is critical to assess their impact on PK of&#xD;
      antiretroviral agents, in particular PIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research proposal is aimed at the development of a novel multidisciplinary approach to&#xD;
      optimize HAART in HIV infected children. It is increasingly clear that inter-individual&#xD;
      variation in drug metabolism and responsiveness has a strong genetic component. The metabolic&#xD;
      pathways leading to drug clearance, bio-availability, and cellular responses are complex, and&#xD;
      only beginning to be understood. Key to our understanding of inter-individual responses is&#xD;
      identification of the genetic polymorphisms that contribute to this variability, the relative&#xD;
      contribution of different genes/SNPs, and the possible interactions between the corresponding&#xD;
      protein products or pathways. We propose to develop a dosing regimen of PIs in HIV-infected&#xD;
      children that takes into account genetic variability in drug metabolism and transport, and&#xD;
      resistance of the dominant viral strain (as determined by virtual phenotype).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to do so, the protocol address the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 1 (completed previously): Determine the prevalence of genetic variations in&#xD;
           CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and MDR-1 genes in a cohort of children and adolescents with&#xD;
           HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 2 (completed previously): Evaluate the relationship of this genetic&#xD;
           variability to the pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmin, Cmax, AUC) and toxicity (graded by&#xD;
           the Division of AIDS [DAIDS] classification) of protease inhibitors in pediatric&#xD;
           patients with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 3 (THIS STUDY): Evaluate the impact of dose adjustment of protease&#xD;
           inhibitors based on pharmacogenetic profile and virtual inhibitory quotient (VIQ) on&#xD;
           clinical outcome (measured by HIV-RNA viral load and CD4+ cell count changes) and&#xD;
           toxicity (graded by the DAIDS classification) in pediatric patients with HIV infection.&#xD;
