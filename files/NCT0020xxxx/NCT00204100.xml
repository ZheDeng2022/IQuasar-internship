  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surface electrical stimulation has for many years been widely used to retrain paralysed&#xD;
      muscle and achieve the functions of standing and stepping. Recently a number of centres have&#xD;
      used electrical stimulation of the leg muscles to achieve cycling. During cycling the&#xD;
      quadriceps and hamstring muscles (thigh muscles) (and sometimes also the gluteal (buttocks)&#xD;
      muscles) are stimulated to obtain a cycling motion. Stimulation is applied using adhesive&#xD;
      electrodes placed on the surface of the skin. This form of exercise is known as FES-cycling&#xD;
      (FES = Functional Electrical Stimulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently carried out a pilot study which investigated the feasibility of lower-limb&#xD;
      cycling using electrical stimulation. Cycling is accomplished using a standard recumbent&#xD;
      tricycle, which is adapted for the purpose of FES cycling. Three people with a complete&#xD;
      spinal cord lesion at level T7-T10 took part in the pilot study. The subjects are now able to&#xD;
      cycle continuously and reliably on a tricycle mounted on a cycle trainer for periods of up to&#xD;
      1 hour. The subjects are also able to cycle outside for distances of up to 3 km.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the new study is threefold: (i) We wish to develop the equipment and methods&#xD;
      for recreational cycling to the stage of a pre-commercial design specification; (ii) The&#xD;
      subjects recruited for the project will carry out a progressive, high-intensity&#xD;
      cycle-training programme. In Glasgow, 5 paraplegic subjects shall complete the training&#xD;
      programme, which will be based at their homes. This will allow us to fully assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of recreational FES-cycling, by measuring the power which can be sustained during&#xD;
      long periods of cycling, and to measure the impact of the training regime on their quality of&#xD;
      life; (iii) We will determine whether the training regime leads to significant improvements&#xD;
      in cardiopulmonary fitness, and therefore lower risk of heart disease, and to reductions in&#xD;
      the likelihood of the development of pressure sores and fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that this type of exercise will lead to general improvements in the fitness of people&#xD;
      who might use the system in future.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) prevents normal leg exercise which leads to secondary complications,&#xD;
      including cardiopulmonary deconditioning, a high incidence of pressure sores, and bone&#xD;
      demineralisation. Wheelchair sports do not raise fitness to the level of sedentary&#xD;
      non-injured people but it has been shown that cycling via functional electrical stimulation,&#xD;
      &quot;FES-cycling&quot;, can. Previous studies have been clinic-based; this limits the exercise time&#xD;
      and is inappropriate for widespread use. We propose to show that home-based FES-tricycling&#xD;
      can be a recreation, and can also lead to significant health benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will train subjects at home more intensively than in previous studies, to see whether they&#xD;
      can cycle useful distances. The effects of this training will be systematically assessed in a&#xD;
      Health Study, which will: (i) regularly monitor cardiopulmonary fitness; (ii) make regular&#xD;
      tissue measurements related to pressure sore susceptibility, and (iii) measure the effect on&#xD;
      bone density. These health measurements will be made at the collaborating clinical centres,&#xD;
      i.e. for Glasgow, this will be at the Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Injuries Unit, Southern&#xD;
      General Hospital. We will also document the mobile recumbent tricycle system as a design&#xD;
      specification, in preparation for commercialisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be based around three centres, in London, Glasgow and Nottwil, and brings&#xD;
      together an interdisciplinary team of engineers, exercise scientists, therapists and&#xD;
      clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engineering Development. To develop the equipment and methods for recreational cycling to the&#xD;
      stage of a pre-commercial design specification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training for Recreation. To carry out a progressive, high-intensity FES cycle-training&#xD;
      programme. 15 paraplegic subjects (5 at each centre) shall complete the training programme,&#xD;
      which is based at their homes. To assess the feasibility of recreational FES-cycling, by&#xD;
      measuring the power which can be sustained during long periods of cycling, and to measure the&#xD;
      impact of the training regime on their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health and Fitness Study. To assess whether the training regime leads to significant&#xD;
      improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness, and therefore lower risk of heart disease, and to&#xD;
      reductions in the likelihood of the development of pressure sores and fractures.&#xD;
