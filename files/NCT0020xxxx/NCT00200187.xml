      You are being asked to join the study because you have early stage prostate cancer and will&#xD;
      have your prostate removed. The purpose of this study is to compare blood loss during surgery&#xD;
      among two types of anesthesia. One type is general anesthesia. It puts you in a deep enough&#xD;
      sleep that you will not feel anything. It also keeps your blood pressure low, which might&#xD;
      decrease bleeding. The second type is combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. For this type, a&#xD;
      small catheter is placed in your spinal canal through your back. Anesthesia given through the&#xD;
      catheter makes your body numb from the waist down, so the sleep you would be in is not so&#xD;
      deep. Your blood pressure would remain in your normal range. After surgery, the catheter&#xD;
      remains in place to treat your pain, but your body would not be numb. When you wake up after&#xD;
      general anesthesia, you would receive pain medicine through a vein in your arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both types are used at Memorial Hospital. They are accepted forms of anesthesia. We will be&#xD;
      looking at blood loss between these two types for patients having their prostate removed. We&#xD;
      also want to learn about the side effects of each anesthesia type, and assess pain that you&#xD;
      experience after surgery.&#xD;

      This is a prospective randomized trial comparing the efficacy of a low venous pressure&#xD;
      general anesthesia (LVPGA) technique vs. combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE) in&#xD;
      decreasing intraoperative blood loss in patients undergoing open radical retropubic&#xD;
      prostatectomy (RRP) for newly diagnosed clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate.&#xD;
      The study design involves the enrollment of 246 patients scheduled for RRP. To control for&#xD;
      surgeon technique in the varibility of intraoperative blood loss, the study will be limited&#xD;
      to the patient population of two surgeons who perform greater than 150 radical&#xD;
      prostatectomies per year. Patients will be stratified for each surgeon and will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive either a LVPGA or CSE. Preoperatively patients will be encouraged to donate&#xD;
      autologous blood as is the current practice at MSKCC. Perioperative measurement and&#xD;
      management of fluid administration, estimation of blood loss and urine output, and&#xD;
      transfusion criteria will be standardized for both anesthesia groups. Transfusion of blood&#xD;
      products will be at the discretion of the attending surgeon and anesthesiologist following&#xD;
      the guidelines described in the protocol. Autologous blood will not routinely be transfused&#xD;
      back if the hemoglobin is &gt;= 8.0 and the patient is not symptomatic. Patients randomized to&#xD;
      the CSE arm will also receive postoperative epidural analgesia, while patients randomized to&#xD;
      LVPGA will receive intravenous PCA analgesia as per our current standard of care. Pain relief&#xD;
      will be assessed by a standardized pain scale and recorded in the PACU and then twice daily&#xD;
      until discharge. All patients will receive routine preoperative evaluation, as well as&#xD;
      routine intraoperative and postoperative monitoring and care. All patients will be placed on&#xD;
      a routine postoperative pathway. The MSKCC Morbidity/Mortality DMT Documentation System will&#xD;
      be utilized to document postoperative complications as per our routine practice. The Surgical&#xD;
      Secondary Events (SSE) program is designed to provide risk adjusted postoperative morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality data for institutional comparisons and as a decision support project,&#xD;
      generating, reporting and analyzing events to promote change and improvement in patient&#xD;
      management. SSE are grouped in 6 grades depending on the severity of the complication and the&#xD;
      treatment requirements: Grade 0, no event observed beyond 30 days postop. Grade 1, use of&#xD;
      oral medications, bedside interventions to treat an event. Grade 2, use of I.V. medications,&#xD;
      TPN, enteral nutrition, or blood transfusion to treat an event. Grade 3, interventional&#xD;
      radiology, therapeutic endoscopy, intubation, angiography or operation required to treat an&#xD;
      event. Grade 4, residual and lasting disability requiring major rehabilitation or organ&#xD;
      resection. Grade 5, event resulting in death of patient.&#xD;
