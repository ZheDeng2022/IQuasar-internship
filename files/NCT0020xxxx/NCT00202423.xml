  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10-week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of Cannabis Based Medicine Extract (Sativex) on patterns of brain&#xD;
      activation associated with movement in 20 MS patients suffering from lower limb spasticity.&#xD;
      Spasticity is a common symptom in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), occurring all over the course of&#xD;
      the disease, particularly in the progressive phase.Physiologically, spasticity and&#xD;
      hyperreflexia habitually seen in patients with pyramidal syndrome is due to lesions of other&#xD;
      descending pathways, such as the cortico reticulospinal pathways, which participate in&#xD;
      voluntary movements.It is now known that an endocannabinoid system acts in humans by at least&#xD;
      two types of cannabinoids receptors, CB1 and CB2. There is evidence to support the view that&#xD;
      the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC), and&#xD;
      cannabinoids in general, can reduce muscle spasticity in people with MS. Aim of the study&#xD;
      will be to evaluate the effect of Sativex on: (i) patterns of brain activation associated&#xD;
      with movement (fMRI) in MS patients suffering from spasticity; (ii) changes in level of&#xD;
      spasticity (H-reflex); (iii) changes in intracortical excitability and on synaptic&#xD;
      intracortical network of the motor areas (double shock TMS).&#xD;

      Baseline assessment will be followed by randomisation and dose introduction. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to two counterbalanced groups starting either with Sativex or with placebo&#xD;
      as the first drug. They will be dispensed sufficient study medication for two weeks together&#xD;
      with a diary. During the two-week treatment period all the patients will have to be reached&#xD;
      the optimal, individualised dosage to subjectively relief spasticity.Patient will return&#xD;
      after three weeks and they will undergo the fMRI and neurophysiological evaluations.Then&#xD;
      patients will perform a two-week washout period and they will be requested to intake the&#xD;
      alternative medicine. After two weeks patients will perform a second fMRI/neurophysiological&#xD;
      study. Two weeks later, after a second washout period, a last visit will be performed to&#xD;
      conclude the study.&#xD;
