      We, the investigators at Baylor Breast Care Cancer, are doing this study to learn how well&#xD;
      Taxotere makes tumors become smaller. We are also doing this study to find out how well&#xD;
      Taxotere treats the type of breast cancer that some patients have. We are asking patients to&#xD;
      take part in this study because they have locally advanced breast cancer. Women with this&#xD;
      breast cancer will usually receive chemotherapy medicines to reduce or shrink the cancer&#xD;
      before surgery to take out the cancer. If patients choose to take part in this study, they&#xD;
      will receive Taxotere and the combination of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. These&#xD;
      medicines are part of the standard good medical care for this type of breast cancer. They are&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of this problem. To help us learn how the patients' cancer&#xD;
      responds to these medicines, we will take a small tissue sample (biopsy) of the patients'&#xD;
      breast cancer before beginning treatment, one day after the first dose of treatment, once&#xD;
      each week for the first three weeks of treatment, and when surgery is done as part of&#xD;
      treatment for their cancer. These samples will be collected also to look at the biology of&#xD;
      the patients' cancer. We will also use a new method called cDNA array technology, which lets&#xD;
      us look at thousands of genes (coding information inside the cancer cell) at once. By looking&#xD;
      at different genes in the breast cancer, we may learn important information about which&#xD;
      cancers will respond to a chemotherapy medicine. We hope to learn if there are different gene&#xD;
      patterns in patients whose tumors shrink or do not shrink with this chemotherapy medicine.&#xD;
      This information may help us, in the future, to choose the right medicines for women with&#xD;
      breast cancer so that they have the highest chance of their cancer shrinking with&#xD;
      chemotherapy medicine. We cannot and do not know if patients will benefit if they take part&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      New treatment strategies are needed to improve the clinical outcome in breast cancer patients&#xD;
      at high risk of tumor recurrence. Even with the best present combination chemotherapy,&#xD;
      radiotherapy and surgery, the five-year rate of disease recurrence and death is at least 60%&#xD;
      in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Recent advances that may improve clinical&#xD;
      outcome include the use of taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel), a new class of cytotoxic&#xD;
      agents, with reported higher response rates than standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Understanding the in vivo mechanism of action of chemotherapeutic agents would also allow for&#xD;
      rational combination of agents. For example, if apoptosis is the main mechanism of&#xD;
      therapeutic action, then future developments in restoring function of p53 by gene therapy or&#xD;
      treatment with apoptosis regulating molecules may prove to be important future advances in&#xD;
      the treatment of cancer. If specific therapeutic targets and pathways are identified, new&#xD;
      molecules with selective action against these targets may be developed, which may have&#xD;
      potential for decreased toxicity with increased efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, we undertook a Phase II clinical trial of neoadjuvant docetaxel (Taxotere) in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced breast cancer (H-8448), with the primary goal of defining the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and the biologic effects of docetaxel. The secondary aim of the study was&#xD;
      to identify distinctive gene expression patterns predictive of response to docetaxel&#xD;
      chemotherapy. For this, we proposed to use microarray expression technology (Affymetrix U95A)&#xD;
      and allied validation technologies (e.g., IHC, western blot, quantitative RT-PCR) to identify&#xD;
      and validate patterns of gene expression associated with chemotherapy sensitivity or&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this Phase II extension study is to determine the biologic effects of&#xD;
      docetaxel (Taxotere), to identify gene expression profiles predictive of response, and to&#xD;
      further describe the efficacy of Taxotere in women with locally advanced breast cancer. In&#xD;
      addition to surgical operability and clinical response, the endpoints will include the&#xD;
      comparison of histologic and molecular markers from sequential core biopsies of primary&#xD;
      breast cancers of patients receiving Taxotere. Expression arrays will be used to identify and&#xD;
      validate patterns of gene expression associated with Taxotere sensitivity or resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical study: A diagnostic core biopsy will be performed prestudy, and tissue obtained from&#xD;
      this will be available for analysis. Other required baseline investigations, including CBC,&#xD;
      kidney function tests, liver function tests, EKG, and pregnancy tests, are part of the&#xD;
      standard of care. Docetaxel (Taxotere) 100 mg/m2 is to be administered on day 1. A core&#xD;
      biopsy is to be performed one day after chemotherapy (day 2) and on days 8, 15 and 22. On day&#xD;
      22, after repeat core biopsy, a second cycle of docetaxel (Taxotere) chemotherapy (100 mg/m2)&#xD;
      will be given. Docetaxel (Taxotere) will be given three-weekly for a total of four cycles.&#xD;
      Primary surgery will then be conducted, if operable, following completion of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment. Adjuvant AC (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, every three&#xD;
      weeks) for four cycles will then be administered. Adjuvant radiotherapy will be considered&#xD;
      following completion of AC chemotherapy. Patients whose tumors were ER and/or PgR positive&#xD;
      would be commenced on tamoxifen for five years after completion of AC chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core biopsies: Core biopsies for biologic marker evaluation will be performed prestudy&#xD;
      (excess from diagnostic biopsy), and on days 2, 8, 15, and 22 following entry into study.&#xD;
      Tissue for analysis will also be obtained at surgery. Prestudy biopsy and specimen at surgery&#xD;
      will be part of standard of care, while four additional biopsies will be performed solely for&#xD;
      research purposes only. Thus, a total of six biopsies will be obtained: prestudy, day 2, day&#xD;
      8, day 15, day 22, and at surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biologic markers to be assessed: Docetaxel (Taxotere) may produce a therapeutic response by&#xD;
      induction of programmed cell death or by inhibition of cell division. Hence, apoptosis by&#xD;
      TUNEL assay and other regulatory molecules (p53, bcl-2 and bax) will be measured.&#xD;
      Proliferation will be assessed by measuring Ki67. From animal models, antiangiogenic effects&#xD;
      with docetaxel (Taxotere) have been described, and this would be assessed in these clinical&#xD;
      samples by measuring VEGF and microvessel counting (CD31). Remaining frozen tissue will be&#xD;
      snap frozen and stored temporarily in liquid nitrogen for microarray analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects with chemotherapy are part of standard of care. The chemotherapy treatments used&#xD;
      in this protocol have all been widely used in breast cancer patients and represent some of&#xD;
      the most effective treatments for this condition. Some known effects for all chemotherapy&#xD;
      include neutropenia, infections, anemia, cardiotoxicity, congestive heart failure, alopecia,&#xD;
      nail discoloration, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and loss of appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects from core biopsies: Risks associated with breast biopsy include bleeding,&#xD;
      bruising, mild discomfort, and infection. Discomfort and minor complications from the four&#xD;
      additional biopsy procedures will be minimized by use of experienced personnel.&#xD;
