      This 3-year collaborative project will develop, implement, and test a comprehensive approach&#xD;
      to the prevention of falls among high-risk older adults in Dane County, Wisconsin through two&#xD;
      complementary strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a targeted strategy of an individualized multifactorial intervention for&#xD;
           community-living high-risk older adults. Older adults are defined as aged 65 and older.&#xD;
           High risk is defined as two or more falls in the year prior, one fall with injury, or&#xD;
           one fall with gait and balance problems, as per recent guidelines from the American&#xD;
           Geriatric Society (AGS). The multifactorial intervention consists of an in-home&#xD;
           assessment followed by recommendations to the participant and his/her physician, a&#xD;
           prescription for physical therapy, other referrals (optometry, podiatry, occupational&#xD;
           therapy, etc.) based on the assessment, monthly phone follow-up for 11 months, and a&#xD;
           prescription for long-term exercise after physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a program to educate primary care physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners,&#xD;
           and physical therapists in Dane County in the current diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
           recommendations for fall prevention.&#xD;

      The purposes of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test, in a randomized, controlled, single-blind study design, whether a&#xD;
           multifactorial intervention for high-risk older adults will decrease the rate of falls&#xD;
           compared to a control group receiving a home safety and nutrition booklet by mail;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To enhance existing health professional knowledge base to support fall prevention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test, in a quasi-experimental study design, the ability of a community-wide health&#xD;
           professional educational program to decrease the rate of fall-related hospitalizations&#xD;
           among older adults (both high and low-risk) in Dane County compared to control counties&#xD;
           in Wisconsin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of falls will be 40% lower over one year among high-risk older adults randomized to&#xD;
      the individualized multifactorial intervention (combined with health professional education),&#xD;
      compared to those randomized to home safety and nutrition booklets (combined with health&#xD;
      professional education) in Dane County.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A health professional education program about fall prevention will decrease the rate of&#xD;
      fall-related hospitalizations among older adults (both high and low-risk) in the intervention&#xD;
      county by 10%, compared to an anticipated no change from baseline in control counties.&#xD;
