  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of risperidone and ECT improves&#xD;
      a patient's response in depression compared to ECT alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Medication resistance to antidepressant therapy, or Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD), is&#xD;
      the main reason, if not main indication, for which patients are presently referred for&#xD;
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in hopes of a rapid, definitive response (APA 2001 ECT Task&#xD;
      Force Report). While the causes of TRD remain unclear, this category of patients includes&#xD;
      those who have incomplete remission, those who relapse rapidly and frequently, those who have&#xD;
      psychotic depression, those who develop chronic depression, and those who often have comorbid&#xD;
      medical and psychiatric illness (Sackeim 2001, Sharma 2001, Fava and Davidson 1996, Thase&#xD;
      1995). Moreover, while increased age per se is not a barrier to antidepressant response, many&#xD;
      elderly, especially those with comorbid medical or neurological illness, are unable to&#xD;
      tolerate courses of aggressive pharmacotherapy or seem to have a less robust response to&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy, and possibly to ECT alone, with significant residual functional and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (Reynolds 1998, Stoudemire 1998, Lebowitz 1997, Gurland 1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to patients who are not medication resistant, who generally retain the highest&#xD;
      likelihood of response to ECT alone, patients with TRD have a lower response rate to ECT with&#xD;
      average estimates of response to ECT alone between 50-60% (APA 2001 ECT Task Force).&#xD;
      Additionally, while ECT for most patients may provide acute remission, those patients with&#xD;
      TRD remain at high risk for rapid relapse (Sackeim 2001, Petrides 2001, Sackeim 1990, Aronson&#xD;
      1987). Consequently, ECT alone may be insufficient to achieve remission or to prevent&#xD;
      relapse. Interestingly, resistance to some types of medication was found also to predict&#xD;
      resistance to ECT alone, i.e., resistance to tricyclic antidepressants correlated with a less&#xD;
      likely response to ECT, though the same prediction did not hold for serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors (Prudic 1996, Prudic 1990).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, for some patients with TRD, studies support the use of combined medication&#xD;
      approaches, and specifically, have demonstrated the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of&#xD;
      an antidepressant with an antipsychotic medication, though usually for patients with comorbid&#xD;
      psychosis (Wheeler 2000, Shelton 1999, Barak 1999). Case reports exist in the ECT literature&#xD;
      about the safety and tolerability of ECT and antipsychotics, and improved efficacy, albeit&#xD;
      generally for patients with psychotic depression or other treatment resistant psychoses&#xD;
      (Kupchik 2000, Bhatia 1998, Ranjan 1996, Farah, Beale, and Kellner 1995, Minter 1979).&#xD;
      However, no studies systematically, or prospectively, investigate whether the specific&#xD;
      combination of ECT plus an atypical antipsychotic offers a true treatment alternative to&#xD;
      improved efficacy of ECT for patients with TRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study reviews the experience and outcome of combining ECT and an atypical antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication, risperidone, for TRD in various populations in an academic, university-based&#xD;
      setting, and furthermore, explores in a pilot randomized open-label study whether ECT plus&#xD;
      risperidone bears closer scrutiny in more rigorous study designs as a novel treatment&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
