    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a tool that can more accurately assess the intensity&#xD;
      and kind of physical activity that a person performs. The experimental tool, which will use a&#xD;
      mobile computing device as a way of automatically identifying when a certain activity is&#xD;
      being performed and at what intensity, will be tested against a self reported paper diary of&#xD;
      activities performed on a day to day basis. It is hoped that this study will increase&#xD;
      understanding of the health benefits of certain types of physical activity performed in the&#xD;
      home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Engaging in regular physical activity that requires a moderate to vigorous effort is related&#xD;
      to good health and a reduced risk of a multitude of diseases. Currently physical activity and&#xD;
      health promotion research is limited by self- report data that is confounded by participants'&#xD;
      ability to accurately remember and record their physical activity. A potentially new method&#xD;
      of accurately assessing moderate-intensity physical activity is called context sensitive-&#xD;
      ecological momentary assessment (CS-EMA). Mobile computing devices (personal computing&#xD;
      devices, PDAs) that automatically identify when a specific type of physical activity (e.g.,&#xD;
      moderate-intensity physical activity) is being performed has the potential to provide&#xD;
      valuable objective data for naturalistic, experimental, and clinical intervention research&#xD;
      purposes, and has the potential for educational, recreational, and clinical applications. The&#xD;
      goal of this exploratory study is to assess the accuracy of two methods of collecting data on&#xD;
      moderate-intensity physical activity. The study will compare the use of a paper diary to&#xD;
      collect self-reported data on moderate-intensity physical activities performed throughout the&#xD;
      day to self-reported data collected using ecological momentary assessment methods which are&#xD;
      facilitated by a PDA that cues the participant to record when specific intensity levels of&#xD;
      physical activity are achieved. This study will also develop algorithms that will&#xD;
      automatically identify specific types of physical activities being performed. The data&#xD;
      collected from the heart rate monitor, motion sensor, and information requested directly from&#xD;
      the participant via the PDA interface will be used to train pattern recognition systems to&#xD;
      classify the intensity and type of physical activity being performed by the participant. This&#xD;
      study will contribute to research on context- awareness and human activity recognition.&#xD;
