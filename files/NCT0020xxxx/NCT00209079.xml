      The purpose of this trial is to test the combination of Gleevec® (also known as imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate) and Taxotere (also known as docetaxel) in patients with incurable stomach cancer.&#xD;
      This study is being performed to see if the combination of Gleevec and Taxotere is an&#xD;

      The purpose of this trial is to test the combination of Gleevec® (also known as imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate) and Taxotere (also known as docetaxel) in patients with incurable stomach cancer.&#xD;
      Gleevec is a pill form of chemotherapy and is indicated for the treatment of adult patients&#xD;
      with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). It is&#xD;
      considered experimental for the treatment of stomach cancer. Taxotere (docetaxel) is a&#xD;
      chemotherapy which is injected into the vein. It is approved for breast and lung cancer but&#xD;
      has been shown to shrink many different types of tumors. Taxotere has been shown to shrink&#xD;
      stomach cancer in about 20% - 30% of patients treated with Taxotere only. This study is being&#xD;
      performed to see if the combination of Gleevec and Taxotere is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      incurable stomach cancer with minimal side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment on this study consists of two drugs, Gleevec® and Taxotere. Patients will be take&#xD;
      four tablets of Gleevec® daily throughout the study. After one week of Gleevec®, patients&#xD;
      will then begin receiving doses of Taxotere intravenously once a week for two weeks in a row&#xD;
      followed by one week without Taxotere.&#xD;
