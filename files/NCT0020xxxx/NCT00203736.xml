  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus&#xD;
      artesunate with that of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine on its own for the treatment of&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to anti-malarial drugs is a serious impediment to malaria&#xD;
      control. In the South East African Combination Anti-malarial Therapy (SEACAT) evaluation,&#xD;
      there is an evaluation of the phased introduction of combination anti-malarial therapy (CAT)&#xD;
      in Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa. In order to facilitate formulation of effective&#xD;
      regional drug policy and provide a database for decision-making on the implementation of CAT,&#xD;
      it is essential that the in vivo response to CAT be investigated. This will be achieved&#xD;
      through the SEACAT 01 protocol which is a component of the SEACAT evaluation described in&#xD;
      another file on this website. However, in selected Mozambique sites where the intensity of&#xD;
      malaria transmission is high, a direct parallel group comparison of monotherapy (SP) with CAT&#xD;
      (artesunate, AS, plus SP) will be conducted according to a specific amendment (Amendment 4)&#xD;
      to the SEACAT 01 protocol. Amendment 4 is presented in this separate file on the website for&#xD;
      clarity.&#xD;
