      We are asking you to take part in a research study of biomarkers (characteristics or traits&#xD;
      of the genes inside cancer cells). We want to learn if these biomarkers could help us learn&#xD;
      how well your breast cancer may respond (improve) to chemotherapy (drugs to treat cancer).&#xD;

      Breast cancer and systemic chemotherapy: Systemic chemotherapy for operable breast cancer&#xD;
      significantly decreases the risk of relapse and death. However, it is not possible to&#xD;
      identify those patients at the outset who are likely to respond to adjuvant treatment and&#xD;
      which type of treatment should be used. Adjuvant treatment given before surgery (neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy) has a number of advantages in breast cancer, including a reduction in the&#xD;
      requirement for mastectomy. Access to the primary tumor during early treatment allows for in&#xD;
      vivo testing for predictive markers obtained by core biopsies that occur with successful&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictive markers in breast cancer: Prognostic factors like tumor size and nodal involvement&#xD;
      are important indicators for breast cancer survival but have not been shown to be predictive&#xD;
      of sensitivity to chemotherapy. With endocrine therapy, the prime example of a predictive&#xD;
      marker is estrogen receptor (ER) expression, which predicts for response to tamoxifen and&#xD;
      other endocrine treatments. However, predictive markers for chemotherapy are not established.&#xD;
      Overexpression of c-erbB-2 might be associated with decreased response to CMF and increased&#xD;
      response to anthracycline-based treatment, but these observations are still contentious.&#xD;
      Expression of topoisomerase II may also reflect responsiveness to anthracycline chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Recently, some emerging data also suggest that c-erbB2 may be a marker of taxane sensitivity.&#xD;
      As such, we lack predictive biomarkers that could give early information on how effective&#xD;
      chemotherapy is and whether additional treatment might be beneficial. A test for chemotherapy&#xD;
      sensitivity, equivalent to ER in predicting response to endocrine therapy, would greatly&#xD;
      facilitate treatment decisions so that in an ideal scenario, the treatment of each individual&#xD;
      patient could be based on specific features of her disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Preoperative chemotherapy for large tumors (&gt;3cm) or inoperable&#xD;
      breast cancer is well established and is the standard of care for locally advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer. Data from large series of patients have demonstrated that preoperative (neoadjuvant)&#xD;
      chemotherapy leads to significant reduction of tumor size (downstaging) and improves both the&#xD;
      rate and the cosmetic results of breast-conserving surgery. A recent large randomized trial&#xD;
      involving 1,523 patients compared preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy (NSABP B-18).&#xD;
      Although results of this study have shown no difference in disease-free survival and survival&#xD;
      in women on preoperative or postoperative doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy,&#xD;
      significant downstaging of tumors was achieved so that more patients who received&#xD;
      preoperative therapy were able to undergo breast-conserving surgery. The rate of breast&#xD;
      conservation in NSABP B-18 was 85% in patients with tumors greater than 3 cm, with less than&#xD;
      5% of patients reported to have progressive disease while receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      cDNA arrays: High-Throughput Quantitative Profiling of Gene Expression: With the advent of&#xD;
      high-throughput quantitation of gene expression and cDNA technology, it is now possible to&#xD;
      study expression of many genes simultaneously to characterize expression patterns in&#xD;
      different breast cancers that may distinguish molecular phenotypes associated with clinical&#xD;
      response to a treatment. In a recent report, a molecular classification of leukemia was&#xD;
      demonstrated. Bone marrow aspirates taken from 38 patients with acute leukemia were evaluated&#xD;
      for expression of 6,817 human genes. The 50 best discriminating genes were used to create a&#xD;
      predictive index that was then applied to new samples and was found to accurately assign them&#xD;
      as AML or ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data for differential patterns of gene expression in responders vs non-responders&#xD;
      of Taxotere chemotherapy: We conducted a pilot study to investigate gene expression patterns&#xD;
      on core biopsies of human breast cancers in responders and non-responders to Taxotere&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA was isolated from core biopsies of primary breast cancers taken from women before&#xD;
      initiation of Taxotere chemotherapy. Clinical response was assessed after 12 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. We compared patterns of gene expression statistically in order to identify genes&#xD;
      differentially expressed between responders and non-responders to this single&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, these genes efficiently cluster tumors into 3 groups: CR, PR, and NR. We have&#xD;
      selected 2337 genes from these data for further analysis. As expected, the majority of these&#xD;
      genes show heterogeneous expression patterns independent of treatment response, but six large&#xD;
      gene clusters (approximately 180 genes) appear to predict likelihood of response to Taxotere&#xD;
      therapy. Consistent with an apoptosis-induction mode of action for taxanes, responsive tumors&#xD;
      appear to have higher expression of stress-related proteins, such as mitochondrial proteins&#xD;
      involved in apoptosis (cytochromes, proteasome subunits), and higher levels of&#xD;
      motility-related microfilament proteins (actin, myosin, and tropomyosin). Non-responders&#xD;
      patterns are more complex but show elevated levels of some microtubule proteins presumed to&#xD;
      be targets of Taxotere therapy (tubulins, tubulin-interacting proteins) and elevated levels&#xD;
      of inflammatory-response genes. Surprisingly, non-responders also showed elevated&#xD;
      proliferation (KI67) and oncogene (ABL1, MYC and JUNB) expression levels. This molecular&#xD;
      portrait of Taxotere resistance differs from the expected profiles of general&#xD;
      chemoresistance. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry studies to confirm these&#xD;
      differential gene patterns of expression are in progress for all 40 patients.&#xD;

    <description>Docetaxel (Taxotere) 100 mg/m2 is to be administered on day 1. A core biopsy is to be performed one day after chemotherapy (day 2) and on days 8, 15 and 22. On day 22, after repeat core biopsy, a second cycle of docetaxel (Taxotere) chemotherapy (100 mg/m2) will be given. Docetaxel (Taxotere) will be given three-weekly for a total of four cycles. Primary surgery will then be conducted, if operable, following completion of neoadjuvant treatment. Adjuvant AC (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, every three weeks) for four cycles will then be administered. Adjuvant radiotherapy will be considered following completion of AC chemotherapy. Patients whose tumors were ER and/or PgR positive would be commenced on tamoxifen for five years after completion of AC chemotherapy.</description>
