      It is hypothesized that the use of aripiprazole (Abilify) in patients with alcohol and/or&#xD;
      drug dependence with comorbid psychiatric conditions will lead to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in the amount of alcohol and/or drugs used as measured by the Time Line Follow&#xD;
           Back (TLFB) and the Addiction Severity Index (ASI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in cravings for alcohol and drugs as measured by the Penn Alcohol Craving&#xD;
           Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in symptoms of co-morbid psychiatric disorders compared to before starting&#xD;
           aripiprazole.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substance abuse disorders are a major public health problem. With a current prevalence rate&#xD;
      of 18%, substance abuse and dependence costs the nation over $300 billion per year in&#xD;
      treatment costs and lost productivity. Approximately 20% of all patients attending primary&#xD;
      care clinics and 35% of all patients attending psychiatric clinics meet Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual IV (DSM IV) criteria for substance abuse or dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of substance abuse and dependence disorders is complex and involves individual&#xD;
      and group therapy, maintenance of sobriety, commitment to structured living, and&#xD;
      participation in self-help groups. To date, pharmacotherapy for substance dependence&#xD;
      disorders has had limited success. Several medications have been tested in the past,&#xD;
      including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, buspirone,&#xD;
      bupropion, venlafaxine, nefazodone, bromocriptine, amantadine, naltrexone, and acamprosate.&#xD;
      Of these, naltrexone has obtained an FDA indication for treatment of alcohol dependence, and&#xD;
      acamprosate is in use in Europe. However, these medications are effective in only a&#xD;
      relatively small proportion of patients. Benzodiazepines may be useful in treatment of&#xD;
      withdrawal syndromes, but their potential for abuse and dependence limits their use in&#xD;
      maintenance treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label pilot study of aripiprazole therapy in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      substance use disorders and co-morbid disorders like Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective disorder,&#xD;
      Bipolar disorder, Major depressive disorder, Anxiety (Panic disorder, Generalized Anxiety&#xD;
      Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). While Aripiprazole has been approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of Schizophrenia, its use in other psychiatric disorders is off label use.&#xD;
      Increasing evidence suggests that Aripiprazole might offer some benefit for other psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders besides Schizophrenia.&#xD;
