  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthmatics have inflammation in the large airways (tubes through which air travels in and out&#xD;
      of the lungs). The large airways are located in the central lung. New research shows that&#xD;
      asthmatics also have inflammation in the small airways. The small airways are located in the&#xD;
      peripheral lung (the parts of the lung away from the central lung).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, most of the inhaled medications available have been made up of big particles that&#xD;
      never reach the peripheral lung. The purpose of this study is to try to measure the level of&#xD;
      inflammation in the peripheral lung in asthmatics and see if this inflammation can be&#xD;
      decreased with different types of inhaled corticosteroids. The investigators will check&#xD;
      airway inflammation before and after use of an inhaled corticosteroid that has a large&#xD;
      particle size and should only reach the large airways (Flunisolide-CFC), and before and after&#xD;
      use of an inhaled, small particle corticosteroid that should reach both the large and small&#xD;
      airways (Flunisolide-HFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will make 6 study visits over two phases of the study. In the first phase, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect baseline information about subjects while they are using placebo&#xD;
      (inactive substance). In the second phase, subjects will take either the large or small&#xD;
      particle corticosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits will involve questionnaires and various tests measuring lung function (such as&#xD;
      spirometry, forced oscillation, and methacholine challenge). Exhaled nitric oxide will be&#xD;
      measured as an indication of inflammation. Subjects will also measure and make note of lung&#xD;
      function at home twice daily using a peak expiratory flow meter. Two of the visits will&#xD;
      involve fiberoptic bronchoscopy so that the investigators may collect cells and tissue&#xD;
      samples without surgery. Another two of the visits will involve the use of high resolution&#xD;
      computed tomography (HRCT) scans to indirectly evaluate disease in distant parts of the&#xD;
      lungs.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18 to 50 years. Younger subjects are excluded due to greater concerns with&#xD;
             respect to risks from radiation and bronchoscopy in children; older subjects due to&#xD;
             greater risks of bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mild to moderate persistent asthma (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 70% predicted {Hankinson, 1999 #266}; PC20 less than or equal&#xD;
             to 8 mg/ml) and currently using only short acting inhaled beta agonists as needed for&#xD;
             control of asthma symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use of the following medications will exclude subjects from entering the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oral or parenteral steroids within 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inhaled corticosteroids within 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antileukotrienes, b-adrenergic blocking agents, inhaled cromolyn sodium or&#xD;
                  nedocromil, macrolide antibiotics, or investigational drugs within 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Drugs or exposures which, in the opinion of the investigators, could influence&#xD;
                  study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tobacco within 1 year or less than or equal to 5 pack years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women, lactating women, or women of childbearing age not willing to take&#xD;
             precautions to avoid becoming pregnant during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with upper respiratory infection or receiving an influenza vaccine within 6&#xD;
             weeks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of allergy or adverse reaction to inhaled beta agonists or&#xD;
             methacholine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with clinically significant evidence of cardiovascular, central nervous&#xD;
             system, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematopoietic, hepatic, psychiatric, or&#xD;
             respiratory (other than asthma) disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility will be determined by an investigator using the above inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
        criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No subjects will be excluded based on race or gender. Subjects must be between 18 and 50 in&#xD;
        order to avoid greater risks of bronchoscopy and, in those under 18, exposure to radiation.&#xD;
        To avoid risks, women will not be enrolled if pregnant, lactating or of childbearing&#xD;
        potential and unwilling to undertake appropriate precautions.&#xD;
