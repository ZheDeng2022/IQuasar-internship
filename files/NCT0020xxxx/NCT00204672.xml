      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastroesophageal reflux is a major contributor to exercise-triggered asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of patients will be studied: those with asthma who have difficulty with exertion,&#xD;
      those without asthma who experience difficulty with exertion. Both groups will experience&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux (GER) twice of less per week. Patients will complete a treadmill exam&#xD;
      to determine their VO2 max. They will then undergo pH monitoring while exercising for 30&#xD;
      minutes at 65-70% of their VO2 max. Subjects will be given placebo or acid suppression pill&#xD;
      for 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, the subjects will repeat the exercise (30 minutes) and&#xD;
      24-hour pH study.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether patients with exercise-triggered asthma experience GER during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the exercise-induced GER within the subjects relates temporally to their&#xD;
      exertional asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of potent acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor in&#xD;
      suppressing exercise-triggered GER and asthma in these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population to be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise-triggered asthmatics - defined as asthmatics with exertion as their primary&#xD;
      exacerbating factor and experiencing less than two episodes of classic gastroesophageal&#xD;
      reflux a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will be randomized into three different treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Placebo BID&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 20 mg Aciphex QD and placebo QPM&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 20 mg Aciphex BID&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 patients will be studied in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA&#xD;
&#xD;
      pH data - Data will be collected on the frequency and duration of the reflux episodes (number&#xD;
      of episodes and the percent time the esophageal pH is less than 4.0). This will then be&#xD;
      correlated with the respiratory symptom and changes in spirometry. A symptom index will be&#xD;
      designed to associate the episodes of reflux and bronchospasm that occur within 5 minutes of&#xD;
      a drop in esophageal pH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Tolerance/Symptoms - comparisons will be made between the three groups regarding&#xD;
      symptomatology during exercise after randomization to either placebo or differing doses of&#xD;
      Aciphex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry testing - done after exercise test. Comparisons between baseline and following&#xD;
      treatment Symptoms scores - both the overall numerical grades of the patients quality of life&#xD;
      and the number of asthmatic episodes and rescue inhaler use will be compared to baseline&#xD;
      after the 12 week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The asthma database at the University covers approximately 500 patients. A database search&#xD;
      will be performed to identify patients suitable for recruitment. Additional recruitment, if&#xD;
      needed, will be pursued through radio advertising. Once the study is initiated, the baseline&#xD;
      time for therapy is 12 weeks for each patient. An estimate of the time necessary to complete&#xD;
      the study is 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise triggered asthma has not been well studied with respect to its relationship to GER.&#xD;
      This study will be considered a pilot study with 12 subjects per arm. Results from this study&#xD;
      may be used to power a follow up study.&#xD;
