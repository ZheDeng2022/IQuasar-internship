      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to explore the role of histoblood group antigens in&#xD;
      virus-induced asthma exacerbations. These antigens (ABH and Lewis) decorate O- and N-linked&#xD;
      glycans on mucin and epithelial glycoproteins, respectively. Glycan synthesis involves&#xD;
      glycosyltransferases, including fucosyltransferases (FUT) encoded by FUT genes. Glycan&#xD;
      degradation involves glycosidases, including fucosidase. &quot;Secretor status&quot; is defined by FUT2&#xD;
      activity in epithelial cells, which forms the H antigen and allows subsequent synthesis and&#xD;
      secretion of A, B, and Lewis B antigens. In preliminary studies it was found that: 1)&#xD;
      asthmatic patients with frequent exacerbations are more likely than non-exacerbated patients&#xD;
      to be secretors; 2) secretors report more frequently that a cold causes asthma; and 3) sputum&#xD;
      in stable asthma has abnormally high fucosidase activity. These findings suggest that airway&#xD;
      glycans are subjected to the following two competing homoeostatic influences: 1) the&#xD;
      diversity and activity of glycosyltransferases within cells that synthesize glycans; and 2)&#xD;
      the diversity and activity of glycosidases that turn over and remodel glycans in the airway&#xD;
      lumen. This study will test the hypothesis that secretor positive asthmatic patients are&#xD;
      susceptible to virus-induced asthma exacerbation and that abnormal glycosidase activity in&#xD;
      secretions modifies the glycan coat and promotes virus-induced exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secretor status will be studied in order to determine whether it is a risk factor for asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations precipitated by viruses. Preliminary studies suggest that secretor positive&#xD;
      asthmatics are prone to asthma exacerbations and that asthmatic patients have abnormal&#xD;
      glycosidase activity in their airway secretions. This study will explore these findings&#xD;
      further in the following two ways: 1) a case-control study will compare secretor status and&#xD;
      frequency of viral airway infection in 50 asthmatic patients hospitalized for management of&#xD;
      acute severe asthma to 50 asthmatic subjects in the outpatient setting without a history of&#xD;
      severe asthma exacerbation. Sputum samples or tracheal aspirates (from intubated patients)&#xD;
      will be collected from all patients. In these samples, DNA will be used as a microarray to&#xD;
      detect viruses; and 2) epithelial brushings and bronchial biopsies from a tissue bank will be&#xD;
      used to establish the relationship between secretor status (erythrocyte Lea and Leb&#xD;
      phenotyping) and airway epithelial cell activity of FUT genes (real time RT-PCR), and&#xD;
      expression of Lea, Leb, A, B, and H antigens (immunohistochemistry).&#xD;
