      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of divalproex extended release&#xD;
      (ER) compared to risperidone in the treatment of bipolar disorder with comorbid substance use&#xD;
      disorder&#xD;

      Patients will be screened up to seven days at which time the following assessments will be&#xD;
      completed: the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), general medical history,&#xD;
      psychiatric history, physical examination, physicians assessment, and laboratory tests.&#xD;
      Patients who are on mood stabilizers and oral neuroleptics prior to study enrollment and are&#xD;
      not responding fully to these medications will be tapered off of the medication for a washout&#xD;
      period of 48 hours. After the completion of screening, only patients who are determined to be&#xD;
      eligible for the study will be randomized to study medication (divalproex or risperidone) in&#xD;
      a 1:1 double-blind fashion. Scheduled study visits will occur every two weeks for a total of&#xD;
      12 weeks. Assessments for each visit, from the baseline visit to the week 12 visit are as&#xD;
      follows: the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF),&#xD;
      Alcohol and Drug Use Inventory, clinician alcohol and drug use scales, self report scales,&#xD;
      adverse events, vital signs and weight, concomitant medications, urine drug screen, and study&#xD;
      medication accountability. Designated research staff will complete assessments weekly.&#xD;
      Investigators will be blinded to laboratory tests completed at week 2, 4, and 12 visits.&#xD;
      Patients randomized to Depakote ER will begin 500mg BID on day of randomization and remain on&#xD;
      this dose for 5 days, then on day 6 increase to 20mg/kg to achieve valproic acid levels of&#xD;
      80-100 (blinded laboratory reporting). Patients randomized to risperidone, initially start&#xD;
      with 2mg QD with an increase to 4mg at day 5 and increase (as tolerated or required) up to&#xD;
      6mg/d.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed written informed consent for trial participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients, ages 19-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must meet DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I or bipolar II disorder (any phase of&#xD;
             illness) and concurrent substance use disorder (alcohol or illicit drug abuse or&#xD;
             dependence).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be using a reliable method of&#xD;
             contraception. Reliable methods of contraception include hormonal contraceptives (oral&#xD;
             contraceptive or long-term injectable or implantable hormonal contraceptive), barrier&#xD;
             methods (e.g., condom and diaphragm, condom and foam, condom and sponge), intrauterine&#xD;
             devices, and tubal ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have other serious unstable illnesses and must be otherwise&#xD;
             physically stable on the basis of a physical exam, medical history, and the results of&#xD;
             blood biochemistry, hematology tests, and a urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must complete at least a 48-hour wash screening/washout period for mood&#xD;
             stabilizers and oral neuroleptics.The wash screening/washout period may be completed&#xD;
             as an inpatient. If so patient may remain an inpatient as long as necessary. Should&#xD;
             the patient become discharged he or she must be able to continue in the study as an&#xD;
