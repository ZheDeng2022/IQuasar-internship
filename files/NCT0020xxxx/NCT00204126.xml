  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treadmill therapy has the potential to improve the physical fitness and voluntary function of&#xD;
      incomplete-lesion spinal cord injured (SCI) patients. However, if it is to be offered as a&#xD;
      rehabilitation strategy, evidence must be gathered to support its effectiveness. Present&#xD;
      methods used to determine the efficacy of treadmill training do not provide accurate means of&#xD;
      monitoring changes in physical fitness during the exercise, or to accurately measure the&#xD;
      changes in voluntary muscle function which may occur during a training intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are therefore currently recruiting subjects for a study investigating the feasibility of&#xD;
      new methods for monitoring improvements in physical fitness during walking on a treadmill. We&#xD;
      also aim to develop methods for monitoring changes in voluntary muscle strength. The bone&#xD;
      density of both legs will also be measured to determine if any improvement has occurred&#xD;
      following training.&#xD;

      Treadmill therapy has the potential to improve the cardiopulmonary fitness, voluntary&#xD;
      function, and lower limb bone density of incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) patients.&#xD;
      However, if it is to be offered clinically as a rehabilitation strategy then evidence must be&#xD;
      gathered to support its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of FES-assisted walking with incomplete SCI individuals, both overground and on&#xD;
      a treadmill, has previously been assessed by monitoring walking speed, stride length,&#xD;
      endurance, cadence, the physiological and oxygen cost, % body weight support (treadmill), and&#xD;
      by performing observational gait analysis and manual muscle testing (1,2,3,4,5,6). However,&#xD;
      these methods do not provide a means of measuring changes in fitness or for accurately&#xD;
      monitoring improvements in voluntary muscle function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present appropriate methods for testing a person's cardiopulmonary fitness on a treadmill&#xD;
      are lacking. Previously, incremental exercise tests have been carried out by maintaining a&#xD;
      constant inclination and increasing the speed linearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, if the speed is increased linearly it is likely that it will increase at too fast a&#xD;
      pace. Therefore the test will become a measure of the subject's ability to move their legs&#xD;
      quickly and/or efficiently enough, rather than metabolic factors. If a steep gradient is&#xD;
      chosen as the constant inclination then a high initial metabolic cost will result, which will&#xD;
      limit the test time. Another common method used is to maintain a constant speed while&#xD;
      increasing the sine of the angle of inclination. The problem with this method of testing is&#xD;
      that if too low a speed is selected then a very steep gradient results before the level of&#xD;
      tolerance is reached, and if too high a speed is selected there is a high initial metabolic&#xD;
      cost. These problems were addressed in a recent paper by Porszasz et al., 2003 (7). They&#xD;
      demonstrated that by increasing walking speed linearly and treadmill gradient curvilinearly,&#xD;
      a linear increase in work rate occurs with the subjects fatiguing at a moderate speed. If&#xD;
      this protocol could be adapted for use with incomplete SCI patients it would provide an&#xD;
      accurate means of testing changes in cardiopulmonary function which may result after&#xD;
      treadmill training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has recently been recorded that dynamometry (rather than manual muscle scores) should be&#xD;
      used to assess changes in voluntary function in incomplete SCI patients (8). Therefore we&#xD;
      will employ this approach in this study. Following a spinal injury there is a rapid decline&#xD;
      in bone mineral density which increases the risk of fracture following minor trauma.&#xD;
      Therefore we will also measure the bone density at the epiphyses and shaft of the tibia and&#xD;
      femur to determine if this form of training leads to changes in bone mineral density in this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By demonstrating that treadmill training can improve the cardiopulmonary fitness of&#xD;
      individuals with incomplete SCI, their voluntary strength, and bone mineral density, it will&#xD;
      help to provide the evidence that this form of rehabilitation is worthwhile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By increasing cardiopulmonary fitness it will reduce their risk of developing cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, a major problem in this population due to their sedentary lifestyle. If it can be&#xD;
      demonstrated to improve their voluntary function it would suggest that their quality of life&#xD;
      and ability to carry out activities of daily living may also improve. Improving their bone&#xD;
      density would consequently reduce their risk of fracture. Therefore the results of this study&#xD;
      will contribute to the quest of trying to improve the overall health and functional ability&#xD;
      of this patient population.&#xD;
