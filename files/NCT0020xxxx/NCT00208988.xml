  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer among men. It is also the second leading&#xD;
      cause of cancer-related death among men. Two screening tests are available to try to detect&#xD;
      prostate cancer early - the digital rectal examination (DRE) and the prostate specific&#xD;
      antigen (PSA) blood test. Unfortunately, physicians aren't sure whether or not these two&#xD;
      screening tests help save lives, and there's a lot of controversy about how to use them.&#xD;
      Recently, a major government committee (the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) recommended&#xD;
      that physicians discuss the risks and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening with&#xD;
      their patients, and allow patients to make their own decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the controversies, many physicians currently don't discuss prostate cancer with&#xD;
      their patients. The problem is that it takes time and effort to have these discussions, and&#xD;
      the information is complicated. A lot of patients have trouble understanding it, especially&#xD;
      if they have a limited educational background or trouble reading. When patients have&#xD;
      difficulty obtaining, understanding, and acting on basic health information, we say that they&#xD;
      have &quot;low health literacy.&quot; Other researchers have shown that patients with low health&#xD;
      literacy don't know as much about cancer screening and are less likely to get screened for&#xD;
      various cancers. They also tend to be timid about discussing things with their doctor, and&#xD;
      often go along with what the doctor says, rather than taking an active role in the decision&#xD;
      making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2003, under IRB approval, we conducted a study with 2 goals: 1) to encourage patients to&#xD;
      talk to their doctor about prostate cancer screening, and 2) to learn more about the impact&#xD;
      of low health literacy on these conversations. To promote conversation, we used two handouts,&#xD;
      given to patients in the waiting room before they saw the doctor. The first was a patient&#xD;
      education handout about prostate cancer screening, written in very simple terms with useful&#xD;
      illustrations. The second was a handout that simply encouraged patients to talk to their&#xD;
      doctor about prostate cancer. Patients got one of the two handouts, or a nutritional handout&#xD;
      that served as a control. After they saw their doctor, a research assistant briefly&#xD;
      interviewed the patient to find out whether or not prostate cancer screening was discussed.&#xD;
      We also measured the patients' health literacy skills, and asked a few other questions about&#xD;
      their decision to get screened for prostate cancer.&#xD;
