      Aim: In a population of first episode manic patients with psychotic features, we want to&#xD;
      compare the side effect profile, the degree of adherence and the subjective well being, as&#xD;
      well as the efficacy of two treatments: The standard treatment currently applied (lithium +&#xD;
      chlorpromazine) and an alternative treatment more recently introduced (lithium + olanzapine).&#xD;
      In addition, we want to study retrospectively the development of bipolar disorder and study&#xD;
      prospectively the 6 and 12-month outcome of a cohort of patients presenting a first manic&#xD;
      episode with psychotic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Background: While the efficacy of lithium in the treatment of acute mania has been&#xD;
      established by numerous studies, it is also known that up to 50% of the patients fail to&#xD;
      respond when it is prescribed alone. It is therefore common practice to complement the&#xD;
      treatment, most commonly with antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. It has been suggested that&#xD;
      antipsychotic agents are faster acting and are superior in controlling hyperactivity compared&#xD;
      to lithium, whereas mood stabilisation is better achieved by lithium, Typical antipsychotics,&#xD;
      such as chlorpromazine, may therefore be useful as adjunctive medication to mood stabilisers,&#xD;
      especially within the first few weeks of treatment of acute mania, and for patients&#xD;
      exhibiting psychotic symptoms or hyperactivity. They however can induce side effects&#xD;
      (somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, extrapyramidal side effects such as rigidity of the&#xD;
      muscles, and possibly tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements or contraction of muscles),&#xD;
      as well as akathysia (sense of restlessness). They finally have been suspected to contribute&#xD;
      to the occurrence of post-manic depression. Recent publications in chronic populations have&#xD;
      shown that atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, are also an effective adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment. Olanzapine has the important advantage to induce a very low incidence of&#xD;
      extrapyramidal side effects, including tardive dyskinesia. It can however induce somnolence,&#xD;
      dizziness, dry mouth, and rather commonly weight gain. Moreover, some authors have reported&#xD;
      that olanzapine might induce mania. Both treatments appear then to have positive effects as&#xD;
      well as undesirable side effects. Our project is to compare them. The literature concerning&#xD;
      first episode mania is sparse, particularly in the domain of pharmacotherapy. One&#xD;
      retrospective study showed that 77% of the patients received antipsychotics at discharge and&#xD;
      25% at 6 months follow-up. No comparison has however been made between typical and atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotics, and there are no specific treatment guidelines of first episode mania with&#xD;
      psychotic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Summary: The hypothesis is that olanzapine and chlorpromazine will have a comparable&#xD;
      efficacy as adjunctive treatment of the acute manic episode with psychotic features. We&#xD;
      however think olanzapine will induce less side effects and will be better accepted by the&#xD;
      patients, and therefore that the adherence to the treatment will be better than with&#xD;
      chlorpromazine. We finally think the subjective sense of well being will be greater with&#xD;
      olanzapine than with chlorpromazine.We will recruit 75 patients at the time of their first&#xD;
      admission for mania with psychotic features at EPPIC. After signature of the informed&#xD;
      consent, we will perform a baseline assessment first to confirm the diagnosis, and second to&#xD;
      evaluate the level of psychopathology. The patients will then be randomly selected to receive&#xD;
      either a treatment of lithium and olanzapine or a treatment of lithium and chlorpromazine. By&#xD;
      the end of the study there will be 37 patients in each group.The patients will go through a&#xD;
      baseline assessment including physical examination and usual laboratory investigation to&#xD;
      exclude any physical illness. They will also go through a one-hour assessment of&#xD;
      psychopathology. Between day 2 and 3 they will go through 2 hours of interview to reassess&#xD;
      diagnosis and personal history. They will thereafter be assessed weekly for eight weeks on&#xD;
      various dimensions: evolution of the intensity of the symptoms, appearance of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, occurrence of side effects and degree of adherence to the treatment, in an 1-hour&#xD;
      interview. Subjective well being and quality of life will re evaluated at week 4 and 8,&#xD;
      adding 45 minutes to the duration of the interview. This is a flexible dose, open trial,&#xD;
      which means the doctor in charge of the patient will know which medication is being&#xD;
      prescribed, and that he will be allowed to adapt the dosage according to what he feels&#xD;
      necessary. This research project will allow us to organise a more specialised clinic for the&#xD;
      care of first episode manic patients. We will take this opportunity to study carefully the&#xD;
      months preceding the appearance of the first episode in order to try to reconstruct the&#xD;
      prodrome of bipolar disorders. We will also, in an extension phase of the study, look at the&#xD;
      long term outcome (at 6 and 12 months) of a first episode of mania.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective single-centre open trial will compare two groups receiving two different&#xD;
      neuroleptics combined with lithium during the first 8 weeks of treatment of a first manic&#xD;
      episode. All the patients will also be included in a 6 and 12 months follow-up study and will&#xD;
      provide information regarding the prodrome of bipolar illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial comprises five phases: (1) Recruitment and screening; (2) Baseline assessment; (3)&#xD;
      8 weeks treatment phase; (4) Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment and screening The Youth Access Team (YAT) assesses all the patients referred&#xD;
           to the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) in order to confirm&#xD;
           the diagnosis of first psychotic episode. Patients with a clinical presentation&#xD;
           compatible with a diagnosis of first episode mania will be presented to the main&#xD;
           investigator or to one of the co-investigators for a screening interview. This interview&#xD;
           should take place as soon as possible, and not later than 24 hours after admission.&#xD;
           During these 24 hours, the patients will be kept under a treatment of benzodiazepine&#xD;
           exclusively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any patient meeting the inclusion criteria (including a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)&#xD;
           [37] total scores equal or superior to 20) and none of the exclusion criteria at the&#xD;
           screening interview will be informed (as well as his/her family) about the study, and&#xD;
           they will receive a Patient Information Sheet. A Consent form will be completed if they&#xD;
           agree to take part in the study. Patients under section 12 who are unable to give&#xD;
           informed consent: these patients will be asked for consent when they are better. The&#xD;
           authorised psychiatrist will be able to give consent to treatment on their behalf until&#xD;
           they are well. When they are well and are asked to give consent and they do not give&#xD;
           consent, all information gathered on this patient will be removed. If the patient&#xD;
           declines to consent to the study, she/he will be offered standard clinical care in&#xD;
           EPPIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline assessment Once informed consent will have been given, and provided the YMRS&#xD;
           score 24 hours after admission remains greater than 20, patients will be assessed by a&#xD;
           research assistant who will be blind to the treatment during the first 8 weeks of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ The diagnosis will be based on clinical assessment according to the DSM-IV [38]&#xD;
           criteria. It will be confirmed during the first week of the study by results of the&#xD;
           Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV, Patient Version (SCID-P) [38].&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ The severity of the illness will be evaluated at baseline with the YMRS, the BPRS, the&#xD;
           Clinical Global Impression bipolar version (CGI-BP) [39] and the Global Assessment of&#xD;
           Functioning (GAF) [38].&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ The depressive symptoms will be assessed with the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating&#xD;
           Scale (HAMD-21) [40].&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Substance abuse comorbidity will be assessed during the first week with the PACE&#xD;
                Substance Use Questionnaire (PSUQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Level of functioning will be assessed with the Quality if Life Scale (QLS) [41],&#xD;
                the Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS) [42] and the Modified Vocational Status Index&#xD;
                (MVSI) and the Modified Location Code Index (MLCI) [43] during the first week of&#xD;
                treatment. If necessary the participation of relatives will be asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, the subjects will undergo physical examination, including blood test, for&#xD;
           safety reasons. Demographic data, vital signs, and details on any concomitant medication&#xD;
           and medical history will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ Laboratory tests: Haematology: Haemoglobin, MCH, MCHC, MCV, RBC, WCC, platelets,&#xD;
           haematocrit. Biochemistry: Total bilirubin, total protein albumin, AST, ALT, alkaline&#xD;
           phosphatase, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, prolactin, cholesterol, triglycerides,&#xD;
           glucose, thyroid function tests (freeT4 and TSH), prolactine level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 8-week Treatment phase: The Australian Clinical Guidelines for Early Psychosis [44]&#xD;
           suggest that first episode patients should ideally be observed during 24 hours before&#xD;
           any medication is started. This rule will also be applied in the context of the study.&#xD;
           During this period, the medication will be restricted to benzodiazepines except in case&#xD;
           of severe agitation. In case of severe agitation neuroleptics will be prescribed, if&#xD;
           possible after informed consent and randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will thereafter be randomly assigned to one of two groups: olanzapine +&#xD;
           lithium, or chlorpromazine + lithium. The raters (research assistant and one&#xD;
           psychiatrist in charge of the rating of the side effects) will be blind to the&#xD;
           randomisation process and treatment conditions during the first 8 weeks of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each subject will also be allocated to a case manager and a psychiatrist who will be one&#xD;
           of the investigators. The psychiatrist in charge of the patient will not be blind to the&#xD;
           treatment, and therefore will not do the rating of side effects. A research assistant&#xD;
           will conduct all the psychometric assessments across the 12 months of the study and will&#xD;
           remain blind to the medication received during the first 8 weeks of the trial. During&#xD;
           this eight weeks period, patients will be seen according to clinical needs, and will be&#xD;
           met weekly up to week 4 and then on week 6 and 8 for assessment of current levels of&#xD;
           psychopathology, the collection of safety data and assessment of compliance. After the&#xD;
           first 8 weeks of treatment, the psychiatrist will be free to change the treatment.&#xD;
           Neurolpetics will be continued for a minimum of 6 months and lithium for a minimum of 12&#xD;
           months. Lithium serum level will be assessed at day 4 and 7, and then accordingly to the&#xD;
           stability of the blood level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up prospective evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this phase, the aim is to compare the level of side effects under each medication&#xD;
           regimen, the subjective well-being and the adherence to the treatment during the first 8&#xD;
           weeks on treatment. Other aims are to assess the efficacy of both treatments, the&#xD;
           incidence of depressive symptoms, and the 6 and 12 months outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ Side-effects will be assessed weekly with the UKU rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adherence to the medication will be assessed weekly with the Medication Adherence&#xD;
                Rating Scale (MARS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjective well-being will be assessed with the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) and&#xD;
                the Subjective Well-Being Under Neuroleptics Scale (SWN) at week 1,4 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The severity of the illness will be prospectively evaluated on a weekly basis until&#xD;
                week 4, and then at week 6 and 8, month 6 and month 12 with the YMRS, the BPRS and&#xD;
                the CGI-BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Depressive symptoms will be assessed at the same time lines with the HAMD-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Substance abuse comorbidity will be reassessed at week 8, month 6 and month 12 with&#xD;
                the PSUQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change inn the level of functioning will be assessed with the QLS, the PAS and the&#xD;
                MVSI and MLCI at month 6 and month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vital signs and weight change will be reassessed at weeks 4 and 8 and at months 6&#xD;
                and 12, or whenever necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Laboratory values will be reassessed at week 8, or whenever necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SUBJECTS TRIAL SAMPLE The aim is to recruit 75 first episode manic patients over a two&#xD;
           years period. EPPIC takes care of 60 to 80 first episode manic patients each year and we&#xD;
           plan on a recruitment rate of 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TREATMENT Trial drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lithium: Lithium will be started at 500mg per day on day one and will be increased to&#xD;
           500 mg bd from day 2. Serum lithium will be assessed on day 4, and the daily dose of&#xD;
           lithium will be adapted accordingly. Serum lithium will be assessed again on day 7 and&#xD;
           thereafter once or twice a week depending on the previous results. We will aim at&#xD;
           keeping the lithium level between 0.5 and 1.0 mEq/l, ideally between 0.8 and 1.0 mEq/l.&#xD;
           (Higher levels are not recommended when lithium is prescribed along with antipsychotics&#xD;
           [49] Chlorpromazine: Chlorpromazine will be started at 100 mg/day orally and adjusted&#xD;
           from day 2 by steps of 50 mg or 100 mg, upwards or downwards. Chlorpromazine will be&#xD;
           continued for a minimum of 6 months, and will be interrupted according to the clinical&#xD;
           state.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Olanzapine: Olanzapine will be started at 5mg/day and adjusted by steps of 2.5mg each&#xD;
           day according to the clinical picture, upwards or downwards. Olanzapine will be&#xD;
           continued for a minimum of 6 months, and will be interrupted according to the clinical&#xD;
           state.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CONCOMITANT MEDICATION All medications (prescribed or over-the-counter medications) that&#xD;
           are ongoing at the start of the trial or started during the trial, must be documented in&#xD;
           the file.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following medications are allowed, under specified circumstances:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diazepam: up to 50 mg/day to alleviate severe agitation. Benztropine: up to 4 mg/day,&#xD;
           for treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms. Paroxetin: will be prescribed in case of&#xD;
           the occurrence of a depressive episode that persists after optimisation of the lithium&#xD;
           treatment and interruption of antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ASSESSMENTS Safety ¨ The frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (events that&#xD;
           first appear or worsen during the study period) will be compared between both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ The frequency of side effects as rated with the UKU scale will be compared between&#xD;
           both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ Weight gain will be compared between both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ Frequency of changes in vital signs and laboratory findings will be compared between&#xD;
           both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjective well- being&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ Total scores on the DAI and the SWN will be compared between both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ASSESSMENT OF SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ Degree of adherence to the treatment as scored on the MARS will be compared between&#xD;
           both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ End point analysis: Mean change in various scales from baseline to week 4 and week 8&#xD;
           will be used to compare the efficacy of the two treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ Primary efficacy analysis will be assessed by comparing the mean change in theYMRS&#xD;
           total score.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ Secondary efficacy analysis will be assessed by comparing the mean change in CGI-BP&#xD;
           total score and in BPRS total score.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ¨ Response analysis: Response is defined as at least a 50% drop in the total YMRS total&#xD;
           score from base line to the 8-weeks end point. Euthymia is defined as a total score on&#xD;
           the YMRS of no greater than 12 at end point. The number of patients reaching both of&#xD;
           these levels of improvement in both groups will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Incidence of depressive episodes ¨ A worsening in the HAMD-21 score of at least 3 points&#xD;
           will be used as a definition of a clinically detectable worsening in depressive&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Six and 12 months outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
           Definition of recovery:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Syndromic recovery: Eight contiguous weeks [50] during which the patient no longer&#xD;
                meets criteria for a manic, mixed, or depressive syndrome. Recovery from each of&#xD;
                these syndromes is based on DSM-IV criteria and is operationalised as follows:&#xD;
                manic syndrome-no longer meeting the A or B criterion for a manic episode;&#xD;
                depressive syndrome-no longer meeting the A criterion for a major depressive&#xD;
                episode; mixed syndrome-no longer meeting the A or B criterion for a manic episode&#xD;
                and the A criterion for a major depressive episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Symptomatic recovery: Eight contiguous weeks [50] during which the patient&#xD;
                experiences minimal to no psychiatric symptoms, operationalized as follows: Young&#xD;
                Mania Rating Scale total score of 5 or less, Hamilton depression scale total score&#xD;
                of 10 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relapse: Relapse is defined as the return of symptoms after a remission of less&#xD;
                than 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recurrence: Recurrence is defined as return of symptoms after recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Functional recovery: Return to premorbid levels of function for at least 8&#xD;
                contiguous weeks [50]. To assess functional recovery, seven of the nine general&#xD;
                items from the Premorbid Adjustment Scale are evaluated at the 6 and 12-month&#xD;
                follow-up visit for the interval period (excluding ratings of education and&#xD;
                abruptness in the change in work associated with the index episode, since these&#xD;
                scores can not change). To meet criteria for functional recovery, subjects has to&#xD;
                receive Premorbid Adjustment Scale general item interval scores less than or equal&#xD;
                to the premorbid rating on five of the seven items and have no interval item score&#xD;
                more than 2 points higher than the corresponding premorbid score. Additionally,&#xD;
                functional recovery will be considered to be realised if patients return to at&#xD;
                least base level on both MLCI and MVSI.&#xD;
