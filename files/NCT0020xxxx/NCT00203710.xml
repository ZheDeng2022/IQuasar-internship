  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to study the safety and effectiveness of the Concentric Retriever&#xD;
      Device(CRD)in ischemic stroke patients who undergo clot retrieval with the CRD within 8 hours&#xD;
      of stroke symptom onset. The CRD has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      to retrieve foreign bodies (such as pieces of metal) from blood vessels in the body. The CRD&#xD;
      is a small metal wire with a loop at the end (like a corkscrew) that removes clots from&#xD;
      arteries and thereby restores blood flow to the brain. Prior versions of the CRD may have&#xD;
      been too soft to pull out clots, just as a corkscrew that is too soft would not pull out&#xD;
      corks. The current version of the CRD is not as soft and may be more effective in retrieving&#xD;
      clots. Hypothesis: By restoring blood flow to the brain, stroke symptoms may get better or&#xD;
      the stroke may be prevented from getting worse.&#xD;

      The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Concentric Retriever in the&#xD;
      treatment of thrombotic occlusions originating in the internal carotid, middle cerebral (M1&#xD;
      and M2 segments), basilar, posterior cerebral or vertebral arteries. A maximum of 50 patients&#xD;
      may be enrolled at a single site, University of California, Los Angeles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: Achievement of recanalization (TIMI/TICI grade II or III flow) immediately&#xD;
      post procedure without occurrence of major complications will be assessed. Major&#xD;
      complications are defined as vessel perforation, intramural arterial dissection, symptomatic&#xD;
      intra-cranial hemorrhage, and significant embolization in a previously uninvolved arterial&#xD;
      territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: Assessment of patient's neurological condition and functional state&#xD;
      using the NIHSS, Barthel Index, and Modified Rankin at 30 and 90 days post-procedure. A&#xD;
      composite of major adverse events at 30 and 90 days post-procedure will be reported. Major&#xD;
      adverse events are defined as death and new stroke.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1(a) -Patients who present within 8 hours of stroke onset and are not candidates for&#xD;
        treatment with t-PA who have clinical signs consistent with the diagnosis of ischemic&#xD;
        stroke such as impairment of language, motor function, sensation, cognition, and/or gaze,&#xD;
        or vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1(b). Patients who have had an acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolytic&#xD;
        therapy where vascular imaging (TCD, CTA, MRA, angiography) shows a persistent occlusion&#xD;
        after the end of the infusion treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients &gt; 18 years of age. 3. NIHSSS &gt; 7 4. Angiogram shows a thrombotic occlusion&#xD;
        originating in the internal carotid, middle cerebral (M1 or M2 segment), basilar, posterior&#xD;
        cerebral, or vertebral arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient/patient guardian is willing to comply with the protocol requirements and return&#xD;
        to the treatment center for all required clinical evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is pregnant (if within child bearing age).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has baseline glucose of &lt; 50mg/dL (&lt;50 mg/mM).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has excessive arterial tortuosity that precludes the device from reaching the&#xD;
             target area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has known hemorrhagic diathesis, coagulation factor deficiency, or oral&#xD;
             anticoagulant therapy with INR &gt; 2.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient received Heparin within 48 hours with a PTT greater than 2 times the lab&#xD;
             normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has baseline platelets &lt; 30,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has history of severe allergy to intra-arterial contrast medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has severe, sustained hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 185 mm Hg or&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mm Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: If the blood pressure can be successfully reduced and maintained at the&#xD;
             acceptable level using medication (i.e. Nipride), the patient can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. CT Scan or MRI reveals significant mass effect with midline shift.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient's angiogram shows an arterial stenosis (&gt;50%) proximal to the embolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient's anticipated life expectancy is less than 3 months.&#xD;
