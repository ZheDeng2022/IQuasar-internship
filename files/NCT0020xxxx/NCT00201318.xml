      * AIMS OF THE STUDY (STUDY OBJECTIVES)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the effect of daily lamivudine (100 mg) in reducing the risk of HBV reactivation&#xD;
           and hepatitis development in HBsAg (+) NHL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the efficacy of daily lamivudine in preventing and treating hepatitis B&#xD;
           reactivation and in circumventing hepatic failure and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test whether lamivudine can improve the overall outcome of NHL patients who are HBV&#xD;
           carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Study end-points: The major end-point: hepatitis B reactivation in NHL patients---defined by&#xD;
      higher than 10-fold increase of serum HBV DNA level and/or reappearance of HBeAg in the serum&#xD;
      during and within 6 months after chemotherapy. The minor end-point I : events of hepatic&#xD;
      failure and death---defined by jaundice with hepatic encephalopathy. The minor end-point II:&#xD;
      the response rate and survival rate in HBsAg-positive NHL patients receiving lamivudine&#xD;
      prophylaxis and treatment.)&#xD;

      -  TREATMENT PLANS&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Systemic chemotherapy with CHOP regimen Schedule and Dose for CHOP Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
                750 mg/m2 i.v. Day 1 Doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 i.v. Day 1 Vincristine 1.4 mg/m2/d i.v.&#xD;
                Day 1 Prednisolone 60 mg/m2/d p.o. Day 1-7 1.1 Courses will be repeated every 21&#xD;
                days. 1.2 For patients with CR, give at least 2 additional courses for a minimum of&#xD;
                6 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
                1.3 For patients with maximal response as PR or SD, change to second-line&#xD;
                chemotherapy. The regimens for second-line chemotherapy are at the discretion of&#xD;
                the investigators. Local radiotherapy is allowed for residual localized 1.4 For&#xD;
                patients with PD, change to second-line chemotherapy. The regimens of the latter&#xD;
                are at the discretion of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
                2.1 Arm I Patients take lamivudine 100 mg P.O. qd, starting from Day 1 of the first&#xD;
                course of CHOP, and until 2 months after the completion of chemotherapy. Lamivudine&#xD;
                is to be maintained no matter hepatitis occurred or not during chemotherapy. If&#xD;
                second-line chemotherapy is used, lamivudine with the same dose and schedule will&#xD;
                be continued until 2 months after completion of the second-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                If third-line chemotherapy is needed, the use of lamivudine will be at the 2.2 Arm&#xD;
                II Patients are treated with CHOP alone. If the patients develop clinical&#xD;
                hepatitis, as defined in section 7.2, lamivudine 100 mg, P.O., qd., will be given,&#xD;
                and continued until hepatitis is resolved. Prophylactic lamivudine is not to be&#xD;
                given in subsequent chemotherapy. (Our previous study has indicated that nearly all&#xD;
                clinical hepatitis developed in HBV carriers during systemic chemotherapy is caused&#xD;
                by HBV reactivation. Therefore, for practical reason, the investigators are not&#xD;
                advised to wait for the results of HBV DNA serology examination before starting&#xD;
                lamivudine treatment. )&#xD;
&#xD;
                3.0 DOSE MODIFICATION 3.1 Hematological Toxicity* Drug administration is postponed&#xD;
                if there is no full hematological recovery (AGC &gt; 2,000/mm3 and Platelet &gt;&#xD;
                100,000/mm3 ) from prior course at scheduled treatment day. Full doses will be&#xD;
                given as soon as the hematological recovery is documented. If two weeks after the&#xD;
                due day recovery is still incomplete, the treatment may be started and the dosage&#xD;
                be reduced according to the following&#xD;
&#xD;
                schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
                AGC*/mm3Platelet/mm3 1,500-2,00075,000-100,000 1,000-1,49950,000-74,999&#xD;
                &lt;1,000&lt;50,000 Cyclophosphamide 80% 60% ** Doxorubicin 80% 60% **&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G-CSF is allowed to be used prophylactically for older ( &gt; 60 years old) patients and&#xD;
           for patients with previous or ongoing prolonged myelosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Postpone for another week. If the counts remain AGC&lt;1,500 or Platelet &lt;75,000 three&#xD;
                weeks after the due day, patients should be off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Hepatotoxicity For patients with normal prechemotherapy serum ALT, hepatitis flare-up is&#xD;
      defined as ALT elevation greater than 1.5 fold of upper normal limit. For patients with&#xD;
      abnormal prechemotherapy serum ALT, hepatitis flare-up is defined as 2.0 fold or greater&#xD;
      increase of serum ALT level. The hepatitis or hepatitis flare-up is attributed to&#xD;
      reactivation of HBV when there is a sudden elevation (&gt;10-fold) in serum HBV DNA level or&#xD;
      reappearance of HBV DNA and/or HBeAg in the serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since results of our previous study has indicated that nearly all clinical hepatitis&#xD;
      developed in HBV carrier during chemotherapy is caused by HBV reactivation, and serum HBV DNA&#xD;
      data are not readily available in most hospitals, all patients with hepatitis flare-up are&#xD;
      considered HBV reactivation until proved otherwise. For patients in the second arm,&#xD;
      biochemical hepatitis will prompt a start of daily lamivudine, even before a definite&#xD;
      documentation of 10-fold increase of HBV DNA. For patients with only minor hepatic&#xD;
      dysfunction (total bilirubin &lt;3.0 mg/dl and ALT &lt;200 I.U./L), full-dose chemotherapy is&#xD;
      recommended on the scheduled treatment day without delay. For patients with more severe&#xD;
      hepatic dysfunction (total bilirubin ≧ 3.0 mg/dl or ALT ≧ 200 I.U./L), subsequent course is&#xD;
      postponed for 1 week and the dosage modified as followings if the values remain abnormal&#xD;
      after 1 week:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Bilirubin (mg/dl) &lt;3.0 3.0 ~ 4.9 5.0 ~ 7.5 &gt;7.5 ALT (I.U./L) &lt;200 200 ~ 399 400 ~ 800&#xD;
      &gt;800 Doxorubicin 100% 75% 50% *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wait until recovery with serum levels below these values. Patients will be off study if&#xD;
           Bil &gt; 7.5 mg/dl or ALT &gt; 800 I.U/L, 3 weeks after the due day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Gastrointestinal Toxicity In case of severe (≧ NCI Gr III) anorexia, nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      diarrhea, stomatitis or abdominal pain, all therapy should be delayed until improvement of&#xD;
      symptoms to ≦ GrII.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be off study if ≧ Gr III toxicity persists ≧ 3 weeks after due day. Patients&#xD;
      are allowed to use H3-blockers in the subsequent courses for severe nausea and vomiting. If&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicity is still ≧ Gr III during the next course, doses of cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and doxorubicin should be reduced by 25% in the subsequent courses. If no further episodes of&#xD;
      severe reaction, the doses can be escalated, 12.5% each time, and back to 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Cardiotoxicity In case of NCI grade II cardiotoxicity, doxorubicin should be reduced by&#xD;
      50%. If cardiotoxicity is resolved, the dose may be carefully deescalated, 12,5% each time,&#xD;
      in the subsequent courses. If severe (≧ NCI grade III) cardiotoxicity develops, doxorubicin&#xD;
      should be discontinued and should not be used again in the subsequent courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Multiple Toxicity In the event of multiple toxicity, dose modification should be based on&#xD;
      the guideline that requires the greatest reduction of doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are still under or have completed protocol treatments (1st-line or 2nd-line)&#xD;
      should be continuously followed-up for all study end points. Patients are removed from study&#xD;
      if they have major violation of the protocol due to the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Completion of assigned therapy and observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Progressive of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Excessive of complication or toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient withdrawal or refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT ： Authorized physicians or research nurses must call Ms. Yueh-Ling&#xD;
      Ho at the TCOG Operations Office (Tel: 02-26534401 ext 6655) for patients registration and&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A permuted block randomization will be used to generate the list by the Statistical Center&#xD;
      housed at the Division of Biostatistics, NHRI. Treatment assignment is given only when the&#xD;
      patient passes the eligibility check.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 REPORT OF ADVERSE EFFECT : Adverse effect of treatments should be reported to TCOG&#xD;
      Operations Office at 02-26534401 ext 6655, 6657, 6658 and FAX: 02-2782-3755, within 48 hours.&#xD;
      See appendix for the TCOG ADR (Adverse Drug Reaction) Form of reporting adverse effect.&#xD;
