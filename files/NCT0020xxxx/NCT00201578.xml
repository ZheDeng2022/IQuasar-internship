  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine and various forms of alternative medicine to&#xD;
      maintain health among the Chinese ethnic group has had a long history and has been deeply&#xD;
      rooted in the Chinese way of living for centuries. It has been a general belief that these&#xD;
      therapies consist of &quot;natural&quot; substances and are less toxic than their western synthetic&#xD;
      drug counterparts. However, recent reports of side effects of systemic traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine, including hypersensitivity, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, cardiovascular toxicity,&#xD;
      renal failure, and contact dermatitis, have been increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is a high prevalence in the usage of traditional Chinese herbal medicine in&#xD;
      Taiwan, this study examines the frequency of patients using herbal medicine whose initial&#xD;
      diagnosis in the emergency department (ED) is acute non viral hepatitis. We, the researchers&#xD;
      at National Taiwan University Hospital, then correlate if the cause of hepatitis is related&#xD;
      to the use of these herbal drugs by taking a detailed history of medication or herbs used and&#xD;
      by verifying the contents by chemical analysis of the &quot;medications&quot; used. To our knowledge,&#xD;
      this is the first study in examining the relationship between non viral hepatitis and the use&#xD;
      of herbal drugs prior to arriving at the ED. We expect to prove adverse effects of these&#xD;
      substances, especially hepatitis, is the cause for requiring emergency care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study design is a prospective, density sampling case control study in which one hundred&#xD;
      patients with non viral hepatitis will be recruited as our case. We use a questionnaire&#xD;
      designed by the investigator in the survey of demographic background, education, and income&#xD;
      status of the cases, as well as the frequency of use of the drug, total dosage used, where&#xD;
      the drug was purchased, what the drug is used for, and whether they know of any adverse&#xD;
      effect that the drug might have. If they had taken the drug within three months prior to this&#xD;
      emergency visit, then they are asked to bring the drug in for examination. Examination of the&#xD;
      drug includes the use of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and if necessary,&#xD;
      inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP mass). In contrast, our control group&#xD;
      consists of subjects that are admitted to the ED due to trauma or fracture. For each case,&#xD;
      they are matched with two subjects in the control group in both gender and age. They should&#xD;
      also arrive within two days after the arrival of the case. All cases and controls are&#xD;
      screened for viral hepatitis and serology must be negative before entering the study. The&#xD;
      questionnaire is given to both groups. If more than one control is eligible to enter the&#xD;
      study, then the control is chosen by a random draw in a hat. After this use of density&#xD;
      sampling, we collect the data and logistic regression is used for analysis.&#xD;
