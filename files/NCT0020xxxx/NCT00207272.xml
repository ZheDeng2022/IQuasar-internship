      Twelve obese patients approved for gastric bypass surgery will be randomized to either&#xD;
      receive an MCT-based or LCT-based liquid diet for a 4 week period. These diets will be&#xD;
      identical except for the quality of the fat. The intervention will be double-blinded. Six&#xD;
      patients will receive a daily diet consisting of 5 liquid meals using the HMR 800 meal&#xD;
      replacement product (Health Management Resources, Inc; 160 calories/shake) with 44.5 grams&#xD;
      MCT oil (Life Enhancement Products, Inc., Petaluna, CA; 8.3 kcal/gm) added. Six patients will&#xD;
      receive the same HMR diet but with 41 grams LCT oil (corn oil; 9 kcal/gm) added. Patients in&#xD;
      both groups will be given a list of supplemental foods that are suitable for the study. They&#xD;
      may choose to eat up to an additional 700 kcal per day from this list and will be asked to&#xD;
      complete food records for monitoring of their caloric intake. Patients will undergo gastric&#xD;
      bypass surgery after 4 weeks of being on their diets. Patients in both groups will be seen&#xD;
      weekly by a registered dietitian and a physician. Blood pressure and weight will be recorded,&#xD;
      and any adverse events will be noted and cared for as is appropriate. Dietary instruction&#xD;
      will be reviewed as needed.Both diets will be 1170-1870 kcal/day, consisting of 36% CHO,&#xD;
      26.2% protein, and 37.6% fat. The MCT diet will contain 30.2% of total calories at MCT oil.&#xD;
      The percentages given are based on the shake and oil consumption only (1170 kcal/day). The&#xD;
      remainder of the diet will vary according to patients' selections from the list of permitted&#xD;
      foods, up to an additional 700 kcal/day (for the total 1870 kcal/day). All subjects will&#xD;
      receive a multi-vitamin each day. Subjects will also receive two Fibercon capsules per day to&#xD;
      prevent possible bowel changes associated with being on a full liquid diet. During surgery,&#xD;
      biopsies of visceral and omental adipose tissue, as well as subcutaneous abdominal adipose&#xD;
      tissue, will be obtained. Tissue will be analyzed to determine mRNA levels of key enzymes in&#xD;
      fatty acid esterification, lipolysis, and oxidative disposition. This preliminary phase will&#xD;
      be conducted to determine whether visceral, omental, and subcutaneous abdominal adipose&#xD;
      tissue behave similarly when exposed to an MCT-based diet.&#xD;

      In this the preliminary phase, a total of 12 obese patients who have been accepted to undergo&#xD;
      gastric restrictive surgery will be recruited. Although the inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
      secondary companion pilot study include diabetic patients, having diabetes mellitus is not&#xD;
      necessary for the testing of the hypothesis in the preliminary phase. The aim is to test&#xD;
      whether subcutaneous adipose tissue in the abdominal region is similar to visceral and&#xD;
      omental adipose tissue in terms of cellular mechanisms after ingestion of MCT oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve obese patients approved for gastric bypass surgery will be randomized to either&#xD;
      receive an MCT-based or LCT-based liquid diet for a 4 week period. These diets will be&#xD;
      identical except for the quality of the fat. The intervention will be double-blinded. Six&#xD;
      patients will receive a daily diet consisting of 5 liquid meals using the HMR 800 meal&#xD;
      replacement product (Health Management Resources, Inc; 160 calories/shake) with 44.5 grams&#xD;
      MCT oil (Life Enhancement Products, Inc., Petaluna, CA; 8.3 kcal/gm) added. Six patients will&#xD;
      receive the same HMR diet but with 41 grams LCT oil (corn oil; 9 kcal/gm) added. Patients in&#xD;
      both groups will be given a list of supplemental foods that are suitable for the study. They&#xD;
      may choose to eat up to an additional 700 kcal per day from this list and will be asked to&#xD;
      complete food records for monitoring of their caloric intake. Patients will undergo gastric&#xD;
      bypass surgery after 4 weeks of being on their diets. Patients in both groups will be seen&#xD;
      weekly by a registered dietitian and a physician. Blood pressure and weight will be recorded,&#xD;
      and any adverse events will be noted and cared for as is appropriate. Dietary instruction&#xD;
      will be reviewed as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both diets will be 1170-1870 kcal/day, consisting of 36% CHO, 26.2% protein, and 37.6% fat.&#xD;
      The MCT diet will contain 30.2% of total calories at MCT oil. The percentages given are based&#xD;
      on the shake and oil consumption only (1170 kcal/day). The remainder of the diet will vary&#xD;
      according to patients' selections from the list of permitted foods, up to an additional 700&#xD;
      kcal/day (for the total 1870 kcal/day). Subjects will receive a multi-vitamin each day.&#xD;
      Subjects will also receive two Fibercon capsules per day to prevent possible bowel changes&#xD;
      associated with being on a full liquid diet. It is estimated patients will lose between 10&#xD;
      and 30 pounds before surgery. This is a standard of care as all patients are encouraged to&#xD;
      lose this amount prior to surgery. This small amount of weight loss from initial body weight&#xD;
      is considered beneficial in reducing complications of gastric bypass surgery in morbidly&#xD;
      obese patients with significant co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, biopsies of visceral and omental adipose tissue, as well as subcutaneous&#xD;
      abdominal adipose tissue, will be obtained. Tissue will be analyzed to determine mRNA levels&#xD;
      of key enzymes in fatty acid esterification, lipolysis, and oxidative disposition. This&#xD;
      preliminary phase will be conducted to determine whether visceral, omental, and subcutaneous&#xD;
      abdominal adipose tissue behave similarly when exposed to an MCT-based dietIn Phase 1 and 2,&#xD;
      these results will be used to extrapolate effects on visceral and omental adipose tissue from&#xD;
      effects seen on subcutaneous adipose tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, small samples of the tissue (approximately .25 cm x .25cm) for each of the 12&#xD;
      subjects will be shipped to Quantomix, where the samples will be viewed under electron&#xD;
      microscopy. There will be no additional tissue removed in the OR for this, and there will be&#xD;
      no added risk to the subjects. Quantomix will not receive any identifying information on the&#xD;
      samples; therefore there will be no breach of confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES: Screening for Preliminary Phase Twelve obese subjects will be recruited&#xD;
      from the Nutrition and Weight Management Center population of gastric restrictive surgery&#xD;
      patients. The subjects will have met all requirements for and received prior approval for the&#xD;
      gastric restrictive surgery. The patient will sign the IRB-approved Informed Consent -&#xD;
      Surgical Intervention form at the Baseline visit. Inclusion criteria includes age 18-65 years&#xD;
      and BMI &gt;40 kg/m2 or &gt;35 kg/m2 with co-morbidities. Exclusions are those that are a part of&#xD;
      the normal standard of care in the pre-selection process for approval of surgery, clinically&#xD;
      severe lactose intolerance, alcohol dependence, and a significant egg allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and Remaining Visits The Baseline visit will be within two weeks of the screening&#xD;
      visit. For the procedures to be performed at the baseline and weekly visits, see Table A&#xD;
      attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for subcutaneous adipose tissue needle biopsy The surgeon will remove three pieces&#xD;
      of fat tissue measuring 2 inches x 2 inches x 2 inches from the fat under the skin during the&#xD;
      gastric restrictive surgery. In the surgical field, it is appropriate to remove this large of&#xD;
      a piece of tissue in order to be able to extrapolate and define how much tissue will be&#xD;
      required to be removed by punch biopsy in Phase 1 and 2 of the secondary companion study (in&#xD;
      the secondary companion study, it is expected that 100 mg subcutaneous tissue will yield 3&#xD;
      micrograms of total RNA. The amount of tissue removed during surgery will be greater than&#xD;
      that amount to ensure the projected yield). The surgeon will also remove two pieces of fat&#xD;
      tissue from the abdomen during surgery. In total, one piece will be taken from the fat tissue&#xD;
      covering the stomach (omental), one piece from just under the skin (subcutaneous), and the&#xD;
      other piece from the fat tissue covering the bowels or intestines (visceral). These are fat&#xD;
      tissues that are in the area that the surgery will be performed. The biopsy will not&#xD;
      interfere in any way with the surgery. The surgeon will also draw a sample of blood (12 mL)&#xD;
      to be used for hematology, serum chemistry, hemoglobin A1C, serum lipids, thyroid function&#xD;
      test, serum insulin, serum hydroxybutyrate (possibly elevated in MCT-fed subjects), serum&#xD;
      leptin, and serum free fatty acid concentration. The surgeon will explain all of this to the&#xD;
      subject prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Op Diet:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to the gastric restrictive surgery, eligible patients will receive dietary&#xD;
           instructions by a registered dietitian for a daily diet consisting of 5 liquid meals&#xD;
           using the HMR 800 meal replacement product (Health Management Resources, Inc.) with 44.5&#xD;
           grams MCT oil or 41 grams LCT oil added. Patients in both groups will be given a list of&#xD;
           supplemental foods that are suitable for the study. They may choose to eat up to an&#xD;
           additional 700 kcal per day from this list and will be asked to complete food records&#xD;
           for monitoring of their caloric intake. Depending on how much food each patient eats,&#xD;
           this will be a daily caloric intake of approximately 1170-1870 calories. All patients&#xD;
           will be instructed to refrain from any alcohol intake while in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All patients will undergo gastric bypass surgery after 4 weeks of MCT oil/HMR or LCT&#xD;
           oil/HMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Op Diet:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery, subjects will follow the usual standard of care implemented in the&#xD;
      Nutrition and Weight Management Clinic through post-operative visits with the surgeon and&#xD;
      registered dietitian. Diet Stages Following Gastric Restrictive Surgery is attached hereto as&#xD;
      Appendix A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.During gastric restrictive surgery, biopsies of visceral and omental adipose tissue as well&#xD;
      as subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon will remove three pieces of fat tissue measuring 2 inches x 2 inches x 2 inches&#xD;
      from the fat under the skin during the gastric restrictive surgery. In the surgical field, it&#xD;
      is appropriate to remove this large of a piece of tissue in order to be able to extrapolate&#xD;
      and define how much tissue will be required to be removed by punch biopsy in Phase 1 and 2 of&#xD;
      the secondary companion study (In the secondary companion study, it is expected that 100 mg&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue will yield 3 micrograms of total RNA. The amount of tissue removed during&#xD;
      surgery will be greater than that amount to ensure the projected yield). The surgeon will&#xD;
      also remove two pieces of fat tissue from the abdomen during surgery. In total, one piece&#xD;
      will be taken from the fat tissue covering the stomach (omental), one piece from just under&#xD;
      the skin (subcutaneous), and the other piece from the fat tissue covering the bowels or&#xD;
      intestines (visceral). These are fat tissues that are in the area that the surgery will be&#xD;
      performed. The biopsy will not interfere in any way with the surgery. The surgeon will also&#xD;
      draw a sample of blood to be used for hematology, serum chemistry, hemoglobin A1C, serum&#xD;
      lipids, thyroid function test, serum insulin, serum hydroxybutyrate (possibly elevated in&#xD;
      MCT-fed subjects), serum leptin, and serum free fatty acid concentration. The surgeon will&#xD;
      explain all of this to the subject prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period (up to 2 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to the Screening visit, in the pre-operative visit, the Preliminary Phase will be&#xD;
           explained to patients who have been pre-approved for gastric restrictive surgery.&#xD;
           Questions will be answered at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Initial screening form will be completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pre-approval for gastric restrictive surgery will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. IRB-approved written consent form, signed at the pre-operative visit with the surgeon&#xD;
           co-investigator and medical co-investigator will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient will be scheduled to return for Baseline visit if eligible for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (within 2 weeks of screening) ± 4 days. Beginning of the study will be within 2-3&#xD;
      weeks after screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fasting blood samples will be obtained for hematology, serum chemistry, hemoglobin A1C,&#xD;
           serum lipids, thyroid function test, serum insulin, serum hydroxybutyrate (possibly&#xD;
           elevated in MCT-fed subjects), serum leptin, and serum free fatty acid concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Weight and blood pressure will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study diet and instructions will be dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient will be scheduled for surgery at the end of Week 4 of the study diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly visits (with registered dietitian and physician)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Weight and blood pressure will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dietary instruction will be reviewed as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adverse effects will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study diet will be dispensed as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. At the visit with the dietitian and physician one day before the gastric bypass surgery,&#xD;
           blood samples will again be obtained for hematology, serum chemistry, hemoglobin A1C,&#xD;
           serum lipids, thyroid function test, serum insulin, serum hydroxybutyrate (possibly&#xD;
           elevated in MCT-fed subjects), serum leptin, and serum free fatty acid concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unscheduled visits (UV):&#xD;
&#xD;
      If necessary for patient safety, unscheduled visits may be arranged. Unscheduled source&#xD;
      document sets used for visits attended between routine patient visits will be labeled with&#xD;
      the last attended visit number followed by a decimal point and the number of the unscheduled&#xD;
      visit (i.e. if two unscheduled visits are attended between Week 0 and Week 1 then those&#xD;
      unscheduled visits would be labeled as unscheduled visit sets 0.1 and 0.2 in chronological&#xD;
      order).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At unscheduled visits the following shall be completed as indicated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be collected for laboratory evaluation, if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical examination will be performed, if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ECG will be performed, if clinically indicated.&#xD;
