      Adherence to medical regimens refers to what degree a patient chooses to follow the advice&#xD;
      given by his/her healthcare provider. Good adherence typically involves behaviors such as the&#xD;
      patient taking medication as directed and going to scheduled clinic appointments. As many&#xD;
      patients often do not follow the advice of doctors as closely as suggested, many researchers&#xD;
      have tried to find out the reasons behind patients being &quot;non-adherent.&quot; This research has&#xD;
      looked at medical conditions such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. More recently,&#xD;
      researchers have started to look at adherence with children who have undergone solid organ&#xD;
      transplantation. This is because about 50% of these children are to some degree non-adherent&#xD;
      with their medical regimen. This comes at a costly price as ongoing non-adherence in&#xD;
      pediatric transplant can lead to the child's body rejecting the new organ and even death.&#xD;
      This study has been designed to look at the reasons that pediatric patients may choose to be&#xD;
      non-adherent. This study will look at issues related to the patient (e.g., age, family&#xD;
      support), related to the disease and regimen (e.g., length of illness, how complicated the&#xD;
      regimen is), related to the medication (e.g., taste, side effects), related to their mind&#xD;
      (e.g., memory problems, confusion), and related to their emotions (e.g., being depressed,&#xD;
      anxious). The investigators will be looking at each regimen-related behavior, such as&#xD;
      attending clinic appointments and will be asking each family about any barriers that make it&#xD;
      difficult. The investigators hope that knowing these barriers will help them make&#xD;
      interventions that fit the specific issues that each patient faces. Ultimately, doctors,&#xD;
      transplant coordinators, and psychological professionals will be able to use this information&#xD;
      to intervene early with families who report barriers that impact adherence.&#xD;

      This study will involve approximately 100 parents of pediatric patients who have received a&#xD;
      solid organ transplant at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) between January 1st, 1988&#xD;
      and December 31st, 2004. Within this sample, pediatric patients who are 11-18 years of age&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in a separate component of the project, involving&#xD;
      approximately 50 adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a parent to participate in this study the child must have had a solid organ transplant at&#xD;
      CHOA, patient is 5-18 years of age, patient lives with the parent(s) in the home, and&#xD;
      informed consent can be obtained. For a child to participate in this study, the child must&#xD;
      have had a solid organ transplant at CHOA, patient is 11-18 years of age, patient lives with&#xD;
      the parent(s) in the home, and informed assent can be obtained. Family exclusionary criteria&#xD;
      are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient has not lived with parent for at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient's medical records are not accessible through the CHOA system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be referred by the respective transplant coordinator or one of the&#xD;
      physicians in this study. Parents will be provided with the findings upon request and&#xD;
      referrals for psychological services will be made as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To recruit participants for the proposed study, children and adolescents who received a solid&#xD;
      organ transplant at CHOA between January 1st, 1988 and December 31st, 2004 will be identified&#xD;
      by the transplant coordinators or physician for each solid organ. Although multiple methods&#xD;
      of recruitment will be used, each family will only be contacted once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic recruitment with the investigator present:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient family who is scheduled for an upcoming clinic visit will be approached by the&#xD;
      transplant coordinator or other clinic-affiliated individual. The investigation will be&#xD;
      briefly described and interest in participating will be solicited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parent will sign a letter of interest stating either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. They are interested in learning more. The form will also ask them to provide contact&#xD;
           information (home address and telephone number) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. They are not interested and do not want to be contacted further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only letters indicating interest will be given to investigators. If a family signs the letter&#xD;
      indicating interest, an investigator present at clinic will approach the family to describe&#xD;
      the investigation and obtain consent/assent. The family will have the option to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. conduct the interview during the present clinic visit,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. schedule a future time to conduct the interview at the clinic, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. conduct the interview via telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic recruitment with the investigator not present:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an investigator is not present at the clinic, the transplant coordinator or other&#xD;
      clinic-affiliated individual will give the letters indicating interest to an investigator to&#xD;
      contact the family via telephone to describe the study. If after the telephone conversation,&#xD;
      a parent is interested in participating, 2 copies of the consent form will be sent to the&#xD;
      parent's home with a self-addressed envelope to return one signed copy. Following receipt of&#xD;
      this form, the parent will be contacted to schedule either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. an interview at the clinic or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an interview via telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mail recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient family who is not scheduled for an upcoming clinic visit will be contacted via&#xD;
      mail from the transplant coordinator and transplant physician. The letter will briefly&#xD;
      describe the investigation and a letter of interest will be included. Included will be a&#xD;
      postage-paid envelope to return directly to the transplant team. The transplant coordinator&#xD;
      or other clinic-affiliated individual will give the letters indicating interest to an&#xD;
      investigator to contact the family via telephone to describe the study. If after the&#xD;
      telephone conversation, a parent would like to participate, 2 copies of the consent form will&#xD;
      be sent to the parent's home with a self-addressed envelope to return one signed copy to the&#xD;
      investigator. Following receipt of this form, the parent will be contacted to schedule&#xD;
      either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. an interview at the clinic or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an interview via telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a parent is not seen in the clinic and does not return a letter of interest, the&#xD;
      transplant coordinator or other clinic affiliated individual will call the family to briefly&#xD;
      describe the investigation and obtain verbal consent for an investigator to contact them via&#xD;
      telephone. If they indicate that they are not interested in participating, they will not be&#xD;
      contacted further. If a parent verbally consents to being contacted to learn more about the&#xD;
      study, an investigator will contact the family via telephone. If after the telephone&#xD;
      conversation, a parent would like to participate, 2 copies of the consent form will be sent&#xD;
      to the parent's home with a self-addressed envelope to return one signed copy to the&#xD;
      investigator. Following receipt of this form, the parent will be contacted to schedule&#xD;
      either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. an interview at the clinic or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an interview via telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the family is called three times with no success in reaching them, this will be considered&#xD;
      passive refusal and will not be contacted further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVIEW PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview with each parent will consist of verbal consent and verbal administration of&#xD;
      the PEDS-TX Survey, Parent Version 1.0, the Medical Adherence Measure (MAM), the Child Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50), the SF-12 Health Survey (SF-12), the Family&#xD;
      Relationship Index (FRI), and demographic questions. The interview with each participating&#xD;
      adolescent patient will consist of verbal assent and the PEDS-TX Survey, Adolescent Version&#xD;
      1.0, the Medical Adherence Measure (MAM), the Child Health Questionnaire-Child Form 80&#xD;
      (CHQ-CF80), the Adolescent Risk Taking Survey (ARTS), and the Family Relationship Index&#xD;
      (FRI). Each interview will be conducted by research assistants and/or graduate students in&#xD;
      psychology. They will be trained in all research procedures by the principal investigator.&#xD;
      Training will include observed practice of procedures and skills taught, focused on building&#xD;
      rapport with and being sensitive to parents and patients with solid organ transplants,&#xD;
      verbally administering the assessment questionnaires in an accurate and comfortable manner,&#xD;
      giving answers to questions from parents and patients in an instructive manner that do not&#xD;
      bias the research, and lastly, being culturally and socioeconomically sensitive when greeting&#xD;
      and interviewing families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data for this study will likely be obtained over a 6-9 month period, with data from a&#xD;
      specific parent and adolescent patient pair occurring within less than a week period (ideally&#xD;
      during the same phone call). Each interview will last approximately 45-75 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
