  <brief_summary>

      The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To review past clinical use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in kidney transplant&#xD;
           patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To discover why doses were modified and how those modifications affected the survival&#xD;
           and health of the transplanted kidney; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether, therefore, the side effects of MMF that result in dose alterations&#xD;
           are related to outcome.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose collecting data on the MMF total daily dose and regimens used in our transplant&#xD;
      population from 1995 to 2003. We will assess why doses were modified and how those&#xD;
      modifications affected graft survival, and whether, therefore, the side effects of MMF that&#xD;
      result in dose alterations are related to outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase I - To describe initial MMF dosing and subsequent changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase II - To explore the potential effect of the above on graft outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase III - To explore reasons for dose changes and how these relate to tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The initial maintenance total daily dose of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, Cellcept)&#xD;
           (Frequency distribution of initial maintenance total daily dose in mg/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Include subgroup information about:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Cadaveric donors vs. living donors&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Regimen (BID vs. TID vs. QID)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Race (AA vs. Others)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in MMF dose from Initial Maintenance Dose (censor patient info at time of&#xD;
           rejection or graft loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To answer this question we will look at all time points captured within the first&#xD;
                post-transplant year, or at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-transplant, whichever is&#xD;
                fewer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. We will analyze the frequency distribution of daily doses and subgroup by cadaveric&#xD;
                donor vs. living donor sub-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients that had no change in MMF total daily dose during their first year&#xD;
           post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           No dose change is defined as the same MMF dose at all time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients that had MMF permanently discontinued in their first year post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients that had a dose reduction during their first post-transplant year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients that had the frequency of their MMF daily regimen increased (i.e., from BID to&#xD;
           TID or QID) during their first post-transplant year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acute Rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Using the data from Statement 2A above we will assess how many patients experienced&#xD;
                a treated acute rejection, and stratify by dose into &quot;total-daily-dose groups&quot; as&#xD;
                warranted by frequency distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Using the data from Statement 2 B, C, &amp; D above, we will analyze whether MMF&#xD;
                discontinuation, dose reduction, or increase in MMF dosing frequency is associated&#xD;
                with the incidence of (subsequent) acute rejection?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Graft failure&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Using the data from Statement 2A above, we will document how many patients had&#xD;
                graft failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Using the data from Statement 2 B, C, &amp; D above, we will analyze whether MMF&#xD;
                discontinuation, MMF dose reduction, or increase in MMF dosing frequency affects&#xD;
                the incidence of graft failure?&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE III&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Reasons for Dose Reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The side effects that resulted in dose reduction will be documented and the effect of dose&#xD;
      reduction in the subsequent period analyzed as above.&#xD;
