  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obesity epidemic observed in recent years can be largely attributed to an obesogenic&#xD;
      environment that encourages overeating and sedentary lifestyles. Behavioral weight control&#xD;
      treatment, the most empirically validated intervention approach, produces initial weight&#xD;
      losses of 10%; however, maintenance of initial weight loss and behavior change has not been&#xD;
      achieved. These disappointing long-term results may reflect the fact that participants are&#xD;
      given only minimal, indirect instruction on how to change their environment to support their&#xD;
      new weight-regulating behaviors. While in theory, the behavioral model emphasizes&#xD;
      environmental antecedents and consequences of eating and exercise, in practice, only 1 to 2&#xD;
      sessions in standard treatment are dedicated to stimulus control-types of skills. By teaching&#xD;
      weight control skills in a contextual vacuum, participants remain vulnerable to the same&#xD;
      environmental influences that maintained their unhealthy eating and exercise habits. Given&#xD;
      that the majority of eating and exercise is home-based, a logical step in strengthening&#xD;
      behavioral treatment and moving toward an ecological model of behavior is to expand the focus&#xD;
      of treatment from the individual to the individual plus their home environment. We propose to&#xD;
      test the long-term impact of a behavioral weight control program designed to directly modify&#xD;
      both the physical and social home environment of weight loss participants. Two hundred&#xD;
      overweight and obese men and women will be randomly assigned to either 18 months of standard&#xD;
      behavioral treatment (SBT) or 18 months of standard behavioral treatment plus direct&#xD;
      modifications to the home environment (SBT+Home). SBT+Home will incorporate many strategies&#xD;
      that have shown promise in improving weight loss (e.g., food and exercise equipment&#xD;
      provision, spouse involvement) but will be the first to study both physical and social&#xD;
      factors within the home simultaneously and will be the longest examination of the home&#xD;
      environment conducted to date. Participants and spouses will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12,&#xD;
      and 18 months. We hypothesize that by broadening the focus of treatment from the individual&#xD;
      to the individual plus their home environment, SBT+Home will produce both better long-term&#xD;
      weight loss and better maintenance of initial weight loss and behavior change. This home&#xD;
      environmental approach, if successful, has potential applications to the maintenance of other&#xD;
      important health behaviors.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are between 21-70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a body mass index (BMI) between 25-50 kg/m2 .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  live with another overweight adult who is between 18-70 years of age and has a BMI&#xD;
             between 25-50 kg/m2 and who is willing to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  report a heart condition, chest pain during periods of activity or rest, or loss of&#xD;
             consciousness on the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q; items 1-4).&#xD;
             Individuals endorsing joint problems, prescription medication usage, or other medical&#xD;
             conditions that could limit exercise will be required to obtain written physician&#xD;
             consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  report conditions that in the judgment of the Principal Investigator would render them&#xD;
             potentially unlikely to follow the protocol for 18 months including an illness likely&#xD;
             to be terminal within 18 months, plans to move out of the area, substance abuse or&#xD;
             other significant psychiatric problems, or dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  report being unable to walk 2 blocks (1/4 mile) without stopping.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are currently participating in a weight loss program and/or taking a weight loss&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are currently pregnant or intend to become pregnant in the next 18 months.&#xD;
