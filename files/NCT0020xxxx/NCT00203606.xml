  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C infects as many as 300,000 Canadians. Up to 25% of those infected will develop&#xD;
      cirrhosis and be at risk for liver failure and liver cancer. Cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C&#xD;
      is the most common reason for liver transplantation in Canada. The largest group of infected&#xD;
      people are those who use injectable street drugs. However, people who continue to use drugs&#xD;
      are routinely excluded from scientific studies testing new treatments for Hepatitis C and are&#xD;
      generally recommended not to receive available treatments. Although several reasons are given&#xD;
      to justify excluding these people from treatment, little scientific evidence is available to&#xD;
      support it. We plan to examine how successful treatment with the current standard treatment&#xD;
      of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is in those who continue to use injection drugs. We&#xD;
      will compare the results of treatment of 70 active drug users to results of published&#xD;
      clinical trials (this is a change from initial plan to compare to treatment results of 70&#xD;
      local) reformed drug users). Our goal is to determine whether reasonable success rates can be&#xD;
      achieved in active drug users that would then further justify their routine treatment.&#xD;
