  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A research study that will evaluate if giving surfactant medication to premature babies&#xD;
      weighing &lt; 1250 gm at birth during the second and third weeks of life will help their lungs.&#xD;
      We are enrolling those premature babies who continue to require the breathing tube and the&#xD;
      mechanical ventilator at days 7-10 of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary surfactant is required for normal lung function. Data from a previous study suggest&#xD;
      that as many as 75% of chronically ventilated extremely low birthweight premature infants&#xD;
      have at least one episode of surfactant dysfunction beyond the first week of life, as&#xD;
      measured in vitro, associated with a low surfactant protein B content. Furthermore, episodes&#xD;
      of surfactant dysfunction are significantly associated with clinically significant&#xD;
      respiratory decompensations. We hypothesize that booster doses of surfactant given during the&#xD;
      second and third week of life to extremely low birth weight premature infants requiring&#xD;
      persistent intubation and mechanical ventilation will improve their respiratory status during&#xD;
      the first 28 days of life. We propose to enroll premature infants &lt; 1250 gm birthweight,&#xD;
      between days 7 and 10 of life who are intubated, and mechanically ventilated. Infants&#xD;
      requiring persistent intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory support at 7-10&#xD;
      days of life will receive a total of 3 doses of Infasurf surfactant, 3 days apart, at the&#xD;
      standard dose of 3 ml/kg. Primary outcome is the change in area under the respiratory&#xD;
      severity score curve between days 7 and 28 of life. Total sample size is 88 infants, study&#xD;
      duration is 36 months, and recruitment of study patients will occur at The Hospital of the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia PA, Women and Children's Hospital in Buffalo, St.&#xD;
      Louis Children's Hospital in St. Louis MO, Mercy Children's Hospital in Kansas City, Oakland&#xD;
      Children's and Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, CA and Long Island Jewish Medical&#xD;
      Center, NY.&#xD;
