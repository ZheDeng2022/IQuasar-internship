  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High protein diets are popular among Maori, especially on the East Coast of the North Island.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to compare the metabolic effects of a moderate carbohydrate,&#xD;
      high protein diet (MCHP) with a high carbohydrate-high fibre (HCHF) diet on insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in Maori at increased risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

      This was a 6-month pilot intervention study of self-identifying Maori participants in a&#xD;
      randomised control trial conducted in Dunedin and Invercargill. The study consisted of three,&#xD;
      two month phases and was conducted over a period of six months. Participants meeting all the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were randomised into three groups: moderate carbohydrate-high protein&#xD;
      (MCHP), high carbohydrate-high fibre (HCHF) or a control group. Those randomised to the&#xD;
      experimental diets were recommended an energy intake based on their current BMI levels. The&#xD;
      aim of phase one was to achieve weight loss with weekly advice and support from the research&#xD;
      team. The aim of phase two was for weight maintenance with continued weekly advice and&#xD;
      support. Phase three consisted of a weight maintenance phase without support. Those in the&#xD;
      control group were instructed to follow their own self selected diet plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome was determined by examining surrogate clinical endpoints. The clinical endpoints&#xD;
      included the following recorded measurements of anthropometric measurements, bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance measurements, profile of mood state questionnaires, activity questionnaires, and&#xD;
      three day diet records were collected at 0, 2, 4 and 6 month periods. Biochemical measures of&#xD;
      lipid profile, fasting insulin and glucose, liver functions and uric acid levels were also&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
