      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substantial evidence supports a favorable relationships between cardiovascular fitness,&#xD;
      physical activity and cardiovascular health. In particular, it is well established that&#xD;
      increased levels of physical activity result in favorable improvements in lipid and&#xD;
      carbohydrate metabolism. There is also evidence that increased physical activity and&#xD;
      cardiovascular fitness have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health independent of the&#xD;
      effects on specific cardiovascular risk factors. One hypothesis proposes that the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of regular exercise in humans is mediated through peripheral mechanisms, in&#xD;
      particular through the chronic adaptations in skeletal muscle to habitual exercise. The&#xD;
      exercise exposures required to achieve health benefits in humans are poorly defined and the&#xD;
      mechanisms through which these beneficial adaptations occur are poorly understood. The study&#xD;
      will investigate the peripheral biological mechanisms through which chronic physical activity&#xD;
      alters carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism, resulting in improvements in these&#xD;
      parameters of cardiovascular health and fitness in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial, Studies of a Targeted Risk Reduction Intervention through Defined&#xD;
      Exercise (STRRIDE I), subjects were randomly assigned to one of three graded exercise&#xD;
      training regimens or a sedentary control group and asked to train, after an initial ramp&#xD;
      period of up to two months, for six months at a given exercise intensity and dose. Parameters&#xD;
      reflecting changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were studied at an integrative&#xD;
      physiologic level and with measurable biological endpoints in peripheral skeletal muscle&#xD;
      (e.g., capillary surface area). It was proposed that the elucidation of the peripheral&#xD;
      mechanisms mediating the favorable responses in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism to chronic&#xD;
      physical activity would lead to better understanding of the health benefits conferred by&#xD;
      physical activity and cardiovascular fitness in humans and point the way toward better&#xD;
      exercise recommendations for clients with significant cardiovascular risk factors. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to investigate the peripheral biological mechanisms through which&#xD;
      chronic physical activity altered carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism, resulting in&#xD;
      improvements in these parameters of cardiovascular health and fitness in humans. The driving&#xD;
      hypothesis was that health benefits derived from habitual exercise were primarily mediated&#xD;
      through adaptations occurring in skeletal muscle, probably related to alterations in exposed&#xD;
      capillary surface area in skeletal muscle induced by exercise training. The investigators&#xD;
      used graded exercise regimens in moderately obese human subjects with mild to moderate lipid&#xD;
      metabolic abnormalities to investigate whether induced alterations in skeletal muscle fiber&#xD;
      type, metabolic capacity and capillary surface area accounted for favorable alterations in&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, lipoprotein levels and lipid metabolism.&#xD;
