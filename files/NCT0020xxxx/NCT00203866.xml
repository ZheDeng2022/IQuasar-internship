  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the experimental vaccine G250 with or&#xD;
      without IL-2 can produce an immune response in patients with renal cell carcinoma who have&#xD;
      had all their cancer removed by surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma is a chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistant neoplasm that has a poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Immunotherapy with the biologic agent IL-2 consistently produces a response rate&#xD;
      of 10-15 %. Currently, for patients with locally advanced disease or patients with solitary&#xD;
      metastases, the only treatment modality with a curative potential is surgical resection.&#xD;
      There is presently no approved agent for use as adjuvant therapy after surgical resection to&#xD;
      decrease the risk of recurrence. Peptide-based vaccine approaches offer an attractive&#xD;
      treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high prevalence of G250 in RCC, the definition of an HLA-A2-restricted epitope (the most&#xD;
      common HLA type), and its immunogenicity makes it the most attractive candidate for&#xD;
      peptide-based vaccine approaches in RCC therapy. The promising preclinical and clinical&#xD;
      evidence provides the rationale for the use of IL-2 to potentiate the antitumor effects of&#xD;
      cancer vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is presently no conclusive data on the best dose of IL-2 to use as an adjuvant to&#xD;
      cancer vaccines. One paradoxical finding in preclinical and clinical trials is that despite&#xD;
      the enhancement in the antitumor effects of cancer vaccines, the number of antigen-specific&#xD;
      CTL is not increased when IL-2 is given with a cancer vaccine 35]. In contrast, patients&#xD;
      treated with peptide vaccines (without IL-2) in some melanoma trials had evidence of high&#xD;
      levels of antigen-specific CTL, with no tumor regression observed 36]. Some possible&#xD;
      explanations include capillary leak from high dose IL-2 resulting in CTL leaving the&#xD;
      circulation and the possibility that high dose IL-2 decreases efficient T-cell priming. A&#xD;
      more recent explanation has been proposed through advances in the mechanism of 1-cell&#xD;
      activation. As their level of activation increases, T-cells become more susceptible to&#xD;
      apoptosis. This phenomenon is known as activation-induced cell death (AICD) IL-2 may then&#xD;
      have a role in the amplification and downregulation of the immune response. High dose IL-2&#xD;
      may help in augmenting the increase in the activation of CTL, but this may lead to increase&#xD;
      their susceptibility to AJCD. The evidence in animal models that low doses of IL-2 were&#xD;
      sufficient in increasing the potency of DC-based immunizations provides the rational for our&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our current study, the lowest dose of IL-2 (1 x 106 IU) is similar to the doses used by&#xD;
      Yee et al. in their adoptive I cell therapy. This dose has been shown to expand and maintain&#xD;
      CTLs in both preclinical and clinical models. The highest dose (11 x 106 IU) was chosen based&#xD;
      on the expected toxicities from higher doses of IL-2 and our experience with this dose as a&#xD;
      single agent in RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that immunization with G250/Montanide/GM-CSF plus IL-2 can lead to an&#xD;
      expansion of G250-specific CTL and result in killing of 0250 expressing micrometastatic RCC.&#xD;
      We propose a dose finding study of escalating low doses of IL 2 (subcutaneous), since no&#xD;
      prior study has specifically evaluated the use of low dose IL-2 as a cytokine adjuvant and&#xD;
      attempted to establish a correlation between dose and immunolgic response.&#xD;
