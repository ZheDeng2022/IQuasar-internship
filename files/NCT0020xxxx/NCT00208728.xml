  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During open-heart surgery, blood flow is supported by a heart-lung machine that both pumps&#xD;
      the blood and gives it oxygen. A problem associated with a heart-lung machine is the damage&#xD;
      to some of the blood caused by protein in the blood cell sticking to the sides of the&#xD;
      heart-lung machine tubing. This breakdown of the blood cell affects the platelets, which help&#xD;
      the blood to clot. Use of the un-treated circuit will be phased out within the next few&#xD;
      years, as newer technology is available. The use of coated tubing has been shown to decrease&#xD;
      problems with post-operative bleeding in the adult population. No studies have been done on&#xD;
      the pediatric population. We plan to perform a prospective, randomized study using the&#xD;
      un-treated circuits used now, the &quot; Smart&quot; circuit tubing manufactured by Cobe Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Inc., Arvada, CO and the PMEA circuit manufactured by Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed by the perfusionist (the person that runs the heart-lung&#xD;
      machine) in charge of the case. No one else will be aware of which circuit is being used.&#xD;
      There will be no changes in the operation of the heart-lung machine, anesthesia or the&#xD;
      surgery because of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood testing that is standard of care and some additional tests will be performed on a small&#xD;
      amount of blood drawn from. the patient via arterial lines. Additional blood sticks will not&#xD;
      be required to obtain this sample.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to compare the PC/SMART and PMEA treated circuits against each&#xD;
      other and the current clinical standard (untreated) circuit with regard to blood component&#xD;
      damage during CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims SA1: To determine if the surface modified circuits decrease platelet&#xD;
      activation, platelet sequestration, and fibrinolysis during pediatric cardiac surgery using&#xD;
      CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Use of a surface modified circuit will attenuate the CPB related decrease in&#xD;
      platelet count, diminish platelet dysfunction as measured by thromboelastography (TEG), and&#xD;
      decrease fibrinolysis as measured by fibrin-split product levels and TEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA2: To determine whether the use of surface modified circuits during pediatric cardiac&#xD;
      surgery results in a clinically relevant decrease in post-operative coagulopathy as measured&#xD;
      by post-operative bleeding and blood product use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The use of surface modified circuits will result in improved function of the&#xD;
      coagulation system yielding less post-operative bleeding and thus fewer blood product&#xD;
      transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study will be a prospective, randomized trial in which a total of 90 patients&#xD;
      (5-10 kgs) undergoing first time cardiac surgery using CPB at Egleston Hospital will be&#xD;
      randomized into 3 groups. Group 1 will be the control group for whom the current standard&#xD;
      unmodified CPB circuit will be used. Group 2 will undergo surgery using the PC/SMART modified&#xD;
      CPB circuit (Cobe Cardiovascular Inc, Arvada, CO). Group 3 will undergo surgery using the&#xD;
      PMEA modified circuit (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1 will be tested using the following assays:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total platelet count Hematocrit Prothrombin time (PT) Activated thromboplastin time (aPTT)&#xD;
      Fibrin split-product level D-dimer level thromboglobulin level (ELISA assay)&#xD;
      Thromboelastography (TEG) using heparinase (to eliminate heparin effect) both with and&#xD;
      without REOPRO (a GPIIb/IIIa platelet inhibitor) to measure the relative contributions of&#xD;
      platelet function and fibrinogen activity to clot formation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performed at the following time-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1 = after induction of anesthesia, prior to CPB T2 = 5 minutes after the initiation of CPB&#xD;
      T3 = at the end of re-warming (end of CPB) T4 = post-bypass (five minutes after protamine&#xD;
      administration) T5 = within 24 hours after surgery (TEG will not be collected at this time)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2 will be tested by quantifying chest-tube drainage and blood product&#xD;
      administration (red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate) over&#xD;
      the first 12 hours after weaning off of CPB.&#xD;
