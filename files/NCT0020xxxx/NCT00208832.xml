  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death in the United States. A common&#xD;
      term for CHD is &quot;blocked arteries.&quot; People with CHD or &quot;blocked arteries&quot; often have high&#xD;
      blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes. They are also more likely to suffer a heart&#xD;
      attack. Many heart attacks could be prevented by taking medicines that control blood&#xD;
      pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. However, only 50%-60% of patients take their medicines&#xD;
      as directed. Patients who don't take their medicines regularly are considered noncompliant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the risk factors for noncompliance is low health literacy. Health literacy is the&#xD;
      ability to obtain, understand, and act on basic health information. Patients with low health&#xD;
      literacy may not understand their illnesses as well, or how to take their medicines properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this project are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to learn more about the relationship between low health literacy and medication&#xD;
           compliance, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to test 2 different strategies designed to help patients take their medicines more&#xD;
           regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CHD were recruited when they arrived for a regular doctor's appointment. We&#xD;
      measured their health literacy skills, asked questions about how they take their medications,&#xD;
      and checked their blood pressure and last cholesterol and diabetes measurements. We then&#xD;
      assigned patients to 1 of 4 intervention groups (intervention ongoing). The first group is&#xD;
      receiving usual care, which includes regular medication instructions printed on the bottle&#xD;
      and no reminders to refill medicines. The second group gets monthly postcards reminding them&#xD;
      to refill their prescriptions. The third group gets a new medication schedule that shows&#xD;
      them, with pictures and figures, how they are supposed to take their medicines each day. The&#xD;
      fourth group receives both the postcards and the new medication schedule. We are following&#xD;
      patients for 1 year to see which intervention has the greatest impact on their medication&#xD;
      compliance, blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes measurements. We will also examine&#xD;
      whether patients' health literacy affects the success of the interventions.&#xD;
