    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, proof of concept trial to&#xD;
      investigate the relationship between dose of esomeprazole magnesium and acid-associated&#xD;
      heartburn symptoms during 4 weeks of treatment. The safety and tolerability of esomeprazole&#xD;
      magnesium in doses up to 40 mg BID will also be assessed.&#xD;
