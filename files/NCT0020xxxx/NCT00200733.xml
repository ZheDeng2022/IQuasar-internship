      Authentic voice is a approach involving the use of first-hand narratives from members of a&#xD;
      target population in order to accomplish public health goals. In the first paper, a&#xD;
      discussion of the potential of using narratives from the target population as 1) a direct&#xD;
      intervention; 2) a form of persuasive communications; and 3) a source of information for&#xD;
      research into various topics. The main premise is that traditional narrative methods can be&#xD;
      adapted to the public health context by providing the narrator with the topic of the&#xD;
      narrative. The second paper examines the patient experience of acupuncture using narrative&#xD;
      drawn from interviews with and letters from acupuncture patients using a content oriented&#xD;
      approach. The third paper examines the importance of meaning shift over the course of&#xD;
      acupuncture treatment and demonstrates the usefulness of patient narratives as a data source&#xD;
      for examining meaning. Findings include the need for intervention studies comparing authentic&#xD;
      voice approaches to existing health communication tools for effectiveness in creating&#xD;
      attitude and behavior change efficiently. Authentic voice approaches also need to be&#xD;
      researched to understand and systematize concepts such as validity in relation to&#xD;
      target-group derived narratives. Effectiveness of authentic voice for advocacy and research&#xD;
      should also be further tested. Concerning acupuncture, the second and third papers show that&#xD;
      acupuncture patients report a variety of benefits far wider than previously reported in the&#xD;
      literature. Study designs should consider this wide range of benefits when assessing&#xD;
      acupuncture outcome. Meaning shift is also reported by acupuncture patients and may play an&#xD;
      important (but non-specific) role in the healing associated with acupuncture.&#xD;
