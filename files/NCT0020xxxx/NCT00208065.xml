  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate histamine, CGRP and VIP levels in saliva&#xD;
      as biological markers for activation of trigeminal and parasympathetic nerve fibers in&#xD;
      various clinical presentations of primary headaches compared to allergic rhinosinusitis and&#xD;
      control populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that many people with self-diagnosed or physician diagnosed &quot;sinus&quot;&#xD;
      headache experience symptoms that fulfill diagnostic criteria for migraine or migrainous&#xD;
      headache. The shared symptomatology does not differentiate these disorders.&quot;Sinus&quot; symptoms&#xD;
      as an early manifestation of migraine may be associated with elevated levels of CGRP&#xD;
      suggesting peripheral trigeminal activation whereas &quot;sinus&quot; symptoms late in migraine may&#xD;
      have associated elevations of VIP suggesting parasymptathetic activation. Subjects without&#xD;
      autonomic or &quot;sinus&quot; symptoms will not have changes in salivatory histamine, CGRP or VIP and&#xD;
      will have values similar to controls. Subjects with rhinosinusitis will have levels or&#xD;
      patterns of salivatory histamine, CGRP and VIP unique from migraine subjects. If &quot;sinus&#xD;
      symptoms&quot; are associated with parasympathetic activation, then there should be detectable&#xD;
      increases in VIP early in the course of nasal symptom development and, conversely, if these&#xD;
      symptoms associate with trigeminal activation, then increases in CGRP should be detected.&#xD;
      Five groups of 10 subjects each will be recruited. Group A without migraine, with&#xD;
      self-described &quot;sinus&quot; headache or symptoms of rhinosinusitis. Group B with chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis and no history of migraine or &quot;sinus&quot; headache. Group C with &quot;sinus&quot; headache&#xD;
      with symptoms meeting IHS criteria for migraine and symptoms of rhinosinusitis preceding the&#xD;
      onset of headache symptoms meeting migraine criteria. Group D with symptoms of rhinosinusitis&#xD;
      that develop late in the course of migraine after criteria for IHS migraine are met. Group E&#xD;
      with IHS migraine, without sinus symptoms associated with migraine.&#xD;
