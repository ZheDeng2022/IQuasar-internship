  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers want to learn whether ZD1839 can improve the activity of tamoxifen, a drug&#xD;
      that participants will receive for the treatment of the type of breast cancer being studied.&#xD;
      Tamoxifen medicine is part of the standard treatment for the type of breast cancer being&#xD;
      studied. It is approved for the treatment of this problem. In order to help the researchers&#xD;
      understand how the cancer responds to these medicines, the researchers will take a small&#xD;
      tissue sample (biopsy) of the breast cancer before beginning treatment and after two weeks of&#xD;
      treatment, at 6 weeks and when surgery is done as part of treatment for the cancer. If&#xD;
      participants do not respond to treatment, another biopsy will be done to see why the&#xD;
      participants did not respond. These samples will also be collected to look at different&#xD;
      characteristics of the cancer. The researchers cannot and do not guarantee that participants&#xD;
      will benefit if they take part in this study&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed or over-expressed in many human solid&#xD;
      tumors and plays an important role in progression to invasion and metastases. The EGFR&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase is activated by binding of a variety of ligands to the external domain.&#xD;
      Autophosphorylation by the EGFR tyrosine kinase initiates a signaling cascade that feeds&#xD;
      downstream cell cycle control machinery regulating cell proliferation, and these reactions&#xD;
      are a major component in growth factor-induced proliferation of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Erb-B (HER) receptor family consists of four transmembrane tyrosine kinases:&#xD;
      Erb-B1-epithermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, HER1), Erb-B2/neu (HER2), Erb-B3 (HER3), and&#xD;
      Erb-B4 (HER4). The ectodomain of Erb-B1, Erb-B3, and Erb-B4 interacts with a specific set of&#xD;
      ligand, whereas no ligand has been identified thus far for the Erb-B2 receptor. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      Erb-B2 can be activated by any of the other ligand-activated Erb-B coreceptors. Upon ligand&#xD;
      binding to the active domain of Erb-B1, Erb-B3, or Erb-B4, these receptors preferentially&#xD;
      recruit Erb-B2 into a heterodimeric complex in which the Erb-B2 kinase can modulate receptor&#xD;
      internalization and prolong signal transduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are now emerging that Erb-B2 modulates cellular p27 and cyclin D1 protein levels through&#xD;
      both Ras/MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt signaling. Reversible interruption of Erb-B2 function by&#xD;
      trastuzumab (Herceptin) has been shown to inhibit MAPk and reduce MAPk-mediated transcription&#xD;
      through cyclin D1. In addition, the signaling molecule Akt is important in the cell survival&#xD;
      pathway. Akt inhibits apoptosis and is present in the PI3 kinase pathway, which is activated&#xD;
      by the EGF family and the IGF family. Several biologic arguments support the use of EGR&#xD;
      inhibitors to block HER2 signaling. In HER2-overexpressing cell lines, the HER2 receptor is&#xD;
      constitutively phosphorylated. This suggests that HER2 may be transactivated through&#xD;
      ligand-stimulated EGFR, also present in tumor cells. In addition, overexpression of HER2&#xD;
      enhances the binding of EGFR ligands to the receptor and potentiates EGFR signaling. HER2&#xD;
      inactivation has been shown to impair EGFR- mediated transformation, and conversely EGFR&#xD;
      blocking antibodies can augment the growth inhibitory effect of antiHER2 antibodies in cells&#xD;
      with high levels of HER2. Taken together, these data suggest that EGFR/HER2 crosstalk is&#xD;
      present in a subset of human tumors and that interruption of EGFR may reduce HER2 signaling.&#xD;
      Cell cycle progression is regulated predominantly by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which&#xD;
      in turn are controlled by a family of CDK inhibitory proteins that include P27KIP1 and&#xD;
      P21CIP1-WAF1. Pathways involving CDK inhibitors are commonly destructive in cancer cells.&#xD;
      ZD1839 is an orally active, selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal&#xD;
      transduction pathways implicated in cancer cell proliferation, survival, and other&#xD;
      host-dependent processes promoting cancer growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preclinical studies, ZD1839 causes tumor growth delay in a range of cancer cell lines and&#xD;
      xenografts, and tumor regression has been observed at higher doses. ZD1839 was also shown to&#xD;
      inhibit proliferation in DCIS together with significantly increased apoptosis in these&#xD;
      tissues. Data from these different cell lines and xenografts suggest that ZD1839 may act via&#xD;
      dose-dependent growth inhibition and by increasing apoptosis, and may even potentiate the&#xD;
      activity of cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one phase II multicenter study, 63 women with metastatic breast cancer who could have had&#xD;
      any number of previous chemotherapy or hormonal regimens were treated with an oral daily dose&#xD;
      of 500 mg of ZD1839 until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent. Dosage reduction to 250 mg daily was allowed for toxicity. The primary end point was&#xD;
      clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response [modified ICC/WHO criteria] +&#xD;
      stable disease) at 6 months. There was 1 partial response and 2 patients with stable disease&#xD;
      for more than 4 months (4 months in 1 patient and 7+ months in the other), for a total of&#xD;
      4.8% clinical benefit. An additional 4 patients had stable disease lasting 1 to 2 months, and&#xD;
      another 2 patients had stable disease lasting 1 month, resulting in an overall 14.3% partial&#xD;
      response or stable disease in this heavily pre-treated population; 15% were on treatment for&#xD;
      4 to 8+ months, and 2 patients stayed on treatment, despite progression, because of&#xD;
      significant bone pain palliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary efficacy and toxicity data from another phase II trial of 22 ER-positive or&#xD;
      ER-negative patients were reported at the same conference. In that study, patients could have&#xD;
      had 1 previous chemotherapy regimen or were experiencing disease progression while on&#xD;
      tamoxifen and were given 500 mg of ZD1839 daily. Two patients had a partial response and 10&#xD;
      had stable disease at 4 weeks. In both trials the toxicity profile was identical to that seen&#xD;
      in patient with NSCLC.&#xD;
