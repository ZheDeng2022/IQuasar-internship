  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients living with advanced chronic diseases (ACD), such as congestive heart failure (CHF)&#xD;
      and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) present substantial care and economic challenges&#xD;
      for the health care system due to frequent emergency room visits and acute care&#xD;
      hospitalizations. Morbidity and mortality is high in these complex populations, and patient&#xD;
      quality of life is often compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care of patients with ACD occurs across health care sectors, by providers in the acute,&#xD;
      primary and community settings. Despite recent efforts to enhance the care of patients with&#xD;
      ACD, through multidisciplinary disease management programs, variations and gaps exist along&#xD;
      the continuum of care. The available evidence suggests that there are opportunities to&#xD;
      optimize the primary care of patients with ACD. We are proposing to build upon the current&#xD;
      evidence and guidelines for disease management programs, our existing specialized resources,&#xD;
      our existing primary care practices, and develop and test a model of care that is primary&#xD;
      care based, sensitive to the unique demands and characteristics of different primary&#xD;
      practices. Our goal is to design linkages and care strategies of relevance and importance to&#xD;
      the primary care providers who care for patients with advanced COPD and CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This demonstration project is a randomized controlled clinical trial of the RoadMAP program&#xD;
      (intervention) delivered by a Primary Care Nurse Specialist (PCNS) compared to usual care&#xD;
      (control group). The primary outcomes will be degree of adherence to clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines. Secondary outcomes will be patient satisfaction, quality of life, use of&#xD;
      community-based services, number of emergency room visits, and number of hospitalizations.&#xD;

      The available evidence suggests that there are opportunities to optimize the primary care of&#xD;
      patients with ACD. We are proposing to build upon the current evidence and guidelines for&#xD;
      disease management programs, our existing specialized resources, our existing primary care&#xD;
      practices, and develop and test a model of care that is primary care based, sensitive to the&#xD;
      unique demands and characteristics of different primary practices. Our goal is to design&#xD;
      linkage and care strategies of relevance and importance to the primary care providers who&#xD;
      care for patients with advanced COPD and CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized controlled clinical trial of the RoadMAP program (intervention)&#xD;
      delivered by a PCNS compared to usual care (control group). The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      degree of adherence to clinical practice guidelines. Secondary outcomes will be patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, quality of life, use of community-based services, number of emergency room&#xD;
      visits, and number of hospitalizations. The purpose of the RoadMAP program is to improve the&#xD;
      care of people with advanced stage COPD and CHF. Specifically, activities will be aimed at&#xD;
      improving patients' self care ability, facilitating access to the most appropriate services,&#xD;
      ensuring medical treatment according to consensus guidelines and promoting consistency of&#xD;
      health care communication. Adherence to guidelines is a process that involves activities by&#xD;
      the patient, PCNS, and the Primary Care Physician. The PCNS would follow-up the patient again&#xD;
      at approximately one month after initial contact and then every 3 months, to assess and&#xD;
      monitor adherence to the proposed MAP by the patient, the physician, and the nurse. Patients&#xD;
      will have the option of returning to the physician office or to be monitored by phone. An&#xD;
      office visit will be recommended if there is a perceived need for medical assessment and&#xD;
      intervention. The family physician would continue to see the patient as required in order to&#xD;
      carry out the medical portion of the MAP and to deal with other primary care problems as&#xD;
      needed. Additionally, the PCNS would be available to work with nurses and other health&#xD;
      professionals in each primary care practice in the provision of care to the ACD patients.&#xD;
