      Pacemakers can be attached to one or more than one of the heart chambers. After watching&#xD;
      pacemakers work over time, doctors have found that the pacemakers that stimulate only one&#xD;
      chamber of the heart sometimes lead to problems later. These problems may be changes in the&#xD;
      size and shape of the heart. The heart cannot work as well when some of these changes happen.&#xD;
      We need to learn more about these changes and how to prevent them. There has not been an easy&#xD;
      way to do this. A new treatment called Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is associated&#xD;
      with biventricular pacing where two chambers of the heart are stimulated simultaneously.&#xD;
      Tissue Doppler Imaging,Tissue Synchronization Imaging and 3 dimensional echocardiography are&#xD;
      new forms of technology that look at the heart while it works. They are similar to a moving&#xD;
      x-ray that can watch the heart muscles moving. The movement can be measured. Doctors will&#xD;
      check for changes that happen over time. This has not been studied in children before because&#xD;
      this kind of is new to this group of patients. This technology is noninvasive which means it&#xD;
      can be done from the outside of the body and is painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hearts of children grow fast. It is important to be able to know if the pacemaker or&#xD;
      problems from dilated cardiomyopathy are causing any changes in the heart that might cause&#xD;
      problems. We expect to be able to use information we learn from this study to improve how we&#xD;
      use pacemakers in the future to avoid problems that can happen over time.&#xD;

      Hypothesis H1: Children with DCM. Ventricular dyssynchrony is seen in a majority (over 50%)&#xD;
      of pediatric patients with DCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim, SA 1: To describe changes in right and left ventricular function using Tissue&#xD;
      Synchronization Imaging (TSI),Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI), 3D echocardiography and&#xD;
      conventional echocardiogram parameters in children with dilated cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis H2: In the pediatric population, clinical signs and symptoms related to dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy are improved with the use of biventricular pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim, SA 2: To quantitate the effects of biventricular pacing therapy on ventricular&#xD;
      function in children with dilated cardiomyopathy using Tissue Synchronization Imaging&#xD;
      (TSI),Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI, 3D echocardiography and conventional echocardiographic&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population will include children (newborn to 18 years of age) treated for dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (Egleston Campus). Patients receiving&#xD;
      pacemaker therapy and medicinal therapy for DCM will be included. For the purpose of this&#xD;
      study, dilated cardiomyopathy is defined as an ejection fraction (EF) of &lt;35% with left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) dimensions greater that 95% for age. Only patients with normal heart anatomy&#xD;
      and those with repaired congenital defects that have 4 chambers will be evaluated. Heart&#xD;
      transplant patients and patients who cannot travel to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at&#xD;
      Egleston for follow-up are excluded from this study. Two distinct patient groups will be&#xD;
      examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Patients with the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. We will divide these patients&#xD;
      into two subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: New onset DCM patients (defined as patients who have been diagnosed with DCM within the&#xD;
      past 90 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: Established DCM patients (defined as patients who have been diagnosed with DCM for more&#xD;
      than 90 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Paced Patients: Patients with a secondary diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy due to&#xD;
      chronic RV pacing who are being evaluated for Biventricular pacemaker implantation. This&#xD;
      group will also include patients with DCM who have received biventricular pacemakers within&#xD;
      the last two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be a single center, prospective, pilot evaluation of the ventricular&#xD;
      effects of DCM and the effect of Biventricular pacing for the treatment of DCM in pediatric&#xD;
      patients. All patients will be enrolled following referral 1) for implantation of a&#xD;
      biventricular pacemaker for the treatment of cardiomyopathy or 2) for a research&#xD;
      echocardiogram due to the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy without pacemaker therapy.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria will be those children with dilated cardiomyopathy or children referred&#xD;
      for biventricular pacemaker implantation or upgrade with the diagnosis of dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. All participants will be required to sign an informed consent prior to any&#xD;
      procedures. We anticipate enrolling 50 patients between March 1, 2005 and February 28, 2006&#xD;
      for this study: 25 patients in Group 1 and 25 patients in Group 2. This will give us a&#xD;
      confidence level of 95% with a confidence interval of 4-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic assessment Standard 2-dimensional, M-mode, and Doppler evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed. We will assess cardiac function using left ventricular shortening (SF) and&#xD;
      ejection fractions (EF measured by Simpson's Rule). We will also perform tissue&#xD;
      synchronization imaging (TSI), tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), and 3D echocardiography using&#xD;
      the GE Vivid 7 and HP echocardiographic systems. These systems will assist investigators in&#xD;
      determining ventricular function and synchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all, study participants will receive echocardiographic assessment at the following time&#xD;
      points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (new onset and established DCM patients without pacemakers):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Outpatient with the diagnosis of DCM (no pacemaker)-one echo will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline/enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Inpatient with the diagnosis of DCM (no pacemaker)-one echo will be performed within 24&#xD;
      hours of admission to the hospital, 14 days after admission or at discharge from the hospital&#xD;
      (whichever comes first), and 3 months 2 weeks after discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (DCM patients with pacemakers): One echo will be performed at baseline prior to&#xD;
      biventricular pacemaker implantation, 14 days after admission or at discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital (whichever comes first) following biventricular pacemaker implantation, 2 weeks, 1&#xD;
      month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months 2 weeks after biventricular pacemaker&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-observer variability for each echocardiographic assessment (methods and data analysis)&#xD;
      will be performed by Drs. Derek Fyfe and Tracy Froehlich in Non-invasive Cardiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment Clinical evaluation, including the collection of concomitant medication&#xD;
      administration, number of hospitalizations for heart failure and adverse events will be&#xD;
      performed at each visit. An electrocardiogram (EKG) will be performed at all study visits to&#xD;
      assess QRS duration. Heart failure functional class will also be collected at every visit&#xD;
      using the Ross or NYHA classification.&#xD;
