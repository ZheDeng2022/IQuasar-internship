      The objective of this study is to determine the differential effect of intervention delivery&#xD;
      channel (phone versus print versus wait list control) on physical activity adoption and&#xD;
      maintenance in previously sedentary adults. Both delivery channels have been found to be&#xD;
      effective, but telephone-based interventions require more commitment on the part of the&#xD;
      subjects and are more labor intensive than print-based interventions. Thus, we will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial comparing three groups: 1) telephone-based&#xD;
      motivationally-tailored individualized feedback; 2) print-based, motivationally-tailored&#xD;
      individualized feedback; 3) minimal contact waiting list control condition (receive&#xD;
      intervention after 12 months as controls). Two hundred and twenty-eight healthy, sedentary&#xD;
      women and men ages 18-65 will be randomly assigned to one of the two interventions or the&#xD;
      waiting-list control condition. Our primary hypothesis is that individuals randomized to&#xD;
      either phone or print conditions will exhibit significantly higher levels of physical&#xD;
      activity participation at 6 and 12 months than individuals in the waiting list control&#xD;
      condition. And, in addition, that subjects randomized to the telephone condition will exhibit&#xD;
      significantly higher levels of physical activity participation at 6 and 12 months than those&#xD;
      in the print condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As many as 60% of Americans do not engage in regular physical activity and 25% are completely&#xD;
      inactive. The risk of cardiovascular disease is almost doubled among people who are&#xD;
      physically inactive, comparable to the risks associated with increased systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, cigarette smoking, and elevated serum cholesterol. To make an impact on physical&#xD;
      activity prevalence at the population level requires a research focus at the interface&#xD;
      between clinical efficacy trials and large-scale dissemination studies. Studies at this&#xD;
      interface must use proven interventions that are simultaneously effective and cost-efficient.&#xD;
      Such interventions are the focus of this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the differential effect of intervention delivery&#xD;
      channel (phone versus print versus wait list control) on physical activity adoption and&#xD;
      maintenance in previously sedentary adults. Both delivery channels have been found to be&#xD;
      effective, but telephone-based interventions require more commitment on the part of the&#xD;
      subjects and are more labor intensive than print-based interventions. Thus, we will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial comparing three groups: 1) telephone-based&#xD;
      motivationally-tailored individualized feedback; 2) print-based, motivationally-tailored&#xD;
      individualized feedback; 3) minimal contact waiting list control condition (receive&#xD;
      intervention after 12 months as controls). Two hundred and twenty-eight healthy, sedentary&#xD;
      women and men ages 18-65 will be randomly assigned to one of the two interventions or the&#xD;
      waiting-list control condition. The two intervention arms will be matched with respect to&#xD;
      frequency and content of contact. Data will be collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months using&#xD;
      well-established physical activity and physical performance measures, as well as a&#xD;
      comprehensive set of psychosocial questionnaires. Our primary hypothesis is that individuals&#xD;
      randomized to either phone or print conditions will exhibit significantly higher levels of&#xD;
      physical activity participation at 6 and 12 months than individuals in the waiting list&#xD;
      control condition. And, in addition, that subjects randomized to the telephone condition will&#xD;
      exhibit significantly higher levels of physical activity participation at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      than those in the print condition. Additional questions of interest include evaluation of the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the two intervention delivery approaches, each in relation to each&#xD;
      other and to the wait list control group and examination of potential moderators and&#xD;
      mediators of the intervention-physical activity relationship. This study will contribute&#xD;
      important information regarding the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two&#xD;
      interventions, each of which can be utilized for widespread public health dissemination.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals between the ages of 18 to 65 years were recruited for this study. Criteria for&#xD;
        study participation were that individuals were healthy and under-active (i.e.,&#xD;
        participating in moderate or vigorous physical activity for 90 minutes or less per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals were excluded from the study if their body mass index (BMI) was greater than 35&#xD;
        or if they had hypertension, heart disease of any kind or an abnormal electrocardiogram,&#xD;
        stroke, chronic infectious disease, any musculoskeletal problem which would limit treadmill&#xD;
        testing or impair their ability to exercise, asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or any&#xD;
        other serious medical condition that might make exercise unsafe or unwise. Other exclusion&#xD;
        criteria were a schedule that would make adherence unlikely (such as very frequent travel),&#xD;
        plans to move from the area within the next year, pregnancy or plans to attempt pregnancy,&#xD;
        self-report of more than three alcoholic drinks per day on 5 or more days per week,&#xD;
        hospitalization for a psychiatric disorder within the last 6 months, currently suicidal,&#xD;
        bipolar, or psychotic, or currently using prescription medication that might impair&#xD;
        exercise performance or tolerance, specifically beta blockers. Participants agreed to be&#xD;
        randomly assigned to any of the conditions and read and signed an institutionally approved&#xD;
        consent form after all their questions were answered.&#xD;
