  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known successful HIV therapy depends on the patients' ability to take their medicine&#xD;
      regularly. This study is designed to find out if an intervention designed to help patients&#xD;
      remember to take their medication is effective. The intervention consists of a wristwatch&#xD;
      that has an alarm to remind patients when to take their medication, a pillbox and three&#xD;
      monthly phone calls by a physician. All these experimental measures are meant to improve the&#xD;
      ability of patients to take their medicines.&#xD;

      --Background--&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of HIV has changed dramatically since the introduction of highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAART consists of a drug regimen that targets the virus at&#xD;
      various points in its life cycle and is thus more effective than monotherapy. The drugs that&#xD;
      comprise this regimen usually belong to different classes of antiretrovirals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAART regimens can be complex and difficult to tolerate. They usually consist of multiple&#xD;
      pills that have to be taken two to three times a day and may also need to be taken with food,&#xD;
      on an empty stomach or with plenty of fluids (depending on the particular drug). In addition,&#xD;
      they have multiple side effects that may limit the patient's willingness to take them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherance to HAART is of paramount importance. Paterson et al showed that patients should&#xD;
      take 95% of their prescribed doses in order to achieve a high likelihood of success and&#xD;
      maintaining an undetectable viral load. Poor adherence can lead to serious consequences&#xD;
      including failure to prevent viral replication, shortened survival and development of viral&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various methods have been used to measure adherence to HAART. All these methods have their&#xD;
      limitations and no gold standard exists with which they can be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The easiest methods employ questionnaires, interviews or written documentation (ie diaries).&#xD;
      These can be supplemented by a pill identification test. This test asks the patients to&#xD;
      examine a board displaying two similar pills for each antiretroviral drug and to identify&#xD;
      which they have been taking. Correct scores on the test have been shown to correlate with&#xD;
      adherence. The accuracy of self reported adherence depends on the patient's ability to recall&#xD;
      and accurately report this behavior. Since patients may have difficulty in recalling their&#xD;
      adherence over longer periods of time, one commonly used measure relies on self-report over&#xD;
      each of the past 4 days. All methods of self-report overestimate the level of adherence&#xD;
      compared with treatment adherence measures. Patients' wish to please their health care&#xD;
      provider may be partially responsible for this. Patients who admit being non-adherent by&#xD;
      self-report also have poor adherence on other measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of healthcare professionals to predict adherence to HAART is poor. In one study,&#xD;
      the physicians and nurses were wrong 41% of the time when asked which patients were &gt;80%&#xD;
      adherent with HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other methods to monitor adherence are pill counts, pharmacy records, electronic monitoring&#xD;
      devices, such as Medication Events Monitoring System (MEMS) and serum drug levels. All these&#xD;
      methods have their particular shortcomings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pill counts are time consuming. Patients may remove pills from their bottles without taking&#xD;
      them (&quot;pill dumping&quot;), mix pills or forget their medications when coming to clinic. Pill&#xD;
      counts, announced or unannounced may also be viewed as intrusive by many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacy-based measures assume that patients use the same pharmacy or the same payer source&#xD;
      to refill their medications. Thus if prescriptions are not refilled on time it indicates&#xD;
      non-adherence. Limitations include that patients may get free medication samples from their&#xD;
      physicians and that even if the prescriptions are filled on time, it does not mean that the&#xD;
      patient took the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic devices are expensive and have been used in the context of research. MEMS cap was&#xD;
      such a device which registered every time the bottle cap was removed. Patients may remove&#xD;
      more than one dose at a time, open the cap and not take the medication or engage in &quot;pill&#xD;
      dumping&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum drug levels have been used recently in research settings. It is expensive and only&#xD;
      reflects the level of the drug after the most recent dose of the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study being conducted currently at the University of Chicago Hospitals is using Q&#xD;
      methodology to study factors that influence adherence to HAART. Preliminary results of this&#xD;
      study show that patients can be subdivided into five categories based upon responses to&#xD;
      questions regarding their experience with HAART, the health system and living life with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempting to predict an individual patient's potential adherence to HAART is extremely&#xD;
      difficult. Studies have shown conflicting results and are hard to interpret. Factors that are&#xD;
      consistently shown to be associated with poor adherence are lower level of education,&#xD;
      depression, active drug/alcohol use and younger age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care professionals have been trying to improve adherence to HAART since its inception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newer antiretrovirals are simpler to take, have longer half-lives and combine two or&#xD;
      three medicines in one pill. A study by Stone et al showed that poor adherence was associated&#xD;
      with medications which needed to be taken on an empty stomach or had to be taken three or&#xD;
      more times a day. Campo and colleagues found that the higher the number of antiretroviral&#xD;
      medications in the regimen, the less likely it is that patients would be adherent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions to improve adherence are difficult to evaluate. This is due to the complex&#xD;
      nature of measurement of adherence itself, and then after the intervention, the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention on adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pill boxes, charts of medications with photographs, electronic reminders, pharmacy support&#xD;
      have all been studied. It has been shown that most interventions are useful short term but&#xD;
      their effect is not durable. Thus reinforcement of the intervention is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      --Materials and Methods--&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study if adherance to HAART is improved with an electronic reminder device (watch&#xD;
      with an alarm), a pill box and phone calls made by a health care professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 200 HIV infected adults will be asked to participate in the study. For inclusion in the&#xD;
      study, patients must be at least 18 years of age or older and able to give consent. They must&#xD;
      have been on HAART for six weeks. Also patients included in the study must provide the&#xD;
      research staff with a working telephone number, where they can be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to the intervention or the control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have their HIV viral loads noted at the beginning of the study. This will&#xD;
      not incur any additional cost to the patient as HIV viral loads are measured as a standard of&#xD;
      care in patients who are on HAART at regular intervals. This measurement reflects the&#xD;
      efficacy of HAART and HIV viral loads that are high may reflect poor adherance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be administered a questionnaire on enrollment. This questionnaire will&#xD;
      consist of three parts. The first part will address the demographics of the patients. The&#xD;
      second will be a pill identification test. The patients will be asked to recognize the agents&#xD;
      that they are taking as part of their HAART regimen from a chart that has photographs of all&#xD;
      antiretroviral medications. The third part will be a Q sort questionnaire where the patients&#xD;
      will be asked to rank statements regarding their experience with HAART, the healthcare&#xD;
      system, living life with HIV etc. This is the same format that is currently being used in the&#xD;
      ongoing study at the University of Chicago Hospitals which studies subjective attitudes and&#xD;
      adherance to HAART in HIV infected adults. That study has enrolled ~90 subjects. Data from&#xD;
      the ongoing study will be used as part of this new study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to provide the research staff with a working telephone number.&#xD;
      Lack of a working telephone number is an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the questionnaire, the patients will be randomized into intervention and control&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will be given a wristwatch with an alarm. The patients in this group&#xD;
      will receive instructions on how to program the watch so that it reminds them to take their&#xD;
      medications. They will be given a pillbox. The pillbox will be able to hold one week's supply&#xD;
      of HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also the intervention group will receive a standardized phone call from a physician not&#xD;
      directly related in their health care once a month for three months. The phone call will not&#xD;
      last more than 15 minutes and will comprise a standard set of questions about their&#xD;
      medications. The responses of the patients will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be observed during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, the HIV viral loads of both groups will be noted again and an&#xD;
      attempt will be made to see if the intervention had any effect on adherance with HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is a difference in adherance between the intervention and the control groups at the&#xD;
      end of the study, we think that this intervention is simple and cost effective. It can be&#xD;
      easily reproduced at other centers that take care of patients with HIV.&#xD;
