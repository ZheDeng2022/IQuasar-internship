  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recommendations for treatment of childhood obesity in a primary care setting have been&#xD;
      developed. These recommendations include beginning treatment with young children, focusing&#xD;
      treatment on the parent so the parent can assist the child in making changes, and changing 2&#xD;
      or 3 very specific eating or activity behaviors (i.e., eat less snacks, rather than eat less&#xD;
      calories). The effectiveness of these recommendations has never been evaluated. This&#xD;
      project's goal is to develop, implement, and evaluate a 6-month childhood obesity&#xD;
      intervention meeting these recommendations. Another goal of the project is to compare two&#xD;
      different approaches, focusing on either decreasing intake of two unhealthy foods or&#xD;
      increasing intake of two healthy foods, for changing eating behaviors during treatment. Two&#xD;
      hundred ten children, between the ages of 4 to 9 years, who are at risk for overweight or&#xD;
      overweight, based upon weight and height standards, will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      treatments: 1) a Newsletter treatment (provided with information on healthy eating only); 2)&#xD;
      a Parent Program that decreases intake of sweet/salty snack foods (&lt; 3 servings/week) and&#xD;
      sweetened drinks (&lt; 3 servings/week); or 3) a Parent Program that increases intake of fruits&#xD;
      and vegetables (5 servings/day) and low-fat dairy products (2 servings/day). Children's&#xD;
      height and weight will be measured at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. This project will determine&#xD;
      if the recommendations for treatment are effective, and if focusing on decreasing intake of&#xD;
      unhealthy foods or increasing intake of healthy foods produces a better long-term weight loss&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age between 4 and 9 years. We propose to use this age group since parents are in&#xD;
             control of the eating and exercise choices of such children, and thus a program that&#xD;
             focuses on parenting behaviors (i.e., positive reinforcement, stimulus control,&#xD;
             parental modeling) should be developmentally appropriate. This age group also meets&#xD;
             the Expert Committee's goal of intervening early5; moreover children aged 4 to 8 years&#xD;
             have similar nutritional needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 85th percentile BMI. Based upon the Expert Committee&#xD;
             recommendations,5 children &gt; 2 years of age who are identified as being at risk for&#xD;
             overweight (85th to 94th percentile BMI) or overweight (&gt; 95th percentile BMI) should&#xD;
             focus on weight maintenance as height continues to increase. These recommendations are&#xD;
             aimed at reducing z-BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Tanner stage 1 (prepubertal) sexual maturation status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Self-report at least one of the following problematic behaviors:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Consume &lt; 2 servings per day of whole fruit (not juice) or &lt; 3 servings per day&#xD;
                  of vegetables.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Consume &gt; 1 serving of sweetened drink per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Consume &lt; 2 servings of low-fat milk per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Consume &gt; 4 times per week of sweet or salty snack foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A parent willing to attend treatment meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Parent and child speak English.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Report a family member participating in another weight loss program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Report that the child or parent planning to attend the treatment meetings has a major&#xD;
             psychiatric disease or organic brain syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Report that the child or parent planning to attend the treatment meetings has dietary&#xD;
             or physical activity restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Intend to move outside of the metropolitan area within the time frame of the&#xD;
             investigation.&#xD;
