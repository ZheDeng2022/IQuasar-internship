  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to study the normal distribution of&#xD;
      the PET ligand (R)-[11C]PK11195. This ligand will be used to study inflammation in the brain&#xD;
      in several brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury.&#xD;

      At the University Hospital Vrije Universiteit the PET ligand PK11195 labeled with carbon-11,&#xD;
      (R)-[11C]PK11195, will be used to study microglia activation in-vivo in patients with&#xD;
      traumatic brain damage, Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis and neuritis optica, disorders&#xD;
      with unknown pathophysiology and treatment difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-1(1-methylpropyl)-3 isoquinolinecarboxamide) is a&#xD;
      highly specific ligand for the peripheral benzodiazepine-binding site, which is particularly&#xD;
      abundant on cells of the mononuclear macrophage line (Myers et al., 1991). In normal human&#xD;
      brain, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand PK11195 exhibits low to minimal&#xD;
      binding primarily associated with the choroid plexus, ependymal linings and glial cells.&#xD;
      However, following neuronal damage, the cells involved in the ensuing gliosis, microglia,&#xD;
      show a marked increase in expression of these sites (Stephenson et al., 1995;Conway et al.,&#xD;
      1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK11195 labeled with carbon-11 is a PET ligand to peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors&#xD;
      which has already been used in patients with stroke (Ramsay et al., 1992), Rasmussen's&#xD;
      encephalitis (Banati et al., 1999), multiple sclerosis (Banati et al., 1997) and facial nerve&#xD;
      lesions (Myers et al., 1999). However, no tracer kinetic model for quantification has been&#xD;
      fully validated for(R)-[11C]PK11195. In order to use (R)-[11C]PK11195 for PET-imaging of&#xD;
      microglia activation and to use it in the longitudinal monitoring of disease progression,&#xD;
      baseline levels of ligand uptake in a healthy control population are required. This study&#xD;
      aims to measure (R)-[11C]PK11195 uptake in normal brain in different age groups and to&#xD;
      develop methods for quantification of specific binding of (R)-[11C]PK11195. Because&#xD;
      (R)-[11C]PK11195 uptake depends on regional bloodflow, each (R)-[11C]PK11195 scan will be&#xD;
      preceded by a cerebral bloodflow scan with H215O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the distribution of (R)-[11C]PK11195 in normal brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop methods for quantification of specific binding of (R)-[11C]PK11195&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the metabolic profile of (R)-[11C]PK11195 in healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN OF THE STUDY Forty healthy subjects will be recruited, 20 males and 20 females. This&#xD;
      is an open study. The study consists of one PET scan, which will be performed at the&#xD;
      Department of Nuclear Medicine &amp; PET research of the VU University Medical Centre.&#xD;
