    <textblock>
      There is accumulating evidence from various sources that extracts from the milk thistle plant&#xD;
      can be useful in the treatment of a variety of liver ailments as well as other disorders.&#xD;
      This investigation will essentially be composed of two individual normal volunteer studies of&#xD;
      milk thistle. The first study will assess the rate and extent of absorption of components of&#xD;
      a standardized botanical extract obtained from the milk thistle plant. This first study is&#xD;
      termed a bioavailability study. This investigation will take approximately 8 weeks and&#xD;
      involve 10 clinic visits. Secondly, a drug interaction study will be performed. This is an&#xD;
      assessment study of the potential for this botanical extract to interact with other&#xD;
      prescription or over-the-counter medications. This study is also expected to take&#xD;
      approximately 8 weeks but will involve 18 clinic visits. In both studies all subjects will&#xD;
      receive the same milk thistle supplement and no placebo will be administered.&#xD;

      BIOAVAILABILTY STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Clinical Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Informed Consent: Sixteen subjects will be recruited for the clinical protocol. All&#xD;
      protocols, consent forms, and HIPAA forms shall be IRB-approved prior to initiating any study&#xD;
      procedure or recruitment. At a screening/informed consent visit, the study design, purposes&#xD;
      and inclusion/exclusion criteria will be explained to each prospective subject. Written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained prior to commencing any study procedures. After informed&#xD;
      consent is obtained, medical examinations will be performed along with baseline serum&#xD;
      chemistries, complete blood count, electrocardiogram, urinalysis, urine drug screen,&#xD;
      nicotine/cotinine, and urine pregnancy test (females). Subjects will be asked about their&#xD;
      diets including alcohol use and the use of herbal medications/dietary supplements. If a&#xD;
      potential subject has been consuming any herbal or dietary supplements a two-week period of&#xD;
      abstinence from supplement use will be necessary before beginning the study. Additionally,&#xD;
      subjects will refrain from use of honey or propolis-containing products (due to presence of&#xD;
      chrysin and potential assay interference), and artichokes, or artichoke-containing foods that&#xD;
      also contain taxifolin (a constituent found in MT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single- and Multiple-Dose Silymarin Pharmacokinetics: Subjects will arrive at the MUSC GCRC&#xD;
      in the morning where they will remain for approximately 10-hours for each of 4 separate blood&#xD;
      drawing phases of the study. After checking in, and under medical supervision, a modification&#xD;
      of a modified Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS) will be administered and a registered&#xD;
      nurse will place an indwelling venous catheter in each subject's arm to facilitate serial&#xD;
      blood sampling. At 8 AM after urinary void and collection of an aliquot for creatinine&#xD;
      analysis, subjects will take one 175 mg capsule of MT standardized to 80% SM (140 mg of SM).&#xD;
      The rationale for product choice is discussed below. Subjects will be in a fasted state for 4&#xD;
      hours following MT administration to reduce any effect of food on absorption. A total of 12&#xD;
      blood samples (10 ml each) will be taken over the next 24-hour period. All samples will be&#xD;
      drawn in heparinized tubes and stored on ice until centrifugation at 4°C. As flavonoids are&#xD;
      notorious for their instability in biological matrices, no sample will remain on ice for&#xD;
      longer than 15 minutes prior to centrifugation. Time points of blood collection will be&#xD;
      immediately prior to the dose of MT (0 time point), and at 0.5 hours, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0,&#xD;
      4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12, and 24 hours. A second TESS will be administered to the subjects 2 hours&#xD;
      post-dosing, at a time generally expected to represent silybin Cmax. Subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to return for 4 brief visits for collection of single blood samples through a separate&#xD;
      venipuncture at time points of 24, 36, and 48 hours. This extended sampling will provide&#xD;
      adequate PK data to determine Cmax, AUC, terminal t1/2, and Clo of SM flavonoids. Standard&#xD;
      meals will be served by the registered dietician at the GCRC and will not include any other&#xD;
      sources of flavonoids. The composition and amount of food eaten throughout the day will be&#xD;
      recorded. Plasma will be acidified with 10 ml of 1M acetic acid/ml plasma and frozen&#xD;
      immediately at -70°C. This single dose assessment of silymarin pharmacokinetics will be&#xD;
      conducted at three dosage levels of MT supplement in an attempt to span the usual therapeutic&#xD;
      range of MT and will be performed on three distinct occasions separated by no less than a&#xD;
      7-day wash-out period. The doses of MT used will be 175 mg, 350 mg and 525 mg administered&#xD;
      orally with 200 mL of water as one, two, and three capsules, respectively. Again, these doses&#xD;
      as well as product could be changed if a more standardized supplement is made available&#xD;
      through NIH/NCCAM or some other source. The highest dose of MT supplement proposed for oral&#xD;
      administration, 525 mg (420 mg SM) does not pose any undue risk to subjects since SM doses of&#xD;
      420 mg to 800 mg has been administered to many patients with hepatic dysfunction in clinical&#xD;
      trials with few side effects reported (NLM, 2000; Saller et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the last single dose assessment and an ensuing 7-day minimum wash-out period,&#xD;
      subjects will initiate treatment of a 28-day treatment exposure to the MT supplement 175 mg&#xD;
      (140 mg SM) at the generally recommended and clinically studied dosage of one capsule thrice&#xD;
      daily (NLM, 2000). A 28-day course is selected to assure steady-state is reached and to&#xD;
      surpass the duration of any other published pharmacokinetic studies of SM in human subjects&#xD;
      which have generally been of brief duration. In addition, this extended dosing assessment&#xD;
      will allow for the gathering of pilot data on the antioxidant potential of SM via&#xD;
      measurements of urinary isoprostanes. Finally, an assessment of treatment-emergent adverse&#xD;
      effects and tolerability will be made. Subjects will report to the outpatient GCRC on 4&#xD;
      separate occasions to pick up a 7-day supply of SM at which time a TESS will be administered.&#xD;
      At the initial visit to the GCRC to obtain the first week's supply of MT, subjects will&#xD;
      provide a urine sample for baseline measurement of urinary isoprostanes and creatinine. After&#xD;
      28 days of treatment subjects will report to the GCRC for the determination of steady-state&#xD;
      concentrations of SMs in plasma and urine. A blood draw will be performed immediately prior&#xD;
      to dosing with the MT (Ctrough) and 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 and 8.0 following MT dosing.&#xD;
      Based upon available published data, these timepoints should be sufficient to capture the&#xD;
      (Cmax) for all flavonoids of interest despite interindividual variability. Additionally,&#xD;
      subjects will provide a morning urine sample for analysis of urinary isoprostane and&#xD;
      creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up: Subjects will return 7 days following the final blood draw to have a follow-up&#xD;
      serum chemistry and complete blood count (CBC) performed to provide an additional assurance&#xD;
      of subject safety. We will also perform a final assessment of adverse events using the TESS&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DRUG INTERACTION ASSESSMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Clinical Protocol for Drug Interaction Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      An outline of the proposed clinical study to determine the drug interaction potential of&#xD;
      silymarin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing Cytochrome P450 Activity in vivo with Probe Drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probe substrate compounds for the major CYP enzymes are available to assess genetic,&#xD;
      environmental, and ethnic differences in enzyme activity. In the last 2 years our research&#xD;
      group has published 7 full research reports utilizing probe drug methodology in assessing&#xD;
      botanical-drug interactions. These studies were likewise funded by NCCAM, had an excellent&#xD;
      safety record, and were performed within the MUSC GCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probe compounds can be initially administered to subjects in the absence of suspected enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitors or inducers and the parent drug or drug: metabolite ratios measured in plasma and&#xD;
      urine to reflect enzyme activity. This assessment can then be repeated in the presence of a&#xD;
      suspected inhibitor or inducer and comparisons can be made. In this manner, specific enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitory or inductive effects can be elucidated, documented, and generalized to other&#xD;
      similar substrates. In this study, by using the selected probe substrates alprazolam&#xD;
      (CYP3A4), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), tolbutamide ([TOL] CYP2C9) and caffeine (CYP1A2), we&#xD;
      will assess the ability of MT/SM to selectively alter one or more of the major drug&#xD;
      metabolizing enzymes responsible for the metabolism of &gt; 80% of all therapeutically used&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to use these validated and widely accepted methods to evaluate the&#xD;
      drug-interaction potential of a characterized MT supplement. A clinical protocol, using 16&#xD;
      normal volunteers, will evaluate the potential to inhibit or induce CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9,&#xD;
      and the potential to inhibit CYP2D6 (a non-inducible isoform). Test doses of these four safe&#xD;
      probe drugs will be administered at baseline (before treatment with MT) and after a 14-day&#xD;
      treatment period. Changes in the pharmacokinetics of these probe drugs will indicate the&#xD;
      degree of specific enzyme inhibition or induction, respectively. These data will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of combining a standardized MT supplement with other drugs that are&#xD;
      substrates for the CYP enzymes studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Informed Consent: Sixteen subjects will be recruited for the clinical protocol and&#xD;
      replacements will be recruited if necessary for 16 subjects to complete the protocol.&#xD;
      Screening and a separate informed consent process will take place as in the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      study previously described with the following exceptions: Subjects will be genotyped to&#xD;
      determine if they are poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Subjects will also be asked&#xD;
      about adverse events according to a Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale ([TESS] Zhang et al.,&#xD;
      2001) to determine if any symptoms are present prior to administration of the MT supplement.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked about their diets including alcohol use and the use of herbal&#xD;
      medications/dietary supplements. If a potential subject has been consuming any herbal or&#xD;
      dietary supplements a two week period of abstinence from supplement use will be necessary&#xD;
      before beginning the next study phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline CYP profile: Subjects will return to the GCRC at a specified time in the morning&#xD;
      prior to probe drug administration. In the morning, an indwelling venous catheter will be&#xD;
      placed in each subject's arm to facilitate serial blood sampling. At 8AM, after urinary void,&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to take simultaneous single oral doses of 2 mg ALPZ, 100 mg CAF, 100&#xD;
      mg TOL, and 30 mg DM. At this time, a urine collection will commence for the first eight&#xD;
      hours of the visit. A total of 11 blood samples (10 ml each) will be taken over a 12-hour&#xD;
      period. Time points of blood collection will be immediately before drug administration, and&#xD;
      at 0.5 hours, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 12 hours. Additionally, the subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to return for 4 more brief visits for collection of single blood samples&#xD;
      through a separate venipuncture at time points of 24, 36, and 48 hours. This extended&#xD;
      sampling will provide adequate pharmacokinetic data to determine Cmax, AUC, terminal t1/2,&#xD;
      and Clo of all probe drugs. To reduce any potential variability in drug absorption due to&#xD;
      food, the subjects will be in a fasted state for 4 hours following probe drug administration.&#xD;
      Standard meals will be served by the registered dietician at the GCRC and will not include&#xD;
      grapefruit, artichoke products, or CAF. The composition and amount of food eaten throughout&#xD;
      the day will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MT Treatment Period: Subjects will commence treatment with the MT supplement 175 mg (140 mg&#xD;
      SM) one capsule three times daily (8AM, 12 noon, 8PM) for a period of 14 days. Subjects will&#xD;
      be supplied with pre-loaded medication organizers containing the daily doses of MT to promote&#xD;
      compliance with the regimen. Subjects will be asked to return to the study site for 4&#xD;
      pre-scheduled appointments during this time for capsule counts, to discuss compliance with&#xD;
      dietary restrictions, and for monitoring of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-MT CYP profile: Subjects will return to the GCRC for this phase of the study. Subjects&#xD;
      will check in the morning prior to a repeat dosing of probe medications. The profiling of&#xD;
      CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 will be performed exactly as described for the baseline phase with&#xD;
      the exception that for the first 24 hours subjects will continue their previous schedules of&#xD;
      dosing with the MT supplement. The doses of probe drugs will coincide with the 8AM dose of MT&#xD;
      so that they will be taken concomitantly. Blood and urine sampling times will be identical.&#xD;
      As in the baseline phase, subjects will be in a fasted state for 4 hours following probe drug&#xD;
      administration. Additionally, subjects will be served identical meals at the same timepoints&#xD;
      as in the baseline phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up: Subjects will return 7 days following the final blood draw to have a follow-up&#xD;
      serum chemistry and complete blood count (CBC) performed to provide an additional assurance&#xD;
      of subject safety. We will also perform a final assessment of adverse events using the TESS&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probe Drugs: Alprazolam (ALPZ), dextromethorphan (DM), tolbutamide (TOL) and caffeine (CAF)&#xD;
