  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Correction of anaemia in renal transplant recipients by parenteral application of recombinant&#xD;
      erythropoietin and if necessary iron will improve large artery function (endothelial function&#xD;
      and elasticity), as assessed by ultrasound techniques and applanation tonometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes in large artery function will be reflected by changes in serological markers of&#xD;
      endothelial function and oxidative stress and by changes in monocyte function and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are gender differences in the responses of vascular function to correction of anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides improvement of large artery function, correction of anemia will also affect&#xD;
      parameters of graft function, i.e. glomerular and tubular proteinuria.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The value of anaemia therapy with recombinant erythropoietin and iron for improvement of&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcome has been clearly demonstrated in dialysis patients and is standard of&#xD;
      care. In this patient collective one study shows that correction of anaemia together with&#xD;
      blood pressure control does improve large artery function. After kidney transplantation, the&#xD;
      situation is not clear. Anemia is common in kidney transplant patients despite a functioning&#xD;
      graft and is caused by inadequate erythropoietin production, inflammatory reactions and toxic&#xD;
      bone marrow depression. Current guidelines suggest to correct anemia also in kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients in analogy to hemodialysis patients, however, there is to date no&#xD;
      evidence that correction of mild to moderate anemia will improve cardiovascular outcome.&#xD;
      Since cardiovascular outcome studies are difficult to perform in renal transplant patients we&#xD;
      propose to study intermediate endpoints, surrogate parameters of cardiovascular endpoints,&#xD;
      i.e. large artery distensibility and endothelium-dependent brachial artery dilatation. Our&#xD;
      group was able to show that the former is a valid marker of cardiovascular morbidity in renal&#xD;
      transplant patients (1), and a recent report stated the same prognostic value for brachial&#xD;
      artery flow-dependent dilatation in hemodialysis patients. Since the causes of anemia in&#xD;
      renal transplant patients are complex, it is not clear that treatment of at anemia with&#xD;
      recombinant erythropoietin and iron will be beneficial. Erythropoetin treatment is likely to&#xD;
      improve hypoxia and thereby to improve large artery function, but also upregulates&#xD;
      circulating endothelial progenitor cells, already elevated in kidney transplant patients and&#xD;
      a marker of vascular stress, e.g. in patients with vasculitis. Erythropoietin might therefore&#xD;
      be detrimental to endothelial function and as a consequence to vascular elasticity. It may be&#xD;
      argued that in renal transplant patients, vascular damage is profound and irreversible and&#xD;
      therefore vascular function does not respond to pharmacological interventions. However, our&#xD;
      group was able to show that although renal transplant patients have severely impaired large&#xD;
      artery functional wall properties independent of immunosuppressive treatment regimens (2),&#xD;
      they have a preserved large artery vasodilator capacity (3) and that treatment with a statin&#xD;
      produces sustained long-term improvements of endothelial function in kidney transplant&#xD;
      patients (4). Previous studies showed effects of erythropoietin treatment on serological&#xD;
      parameters of endothelial function in hemodialysis patients. It is important to relate&#xD;
      erythropoietin-induced changes in these parameters to changes in large artery function.&#xD;
      Particularly, in the aimed target population immunological processes are very likely to&#xD;
      affect vascular function. It has been shown that endothelial cell proliferation is induced by&#xD;
      angiogenetic factors released by activated monocytes. Besides monocyte adhesion to&#xD;
      endothelial cells is triggered e.g. by endothelial cells themselves when they are exposed to&#xD;
      shear stress(5). During the adhesion process different costimulatory factors become important&#xD;
      in the early and critical atherogenetic event. Monocyte survival and activation do have a key&#xD;
      role in this process leading to arteriosclerosis and endothelial damage(6). Changes in&#xD;
      monocyte survival in dependence of immunosuppression or erythropoietin treatment may be&#xD;
      responsible for increasing circulating endothelial cells(7). Therefore we aim to relate&#xD;
      erythropoietin-induced changes in vascular function to changes in monocyte function and&#xD;
      apoptosis. In many disease states changes in endothelial function are reflected by changes in&#xD;
      urinary protein excretion. Therefore, erythropoietin therapy could alter urinary protein&#xD;
      excretion in parallel to the changes observed in large artery function. Finally, anemia is&#xD;
      more common in female renal transplant recipients than in male renal transplant recipients,&#xD;
      and female dialysis patients tend to require more erythropoietin for anemia treatment that&#xD;
      male patients. Therefore it is conceivable that gender differences exist with respect to the&#xD;
      effects of anemia correction on vascular function.&#xD;
