    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel group, placebo controlled study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ezetimibe added to ongoing atorvastatin&#xD;
      therapy compared with ongoing atorvastatin treatment alone. This study will involve subjects&#xD;
      with primary hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease (CHD) who are currently being&#xD;
      treated with atorvastatin and who would benefit from additional reduction in low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, parallel groups, placebo-study is designed for subjects with&#xD;
      primary hypercholesterolemia [plasma LDL-C concentrations between &gt;= 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL)&#xD;
      to &lt;= 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) and triglyceride concentrations of &lt; 3.99 mmol/L (350 mg/dL) and&#xD;
      coronary heart disease who are currently being treated with atorvastatin 10 mg and would&#xD;
      benefit from additional reduction in LDL-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess whether the daily co-administration of ezetimibe 10 mg to ongoing&#xD;
      treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg will be more effective than treatment with atorvastatin 10&#xD;
      mg alone in further reducing LDL-C concentrations and in achieving LDL-C target goal as&#xD;
      defined by the ESC or National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines at the time of&#xD;
      database lock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of ezetimibe 10 mg added daily to ongoing&#xD;
      treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg versus ezetimibe placebo added daily to ongoing treatment&#xD;
      with atorvastatin 10 mg in reducing the concentration of LDL-C at endpoint after 6 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to compare the efficacy of ezetimibe 10 mg added to ongoing&#xD;
      treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg daily versus ezetimibe placebo added to ongoing treatment&#xD;
      with atorvastatin 10 mg daily after 6 weeks of treatment with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The percentage of subjects who achieve the target LDL-C goal as defined by the ESC or&#xD;
           NCEP guidelines at the time of database lock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL-C and triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and tolerability. Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled into the study to&#xD;
           insure that at least 160 subjects complete the study. Each site will enroll&#xD;
           approximately 20 subjects for a total of approximately 200 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 7 weeks. Each subject will&#xD;
      be scheduled for 3-4 study visits. Visits 1 and 2 are screening visits; these visits may be&#xD;
      combined. At Visit 3, those subjects who meet the enrollment criteria will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of two treatment groups: ezetimibe 10 mg or ezetimibe placebo to be taken with ongoing&#xD;
      open-label atorvastatin 10 mg/day. Randomization will be stratified based on the LDL-C level&#xD;
      at Visit 3: &lt; 3.3 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) or &gt;= 3.3 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). Subjects will be treated&#xD;
      for 6 weeks and then return for a final visit, Visit 4.&#xD;
