    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine procedure based on the measurement&#xD;
      of positron emission from radiolabelled tracer molecules. These radiotracers allow biologic&#xD;
      processes to be measured and whole body images to be obtained which demonstrates sites of&#xD;
      radiotracer accumulation. The most common radiotracer in use today is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      (18F-FDG) which is a radiolabelled sugar (glucose) molecule. Imaging with 18F-FDG PET is used&#xD;
      to determine sites of abnormal glucose metabolism and can be used to characterize and&#xD;
      localize many types of tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer treatment and outcome depend largely on the accurate diagnosis and staging of disease.&#xD;
      There is extensive data in the literature indicating the importance of FDG-PET imaging in&#xD;
      accurately characterizing disease, as well as determining stage and sites of recurrent&#xD;
      disease in many cancer types. For these indications, functional imaging with PET provides&#xD;
      unique information which is not available from standard medical imaging modalities such as&#xD;
      ultrasound, X-ray, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to document the safety and efficacy of 18F-FDG produced by&#xD;
      the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) at its Tri-University Meson Facility (TRIUMF)&#xD;
      production facility and to evaluate FDG-PET as a diagnostic and decision making tool in the&#xD;
      management of oncology patients in British Columbia. With a population base of over 4 million&#xD;
      people, standardized cancer treatment protocols, and evidence based guidelines for FDG-PET&#xD;
      imaging, the BCCA is positioned to make an important contribution to defining the role of PET&#xD;
      in the Canadian health care system.&#xD;

      1.0 Background &amp; Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, diagnostic imaging can address two issues: structure and function. One can either&#xD;
      view structures in the body and image anatomy using structural imaging modalities such as&#xD;
      plain film radiography (X-ray), Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI), or one can view chemical processes and image biochemistry and function using&#xD;
      biochemical imaging modalities such as Planar and Single Photon Emission Computerized&#xD;
      Tomography (SPECT) imaging and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The strength of the&#xD;
      biochemical imaging methods is in distinguishing tissues according to metabolism rather than&#xD;
      structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most commonly used tracer for PET imaging; its use and&#xD;
      safety are well established world wide. The 18F-FDG is injected intravenously and is&#xD;
      transported from blood to tissues in a manner similar to glucose. It has been understood for&#xD;
      over 50 years, that cancer cells, in general, have increased glucose uptake and anaerobic&#xD;
      metabolism compared to normal tissues. Like glucose, FDG is taken up into cells through&#xD;
      glucose transport proteins (GLUT) and then phosphorylated by hexokinase to FDG-6-phosphate.&#xD;
      However, since FDG-6-phosphate is not a substrate for subsequent glucose metabolic pathways&#xD;
      and has a very low membrane permeability, the FDG-6-phosphate becomes trapped in tissue in&#xD;
      proportion to the rate of glycolysis. This accumulation of 18F-FDG-6-phosphate forms the&#xD;
      basis of tumor metabolic imaging with PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Indications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer treatment and outcome depend largely on the accurate diagnosis and staging of disease.&#xD;
      There is extensive data in the literature indicating the importance of PET imaging in&#xD;
      accurately characterizing disease, determining stage and sites of recurrent disease in many&#xD;
      cancer types. For these indications, it is well documented in the literature that functional&#xD;
      imaging with PET exceeds sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of conventional 3-D imaging&#xD;
      modalities. The most widely cited reference for the efficacy of PET imaging is: A Tabulated&#xD;
      Summary of the FDG PET Literature, published by Gambhir et al, JNM (2001) 42: 1S-93S. In this&#xD;
      study the average FDG PET sensitivity and specificity across all oncology applications are&#xD;
      estimated at 84% (based on 18,402 patient studies) and 88% (based on 14,264 patient studies),&#xD;
      respectively. The average management change across all applications is estimated to be 30%&#xD;
      (based on 5,062 patients). Data was obtained combining 419 total articles and abstracts on&#xD;
      studies in which FDG PET was used. Various methods of analysis were applied to these data,&#xD;
      which revealed only a small amount of variation in the ratio values. Specifically, the&#xD;
      sensitivity of PET ranged from 84 - 87%, the specificity ranged from 88% - 93%, and the&#xD;
      accuracy ranged from 87 - 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 18F-FDG for use in&#xD;
      all cancer types. On January 28, 2005 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)&#xD;
      announced that it would reimburse PET imaging studies when performed for almost all&#xD;
      previously non-covered oncology indications. All previous PET coverage remained fully in&#xD;
      effect, and initial staging of cervical cancer was added without conditions but coverage was&#xD;
      expanded conditionally to include all cancers and non-covered indications except breast&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis and regional lymph node staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/mcd/viewncd.asp?ncd_id=220.6.15&amp;ncd_version=1&amp;basket=ncd%3A220%2E6%2E&#xD;
      15%3A1%3APET+%28FDG%29+for+All+Other+Cancer+Indications+Not+Previously+Specified)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indication for performing this diagnostic imaging test is the need for non-invasive,&#xD;
      functional assessment of patients suspected of having or previously diagnosed with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Esophageal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Head &amp; neck cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testicular (Germ Cell) cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thyroid cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of this study are to validate the safety of 18F-FDG produced by BCCA and to&#xD;
      evaluate 18F-FDG PET as a decision making and diagnostic tool in the management of oncology&#xD;
      patients in British Columbia. With a population base of over 4 million people, standardized&#xD;
      cancer treatment protocols, and evidence-based guidelines for PET imaging, the BCCA is&#xD;
      positioned to make an important contribution to defining the role of PET in the Canadian&#xD;
      health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single cohort observational study design in which additional safety data will&#xD;
      be collected from the first patient being scanned from each of the first three batches of&#xD;
      18F-FDG delivered to our clinical site. Data will be collected from referring physicians with&#xD;
      respect to how the PET scan results affected patient management and results of the PET scan&#xD;
      will be correlated with biopsy results when available. All subjects are informed of&#xD;
      anticipated effects (none) and purpose of the injected substance. There is no intent to&#xD;
      change the way this protocol is conducted or to in any way alter the effect or purpose of the&#xD;
      injected tracer. Subjects are approached with respect to their willingness to participate in&#xD;
      the proposed study based on clinical criteria and undergo a brief clinical assessment&#xD;
      followed by scanning as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 Study Time-Frame&#xD;
&#xD;
      The B.C. Cancer Agency anticipates a start date in June 2005 and a potential completion date&#xD;
      in August of 2015, at which time our on-site (Vancouver Cancer Centre) radiopharmacy and&#xD;
      cyclotron will be operational. Ten years of data collection will provide meaningful numbers&#xD;
      for analysis and support of an 18F-FDG New Drug Submission (NDS) to Health Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 Patient Population and Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40,000 patients will be entered into the study. This number is based on the&#xD;
      anticipated number of PET scan referrals based on the criteria for study inclusion outlined&#xD;
      below and our clinical capacity of 15 to 35 patients per day operating 220 days per year.&#xD;
      This will be the only publicly funded PET program in the province of British Columbia. A&#xD;
      sample size of 40,000 patients will allow the PET program in BC to operate until Phase B of&#xD;
      the Functional Imaging Program is implemented and the BCCA is positioned to submit an NDS for&#xD;
      18F-FDG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a response rate of 90% to the patient management survey and a change in patient&#xD;
      management for 30% of the study participants, precision for the 95% confidence interval of&#xD;
      the estimated proportion will be .013. Given the same response rate and change in patient&#xD;
      management proportion, a tumour site with 100 patients will yield a precision of .089 for its&#xD;
      95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sensitivity (or specificity or accuracy) rate of 80% can be estimated for the full sample&#xD;
      with a precision of .011 for its 95% confidence interval, or a precision of .080 for a&#xD;
      sub-sample of 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional safety data will be collected from the first patient imaged from each of the first&#xD;
      three batches of FDG delivered to our clinical site (N=3). The chemical structure of our&#xD;
      product is identical to authentic FDG. We have performed a minimum of five consecutive&#xD;
      18F-FDG productions with all quality control passing and will have done many more in the&#xD;
      course of this CTA review process. The safety record of FDG PET worldwide is undisputable and&#xD;
      we expect the number of adverse events in our study to be zero. In addition to baseline&#xD;
      assessment, these subjects will have their blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate and&#xD;
      temperature monitored every 15 minutes for 2 hours post-procedure. Patients will be&#xD;
      questioned as to their general well-being after the scan. If there are concerns that the&#xD;
      patients' health status has changed during or immediately following the scan, then a&#xD;
      physician will provide a more detailed assessment. Each of these three patients will be&#xD;
      followed up by telephone, usually the day after the scan to help insure there were no delayed&#xD;
      effects. These whole body PET scan images will be reviewed independently by two Nuclear&#xD;
      Medicine physicians to confirm an expected biodistribution of radioactivity. If a subject did&#xD;
      experience a reaction post-injection that could not immediately be attributed to another&#xD;
      condition or exposure, or if the biodistribution of FDG in normal tissue was altered and&#xD;
      could not be explained on clinical grounds (eg. patient on G-CSF), the tracer would be&#xD;
      re-examined and tested for impurities and pyrogens. The safety data collected from these&#xD;
      three patients will verify that the FDG produced by the BCCA is behaving as expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients considered appropriate for participation in this protocol are drawn from a&#xD;
      population made up of the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are between the ages of 19 and 90 years, although exceptions to these numbers&#xD;
           may be made depending on the individual's ability to understand, give assent/consent,&#xD;
           and tolerate the procedure. Health Canada can expect a separate CTA submission from the&#xD;
           BCCA within the next few months for FDG-PET indications in the pediatric oncology&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
