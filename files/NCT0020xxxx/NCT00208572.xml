  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposal will assess the effectiveness of SRI treatment of anxiety following TBI. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that participants will report significantly fewer and less severe anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms after a 12-week course of citalopram than after a 12-week course of placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety occurs commonly after traumatic brain injury and may influence cognitive, behavioral,&#xD;
      and somatic presentations that may interfere with patients' recovery and adaptation to life&#xD;
      after brain injury. TBI involves both diffuse brain injury as well as frequent focal injuries&#xD;
      to frontal and temporal structures, including hippocampus and amygdala, areas that are also&#xD;
      implicated in the neurobiology of anxiety. Although there are anecdotal reports of the&#xD;
      benefits of SRIs in the treatment of anxiety in association with TBI, there are unfortunately&#xD;
      no controlled trials to establish SRI efficacy in patients whose anxiety is considered&#xD;
      secondary to brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized placebo controlled clinical trial design will be used to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of citalopram in patients with anxiety disorder due to a general medical&#xD;
      condition, specifically traumatic brain injury (TBI). Beneficiaries who are between 3 and 24&#xD;
      months post injury and who meet criteria for DSM-IV diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to TBI&#xD;
      will be recruited from the 7 DVBIC VA and Military Medical Centers. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive an increasing dose of citalopram or placebo up to a dose of 40 mg of&#xD;
      citalopram or 4 pills of placebo over a 12-week treatment period. Patients will receive&#xD;
      comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluations at a DVBIC site, including neurology,&#xD;
      neuropsychology and psychiatry interviews and evaluations at baseline, 12 weeks and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will sign informed consent prior to the administration of research tests and&#xD;
      scales. An informational script is read to individuals seen within the protocol timeframe.&#xD;
      This script will provide a necessary standardization for the presentation of the protocol to&#xD;
      potential participants. It also specifies the research coordinator as the individual to&#xD;
      present the protocol, rather than a primary clinical care provider. After the script is read,&#xD;
      the individual will be given the informed consent to review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be eligible to participate/consent to participate in the study until they&#xD;
      reach a Rancho Los Amigos level of 7 or 8. If there is any question as to a patient's&#xD;
      capacity to consent, the neuropsychologist and/or psychiatrist involved in the study will&#xD;
      assess the subject's intellectual and mental faculties prior to consent. Any confusional&#xD;
      state prohibits a subjects from being rated as a 7 or 8. Additionally, in our experience,&#xD;
      most patients are not able to undergo a full evaluation in the Walter Reed DVBIC program&#xD;
      until they reach this level of recovery. Therefore, we anticipate that almost all patients&#xD;
      evaluated in our program will have the capacity to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the volunteer informed consent, the tests and scales will be administered and&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to receive a 12-week course of citalopram or placebo. Female&#xD;
      participants of childbearing potential will be given a serum pregnancy test (up to 1&#xD;
      tablespoon) prior to being randomized to the study medication. If the result of this test is&#xD;
      positive, she will not be allowed to participate in this study. The study physician will&#xD;
      discuss alternative treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive an increasing dose of citalopram or placebo up to a dose of 40 mg of&#xD;
      citalopram or 4 pills of placebo. See Table 2 for dosing schedule. A blood sample (up to 1&#xD;
      tablespoon) drawn after completion of the 12-week treatment period will be used to obtain&#xD;
      citalopram levels as a measure of medication compliance. A two-week taper will follow the&#xD;
      treatment period. Patients will receive comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluations at a&#xD;
      DVBIC site, including neuropsychological and psychiatric interviews and evaluations at&#xD;
      baseline, 12 weeks and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because no randomized, controlled trials exist to suggest that current medical treatment is&#xD;
      effective in these patients, and because a substantial placebo effect is a known reality, the&#xD;
      design of this study (citalopram vs. placebo) is appropriate. Patients are commonly referred&#xD;
      to the DVBIC with mild-moderate mood and anxiety symptoms. We have cared for several&#xD;
      clinically anxious patients who refused medications. We worked with them in a supportive&#xD;
      educational framework, and in some cases, their anxiety remitted. Thus, the best treatment&#xD;
      for these patients is far from established. It is likely that this and other future research&#xD;
      will help clarify which treatments are best for which patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be contacted weekly (in person or by phone) during the medication phase to&#xD;
      assess general condition, current symptoms and compliance. Female participants will also be&#xD;
      asked if there is a possibility that she may be pregnant. If there is a chance, she will be&#xD;
      discontinued from the study medication and asked to return to the clinic for a serum&#xD;
      pregnancy test. If the result of this test is positive, she will be followed by the study&#xD;
      staff for the remainder of the study. If the result of this test is negative, she will be&#xD;
      re-started on the study medication at 1 pill or 10 mg of citalopram or placebo per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be rated for improvement at weeks 3, 6, and 9 for possible dosage adjustment.&#xD;
      The determination of medication adjustment will be made based upon scores on the Clinical&#xD;
      Global Improvement Scale given to the participant at these time points (see Table 2). Dosage&#xD;
      adjustment will be considered if the clinician rates the patient as a score of 3 or higher on&#xD;
      this scale (Minimally Improved to Very Much Worse). However, the CGI Efficacy Index for drug&#xD;
      effect will determine the direction of dosage adjustment. A side effect that is rated as&#xD;
      significantly interfering with patient functioning or outweighing therapeutic effect will&#xD;
      result in one or more of the following courses of action: (1) addition of concomitant&#xD;
      medication, (2) decrease in the study agent dose, (3) discontinuation of the study agent. In&#xD;
      other words, a patient who is scored as 3 or higher on the CGI Global Improvement Scale who&#xD;
      does not have significant side effects on the CGI Efficacy Index will have the study agent&#xD;
      dose increased. Any patient who experiences significant side effects at any time during the&#xD;
      treatment period will be considered for dose decrease, discontinuation or concomitant&#xD;
      medication use. A decision regarding the proper course of action will be dependent on the&#xD;
      severity of the side effect, overall therapeutic effect and patient input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to the study center at the end of the 12-week treatment period for the&#xD;
      follow-up evaluation. After the 12-week evaluations, patients will be tapered off citalopram&#xD;
      or placebo within 2 weeks. Tapering and discontinuation of the study medication or placebo&#xD;
      will be done on a gradual basis (e.g., If the patient is on 30 mg, s/he could take 20 mg for&#xD;
      1 week, 10 mg for one week, then D/C). If, following the 12-week participation in the&#xD;
      treatment protocol and the 1-2 week taper period, subjects have recurrent symptoms that are&#xD;
      distressing to them or believe they need medication to keep their symptoms from recurring&#xD;
      they will be evaluated clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants complete the 12- week treatment period, they will be tapered off the study&#xD;
      agent. After the taper has been completed, they may be treated with any therapy or&#xD;
      pharmacological intervention that their physician feels is clinically indicated. Although we&#xD;
      will be collecting data for one year after participants complete the treatment phase, our&#xD;
      primary outcome measures will be collected at the end of the 12th week of the treatment&#xD;
      period. We will record all concomitant medications used during the study and all medications&#xD;
      being used at the follow-ups for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 12-week treatment period and taper, patients may be offered appropriate&#xD;
      treatment, including citalopram, if medically indicated. All treatment drugs will be&#xD;
      recorded. The blind will not yet be broken, that is, patients will not be able to learn if&#xD;
      they were being treated with placebo or citalopram.&#xD;
