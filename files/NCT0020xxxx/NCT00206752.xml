  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of avoiding opposite side neck&#xD;
      radiation therapy in patients with clearly one side squamous cell cancer of the head and&#xD;
      neck. We aim to assess the reduction in treatment volume (amount of radiation therapy&#xD;
      required), and the resultant xerostomia and mucositis, with the delivery of unilateral neck&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with definitive external beam radiation plus/minus chemotherapy&#xD;
      plus/minus neck dissection in the ipsilateral neck (post radiation). The primary site will be&#xD;
      treated with definitive radiation therapy, or definitive surgery plus post-operative&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Primary endpoints are loco-regional control, as well as quality of life,&#xD;
      xerostomia, mucositis, and neck fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salivary evaluations shall be performed prior to the initiation of radiation therapy, during&#xD;
      the second week of EBRT, and at the completion of radiation. Evaluations will also be&#xD;
      conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months after the completion of EBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral mucositis will be assessed prior to the initiation of EBRT and weekly during EBRT.&#xD;
      Evaluations will also be conducted at 3 and 6 months after the completion of EBRT. Two&#xD;
      standardized mucositis scales will be used: the RTOG scale and the WHO scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response will be evaluated by physical exam and PET/CT. PET/CT scans will be done at&#xD;
      3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and then when clinically indicated during follow-up.&#xD;
