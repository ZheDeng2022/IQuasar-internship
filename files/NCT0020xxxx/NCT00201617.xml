  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 3-year prospective investigation is to examine the short-term and&#xD;
      long-term (1 year)efficacy of the bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) in adults with single&#xD;
      sided deafness&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Limited studies have been done on the BAHA in adults with single sided (sensorineural)&#xD;
      deafness, and these studies have evaluated only short-term efficacy at one month post&#xD;
      implantation. The findings of the limited number of studies to date on the BAHA with single&#xD;
      sided deafness demonstrate that the BAHA improves understanding in noisy or group situations&#xD;
      and understanding conversation when addressed by a speaker on the side of the bad ear and&#xD;
      most users have judged the BAHA to have at least satisfactory benefit. But conflicting&#xD;
      findings have been obtained regarding whether the BAHA improves the ability to locate the&#xD;
      source of a sound. Additionally, no studies have been done to see whether the magnitudes of&#xD;
      the improvements seen at one month post implantation increase over time because of learning&#xD;
      effects or brain plasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will show whether the previously reported BAHA benefits at one month post&#xD;
      BAHA sound processor fitting, related to speech recognition in noise and subjective&#xD;
      satisfaction, persist at one year, and whether learning effects increase the magnitudes of&#xD;
      these benefits from one month to one year post BAHA sound processor fitting. This long-term&#xD;
      investigation also attempts to resolve the conflicting findings pertaining to the BAHA effect&#xD;
      on localization abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with hearing impairment will comprise 20 adults with single sided deafness who&#xD;
      consent to remediation with the BAHA.In order to see how the adults with unilateral hearing&#xD;
      loss will differ from the normal-hearing subjects over time, a control group of 20&#xD;
      normal-hearing individuals also will be evaluated over time, to see how closely the results&#xD;
      of the unilateral deafness group approximate the results of the normal individuals.&#xD;
