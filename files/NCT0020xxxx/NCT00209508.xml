  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to assess whether GPI 1485 has the ability to delay or stop disease&#xD;
      progression and improve symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) that is already&#xD;
      being treated with a dopamine agonist therapy. Whether the drug is working will be assessed&#xD;
      by evaluating clinical endpoints such as UPDRS scores and by evaluating images, obtained by&#xD;
      SPECT scan, of brain activity. Participants in the study will be given either placebo or GPI&#xD;
      1485 treatment. The duration of the study is 2-years and patients are required to complete 12&#xD;
      safety visits and 3 SPECT scans. SPECT scans will be taken before, after 1-year, and after&#xD;
      2-years of treatment with GPI 1485. In completing the SPECT scan, patients will be injected&#xD;
      with a radioactive investigational drug b-CIT and pictures taken using a Single Photon&#xD;
      Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) camera.&#xD;

      In this phase II study, the investigational new drug (not approved by the FDA) GPI 1485 is&#xD;
      being assessed for its ability to delay or stop disease progression and improve symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease (PD). These potential effects of GPI 1485&#xD;
      are based on animal studies in which the drug was shown to both protect nerves from damage&#xD;
      and to regrow damaged nerves. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either GPI 1485 or placebo (inactive pill). GPI 1485 will be supplied as an oral tablet&#xD;
      formulation to participants enrolled in the study. Participants randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      GPI 1485 will be required to take four tablets four times a day by mouth. GPI 1485 matching&#xD;
      placebo will also be supplied as an oral tablet formulation. Participants randomly assigned&#xD;
      to placebo will be required to take four placebo tablets four times a day by mouth. The&#xD;
      duration of this study is 24 months which includes 12 clinical visits at one of 21&#xD;
      participating sites and three imaging visits to Molecular NeuroImaging (MNI) in New Haven&#xD;
      Connecticut. At MNI, participants will be injected with a radioactive investigational drug&#xD;
      b-CIT to obtain images of the activity in the brain with Single Photon Emission Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (SPECT). This will evaluate whether GPI 1485 slows or delays the loss of brain&#xD;
      activity in patients with mild to moderate PD. During this study you will also have other&#xD;
      clinical evaluations including a physical exam, blood work, ECG (tracing of your heart&#xD;
      rhythm), and urinalysis. Tests specific to Parkinson's disease will also be performed&#xD;
      including: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Dyskinesia Rating Scale,&#xD;
      Bilateral finger-tapping test, and Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS). In addition&#xD;
      assessments of your health and mood will be done.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          1. Male and female patients 40 - 80 years of age with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD &lt; 10&#xD;
             years. The diagnosis of idiopathic PD will be based on the medical history, neurologic&#xD;
             examination, current response to anti-PD medication(s), and the presence of at least&#xD;
             two of the following at the time of diagnosis: resting tremor, bradykinesia, or&#xD;
             rigidity.&#xD;
&#xD;

             mg/dL) that may interfere with the protocol-specified safety and efficacy&#xD;
             measurements, present an unacceptable risk to the patient's well-being, or compromise&#xD;
             the patient's ability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
