    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease in infants and children often challenges healthcare providers both&#xD;
      in regards to diagnosis and in the management of these conditions. The field becomes more&#xD;
      complicated as one examines the myriad of defects that present and the complex care that is&#xD;
      required. Over the last 20-25 years, the remarkable advances in the medical and surgical&#xD;
      management of the most complex lesions have decreased neonatal mortality, such that many more&#xD;
      survive the neonatal period. Therefore, new challenges regarding the continued care of this&#xD;
      patient cohort of high-risk infants and children exist. In order to continue the improvement&#xD;
      of treatment(s) offered to these patients, continuous review and analysis of the current&#xD;
      standard of care is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will collect information related to the current surgical and&#xD;
      medical therapies offered to patients enrolled in the High Risk Congenital Heart Program at&#xD;
      Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. All of the procedure and visit information will be a part&#xD;
      of the child's standard of care. This information will be placed in a database. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to learn more about the short-term and long-term effects of current&#xD;
      therapies and procedures.&#xD;

      Patients, age newborn to 21 years, followed in the High Risk Congenital Heart Defect Clinic&#xD;
      at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston will be asked to participate in this trial.&#xD;
      The term &quot;high risk&quot; is assigned to a patient with the following diagnoses or medical&#xD;
      problems: critical aortic stenosis, truncus arteriosus (with or without interrupted aortic&#xD;
      arch), patients with complex single ventricle physiology (such as hypoplastic left heart&#xD;
      syndrome, unbalanced AV canal, tricuspid atresia, transposition of the great vessels with&#xD;
      ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis, mitral atresia, pulmonary atresia with&#xD;
      intact ventricular septum), left ventricular outflow tract obstruction requiring Konno&#xD;
      procedure, transposition of the great vessels (with or without ventricular septal defect),&#xD;
      pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, interrupted aortic arch (with or without&#xD;
      ventricular septal defect), anatomy requiring &quot;double switch&quot; procedure, aortic arch&#xD;
      abnormality requiring transverse arch graft, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, anatomy&#xD;
      requiring any of the following procedures: Damas-Kaye-Stansel procedure, ventricular septal&#xD;
      defect enlargement, or resection of subpulmonic stenosis during arterial switch procedure,&#xD;
      atrial septectomy, neonatal repositioning of the tricuspid valve for Ebstein anomaly, Ross&#xD;
      procedure in infancy; mitral stenosis with mitral valve replacement in infancy, and any other&#xD;
      cardiac abnormality requiring surgical repair in infancy with residual hemodynamically&#xD;
      significant lesions. In addition, patients with infantile Marfan syndrome, or kawasaki&#xD;
      disease with coronary artery aneurysm will also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from the parent or legally authorized representative for&#xD;
      all study participants. An Assent, either verbal or written, will also be obtained if the&#xD;
      child is over the age of six (6). A sequential and unique subject number (i.e. NES.001,&#xD;
      NES.002) will be assigned by the investigator or designee to each qualified subject after&#xD;
      informed consent has been obtained. Once a subject number is assigned, it will not be used&#xD;
      again by the investigator. Subjects who are asked to participate but refuse participation in&#xD;
      the study will not be assigned a study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-center, retrospective registry design will be utilized. After consent, the following&#xD;
      data will be collected from each study participant's chart each time he or she attends&#xD;
      clinic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Name&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contact information (or confirm contact information)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Names of other care providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Diagnoses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age at time of visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, respirations, pulse oximetry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight at time of visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If applicable, echocardiography data including m-mode, tissue doppler and color flow&#xD;
           Doppler&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and Physical including surgical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutritional Status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Growth Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If applicable, most recent standard of care laboratories&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If applicable, MRI results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EKG findings&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures are standard of care. The collection of data for this registry will not effect&#xD;
      the care provided to each patient. The individual physician has the right to diagnose and&#xD;
      treat each patient according to standard of care procedures and his/her own medical&#xD;
      judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this registry will last as long as the patient is being followed in the high&#xD;
      risk clinic at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.&#xD;
