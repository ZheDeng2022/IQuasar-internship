      We are comparing the efficacy of Risperidone versus Paroxetine in the treatment of panic&#xD;
      symptoms. The study hypothesis is that Risperidone will be a superior medicine for treating&#xD;
      panic.&#xD;

      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug that acts as an antagonist at 5-HT2A/2C and D2&#xD;
      receptors (Chouignard et al, 1993; Marder &amp; Meibach, 1994). In its serotonergic activity,&#xD;
      risperidone resembles both the atypical antidepressant and 5HT2-antagonist nefazodone (Bakish&#xD;
      et al, 1993) and a 5HT2-antagonist ritanserine (Lima &amp; Moncrieff, 2000; Preskorn 1995).&#xD;
      Nefazodone treats anxiety symptoms and induces less agitation than other reuptake blockers&#xD;
      (Fawcett et al, 1995) while ritanserin shows effectiveness in treatment of dysthymia in&#xD;
      clinical trials. Moreover, risperidone increases release of dopamine and norepinephrine in&#xD;
      the prefrontal cortex (Zhang et al, 2000), an activity that in other pharmacological agents&#xD;
      is associated with their antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antipanic properties (Thase, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, risperidone has a potential to be effective for treatment of either Generalized&#xD;
      Anxiety Disorder, or Panic Disorder, or Major Depressive Disorder with Panic Attacks (DSM-IV,&#xD;
      1994) as a single agent. Moreover, due to its D2 and 5-HT2A/2C antagonism and proven&#xD;
      antipsychotic efficacy, the drug could be uniquely effective for severe panic attacks with&#xD;
      psychotic features or para-psychotic features (Galynker et al, 1996). Consistent with this&#xD;
      supposition, Marder et al (1997) reported that in patients with schizophrenia, risperidone&#xD;
      produced significantly greater improvements than haloperidol in PANSS scores measuring&#xD;
      anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our clinical experience with over 50 patients with panic attacks showed that low dose&#xD;
      risperidone, similar to lorazepam, reduced or eliminated anxiety and panic, often after the&#xD;
      first dose. Risperidone was most effective for patients experiencing obsessive, intrusive,&#xD;
      anxiety-inducing thoughts. In contrast to lorazepam, risperidone treatment did not result in&#xD;
      building of tolerance to the drug or disinhibition. We did not observe extrapyramidal side&#xD;
      effects in patients treated with risperidone for panic attacks. Thus, our preliminary&#xD;
      clinical data indicate that due to its efficacy, quick onset of action, absence of addictive&#xD;
      potential, and lack of side effects, risperidone could be superior to both benzodiazepines&#xD;
      and SSRIs for treatment of panic attacks, particularly for severe panic attacks. Moreover,&#xD;
      risperidone has a potential to be the first line drug for treatment of these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, at present, a clinical study of risperidone for treatment of panic attacks is&#xD;
      indicated and is of great potential value. We are therefore proposing an exploratory open&#xD;
      label single-blind trial of risperidone in vs. paroxetine for treatment of panic attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective One. To compare the efficacy of risperidone to that of paroxetine in treatment of&#xD;
      panic attacks in patients with Panic Disorder and with Major Depressive Disorder with Panic&#xD;
      attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis One: Risperidone and will be more efficacious in treatment of panic symptoms in&#xD;
      both patient groups. Some patients will improve within 24 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Two. To compare the side effect profile of risperidone vs. paroxetine in treatment&#xD;
      of panic attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Two: Risperidone, compared to paroxetine, will cause less sexual side effects,&#xD;
      anxiety, and restlessness. There will be no difference in extrapyramidal side effects between&#xD;
      the paroxetine and the risperidone groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Three. To compare response rates of risperidone vs. paroxetine in treatment of&#xD;
      panic attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Three: Patients with panic attacks will respond significantly faster to&#xD;
      risperidone that to paroxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Four. To examine demographic and clinical predictors of robust response to&#xD;
      risperidone treatment using appropriate statistical analysis of individual scales items and&#xD;
      treatment response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Four: The subgroup patients with panic attacks who will have high scores on items&#xD;
      reflecting somatic anxiety, and ruminative intrusive thinking, and those with nocturnal panic&#xD;
      attacks will show better response to risperidone therapy than patients with low scores on&#xD;
      those items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If study hypotheses are confirmed, future research could include a randomized, double blind&#xD;
      fixed dose study of risperidone as the sole agent for treatment of panic disorder and Phase&#xD;
      IV trials aimed to determine the effectiveness of 0.125 mg and 0.0675 mg dose of risperidone&#xD;
      for treatment of anxiety and panic attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population will consist of psychiatric outpatients who meet criteria for the&#xD;
      DSM-IV diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Panic Attacks or Panic Disorder. The&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited from the Center for Treatment of Affective Disorders and from the&#xD;
      Anxiety and Trauma Center in the Department of Psychiatry at the Beth Israel Medical center&#xD;
      that provide care to 900 patients. At present, the patient ethnic and racial mix is 50%&#xD;
      Hispanic, 15% African American, 32.5% Caucasian and 2.5% Asian. The gender distribution is&#xD;
      approximately 33% male and 67 % female. The outpatient payer mix is 20 % Medicare, 74 %&#xD;
      Medicaid and 6% combined. Of those patients, approximately 40% (360) manifest panic attacks.&#xD;
      Based on our previous experience with recruitment for research studies, we expect that 10-12%&#xD;
      of patients (36-42) meeting diagnostic criteria will also meet the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, will sign the inform consent and will participate in the study. We expect to&#xD;
      recruit 40 patients per year and to complete the study in 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Males and females, ages 21-55.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ability to sign an informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnosis of Panic Disorder, or MDD with Panic attacks, single episode, recurrent, or&#xD;
           chronic&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HAM-A score &gt;17&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Alcohol or substance abuse within the last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Current diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Current diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, or Bipolar Mood Disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Use of antipsychotic medications over the two months preceding enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Changes in antidepressant or mood stabilizer dosing over the two months preceding&#xD;
           enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Previous adverse reaction to risperidone or paroxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Drug Regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be an 8-week parallel comparison (with a blinded rater) of risperidone and&#xD;
      paroxetine for treatment of three groups of patients with panic attacks. Each group will&#xD;
      consist of 30 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing an informed consent, the subjects will be randomly assigned in the open manner&#xD;
      to treatment with risperidone or paroxetine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Treatment with risperidone will be flexible-dose and will be initiated at 0.25 mg po&#xD;
      qhs. For the subjects who did not achieve a remission of panic symptoms, the dose will be&#xD;
      increased to 0.5 mg po qhs on day 3. For subjects who experienced morning sedation, the dose&#xD;
      will be decreased to 0.125-mg po qhs on day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Treatment with Paroxetine will be flexible-dose and will be initiated at 10-mg po qhs.&#xD;
      For subjects who experienced morning sedation, the dose will be decreased to 5-mg po qhs on&#xD;
      day 3. For the subjects who did not achieve a remission of panic symptoms, the dose will be&#xD;
      increased to 20-mg po qhs. For the subjects who did not achieve a remission of panic&#xD;
      symptoms, the dose will be increased to 40-mg po qhs as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3: Treatment with Paroxetine on a fixed dose schedule will be initiated at 10 mg po qhs&#xD;
      on day 1. On day 3 it will be increased to 20 mg po qhs. On day 7 it will be increased to 30&#xD;
      mg po qhs. Most patients respond to an average therapeutic dose of 30 mg of paroxetine.. This&#xD;
      will ensure that a subgroup of subjects will receive optimum therapeutic dose of Paroxetine&#xD;
      and also aid to titrate Paroxetine equivalent dose of Risperidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized on any of the above arms, and not responding or having side effects will&#xD;
      be taken off the study and referred for regular psychiatric treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects receiving fixed dose antidepressants or mood stabilizers prior to their&#xD;
      enrollment in the study will be continued on these medications throughout the study. No dose&#xD;
      adjustment of antidepressants or mood stabilizers will be allowed. At the end of study,&#xD;
      participants can choose to continue their study medications under the care of one of study&#xD;
      physicians or one of the other psychiatrists at Psychiatric outpatients service for adults&#xD;
      Beth Israel Medical Center 16 Street at First Avenue, 2 Bernstein. Those wishing to stop the&#xD;
      study medications at the end of the study will be able to do so under the supervision of one&#xD;
      of the study physicians. Paroxetine will be tapered over a two-week period to avoid SSRI&#xD;
      withdrawal. Risperidone will be stopped abruptly since no withdrawal symptoms have been&#xD;
      reported in the literature making risperidone taper unnecessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments to evaluate mood improvement will be performed by a rater blinded to medication&#xD;
      status on a daily basis for the first three days and every other day for the first two weeks.&#xD;
      The assessments (please see Appendix 1 for the assessment battery) will continue weekly for&#xD;
      the rest of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants' will provided with psychiatric treatment, free of charge, at our&#xD;
      clinic, for one month following the end of the study. At the end of one-month period, we will&#xD;
      assist you in finding further psychiatric care. Travel expenses will be reimbursed for the&#xD;
      subjects participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will calculate Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficients (r) for each of the&#xD;
      treatment outcome variable groups. This will enable us to determine the degree of association&#xD;
      between treatment and outcome. More importantly, we can interpret (r) with the Binomial&#xD;
      Effect Size Display (BESD) (Rosenthal, 1991). The BESD will enable us to estimate a&#xD;
      clinically meaningful improvement rate and to estimate the number of people that would&#xD;
      improve as a result of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis and Precision Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated above, our measure of effect size will be the Pearson Product Moment correlation&#xD;
      coefficient (r). For this study we chose an effect size of r = .50 as the smallest effect&#xD;
      size that would be clinically meaningful, and then calculated that we would need a sample&#xD;
      size of 26, to obtain power of 81%, and a 95.0% confidence interval (r = .13 to r = .75) that&#xD;
      would not include zero. (Rosenthal, 1991).&#xD;
