  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that administration of OCs at varying follicular diameters will provide an&#xD;
      appropriate model for the study of follicular atresia in women. Clinically, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that the administration on OCs at different stages of the follicular phase will result in&#xD;
      markedly different patterns of follicular development and/or atresia.&#xD;

      This study is a single-centre, randomized, open-label, double-controlled protocol to study&#xD;
      the patterns of ovarian follicular growth and regression in women administered 0.15mg&#xD;
      desogestrel /0.03mg ethinyl estradiol at different stages of the follicular phase of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We tracked the growth and regression of dominant follicles after administration of OC by&#xD;
      means of highly sophisticated transvaginal ultrasonography and computerized image analysis&#xD;
      techniques. The extremely high resolution ultrasonography of the ovarian follicles and the&#xD;
      computer-assisted image analysis are unique to the Women's Health Imaging Research Laboratory&#xD;
      (WHIRL) at the University of Saskatchewan. The synergyne (Â© R.A. Pierson) image analysis&#xD;
      program was developed in the WHIRL and has the ability to allow assessment of the physiologic&#xD;
      status of follicles as small as 6 to 10 mm. This unique protocol will allow us to&#xD;
      characterize patterns of follicular growth and atresia under the suppressive effects of oral&#xD;
      contraception, as well as the assessment of anovulatory follicles which may develop when OCs&#xD;
      are administered at advanced stages of follicular development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The working hypothesis is that the administration of monophasic OCs prior to and during the&#xD;
      time of physiologic selection of the dominant follicle will prevent the development of an&#xD;
      ovulatory follicle (selection occurs when the dominant follicle reaches 10mm [Baerwald &amp;&#xD;
      Pierson, unpublished data]). In addition, we hypothesize that administration of OCs after&#xD;
      selection of the dominant follicle, at more advanced stages of follicular development will&#xD;
      result in 1 of 4 scenarios: 1.) Ovulation of the dominant follicle, 2.) Regression of the&#xD;
      dominant follicle, 3). Formation of a Hemorrhagic Anovulatory follicle (HAF) or Luteinized&#xD;
      Unruptured Follicle (LUF), or 4.) Formation of a follicular cyst. We hypothesize that atresia&#xD;
      of dominant follicles and formation of anovulatory follicular structures will be associated&#xD;
      with limited endometrial development. In testing these hypotheses, we will determine if OCs&#xD;
      can safely and effectively be administered at any time during the follicular phase of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the ovarian and uterine responses to administration of a combined&#xD;
      dose of 0.15mg desogestrel /0.03mg ethinyl estradiol at 1 of 3 different stages of the&#xD;
      follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The objectives of the trial are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop new and more user-friendly administration schemes for OC use;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use the administration of OCs at different stages of follicular development in women as&#xD;
           a model for studying follicular atresia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the differences in kinetics, physiologic status (state of viability or atresia),&#xD;
           and ultrasonographic image attributes of follicles which grow, regress, ovulate, or form&#xD;
           anovulatory follicular structures after the administration of exogenous steroid&#xD;
           hormones;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess endometrial response to ovarian suppression by ultrasonographic evaluation of&#xD;
           endometrial thickness and endometrial pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening measurements confirm subject eligibility, subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      initiate OC therapy at one of three different times of the menstrual cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Group #1: receives OCs when the dominant follicle reaches 10mm Experimental&#xD;
      Group #2: receives OCs when the dominant follicle reaches 14mm Experimental Group #3:&#xD;
      receives OCs when the dominant follicle reaches 18mm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen women will be randomized to each of the 3 experimental groups in a stratified design&#xD;
      scheme. Data collected from an ongoing OC trial (BMC# 2000-169) will serve as OC control data&#xD;
      (n=15). Data collected from a previous study (BMC# 1988-80) will serve as natural cycle&#xD;
      control data (n=60).&#xD;
