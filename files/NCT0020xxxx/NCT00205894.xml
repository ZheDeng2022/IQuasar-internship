      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a implantable device,&#xD;
      called the bion(R), in the treatment of chronic headache. The bion microstimulator is placed&#xD;
      underneath the skin next to the greater occipital nerve. The bion microstimulator then&#xD;
      stimulates the nerve by generating small amounts of electrical current.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic migraine and chronic cluster headaches are among the most disabling medical&#xD;
      illnesses, inflicting severe functional impairment. These headache subtypes are particularly&#xD;
      resistant to current treatment modalities, with the majority of chronic migraine patients&#xD;
      continuing to experience frequent or near-daily headaches despite aggressive,&#xD;
      multidisciplinary, and multimodal therapy. The refractory nature of these illnesses and the&#xD;
      level of devastation they inflict on the lives of their victims has motivated the pursuit of&#xD;
      novel treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct stimulation of the greater occipital nerve has been shown to alleviate the symptoms of&#xD;
      chronic migraine and chronic cluster headaches in a small number of patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have received a botulinum toxin (botox) injection for treatment of headache within the&#xD;
             last 90 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have previously undergone destructive ganglionectomy affecting C2/C3 occipital and/or&#xD;
