      The purpose of this study is to study the effect of 13-cis retinoic acid in preventing second&#xD;
      primary malignancy in the oral cavity cancer patients after curative local treatment and to&#xD;
      study the toxicity and compliance of 13-cis retinoic acid.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are more than one thousand deaths annually from head and neck cancer in Taiwan&#xD;
      (excluding nasopharyngeal carcinoma) and the majority of treatment failures are related to&#xD;
      recurrence of primary disease. Only patients with early-stage disease have high cure rates,&#xD;
      but they remain at risk for the development of second primary tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second primary malignancies occur at a constant annual rate of 5% to 7% in all head and neck&#xD;
      cancer patients1. Furthermore, because the mortality from primary disease recurrence plateaus&#xD;
      after 2 to 3 years in patients with locally advanced disease, second primary tumors become&#xD;
      the major cause of late cancer mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sporn et al defined chemoprevention as an effort to arrest or reverse premalignant cells&#xD;
      during their progression to invasive malignancy2,3. The concept of chemoprevention has&#xD;
      evolved to include the use of specific compounds, rather than general dietary changes, to&#xD;
      prevent the development of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hong et al studied the effects of 13-cis retinoic acid on patients with history of head and&#xD;
      neck cancers 4. After treatment of head and neck primary cancers with either radiotherapy or&#xD;
      surgery or both, 103 patients were randomized to receive either adjuvant 13-cis retinoic acid&#xD;
      or placebo. In an update of this trial with 55 months of follow-up, 16 patients (31%) in the&#xD;
      placebo group had developed second primary tumors, whereas 7 patients (14%) in the treatment&#xD;
      group had developed second primary tumors (p=0.04) 5. Betel quid chewing becomes increasingly&#xD;
      popular in Taiwan. Exposure to both smoking and betel quid significantly increases the risk&#xD;
      of oral cavity cancer6. The hazard of developing second primary tumors is high in this&#xD;
      population, therefore, chemoprevention is worthy of trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of 13-cis RA for chemoprevention of head and neck cancer only has been published by Hong&#xD;
      et al. Their cases included a variety of head and neck cancers that are known to be not a&#xD;
      homogenous group. The risk of second primary is different for different primary sites.&#xD;
      Therefore, the value of 13-cis RA in chemoprevention is not conclusively addressed. In our&#xD;
      proposal, only oral cavity cancer is included and the result will be more convincing. The&#xD;
      result could be the basis of further chemoprevention clinical trial or guideline for clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
