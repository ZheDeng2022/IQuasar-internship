  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Topiramate is a medication that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      for the treatment of patients with seizures. The trade name for this drug is TopamaxÂ®.&#xD;
      Topiramate has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cluster headache and is&#xD;
      experimental for the purposes of this research study. If a subject participates in this&#xD;
      study, he/she will increase his/her dose of topiramate rapidly in the first few weeks to try&#xD;
      to stop the cluster attacks and then will continue on a maintenance dose of topiramate in&#xD;
      order to determine if it can prevent attacks from occurring during that cluster period. We&#xD;
      believe that this will lead not only to a faster but a more complete remission of the cluster&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 with a diagnosis of cluster headache (episodic&#xD;
             or chronic) as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders (2nd&#xD;
             edition)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a lifetime prevalence of at least 2 prior cluster cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must experience one or more attacks/ day during baseline period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a typical cluster period lasting at least 8 weeks. Subjects must&#xD;
             present in active cluster period and the expected remaining duration of the cluster&#xD;
             cycle must be at least 8 weeks from Baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with other headache types are eligible provided the subject is able to&#xD;
             differentiate these headaches from cluster headaches.&#xD;

             acceptable form of contraception (as determined by investigator), if female of&#xD;

             significant adverse event or would interfere with the assessments of efficacy and&#xD;
             tolerability during this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who require a change in medication or existing regimen of medication for the&#xD;
             prophylaxis of cluster in the 4 weeks prior to Baseline visit and for the duration of&#xD;
             the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have cluster headaches that typically exceed 4 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have used the following medications/ treatments from four weeks prior to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects using any drug which might interact adversely with, or interfere with the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have failed an adequate trial of topiramate for cluster headaches due to&#xD;
             lack of efficacy or adverse events, as determined by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of nephrolithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are allergic to or have shown hypersensitivity topiramate or agents&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who abuse opioids as determined by investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of significant drug or alcohol abuse within the past year&#xD;
&#xD;
