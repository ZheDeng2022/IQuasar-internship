      Based on the limited amount of experience with plasmapheresis and CytoGam concomitant use,&#xD;
      the researchers seek to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (drug absorption, distribution, and&#xD;
      elimination) of this therapy. The researchers are also interested in evaluating the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of the various immunosuppressant medications that patients will receive such&#xD;
      as tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and daclizumab.&#xD;

      Kidney transplantation has emerged as a desired treatment of choice for patients with end&#xD;
      stage renal disease. Although transplantation has become increasingly successful, there&#xD;
      continues to be risks associated with it. Prior to performing a kidney transplant patients&#xD;
      are cross-matched (a test to determine whether or not they have preformed antibodies to the&#xD;
      donor). Preformed antibodies result from a previous pregnancy, blood or platelet transfusion&#xD;
      or prior transplant. Performing a transplant in patients who have preformed antibodies&#xD;
      against the donor generally results in hyperacute rejection (when the immune system attacks&#xD;
      the new kidney). This hyperacute rejection usually results in kidney loss in a very high&#xD;
      percentage of patients. Due to these consequences, pre-transplant cross-matching has emerged&#xD;
      as a standard of care. Although hyperacute kidney loss has now been avoided, a large&#xD;
      population of highly sensitized patients that has little hope of receiving a transplant has&#xD;
      been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of groups have studied methods to lower specific antibody levels in a variety of&#xD;
      clinical settings. The two primary methods used today in transplantation are plasmapheresis&#xD;
      (the separation of plasma from cells, and the removal of solutes, immune globulins, and&#xD;
      medications) and administration of immune globulin therapy. Employing either of these&#xD;
      techniques individually or jointly has substantially reduced acute rejection and improved&#xD;
      kidney survival in these highly sensitized patients. The immune globulin treatments that have&#xD;
      been studied have included large variations in dosage as well as differences in immune&#xD;
      globulin products. The results from these small studies have not identified one therapy,&#xD;
      product or dosage that could be considered standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The kidney transplant work-up also consists of matching ABO blood group between donor and&#xD;
      recipient. Transplantation against the recipient blood group has resulted in very poor&#xD;
      outcomes due to antibody mediated rejection (when the immune system attacks the kidney).&#xD;
      However, due to the shortage of organs available for transplantation, the increasing number&#xD;
      of patients awaiting a transplant and the favorable outcomes with live donor transplant, some&#xD;
      transplant programs have developed protocols for transplanting against the recipient ABO&#xD;
      blood group. These protocols are centered around plasmapheresis and treatment with immune&#xD;
      globulin. As with the positive cross-match patients stated earlier, the standard of care has&#xD;
      yet to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Lloyd Ratner, currently at Columbia University and former Chief of Transplant at Thomas&#xD;
      Jefferson University Hospital and his former colleagues at Johns Hopkins University have&#xD;
      studied the use of plasmapheresis in combination with Cytomegalovirus Immune Globulin&#xD;
      Intravenous (CytoGam) to reverse a positive cross match and to transplant organs against ABO&#xD;
      incompatible blood groups. This has enabled over 20 kidney transplants to be performed with&#xD;
      patient and graft survival at one year being very similar to our traditional cross match&#xD;
      negative and ABO compatible patients. These results are generally considered outstanding&#xD;
      given the fact that antibody mediated rejection historically had a 75 to 100% incidence of&#xD;
      graft loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment protocol that is used consists of plasmapheresis treatments alternating with&#xD;
      CytoGam infusions every other day for 3 to 9 treatments prior to transplantation and another&#xD;
      1-5 treatments after transplant. Plasmapheresis is increasingly performed to treat various&#xD;
      infectious, immunological, metabolic and inherited diseases. In this procedure, plasma and&#xD;
      cellular components of blood are separated and solutes in plasma, including drugs may be&#xD;
      removed. Generally, a volume of 1 to 1.5 times the plasma volume is removed and replaced with&#xD;
      an equivalent volume of crystalloid or colloid. The procedure removes solutes or drugs from&#xD;
      the blood compartment and the tissue stores remain unaffected except for re-equilibration&#xD;
      with decreasing plasma concentrations. After each plasmapheresis treatment patients receive&#xD;
      an infusion of CytoGam which is used to &quot;inactivate&quot; the remaining antibody. However, it is&#xD;
      not known to what extent subsequent treatments of plasmapheresis remove CytoGam that patients&#xD;
      received only hours or days prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment phase with plasmapheresis patients also receive a number of other&#xD;
      medications such as immunosuppressants for the prevention and treatment of graft rejection,&#xD;
      antibiotics for prevention and treatment of infection and various other medications for&#xD;
      related illnesses. The effects that plasmapheresis may have on removal of these medications&#xD;
      is not known for many of these agents. This information would be helpful for the potential&#xD;
      need to re-dose or give supplemental doses of medications. This is extremely important for&#xD;
      the immunosuppressant medications since under-dosing of these agents may result in serious&#xD;
      negative outcomes. Due to these many unknown aspects it would be useful to know the extent of&#xD;
      drug removal during plasmapheresis treatments. This would enable more precise dosing and&#xD;
      ultimately better patient care.&#xD;
