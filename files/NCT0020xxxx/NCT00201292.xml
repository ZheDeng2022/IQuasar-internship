    <textblock>
      Diabetes is prevalent in schizophrenics and may be induced by antipsychotic treatments.&#xD;
      Several retrospective studies have suggested that psychiatric patients exposed to atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotics may be at a higher risk for developing diabetes and ketoacidosis. The&#xD;
      association between these atypical antipsychotics and the onset of diabetes is further&#xD;
      strengthened by observations of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the time sequence between the initiation of antipsychotic treatment and the onset of&#xD;
           diabetes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. remission after the discontinuation of medications; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. re-emergence of diabetes following the re-introduction of atypical antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment emergent diabetes, along with other metabolic disturbances, represents a&#xD;
      serious issue in the use of atypical antipsychotics. Major current debates and unresolved&#xD;
      research issues which are also the focus of this proposal, are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. schizophrenia per se, versus the use of antipsychotics, in triggering diabetes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. whether there are differences between &quot;typicals&quot; and &quot;atypicals&quot; in such an effect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. whether there are differences among different &quot;atypicals&quot;;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. whether, and to what extent, treatment emergent diabetes may be associated with, or&#xD;
           independent of, weight gain, which also often is associated with the use of&#xD;
           antipsychotics; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. genetic and environmental risks in association with treatment emergent diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The policy of some hospitals in Taiwan that discourages the use of atypical antipsychotics&#xD;
      for new onset schizophrenia directs the investigators to a study design looking at the&#xD;
      associated diabetes of both types of antipsychotics. Such a design may provide some hints to&#xD;
      the unresolved research issues mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, a broader defined term, X-syndrome, or metabolic syndrome, is being used to&#xD;
      describe the diabetic condition associated with antipsychotics. X-syndrome is a risky&#xD;
      condition leading to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, with insulin resistance as the&#xD;
      major outcome, associated with two of the following conditions: truncal obesity (deposited in&#xD;
      the thorax and abdomen, instead of the hips and thighs), high triglycerides, high low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or hypertension. The proposed study will combine the phenotypes&#xD;
      of diabetes and X-syndrome to explore the abnormal metabolism caused by antipsychotics,&#xD;
      bridge important information gaps, and provide data contributing towards a better&#xD;
      understanding of the risk and management of diabetes and X-syndrome associated with the use&#xD;
      of antipsychotics. Three assessment tools, namely the Clinical Global Severity (Clinical&#xD;
      Global Impressions - Severity) or the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANNS), the&#xD;
      Diabetes Risk Assessment (ADA) and the Life Style Survey, together with physical&#xD;
      measurements, collect additional information for this study. Diabetes related biochemistry,&#xD;
      including glucose, insulin, leptin, lipids and glycohemoglobin, will be measured to form a&#xD;
      composite phenotype for further pharmacogenetic studies. Candidate genes involved in&#xD;
      pancreatic beta cell insulin secretion will be examined in priority to see if they play a&#xD;
      role in the development of the antipsychotics-induced diabetes.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although our original interests were condensed in atypicals, the fact that some hospitals&#xD;
      discourage the use of atypical antipsychotics for new onset schizophrenia for policy reasons&#xD;
      directs us to a study design looking at both types of therapeutics. Coincidently, such a&#xD;
      design may provide some hints to the unresolved research issues mentioned above. The proposed&#xD;
      study will bridge these important information gaps, and provide data contributing towards a&#xD;
      better understanding of the risk and management of diabetes associated with the use of both&#xD;
      types of antipsychotics. As some researchers in this field have described the diabetic&#xD;
      related conditions in a broader term called &quot;metabolic X-syndrome&quot;, a risky condition leading&#xD;
      to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, with insulin resistance as the major outcome,&#xD;
      associated with two of the following conditions: truncal obesity (deposited in the thorax and&#xD;
      abdomen, instead of the hips and thighs), high triglycerides, high LDL cholesterol or&#xD;
      hypertension,3 we therefore extend our study to both diabetes and metabolic X-syndrome as a&#xD;
      phenotype for further genetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal aims to study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the prevalence of diabetes/metabolic X-syndrome associated with the use of&#xD;
           antipsychotics in Taiwanese Han Chinese populations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. clinical and sociodemographic correlation of diabetes/metabolic X-syndrome associated&#xD;
           with the use of antipsychotics; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the putative role of genes in the development of treatment emergent diabetes/metabolic&#xD;
           X-syndrome secondary to the administration of antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Affecting approximately 1% of any population worldwide, schizophrenia represents a major&#xD;
      cause for morbidity and dysfunction for the afflicted and their loved ones, as well as a&#xD;
      significant burden for the health care system and the society in general. Although&#xD;
      antipsychotics are often remarkably effective in ameliorating schizophrenic symptoms and in&#xD;
      enhancing social functioning, their use often is limited by their propensity to cause serious&#xD;
      side effects that could further compromise patients' health conditions. One such side effect&#xD;
      is diabetes. Research publications from 1919, long before the advent of psychotropic&#xD;
      medication, had showed schizophrenia might predispose individuals to diabetes.1 Following the&#xD;
      introduction of chlorpromazine, the first antipsychotic in the modern era, a large number of&#xD;
      case reports of antipsychotics-induced diabetes were reported. This complication seems more&#xD;
      serious in the new type of antipsychotic, which is generally regarded as an atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic due to the lack of extrapyramidal reactions seen in schizophrenics treated with&#xD;
      antipsychotics discovered previously. Several retrospective studies based on health services&#xD;
      claim databases, strongly suggested that psychiatric patients exposed to atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotics may be at a higher risk for developing diabetes. In addition, patients treated&#xD;
      with these medications also appear to be at a higher risk for developing ketoacidosis. Risk&#xD;
      factors included ethnicity (African Americans, Asians, Hispanics and Native Americans),&#xD;
      family history of diabetes and overweight or obesity. The association between these atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotics and the onset of diabetes is further strengthened by observations of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the time sequence between the initiation of antipsychotic treatment and the onset of&#xD;
           diabetes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. remission after the discontinuation of medications; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. re-emergence of diabetes following the re-introduction of atypical antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together, these data indicate that treatment emergent diabetes, along with other metabolic&#xD;
      disturbances (e.g., dyslipidemia and obesity), represents a serious issue in the use of&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotics. This notwithstanding, many questions of crucial clinical and&#xD;
      theoretical interest remain un-clarified. Major current debates and unresolved research&#xD;
      issues include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) schizophrenia per se, versus the use of antipsychotics, in triggering diabetes; (2)&#xD;
      whether there are differences between &quot;typicals&quot; and &quot;atypicals&quot; in such an effect; (3)&#xD;
      whether there are differences among different &quot;atypicals;&quot; (4) whether, and to what extent,&#xD;
      treatment emergent diabetes may be associated with, or independent of, weight gain, which&#xD;
      also often is associated with the use of antipsychotics; and (5) genetic and environmental&#xD;
      risks in association with treatment emergent diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application aims at addressing some of these important issues, as well as establishing a&#xD;
      platform for future studies that may be more comprehensive and in-depth in nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to the plethora of case reports and reports based on secondary data analyses,&#xD;
      there is a dearth of information deriving from studies that might be more useful for&#xD;
      providing definitive answers to some of these questions. Our review of the extant literature&#xD;
      led to two studies that are worth noting in this regard:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A five-year longitudinal study conducted by Henderson et al in Boston, reporting that&#xD;
           patients treated with clozapine experienced significant weight gain and lipid&#xD;
           abnormality and appear to be at an increased risk for developing diabetes.2 Overall,&#xD;
           36.6% (30/82) of the patients developed newly diagnosed diabetes during the 5-year&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In a sizeable cross-sectional study conducted in northern Sweden, prevalence of diabetes&#xD;
           in patients receiving clozapine was approximately 12% versus 6% in controls.3 It is of&#xD;
           note that both studies focused only on clozapine, and neither of them provide&#xD;
           information specifically on populations of Oriental or Asian backgrounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity and overweight are known risk factors for insulin resistance, which could eventually&#xD;
      lead to the development of type 2 diabetes. Since most atypicals (as well as schizophrenia&#xD;
      itself) are likely to induce significant weight gain, it is reasonable to speculate that&#xD;
      diabetes associated with atypicals might be secondary to weight changes. However, a number of&#xD;
      reasons suggest that factors in addition to/or other than weight gain may also be important:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) diabetes also occurs in patients who do not gain weight;2 (2) in many cases, improvement&#xD;
      in diabetes occurred within 2 weeks, too fast for this to be an effect of a reversal in&#xD;
      weight changes; and (3) the relatively high rate of ketoacidosis, as well as the rapidity of&#xD;
      the recovery following the discontinuation of the treatment, suggests that the putative&#xD;
      diabetogenic effects of the atypicals might be secondary to the inhibition of insulin&#xD;
      secretion, rather than insulin resistance. Very little is known about the mechanisms of&#xD;
      typical antipsychotics in obesity and overweight, however, there should be some shared&#xD;
      pathways in both types of antipsychotics, and specific pathways used by only typicals or&#xD;
      atypicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible role of insulin secretion in mediating atypicals' diabetogenic effects is&#xD;
      further supported by the abundance of serotonin receptors in pancreatic beta cells. In&#xD;
      addition to the mechanisms involving the production and function of insulin, factors&#xD;
      affecting the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of atypicals might also significantly&#xD;
      determine whether individuals and/or populations would be more or less likely to develop&#xD;
      diabetes, as well as the severity of such an unintended effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Putting these considerations together, we propose a multi-factorial working model which,&#xD;
      while emphasizing the central role of the function of the pancreatic beta cells, also will&#xD;
      include factors mediating insulin resistance, as well as those controlling the metabolism of&#xD;
      the atypicals, and their effects on the central nervous system. Such a model concurrently&#xD;
      considers genetic and other factors that might determine the effects of the atypicals and&#xD;
      factors altering glucose homeostasis in target tissues, as well as the interactions among&#xD;
      these factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous achievements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Loh has been engaged in studies of psychiatric genetics since 1993. These studies mainly&#xD;
      emphasized the genetic susceptibility of alcoholism and illicit drug abuse. The research&#xD;
      extended from thesis work to an international collaboration and is still being conducted&#xD;
      using both family and case control designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research subjects will be recruited from three collaborative sites: Taipei City Hospital&#xD;
      Songde Branch, Mackay Memorial Hospital and Yu-Li Hospital. The Institutional Review Boards&#xD;
      of the National Health Research Institutes, the Yu-Li Hospital and the Mackay Memorial&#xD;
      Hospital have approved this study, while a permit from the Institutional Review Board of the&#xD;
      Taipei City Hospital Songde Branch is still being applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatients and outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria, treated&#xD;
      either with typical or atypical antipsychotics, either male or female, age between 18 to 65&#xD;
      years old, are eligible for this study. Exclusion criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Illegal drug use/abuse/dependence;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. alcoholism;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. pregnancy; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. clinical diagnosis of type I or type II diabetes before the onset of schizophrenia or&#xD;
           treatment of schizophrenia (via chart review).&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to empirical experience, around 150 new onset schizophrenics may be collected&#xD;
           each year from our three collaborative sites. For chronic schizophrenics, clinicians&#xD;
           must be aware that the eligible patients are those who can be suitably grouped in&#xD;
           statistics (e.g., poor responder to typical psychotics). Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
           invited to participate in this study, after the signing of written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Possible Impediments: The patients may complain of too many biochemical measurements&#xD;
           conducted in the study period. We can reduce the total number of biochemical&#xD;
           measurements to 3~4 times a year for all research subjects or for those who complain. We&#xD;
           will lose some information but the data should be able to reveal the trend of&#xD;
           biochemical changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical and Laboratory Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical Assessments for New cases&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical information of subjects who come for the treatment of schizophrenia for the&#xD;
           first time will be collected by using the following assessment tools in the Chinese&#xD;
           version:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (I) Clinical Global Severity (Clinical Global Impressions - Severity) or Positive and&#xD;
           Negative Symptom Scale (PANNS): CGI Severity or PANNS is used by the clinician to record&#xD;
           the severity of schizophrenic illness at the time of assessment. The score ranges for&#xD;
           CGI are from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients).&#xD;
           One of these scales will be chosen to access the psychiatric conditions of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (II) Diabetes Risk Assessment: The Diabetes Risk Assessment (ADA, 2000) is a 7-item&#xD;
           self-report scale designed to determine the presence of known risk factors for the&#xD;
           development of Type 2 diabetes. Each item is assigned a point value and points are then&#xD;
           totaled to achieve an overall risk rating.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (III) Life Style Survey: The Life Style Survey is a self-report scale specifically&#xD;
           designed for this study to ascertain certain aspects of daily health habits of the study&#xD;
           participants. Behaviors related to smoking, alcohol use, substance use, diet, exercise,&#xD;
           and family history are evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The CGI, ADA and assessment tools in the Chinese version were translated and validated&#xD;
           by Dr. Tsuo-Hung Lan, and have been used in his clinical studies of metabolic X-syndrome&#xD;
           (YLH93001 and B20030902).&#xD;
&#xD;
           ---Data collection for Old cases: While new cases provide the information we are&#xD;
           interested in, patients who have been treated for schizophrenia previously and with well&#xD;
           documented records warrant a retrospective study. Although the psychiatric and physical&#xD;
           conditions may not consist of all the variables we are interested in, they nevertheless&#xD;
           point out a direction for the study of new cases. In brief, psychiatric and physical&#xD;
           information of old cases are assessed by chart review and valued variables (e.g., Brief&#xD;
           Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS], triglyceride levels, glucose levels, etc.) and DNA will&#xD;
           be collected and used in further pharmacogenetic studies. If possible, the variables of&#xD;
           necessity described below will be collected by following a simplified guideline derived&#xD;
           from the current protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Weight, height, hip and waist circumference and blood pressure, will be collected by&#xD;
           standard methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ---Biochemistry: The following biochemical values are measured in a fasting state every&#xD;
           two months, for 6 times: glucose, insulin, leptin, lipid panel (Total cholesterol, HDL&#xD;
           cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides) and glycohemoglobin (HBA1C or A1C).&#xD;
&#xD;
           For exploratory purposes, the data will be processed and examined in two ways. First, we&#xD;
           adopt diagnostic guidelines suggested by The Expert Committee On The Diagnosis And&#xD;
           Classification Of Diabetes Mellitus, and The American Diabetes Association,5 to define&#xD;
           and classify subjects' glucose metabolism status. However, because these criteria change&#xD;
           from time to time and because we are interested to see how these biochemical values may&#xD;
           form a new index, a second option to manipulate all these variables has been planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We use the measurement of HbA1C as an additional index for diabetes. The Expert&#xD;
           Committee On The Diagnosis And Classification Of Diabetes Mellitus did not include HbA1C&#xD;
           as one of the criteria of diabetes because of difficulties in standardizing reference&#xD;
           ranges of such a measurement across laboratories. This is much less a concern in this&#xD;
           study since all procedures will be performed in the same laboratory, and the results are&#xD;
           used for research rather than clinical purposes. The addition of the HbA1C affords us&#xD;
           with information on glycemic levels in a time scale of weeks, whereas plasma glucose&#xD;
           varies greatly within any given day and from day to day. Thus, an elevated HbA1C&#xD;
           indicates a chronic state of hyperglycemia while hyperglycemia as measured by the FPG or&#xD;
           2-h PG may be transitory.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pharmacogenetics:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Current suggestions include candidate genes involved in pancreatic beta cell insulin&#xD;
           secretion (e.g., HNF-1a, HNF-4a), insulin action (e.g., calpain 10, TNFα),&#xD;
           serotonin/dopamine functions (e.g., 5-HT2A, 2C, D2, COMT) and pharmacokinetic (e.g.,&#xD;
           CYP1A2, CYP2D6,) pathways. SNPs with a population frequency of 0.1~0.15 will be&#xD;
           concerned as priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ---Data Analysis: Clinical Data: The primary outcome is the diagnosis of diabetes based&#xD;
           on American Diabetes Association criteria. Estimates of insulin secretion (fasting&#xD;
           glucose/insulin ratios) and insulin sensitivity as well as demographic variables and&#xD;
           evidence of over-weight/obesity will be evaluated as risk factors for the development of&#xD;
           diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pharmacogenetic Data: The approach to analysis will be a case-control association study:&#xD;
           SNPs within a gene will be combined to form haplotypes to provide more informative&#xD;
           genotypes. Association studies of haplotypes will be done first, comparing the diabetic&#xD;
           with the non-diabetic group. Modeling of contributions of multiple genes will also be&#xD;
           conducted. When SNPs associated with antipsychotics induced diabetes are identified,&#xD;
           their interactive effects will be analyzed by multiple logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ---Sample Size and Power Considerations: Based on current available data of the CATIE&#xD;
           (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) conducted in the U.S.A, a&#xD;
           9.5% incidence rate of diabetes in schizophrenics treated with atypical antipsychotics&#xD;
           is predicted. In addition, Hagg reported a 12% incidence rate of confirmed type II&#xD;
           diabetes among patients treated with clozapine in their cross sectional study.4 We used&#xD;
           the Genetic Power Calculator6 to estimate the sample size needed. We defined a power of&#xD;
           0.8, type I error rate of 0.05, with simple and common acceptable parameters, i.e.,&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) risk ratio of susceptible homozygous genotypes set at 3, (2) risk ratio of heterozygous&#xD;
      genotypes set at 1.5, (3) prevalence of phenotypes of interest set at 10%. When SNPs with&#xD;
      allele frequency of 0.15 are used in such conditions, approximately 135 cases and 270&#xD;
      controls are needed to reach this desired power. Expectedly, to obtain 135 subjects with&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotics-induced diabetes, we need to examine about 1350 new schizophrenic&#xD;
      patients treated with antipsychotics. Such an expectation implies that the pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      study of atypical antipsychotics-induced diabetes is not feasible, however, in reality, the&#xD;
      prevalence of hyperglycemia (one of the components of X-syndrome) among patients treated with&#xD;
      antipsychotics may be higher than 10% in a Han Chinese population. In addition, the&#xD;
      susceptible genotype may have a higher risk ratio. Thus, posterior power estimations may give&#xD;
      even higher power than the conservative estimation even at a smaller sample size. Moreover,&#xD;
      our samples will merge from samples from other medical centers. Thus, the task to examine&#xD;
      1350 schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics, is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---A Sample for Preliminary Pharmacogenetic Studies: We plan to examine a collection of DNAs&#xD;
      in which 292 samples were from the Tao-Yuan Psychiatric Hospital and 393 samples were from&#xD;
      the Yu-Li hospital. The samples were evaluated with the same clinical procedures and physical&#xD;
      measurements described above. However, leptin was not measured and the HbA1C was only&#xD;
      evaluated once. Furthermore, the rest of the biochemistries were only measured twice at the&#xD;
      1st month and 6th month. Nevertheless, this sample collection is worth being explored in a&#xD;
      preliminary study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results and Discussions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Years 1 and 2: Collect clinical information, biochemical data and DNA samples, carry out&#xD;
      preliminary statistical analysis and examine the 292 and 393 samples from the Tao-Yuan&#xD;
      Psychiatric Hospital and Yu-Li hospital, respectively. Years 3, 4 and 5: Form composite index&#xD;
      from preliminary statistical analysis, continue collecting DNAs and conduct pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      studies using the DNA samples collected in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the nature and correlates of diabetic complications is crucial in&#xD;
      the field's ongoing efforts in improving the care and welfare of schizophrenic patients. In&#xD;
      addition, diabetes and X-syndrome associated with antipsychotics and/or schizophrenia also&#xD;
      may represent a unique opportunity for understanding the pathogenesis and management of&#xD;
      diabetes in general. It also could be potentially a particularly effective model for studying&#xD;
      gene-environment interactions that are crucial for understanding most common human diseases.&#xD;
      Ultimately, our goal is to develop genetic tests to predict therapeutic responses. As such,&#xD;
      from the view of a national health economy, this study may prove that personalized medicine&#xD;
      saves money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study provides an opportunity for the researchers to be trained to extend statistical&#xD;
      skills in estimating the putative role of genes in therapeutic responses. In addition, an&#xD;
      understanding of the HbA1C, an interesting but debatable laboratory diagnostic test for&#xD;
      diabetes, will be gained.&#xD;
