  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect that oxygen has when administered to&#xD;
      patients complaining of shortness of breath, where the underlying cause of this symptom is&#xD;
      advanced cancer. The study tests the hypothesis that oxygen improves shortness of breath more&#xD;
      than air in this population. Both oxygen and air will be administered to patients in random&#xD;
      order and in a blinded fashion, with patients asked to rate their shortness of breath before&#xD;
      and after each gas. Finally patients will be asked which gas they prefer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnoea is a devastating symptom in patients with advanced cancer. Management strategies are&#xD;
      limited and include behavioural therapies such as relaxation, and pharmacological therapies&#xD;
      such as opioids and anxiolytics. The latter are associated with problematic side effects in&#xD;
      many patients. Inhalational oxygen is frequently administered but there are few studies in&#xD;
      this population which define its role and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Aim: To compare patient preference for inhalational oxygen versus air for relief of&#xD;
      dyspnoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the patient preference for inhalational oxygen versus compressed air in the&#xD;
           relief of dyspnoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the response to oxygen and air in improvement of dyspnoea in patients with&#xD;
           advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the response to oxygen and air in improvement of dyspnoea in those patients&#xD;
           with advanced cancer with documented hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify factors other than hypoxia which impact on the sensation of dyspnoea and its&#xD;
           relief, when patients are administered oxygen and air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oxygen improves dyspnoea in patients with cancer more than compressed air.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with cancer who are hypoxic are more likely than those who are not hypoxic to&#xD;
           have improvement of dyspnoea with oxygen administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The cause of the dyspnoea may affect whether dyspnoea improves more with oxygen than&#xD;
           with air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a randomised, double blind, crossover study design, patients will be adminstered air&#xD;
      and oxygen for 15 minutes and be asked to rate dyspnoea scores before and after each gas.&#xD;
      Measures of oxygen saturation will be simultaneously measured, and finally the patient&#xD;
      preferences for the gases will be sought at trial completion.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have dyspnoea mainly due to advanced cancer. Patients with a history of&#xD;
             COAD will be eligible for participation in this study as long as the main mechanism of&#xD;
             current dyspnoea is related to tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  intensity of dyspnoea of at least 3 on a 0-10 visual analogue scale at the time of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular Bronchodilators and corticosteroids and other adjuvant medications for&#xD;
             dyspnoea will be allowed to continue during the study. Inhaled bronchodilator steriods&#xD;
             may not be used during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may be receiving regular oral or parenteral opioids and opioid dose must be&#xD;
             stable for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal cognitive status defined as normal state of arousal and&#xD;
             absence of obvious clinical findings of confusion, memory or concentration deficit&#xD;
             according to Blessed Orientation Memory &amp; Concentration mental status examination&#xD;
             (score&lt;10).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no contraindications to oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must sign written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have evidence of acute respiratory distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently oxygen dependent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who refuse to participate or are deemed incapable of completing the research.&#xD;
