    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide,&#xD;
      and is caused most commonly by poor uterine muscle contraction after delivery of the baby and&#xD;
      placenta. The first line agent used in the prevention and treatment of PPH is oxytocin, which&#xD;
      acts by binding with the oxytocin receptor (OTR) found on myometrial cells to cause uterine&#xD;
      contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin is also used for the augmentation of labor when spontaneous labor has been deemed&#xD;
      ineffective. It is administered intravenously at progressively higher doses, until effective&#xD;
      contractions are achieved and vaginal delivery results. However, if augmentation is&#xD;
      determined to have failed, a Cesarean delivery (CD) is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the potential problems with oxytocin use during delivery is that it loses its&#xD;
      effectiveness if the uterus has previously been pre-exposed to its high doses and/or for a&#xD;
      prolonged duration during labor. This phenomenon is termed OTR desensitization, and can&#xD;
      result in the attenuation of myometrial contractility induced by subsequent oxytocin&#xD;
      administration, as well as PPH due to poor uterine tone. Furthermore, oxytocin can produce&#xD;
      potentially fatal maternal hemodynamic adverse effects when administered at high doses, so it&#xD;
      is advantageous to be able to use as low a dose as possible to obtain good uterine muscle&#xD;
      tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to get a better understanding of the signaling pathways&#xD;
      governing desensitization, resensitization and contractility in pregnant human myometrium.&#xD;
      The investigators wish to investigate the effects of increasing recovery period on the&#xD;
      expression patterns of the OTR and its signaling pathways in desensitized pregnant human&#xD;
      myometrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help shed light on the molecular mechanisms responsible for desensitization&#xD;
      and oxytocin-induced myometrial contractility, and will provide some insight into potential&#xD;
      therapeutic targets to reduce the incidence of PPH and complications associated with using&#xD;
      increasing concentrations of oxytocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the expression and phosphorylation patterns of the OTR and downstream&#xD;
      proteins will be altered in desensitized myometrium, and that these patterns will change with&#xD;
      increasing rest periods and re-exposure to oxytocin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinically, women who require augmentation of labor are at increased risk of PPH due to their&#xD;
      greater exposure to oxytocin in both duration and dose through exogenous administration,&#xD;
      presumably mediated by OTR desensitization. In current practice, upon diagnosis of failure to&#xD;
      progress during labor augmentation, oxytocin administration is discontinued, and as long as&#xD;
      there is no indication for immediate delivery, there is a variable duration to proceed to CD.&#xD;
      Due to the high likelihood of OTR desensitization in this patient population, it would be&#xD;
      clinically relevant to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying this action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study from the investigators' group, looking at the rest time required for recovery&#xD;
      and resensitization of the OTR following desensitization, showed that there were no&#xD;
      improvements in oxytocin-induced myometrial contractility after either a 30, 60 or 90 minute&#xD;
      rest period. The reason for why resensitization does not occur remains unknown, but a&#xD;
      possible explanation is that the OTRs undergo structural and functional changes during&#xD;
      desensitization that prohibit their recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to use our previously established in-vitro model of labour&#xD;
      augmentation and OTR desensitization (using pregnant human myometrium and an isometric&#xD;
      tension recording device) to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing OTR&#xD;
      desensitization and resensitization after stopping administration of oxytocin. Investigation&#xD;
      of the signaling pathways responsible for these processes, as well as for oxytocin-induced&#xD;
      contractions in a controlled in-vitro system will aid in the understanding of the kinetics of&#xD;
      the OTR-oxytocin system and provide insight into potential pharmacotherapeutic targets to&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of PPH.&#xD;
