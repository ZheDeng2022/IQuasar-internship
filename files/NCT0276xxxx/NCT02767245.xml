    <textblock>
      Thyrotoxicosis is a hypermetabolic state in which there is increased utilization of thiamine.&#xD;
      Thiamine deficiency has been observed in association with hyperthyroidism. Several studies&#xD;
      documented that thiamine treatment could improve signs and symptoms of congestive heart&#xD;
      failure, or even improve left ventricular ejection fraction in patients without&#xD;
      thyrotoxicosis. This pilot study aims to evaluate prevalence of thiamine deficiency and&#xD;
      assess improvement of cardiovascular function after receiving thiamine supplement in&#xD;
      thyrotoxic patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of thiamine or vitamin B1 deficiency has been documented in 21-98% of patients&#xD;
      with heart failure. Thiamine has multiple effects on the cardiovascular system. It has&#xD;
      important hemodynamic effects on the circulatory system as well as direct positive&#xD;
      pharmacologic effects on the heart. Thiamine deficiency has been shown to cause cardiac&#xD;
      hypertrophy, depressed cardiac contractility, and dysrhythmias. Thiamine is of particular&#xD;
      interest in the management of heart failure for several reasons. Heart failure is a disease&#xD;
      of the elderly whose micronutrient status is in need of attention. Heart failure patients&#xD;
      tend to have inadequate nutrient intake, which has been associated with thiamine deficiency.&#xD;
      Use of loop diuretic is associated with the loss of water-soluble vitamins, including&#xD;
      thiamine. Several studies have examined the role of thiamine supplementation in patients with&#xD;
      heart failure. Clinical trials in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that&#xD;
      thiamine supplementation increases the systolic, diastolic, and central venous pressures,&#xD;
      with a decline in heart rate and increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).&#xD;
      Thiamine acts as a vasodilator and reduces the afterload on the heart, thus improving cardiac&#xD;
      function. Thiamine has also been reported to increase diuresis and natriuresis in patients&#xD;
      with heart failure receiving diuretics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyrotoxicosis considerably increases the demand for thiamine. In vivo study in a rat model&#xD;
      demonstrated that thyroid hormones have a direct influence on mitochondria which is the main&#xD;
      source of energy. Thiamine in its various forms functions as an important coenzyme for&#xD;
      macronutrient oxidation and the production of adenosine triphosphate. Thiamine pyrophosphate&#xD;
      works in several oxidative decarboxylation reactions and is a catalyst in the reactions of&#xD;
      Krebs cycle. Therefore, thiamine seems to decrease in the case of an increased tissue&#xD;
      metabolism. In the previous case reports, they described the possible association between&#xD;
      thyrotoxicosis and thiamine deficiency in patients manifested as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite lack of the evidence of benefit of thiamine therapy in patients with severe&#xD;
      thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm, some experts recommended thiamine in conjunction with other&#xD;
      supportive treatment. We aimed to investigate the effect of thiamine on cardiac function in&#xD;
      patients with severe thyrotoxicosis in a prospective, randomized, open, blinded end-point&#xD;
      study using echocardiographic as well as clinical endpoints.&#xD;
