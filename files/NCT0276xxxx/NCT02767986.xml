      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Culture can affect the way a person thinks about illness. This can affect how they seek help&#xD;
      for illness. It can also affect how they choose a treatment and follow it. This can lead to&#xD;
      health disparities among certain groups of people. Breast and colon cancers are the most&#xD;
      common cancers for Latinos. Even though they get these cancers at lower rates than other&#xD;
      population groups, Latinos are more likely to be diagnosed with these cancers at advanced&#xD;
      stages. Researchers want to study what Latina women immigrants believe causes breast and&#xD;
      colon cancer and other factors they think play a role in disease. This understanding could&#xD;
      lead to better interactions between Latinos and their doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about what Latina immigrants believe causes breast and colon cancer and other&#xD;
      factors they think play a role in disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women ages 18 and older who:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Were born in Latin America&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speak Spanish&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have never had breast, ovarian, or colon cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be interviewed in person or over the phone. This will take up to an hour.&#xD;
      The interview will be recorded. Participants will answer questions about:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their family s cancer history&#xD;
&#xD;
      What they think causes breast and colon cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      What they think plays a role in disease&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Research to understand the sources of health disparities has acknowledged that in addition to&#xD;
      biomedical risk factors, culture plays an important role in differential health outcomes.&#xD;
      Consequently, understanding cultural differences that may influence health behavior is key in&#xD;
      working towards reducing these disparities. Causal attributions are a key component of&#xD;
      individuals illness perceptions and thus impact health behaviors, which may present as health&#xD;
      disparities at a population level. While research has explored non-Hispanic White women s&#xD;
      causal attributions of breast cancer, less is known about Latina s beliefs about the causes&#xD;
      of breast cancer, and little is known about causal attributions of colon cancer in any&#xD;
      population. Understanding Latina s causal attributions of breast and colon cancer may provide&#xD;
      insight into the determinants of cancer disparities in this population. Because a subset of&#xD;
      both breast and colon cancers result from single gene mutations, which confer an increased&#xD;
      risk of developing such cancers, understanding causal attributions in Latina populations is&#xD;
      relevant to the field of genetics. This is especially true since Latinas have historically&#xD;
      underutilized cancer genetic risk assessment counseling and testing services. As these&#xD;
      services become a standard part of general healthcare provision, it will become increasingly&#xD;
      important to understand ways in which different cultural groups interact with genetic&#xD;
      information. One way this can be done is through investigating culturally informed mental&#xD;
      models of disease risk and inheritance. This study seeks to describe causal attributions of&#xD;
      breast and colon cancer and to explore mental models of disease inheritance among Latina&#xD;
      immigrants. A qualitative exploratory design including interviews comprised of free-listing,&#xD;
      ranking, and open-ended questions will be used. Participants will be recruited through the&#xD;
      NIH Clinical Research Volunteer Program as well as using other resources within the Office of&#xD;
      Participant Recruitment. First, we will describe Latina s causal attributions for these&#xD;
      cancers. Next, we will use cultural consensus theory (CCT) to identify and describe common&#xD;
      cultural models of causes of these cancers. Finally, we will explore Latina s mental models&#xD;
      of disease inheritance using both free-listing and openended questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Objectives and specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to describe the cultural models of Latina immigrants regarding&#xD;
      causal attributions of breast and colon cancer as well as to explore this group s mental&#xD;
      models of disease inheritance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: To identify the main causal attributions of breast and colon cancers among Latina&#xD;
      immigrants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: To use cultural consensus analysis to identify the presence or absence of shared&#xD;
      cultural models of causal attributions for breast and colon cancers among participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: To describe the mental models of disease inheritance held by members of the Latina&#xD;
      immigrant population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Brief Rationale and Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Latinos in the United States&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hispanic or Latino is currently the largest minority group in the United States, constituting&#xD;
      17% of the population as of 2013 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In Maryland&#xD;
      specifically, the 2010 census found 8.3% of the population to be Hispanic or Latino, and as&#xD;
      of July 2014, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 9.2% of the Maryland population is&#xD;
      Hispanic or Latino. Notably, the absolute number of Hispanics or Latinos in Maryland doubled&#xD;
      during the period 2000-2010, indicating the high level of growth in this segment of the&#xD;
      population (http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/24000lk.html). The U.S. Office of&#xD;
      Management and Budget (OMB) defines Hispanic or Latino as a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto&#xD;
      Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race&#xD;
      (http://www.census.gov/topics/population/hispanic-origin/about.html). For the purposes of&#xD;
      this proposal, the terms Latino/a will refer to people of Spanish-speaking countries of the&#xD;
      Western hemisphere, and Latino/a immigrants will refer to persons born in one of these&#xD;
      countries who have since immigrated to the United States. Notably, this working definition&#xD;
      excludes people of Spanish or Brazilian nationality or descent, mainly due to the cultural&#xD;
      focus of this investigation.&#xD;
