    <textblock>
      CALYPSO clinical study is a phase 3 study which is carried out to establish the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and pharmacokinetic equivalence of BCD-055 (adalimumab, manufactured by JSC BIOCAD,&#xD;
      Russia) and Humira® when used in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CALYPSO study is the next step of clinical evaluation of adalimumab biosimilar manufactured&#xD;
      by joint-stock company (JSC) BIOCAD, Russia.The aim of this study is to establish that&#xD;
      BCD-057 is equivalent to Humira® in terms of efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics when used&#xD;
      by the standard regimen in patients with plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 344 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, who will be&#xD;
      randomized into 2 groups (1:1 ratio): patients from the first group will receive BCD-057&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) at a dose 80 mg on week 0, then at a dose 40 mg on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,&#xD;
      11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 and 23. Then participants of this group will be invited for&#xD;
      randomization at week 25 (in order to keep the double-blind design of the study), but it will&#xD;
      have a formal character (assignment of a new randomization number and lot). Patients will&#xD;
      continue to receive 40 mg of BCD-057 on weeks 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47,&#xD;
      49 and 51.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from the second group will receive Humira® subcutaneously (SC) at a dose 80 mg on&#xD;
      week 0, then at a dose 40 mg on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 and 23. At week&#xD;
      25 participants will re-randomized (1:1) to treatment with Humira® or will transitioned to&#xD;
      BCD-057.They will receive Humira® or BCD-057 at a dose 40 mg on weeks 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35,&#xD;
      37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49 and 51.&#xD;
