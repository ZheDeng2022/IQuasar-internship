      This study aims at contributing with scientific evidence to the field of aphasia&#xD;
      telerehabilitation. In Norway today, there is an unmet need for language training in post&#xD;
      stroke aphasia and not all patients are offered language training. Early start of aphasia&#xD;
      rehabilitation and satisfying intensity do not seem to be standard clinical practice.&#xD;
      Language training by telemedicine could improve this situation, and this study seeks to&#xD;
      answer the question whether aphasia rehabilitation delivered by videoconference can improve&#xD;
      language function in aphasia post stroke.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 25 % of all stroke cases lead to aphasia. Aphasia can include difficulties with speech&#xD;
      production and comprehension, as well as reading and writing impairment. Language impairment&#xD;
      affects post stroke rehabilitation in a negative manner. Quality of life is reduced in&#xD;
      persons with aphasia compared to stroke victims without aphasia. Speech and language therapy&#xD;
      is the main form of aphasia rehabilitation. The most updated Cochrane review indicates that&#xD;
      intensive speech and language therapy is more effective than therapy of lower intensity.&#xD;
      Current aphasia services in Norway do not seem to be in accordance with the national&#xD;
      guidelines for treatment and rehabilitation of stroke. The capacity for aphasia&#xD;
      rehabilitation at the community level is too small and there is a lack of speech -language&#xD;
      pathologists (SLPs). Language training by videoconference could improve this unmet need for&#xD;
      language training in post stroke aphasia. The literature within this field is however sparse&#xD;
      and there is a substantial lack of studies showing the effectiveness of telerehabilitation.&#xD;
      Financed by the Norwegian Foundation for Health and Rehabilitation, the investigators have&#xD;
      earlier performed a feasibility study at Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital in cooperation with&#xD;
      the Norwegian Centre for Integrated Care and Telemedicine. This feasibility study showed that&#xD;
      language training by videoconference is feasible with regard to technical, practical and&#xD;
      rehabilitation aspects. The feasibility study laid ground for a larger and controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims at contributing with scientific evidence to the field of aphasia&#xD;
      telerehabilitation. The objective of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to&#xD;
      investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of speech and language training given by&#xD;
      videoconference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a pragmatic exploratory randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      (RCT) with an intervention and a control group. The patients will be assessed at inclusion&#xD;
      and before randomization (baseline), and at 4 weeks and 4 months post randomization. Testing&#xD;
      is blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the stroke units at Oslo University Hospital, Akershus&#xD;
      University Hospital, Østfold Hospital,and Bærum Hospital. Patients, who are admitted for&#xD;
      rehabilitation at Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital, will also be included. In addition,&#xD;
      patients earlier treated or on the waiting list at Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital, will be&#xD;
      invited to participate. The investigators will also try to recruit patients from other&#xD;
      rehabilitation institutions, and in cooperation with SLPs in the region of Oslo, Østfold and&#xD;
      Akershus. The investigators will also invite for participation through the Aphasia&#xD;
      Association of Norway (user organization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims at including 40 participants in each group, with a total number of 80&#xD;
      subjects. The investigators will include patients with aphasia in all stages following stroke&#xD;
      including naming impairment. Patients under the age of 16 years and patients, who are unable&#xD;
      to perform five hours of speech and language therapy per week due to medical or cognitive&#xD;
      reasons, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive speech and language therapy via videoconference while the&#xD;
      control group will not receive any specific therapy as part of this study. Both groups will&#xD;
      receive standard aphasia rehabilitation (usual care). The amount of standard aphasia&#xD;
      rehabilitation (usual care) will be logged in all participants. Participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive speech-language training (SLT) for five hours a week over&#xD;
      four consecutive weeks. The SLT will be performed by an SLP using videoconference via&#xD;
      internet from Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital to the laptop in the patient's home, or&#xD;
      rehabilitation/nursing ward. To secure treatment fidelity and replication for future studies,&#xD;
      the investigators have used the template for intervention description and replication&#xD;
      (TiDieR) checklist and guide to describe the intervention. The investigators will use the&#xD;
      technical solution &quot;Cisco Jabber Video/Acano&quot; and the remote control software &quot;LogMeIn&quot;, in&#xD;
      the telerehabilitation that is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stroke units will inform potential participants about the project and refer them to&#xD;
      Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital for further investigation. Potential participants, who are&#xD;
      patients at Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital, receive information about the project and an&#xD;
      invitation to take part in the trial. For recruitment from other rehabilitation institutions,&#xD;
      local speech and language therapists, and for members of the Aphasia association of Norway,&#xD;
      advertising in form of a flyer and a brochure is used. After referral an ambulatory visit by&#xD;
      the PhD-fellow or research SLP will be performed. Detailed information about the project will&#xD;
      be provided and the research investigator will request an informed consent before carrying&#xD;
      out baseline testing. Baseline assessment is blinded as it is performed before group&#xD;
      allocation. The four weeks control and follow-up-testing is performed by external SLPs&#xD;
      blinded to group allocation. Directly after the intervention period (four weeks), the&#xD;
      participant will be visited at home or come to the outpatient clinic at Sunnaas&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Hospital. The laptop will be retrieved and assessment performed. The control&#xD;
      group will be tested at the corresponding time point. A further follow-up assessment will be&#xD;
      performed four months post randomization in all participants. The four weeks control and&#xD;
      follow-up-testing is performed by external SLPs blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effect of aphasia rehabilitation delivered by telemedicine, the&#xD;
      investigators have chosen to look especially on naming as a measure of expressive language&#xD;
      function. The investigators want to regard the prolonged effect of aphasia telerehabilitation&#xD;
      on language function. Further on the investigators want to see the effect immediately after&#xD;
      intervention and on other language functions than naming. The investigators also want to&#xD;
      investigate whether SLT by videoconference can affect quality of life, if it is feasible and&#xD;
      how persons with aphasia and therapists experience the telerehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the assessment of language functioning, the Norwegian Basic Aphasia Assessment (NGA) with&#xD;
      the subtests conversational interview, naming, repetition and comprehension will be used.To&#xD;
      assess the ability of sentence production, the investigators will use the Verb and Sentence&#xD;
      Test (VAST) subtest sentence production. Functional communication will be assessed using&#xD;
      Communicative Effectiveness Index (CETI). Quality of life will be assessed using Stroke and&#xD;
      Aphasia Quality of Life scale (SAQOL-39). In addition, the experiences of patients, relatives&#xD;
      and therapists with the telerehabilitation services will be assessed using a questionnaire as&#xD;
      well as semi-structured interviews with selected patients. There will be an interview with&#xD;
      the SLPs performing the telerehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Naming ability four months post randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Language functions other than naming (repetition, comprehension, sentence production)&#xD;
           four months post randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional communication and quality of life four months post randomization..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Naming and other language functions immediately after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How the telerehabilitation is experienced by patients and SLPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility of telerehabilitation with regards to ethical, technical, logistic, patient&#xD;
           and data safety aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSES AND STATISTICS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use an intention to-treat (ITT) analysis. The trial is a longitudinal&#xD;
      study that will give continuous repeated measurements, and the data will be analyzed using&#xD;
      Mixed-models. Data will be examined for differences over time and between groups. Subgroup&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to explore factors considered to affect the outcome of the trial&#xD;
      like differences in time since onset of stroke or demographic and stroke-related factors.&#xD;
      Qualitative data collected from semi-structured interviews will be suitably coded.&#xD;
