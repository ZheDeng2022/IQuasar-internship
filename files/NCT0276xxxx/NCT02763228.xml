  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a physical activity (exercise)&#xD;
      program in the community will improve the functional and overall health status of older women&#xD;
      with a history of breast cancer. The physical activity or exercise program is designed for&#xD;
      all older breast cancer survivors, and in particular for African-Americans and women of lower&#xD;
      socio-economic status, who are the least likely to engage in physical activity.&#xD;

      Specific Aim #1: To determine the effect of a refined and culturally-sensitive physical&#xD;
      activity intervention on functional outcomes at 20 and 52 weeks among older Breast Cancer&#xD;
      survivors who are within five years of treatment completion for stage I-III Breast Cancer&#xD;
      (BCa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To examine whether race and socioeconomic status (SES) moderate the&#xD;
      intervention effect on physical activity (PA) levels and functional outcomes at 20 and 52&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: To examine the effect of the PA intervention on longitudinal changes in&#xD;
      beliefs, attitudes and preferences (KAPs) and PA levels, and the extent to which changes in&#xD;
      these factors mediate intervention effect on functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #4: To determine the effect of the PA intervention on surrogate biomarkers&#xD;
      associated with breast cancer prognosis and functional disability.&#xD;

    <description>The exercise in this study will consist of two types of exercise training: resistance training and aerobic exercise. Resistance training is like &quot;weight lifting&quot; to improve strength and function. Participants will complete resistance training by using resistance machines and free weights. Aerobic exercise is exercise that intends to improve the cardiopulmonary or oxygen/lung and heart systems. It is often referred to as &quot;cardio&quot; exercise. Treadmill walking, stationary cycling sessions, and/or other exercises will be used for aerobic exercise.&#xD;
Participants will be instructed in the exercise routine by physical fitness experts and trainers.</description>
