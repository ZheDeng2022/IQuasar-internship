    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the effectiveness of musical training in promoting happiness and&#xD;
      quality of life of preschool children from low-income families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the experimental group will attend a weekly 1-hour musical training lesson&#xD;
      for 12 weeks conducted by the Music Children Foundation. While participants in the waitlist&#xD;
      control group received the same training after the experimental group had completed the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children from low income families generally suffer from hard conditions,such as poor living&#xD;
      conditions, inadequate nutrition, and delay in accessing health care services. Such problems&#xD;
      may made children suffer from developmental problems and malnutrition and to have a lower&#xD;
      level of intelligence and difficulties in language comprehension, which may not only have&#xD;
      profound impacts on children's physical well-being, but on their psychological well-being as&#xD;
      well. Musical training is considered to have potential for promoting psychological well-being&#xD;
      among children mostly because music is found to be important to a child's early psychological&#xD;
      development. A growing number of educators and researchers suggest that, of all the stages of&#xD;
      life, infancy may be the time when music has the most important impact on an individual.&#xD;
      Babies hear language long before they are able to comprehend it. The quality and the quantity&#xD;
      of what is unconsciously absorbed in infancy relates directly to later development. Musical&#xD;
      training has been used for various purposes such as improving language development,&#xD;
      self-expression, memory skills, concentration, social interaction, fine motor skills,&#xD;
      listening, problem-solving, teamwork, goal setting, and coordination. More importantly, when&#xD;
      a child learns to sing and play music, other areas of development - creativity, family&#xD;
      bonding, self-esteem, confidence, emotional development - are also positively impacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, although musical training is popular and is considered to be a beneficial&#xD;
      intervention in the promotion of psychological well-being, longitudinal studies that examine&#xD;
      the efficacy of music-making in children from low-income families are limited. Importantly,&#xD;
      there is to date no study that examines the effects of musical training on enhancing the&#xD;
      psychological well-being among these children. There is an imperative need for rigorous&#xD;
      empirical scrutiny of the effectiveness of musical training in promoting the psychological&#xD;
      well-being of children from low-income families. Therefore, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      examine the effectiveness of musical training in promoting happiness and quality of life of&#xD;
      preschool children from low-income families.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects' quality of life will be assessed at 12 weeks after starting the intervention, using the Chinese version of the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scale (PedsQL 4.0).&#xD;
The parents will be asked to fill in this questionnaire for their children. The PedsQL is designed to measure children's healthrelated quality of life. It comprises 23 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale. These items are categorised into four domains: physical functioning (eight items), emotional functioning (five items), social functioning (five items) and school functioning (five items). The total possible range of scores is from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
