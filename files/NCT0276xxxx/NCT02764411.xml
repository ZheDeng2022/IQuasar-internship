  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capillary Malformations (CM) affect a significant proportion of otherwise healthy children&#xD;
      and may lead to psychological discomfort if left untreated. A significant proportion of&#xD;
      untreated lesions undergo soft tissue thickening and darker discoloration later in life due&#xD;
      to progressive ectasia of the affected vessels. While laser treatment is available, its use&#xD;
      may be limited due to need for repeated sedation/general anesthetic use, partial response and&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct an open-label, prospective, cohort study using Onreltea&#xD;
      ( Brimonidine) gel for treatment of facial capillary malformations in children. The study&#xD;
      medication will be applied topically on affected area of the skin daily for 12 weeks. Follow&#xD;
      up visits will occur at at Week 1,4,8,12, and 16 to assess the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      proposed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study second aim is to explore the feasibility of conducting a multicenter placebo&#xD;
      controlled study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are planning to enroll in the study 20 participants at SickKids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a prospective, open label, cohort study. Patients enrolled in the study will be&#xD;
      followed at the Hospital For Sick Children for 16 weeks. They will come for the study visits&#xD;
      6 times: in 1 week, 4,8,12, and 16 weeks after the treatment has been started. During each&#xD;
      study visit the study investigators will assess any changes in the characteristics of CM&#xD;
      lesion(s) captured by a Chromometer *, Analogue Scale and Erythema Assessment tools.&#xD;
      Participants or their parents will assess the changes at the final study visit (VAS and EA&#xD;
      tools).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be provided with study medication for all duration of the study treatment (12&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the treatment will be compared with the baseline data to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Onreltea (Brimonidine) gel in children with facial capillary malformations.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of erythema will be performed using Chroma Meter, CR-400, Konica, Minolta, Osaka, Japan. The meter readings will result in 3 values: L- refers to the relative light intensity, ranging from 0 (black) to +100 (white); a-captures color saturation, ranging from +60 (green) to -60 (red) and b- captures color spectrum from +60 (blue) to -60 (yellow). In most studies both, changes in a (Δa) and overall changes in the composite score (ΔE calculated as √((ΔL*before-ΔL*after)^2+(Δa*before-Δa*after)^2+(Δb*before-ΔL*after)^2 ) are obtained.</description>
