      Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the&#xD;
      world.There is to date no curative therapy for patients with IgAN.It is considered that&#xD;
      dendritic cells, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 and cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), and&#xD;
      interferon-alpha (IFN-a) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), play an important role in&#xD;
      the aberrant mucosal response. Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent and had a notable&#xD;
      impact on immune activation by the reduction of circulating activated immune cells that&#xD;
      including decreased TLR-expressing cells, reduced IFN-secreting plasmacytoid dendritic cells,&#xD;
      reduced production of inflammatory cytokines including interferon alpha, IL-6 and TNF alpha.&#xD;
      Recent studies showed hydroxychloroquine had a benefit for renal remission and could retard&#xD;
      the onset of renal damage in patients with lupus nephritis. hydroxychloroquine may have the&#xD;
      potential effect in IgA nephropathy, alleviated the proteinuria and had the renal protect&#xD;
      effect. This will be a single center, prospective, randomized, controlled study to assess the&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the&#xD;
      world. Its estimated frequency is at least 2.5 cases per year per 100,000 adults. The&#xD;
      glomerulopathy usually progressed slowly leading to end stage renal disease (ESRD). ESRD&#xD;
      developed in 20%-40% of patients after 20 years. Given its complex and as yet incompletely&#xD;
      understood pathogenetic mechanisms, there is to date no curative therapy for patients with&#xD;
      IgAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although pathogenesis of IgAN is still obscure, underglycosylated IgA-containing&#xD;
      immune-complex including IgG or IgA antibodies against the hinge region of IgA1 are key&#xD;
      factors for IgA nephropathy. Aberrant mucosal immune response might lead to increased&#xD;
      production of underglycosylated IgA1. It is considered that dendritic cells, Toll-like&#xD;
      receptor (TLR)9, and cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), , interferon-alpha (IFN-a) and tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), play an important role in the aberrant mucosal response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent and had a notable impact on immune activation by&#xD;
      the reduction of circulating activated immune cells that including decreased TLR-expressing&#xD;
      cells, reduced IFN-secreting plasmacytoid dendritic cells, reduced production of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines including interferon alpha, IL-6 and TNF alpha. Recent studies showed&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine had a benefit for renal remission and could retard the onset of renal&#xD;
      damage in patients with lupus nephritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, hydroxychloroquine, targeting dendritic cells, TLR, IL-6, IFN-α and TNF-α，may have&#xD;
      the potential effect in IgA nephropathy, alleviated the proteinuria and had the renal protect&#xD;
      effect. This will be a single center, prospective, randomized, controlled study to assess the&#xD;
      utility of hydroxychloroquine added to valsartan in IgAN patients.&#xD;
