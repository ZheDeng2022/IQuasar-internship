      Background and aim: Postoperative pain is an adverse effect of oral surgeries and may&#xD;
      therefore be prevented or minimized. This study compares the efficacy of preemptive ibuprofen&#xD;
      and dexamethasone protocols in pain prevention and control after surgical implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: For this prospective, double-masked, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial, 117 dental implants were placed. The groups received three different&#xD;
      protocols 1 hour before surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 600 mg ibuprofen (and another 600 mg dose 6 hours after the first dose);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 4 mg dexamethasone (and another 4 mg 6 hours after the first dose) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue medication (1000 mg acetaminophen) was given to each patient who was instructed to&#xD;
      take it if necessary. Pain intensity was evaluated by a 101-point numeric rate scale and&#xD;
      visual analogue scale, additionally discomfort was evaluated using a four-point verbal rate&#xD;
      scale, hourly for the first 8 hours after surgery and three times a day on the following 3&#xD;
      days.&#xD;

    <description>a visual analog scale (VAS) consisting of a 10-cm line with two extremes at either end; &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;pain that could not be more severe&quot;. Patients were asked to mark a point on the line that represented their level of perceived pain.</description>
