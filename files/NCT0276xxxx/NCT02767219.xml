  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III randomised controlled pilot study which aims to assess the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the use of bevacizumab in patients who have undergone trabeculectomy surgery, which appear&#xD;
      to be showing early signs of failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacological enhancement of trabeculectomy using Mitomycin C (MMC) has significantly&#xD;
      improved success rates. Despite this, some patients still mount aggressive scarring responses&#xD;
      post-operatively and require additional subconjunctival injections of antifibrotic agents,&#xD;
      such as 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) to reduce scar formation and reduce the likelihood of surgical&#xD;
      failure. There is concern that these agents are potentially toxic and may result in side&#xD;
      effects such as keratopathy (loss of corneal epithelium) and are also painful for the&#xD;
      patient. For those patients that are showing clinical evidence of potential scar formation, a&#xD;
      more predictable and less toxic modulator of wound healing is desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been associated with angiogenesis in numerous&#xD;
      pathological situations, including tumor growth, proliferative retinopathy, and rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. VEGF is also thought to play a pivotal role in ocular wound healing. It mediates&#xD;
      the signal transduction cascade leading to tenon's fibroblast migration and proliferation and&#xD;
      collagen gel contraction at the site of surgery, as well as angiogenesis. VEGF also causes&#xD;
      persistent vascular permeability and vasodilation at the level of existing microvessels.&#xD;
      Vessels with increased permeability are typically tortuous and dilated and this is the&#xD;
      clinical appearance within the conjunctiva, suggestive of future excessive wound healing and&#xD;
      scar formation following trabeculectomy. Early interventions such as subconjunctival&#xD;
      injections of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) are therefore often considered when these clinical&#xD;
      findings are apparent, in order to modify the course of wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a pilot study looking at the effect of serial injections of&#xD;
      bevacizumab (an anti-VEGF agent) on modifying the wound healing response in patients showing&#xD;
      early signs of future failure, compared to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). The purpose of the pilot is&#xD;
      to also gather outcome data and information relating to safety and recruitment with a view to&#xD;
      powering a definitive study addressing this issue.&#xD;
