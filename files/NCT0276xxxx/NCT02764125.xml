      This will be a randomised, crossover, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled,&#xD;
      multicentre, phase II proof-of-concept study in PD patients with end-of-dose wearing-off&#xD;
      (motor fluctuations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a 2-period crossover design the subjects will receive ODM-104/levodopa/ carbidopa or&#xD;
      Stalevo during the different study periods in a randomised order. There will be a screening&#xD;
      period, 2 treatment periods and a post-treatment period, altogether 7 scheduled visits: a&#xD;
      screening visit, a baseline visit, 4 visits during the treatment periods (i.e. 2 visits/each&#xD;
      period), and an end-of-study visit. Unscheduled visits may be performed during the first 2&#xD;
      weeks of each treatment period, if there is a need to adjust the levodopa strength. The total&#xD;
      study duration will be 10-15 weeks for each subject.&#xD;
