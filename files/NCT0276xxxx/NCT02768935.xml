  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is growing steadily. Patients with diabetes, cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications (such as myocardial infarction (MI)) are more frequent and severe than in&#xD;
      non-diabetic subjects. The anti-diabetic therapies available have little or no effect on the&#xD;
      incidence of cardiovascular events. It is therefore urgent in diabetics develop new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies to reduce the occurrence of MI or limit the consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the two weeks following MI, monocytes / macrophages are the most represented in the&#xD;
      ischemic heart tissue cells. The infiltration by monocytes / macrophages after infarction MI&#xD;
      is a two-phase process. In the first phase, monocytes / macrophages M1 promote digestion&#xD;
      injured areas, and monocytes / macrophages M2 intervene to promote angiogenesis, collagen&#xD;
      deposition and contribute to tissue repair. The optimal repair after myocardial infarction&#xD;
      depends on effective recruitment of monocytes and macrophages M1 transition needed to digest&#xD;
      the damaged tissue and M2 macrophages necessary for tissue repair. The balance between these&#xD;
      two phenotypes M1 and M2 is controlled by different modulators, such as transcription&#xD;
      factors, cellular miRNA and miRNA extracellular contained in the microvesicles (MVs).&#xD;
      Interestingly, plasma MVs circulating essentially derived monocytes and platelets contain&#xD;
      miRNA and are impaired by inflammation or during various pathological situations (such as&#xD;
      IDM). Furthermore, metabolic disorders such as hypercholesterolemia (often associated with&#xD;
      diabetes) affect the transition from M1 to M2 response and response delay cardiac repair. To&#xD;
      date, the mechanisms that control the M1 / M2 transition at heart level are not elucidated.&#xD;
      Moreover, the impact of diabetes, which leads to chronic low-grade inflammation, is not&#xD;
      explored. Targeting the immune response by promoting the transition M1 / M2 after MI could be&#xD;
      an innovative therapeutic approach. However, better characterization of the response of M1&#xD;
      and M2 macrophages after MI and the mechanisms by which they contribute to tissue remodeling&#xD;
      and the effect of diabetes are needed. The goal is to study how the phenotypes / macrophage&#xD;
      functions after MI are changed by diabetes and to determine the potential role of miRNAs&#xD;
      contained in secreted MVs in the transition M1 / M2 after MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monocytes / macrophages from subjects with normal blood sugar or diabetes who underwent an&#xD;
      IDM (10 per group) will be characterized phenotypically. Their ability to produce MVs will be&#xD;
      analyzed. These MVs will be tested functionally for their ability to orient the polarization&#xD;
      of healthy recipients monocytes. The content of these MVs in terms of miRNAs will be analyzed&#xD;
      in detail. By bioinformatics analysis, some miRNAs of interest (based on their abundance and&#xD;
      target genes) will be selected. These miRNAs are over-expressed in macrophages and MVs&#xD;
      produced by these cells will be analyzed for their ability to modulate differentiation of&#xD;
      monocytes recipients. Finally, the circulating levels of these miRNAs of interest will be&#xD;
      measured after 1 year of IDM and will be correlated to the clinical phenotype of patients&#xD;
      (recurrence, arrhythmias, heart failure). Ultimately, the goal is to identify VMs that can&#xD;
      promote the differentiation of monocytes to an alternative phenotype and identify miRNAs&#xD;
      responsible for this effect. This could help in the future, in a subject with impaired&#xD;
      ability of monocytes to differentiate alternatively, can change by introducing the miRNA of&#xD;
      interest to re-inject or inject MVs macrophage containing the miRNA of interest and thus&#xD;
      correct the defect of differentiation.&#xD;
