      Striving Towards Empowerment and Medication Adherence (STEP-AD) is a research study aimed at&#xD;
      developing an intervention for Black women living with HIV to address psychosocial factors&#xD;
      (i.e. abuse/trauma histories, racial discrimination, HIV stigma/discrimination, and&#xD;
      prescribed traditional gender roles) that have been associated with medication nonadherence&#xD;
      or poor HIV outcomes (e.g. viral load, CD4), but are unaddressed in existing interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among Black women with HIV in the U.S, generally low rates of adherence to ART are likely due&#xD;
      to relevant psychosocial and contextual factors facing Black women with HIV, such as having a&#xD;
      history of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, post traumatic stress, racial&#xD;
      discrimination, and contextual variables related to traditional gender roles; each of which&#xD;
      are associated with worse HIV outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the need, there is currently no evidenced-based psychosocial intervention for Black&#xD;
      women with HIV that addresses these contextual factors to improve adherence to HIV self-care.&#xD;
      A psychosocial intervention including content on reducing the effects of trauma and&#xD;
      discrimination and increasing resilient coping strategies and gender empowerment may be most&#xD;
      culturally appropriate, and therefore effective, in improving quality of life and increasing&#xD;
      treatment adherence in Black women living with HIV/AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Striving Towards Empowerment and Medication Adherence (STEP-AD) is a research study aimed at&#xD;
      developing an intervention for Black women living with HIV to address psychosocial factors&#xD;
      (i.e. abuse/trauma histories, racial discrimination, HIV stigma/discrimination, and&#xD;
      prescribed traditional gender roles) that have been associated with medication nonadherence&#xD;
      or poor HIV outcomes (e.g. viral load, CD4), but are unaddressed in existing interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual, in-depth qualitative interviews (n=30) were conducted with Black women with HIV&#xD;
      and community stakeholders to gather information on the perceived acceptability and to inform&#xD;
      the development of a manualized intervention of an integrated treatment to improve ART&#xD;
      adherence by addressing trauma symptoms, racial discrimination, HIV discrimination, and&#xD;
      gender related stressors experienced by Black women with HIV. This information was used to&#xD;
      develop the resulting intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open pilot trial (n=5) of the resulting intervention was conducted (December 2015 through&#xD;
      August 2016) in order to initially assess the feasibility of all study procedures and&#xD;
      intervention delivery, acceptability, and a potential clinically significant improvement on&#xD;
      ART adherence and hypothesized psychosocial mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot randomized control trial (RCT) comparing the newly developed intervention (N=25) to&#xD;
      an enhanced treatment as usual control (N=25) on ART adherence (primary outcome) and viral&#xD;
      load (secondary outcome) over 6 months (baseline, 10 weekly treatment visits [approximately 3&#xD;
      months], and a 6 month follow-up) begun enrolling participants as of August 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actual enrollment at baseline for all the phases are below. Please note that not all&#xD;
      participants enrolled at baseline moved on to the relevant phase due the need to meet&#xD;
      inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formative qualitative phase: 30 Black women living with HIV, 15 community Stakeholders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open Pilot phase: 20 Black women living with HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot RCT: 119 Black women living with HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total: 184&#xD;
