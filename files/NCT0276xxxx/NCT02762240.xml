    <textblock>
      Accreditation is used increasingly in health systems worldwide. However, there is a lack of&#xD;
      evidence of the effectiveness of accreditation. The overall aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a mandatory accreditation in general practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accreditation has become a widespread tool for quality control and development, and large&#xD;
      resources are spent upon development and implementation of accreditation systems in health&#xD;
      care systems all over the world. Accreditation of healthcare systems has met some critique.&#xD;
      Evidence for positive effects of accreditation has been called for, and health care&#xD;
      professionals have expressed concerns about extra hours imposed by accreditation. However,&#xD;
      only few studies have evaluated the effects of accreditation on central items, such as&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. In general, the results from the different types&#xD;
      of studies are ambiguous and there are only few well-accomplished effect studies. Hence, only&#xD;
      two effect studies met the methodological inclusion criteria of a recent Cochrane review.&#xD;
      None of these studies treated general practice. A review regarding status of accreditation in&#xD;
      primary care concluded that there is a dearth of research on the nature and uptake of&#xD;
      accreditation in this sector along with how accreditation affects outcomes of care, and&#xD;
      whether it is an effective method to improve quality, perceptions of care, healthcare&#xD;
      utilisation and costs. Two studies provided evidence to suggest that accreditation status was&#xD;
      associated with infection control procedures, risk management programmes and quality&#xD;
      improvement activities and after-treatment plans. However, in the latter case, post hoc&#xD;
      analysis revealed that accreditation was associated with units' organizational contexts and&#xD;
      referral sources as well as the nature of the competitive environment. The authors concluded&#xD;
      that accreditation and licensing might reveal as much about a care units' institutional&#xD;
      environments as about the quality of treatment provided. Accreditation is a relatively new&#xD;
      instrument in general practice and its effects on clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      general practitioners' (GPs') job satisfaction and organisational aspects must be evaluated&#xD;
      in order to assess the overall utility for patients and society. Although accreditation has&#xD;
      been implemented in general practice in nine European countries, and in Australia and New&#xD;
      Zealand, research elucidating the effects of accreditation in general practice system, is&#xD;
      strongly needed. In spite of this lack of evidence for effect of accreditation on clinical&#xD;
      and patient related objectives, it has been decided to implement accreditation as a mandatory&#xD;
      instrument in Danish general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish Healthcare Quality Programme (DHQP) is based on general principles for&#xD;
      accreditation. The model contains a set of accreditation standards as well as an&#xD;
      accreditation process. Accreditation has for a longer time period been mandatory in the&#xD;
      secondary healthcare system in Denmark, and it has now been decided to include general&#xD;
      practice as well. Hence, the DHQP has been adjusted to general practice. DHQP for general&#xD;
      practice consists of 16 standards with associated indicators within the following areas: 1.&#xD;
      Quality and patient safety, 2. Patient safety critical standards, 3. Good patient continuity&#xD;
      of care, 4. Management and organisation. The first practices are accredited in January 2016,&#xD;
      and at the end of 2018 all Danish practices should be accredited. An exception is practices&#xD;
      with expected termination within 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since accreditation is a complex intervention, containing several dimensions and active&#xD;
      components, it is of great importance to elucidate these processes and mechanisms that become&#xD;
      evident with the roll-out and implementation of accreditation and to examine the possible&#xD;
      impact, accreditation may have on health care within primary care.&#xD;
