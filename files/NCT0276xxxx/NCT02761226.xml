    <textblock>
      Implants have become the preferred method of single tooth replacement these days, patients&#xD;
      receiving implant treatments not only expect restoration of masticatory function, they also&#xD;
      expect that the prostheses will be esthetically pleasing, easy to clean, and permanent. To&#xD;
      maintain long-term implant stability, it is important to minimize bone loss around the&#xD;
      implant, as well as the soft tissue atrophy that accompanies it.&#xD;

      The peri-implant bone level has been used as one of the criteria to assess the success of&#xD;
      dental implants, Platform switching (PLS) for maintaining peri-implant bone levels has gained&#xD;
      popularity among implant manufacturers over the last few years. However, the assumption that&#xD;
      the inward shifting of the implant- abutment junction may preserve crestal bone was primarily&#xD;
      based on serendipitous finding rather than scientific evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that saucerization around an implant occurs following abutment connection using a&#xD;
      submerged implant with a butt joint (a two-stage approach), such as the Branemark implant.&#xD;
      The nature of saucerization varies according to implant type (one-stage or two-stage) and&#xD;
      abutment connection type. they have reported that the factors that are the most likely causes&#xD;
      of early crestal bone loss around implants are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The micro-gap,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The implant crest module,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Occlusal overload, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The biologic width around the dental implant. At the Toronto Conference 1998, the&#xD;
           consensus with respect to bone loss around the implant was that bone loss of up to&#xD;
           approximately 2 mm during the first year of implant function is acceptable, and at this&#xD;
           level the implant is regarded as successful. There have been many reports on studies to&#xD;
           ascertain the causes of bone loss around implants and clinical techniques to prevent it.&#xD;
           Some reports published in 2005 and 2006 state that the platform switching technique, a&#xD;
           technique in which an abutment that is one-size smaller than the implant platform is&#xD;
           placed, prevents bone loss around the implant. However, there are only a few reports on&#xD;
           the mechanism of action or the extent of bone loss prevention, and as such, it is&#xD;
           difficult to say that the effect of PLS has been thoroughly examined. This review&#xD;
           article examines the PLS technique and the bone loss preventive effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lot of clinical studies discussed the concept of platform switching was extensively studied&#xD;
      histologically and biomechanically. In histomorphometric studies in dogs was no significant&#xD;
      difference in the marginal bone level around platform- switched and -matched implants after&#xD;
      28 days of healing. In contrast, other studies reported a significantly less bone loss around&#xD;
      platform-switched implants after a loading period of 2 to 6months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no consistency among the studies with respect to the study design (e.g. the&#xD;
      location and depth of the implant, and controlled/non-controlled), and as such, it is&#xD;
      difficult to evaluate all of these studies using the same evaluation method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The review and meta-analysis show that platform switching may preserve interimplant bone&#xD;
      height and soft tissue levels. The degree of marginal bone resorption is inversely related to&#xD;
      the extent of the implant- abutment mismatch. But still no general agreement to confirm the&#xD;
      validity of this concept, so Further long-term, well-conducted, randomized controlled studies&#xD;
      are needed to confirm the validity of this concept.&#xD;
