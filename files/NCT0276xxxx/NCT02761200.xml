  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory study is designed to ensure the safety of HIV-infected volunteers who&#xD;
      complete research protocols that include an analytic treatment interruption (ATI). This is a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study of volunteers who were diagnosed with HIV during early acute HIV&#xD;
      infection, treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and subsequently enrolled in a clinical&#xD;
      study that included ATI. After completion of study participation that involves ATI,&#xD;
      participants will be recruited into this study for continued clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;

      This exploratory study is designed to ensure the safety of HIV-infected volunteers who&#xD;
      complete research protocols that include an analytic treatment interruption (ATI). This is a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study of volunteers who were diagnosed with HIV during early acute HIV&#xD;
      infection, treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and subsequently enrolled in a clinical&#xD;
      study that included ATI. After completion of study participation that involves ATI,&#xD;
      participants will be recruited into this study for continued clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      monitoring. Participants without any indication for resumption of ART and who desire to&#xD;
      remain off ART at the time of entry into this study will be monitored closely for HIV viremia&#xD;
      and other pre-defined criteria for ART resumption. Participants with any indication for ART&#xD;
      at the time of enrollment into this protocol, including patient preference for resumption of&#xD;
      ART, will be monitored closely for virologic and immunologic response to ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical study visits will take place at the Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, and the&#xD;
      optional procedures may occur at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Required&#xD;
      laboratory studies that are outlined in this protocol will occur in lieu of those described&#xD;
      in the RV 254 protocol. Volunteers may provide separate informed consent for optional&#xD;
      procedures to include collection of genital secretions, colon biopsy, inguinal lymph node&#xD;
      biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection via lumbar puncture, and brain Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI)/Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)/Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI).&#xD;
      With separate informed consent, willing participants will undergo archival of peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells and plasma specimens for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll volunteers aged 18 years and older who have completed clinical studies&#xD;
      that include ATI in Bangkok, Thailand. Enrollment in this study will be concurrent with&#xD;
      completion of the study with ATI. Participants will fall broadly into one of two categories:&#xD;
      those on ART and those not on ART at the completion of the prior study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ongoing parent study, RV 254 (SEARCH 010, WRAIR 1494), enrolls participants with&#xD;
      documented acute HIV infection at the Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Center in Bangkok,&#xD;
      Thailand. Participants in the cohort are primarily men who have sex with men, but also&#xD;
      include men and women with other HIV acquisition risk factors as well as various ages,&#xD;
      incomes, and education levels. All participants in RV 254 are offered ART at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment through a separately funded protocol. Participants in this substudy will remain&#xD;
      co-enrolled in RV254/SEARCH010, but will follow the schedule of event (SOE) for this&#xD;
      sub-study in lieu of the parent study SOE.&#xD;
