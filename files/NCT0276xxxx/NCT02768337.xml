      Proof of principle phase 1b / randomised phase 2 study of afatinib penetration into cerebral&#xD;
      metastases for patients undergoing neurosurgical resection, both with and without prior&#xD;
      low-dose, targeted radiotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occur in 20-40% of all patients with cancer, with an incidence 10 times&#xD;
      higher than that of primary malignant brain tumours. patients with brain metastases are an&#xD;
      underserved population. Overall they have a poor prognosis with a median survival of 1-2&#xD;
      months with corticosteroids and only 5-7 months after whole brain radiotherapy. An important&#xD;
      factor in the poor prognosis of patients with brain metastases is the inability of many drugs&#xD;
      to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier into tumour tissue.Combination therapy with surgical&#xD;
      excision, radiotherapy and novel drugs could potentially improve the prognosis for some&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CamBMT1 is an open label, 3 Arm randomised Phase 2 trial investigating whether administration&#xD;
      of a low dose of targeted radiotherapy during afatinib treatment could increase the&#xD;
      concentration of drug penetration into brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients in Phase 2 will be randomised to 1 of 3 Arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: no radiotherapy Arm 2: 2Gy radiotherapy Arm 3: 4Gy radiotherapy All patients will also&#xD;
      receive 11 days of afatinib treatment at the recommended Phase 2 dose, previously determined&#xD;
      in a Phase 1b safety run-in phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 10, of afatinib treatment patients randomised to Arms 2 or 3 will receive their&#xD;
      allocated dose of radiotherapy On Day 12, patients will undergo neurosurgical resection of&#xD;
      their brain metastasis/ses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up on Day 22-28 and on Day 41 +/- 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcome measure, samples for measurement of plasma concentration of afatinib&#xD;
      will be taken pre-treatment, on day 10 and Day 12 post-resection. Tumour tissue from the&#xD;
      resected brain metastasis will be taken on day 12 for measurement of afatinib concentration.&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the ratio of these concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population studied will be breast/likely breast or lung/likely lung primary&#xD;
      cancers with operable brain metastases.&#xD;
