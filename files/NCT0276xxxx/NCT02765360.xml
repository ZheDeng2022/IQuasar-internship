      Patients with severe respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD) or obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) can benefit from having non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV). NIV consists of a machine (ventilator) that is blowing air inside a&#xD;
      patient's airway through a mask. NIV provides patients with a bigger breath. Bigger breaths&#xD;
      help patients to have a more oxygen and less waste gas (or carbon dioxide) in their body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These changes can improve outcomes and quality of life. In order to provide appropriate&#xD;
      ventilation for each patient, the ventilator can generate different types of blowing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which delivers a constant flow of air through&#xD;
           the mask&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pressure support ventilation (PSV) which delivers a constant flow of air through the&#xD;
           mask and, on top of that, delivers more flow when the patient begins to inhale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volume targeted ventilation which delivers a flow of air through the mask that is&#xD;
           adjusted breath by breath in order to achieve a preset volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These different type of blowing have consequences on patient comfort as well as on the&#xD;
      improvement of their ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the improvement of the ventilation, currently blood tests are used, however, these&#xD;
      reflect overall output and may miss more subtle changes in breathing that could affect how&#xD;
      patients feel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a new technology that involves wearing a belt of&#xD;
      sensors around the chest that provides information on how well the lungs are being filled&#xD;
      with air by the ventilator. It allows a non-invasive assessment of the effect of NIV on lung&#xD;
      ventilation in real-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to use the EIT technology to assess in real-time patients lung&#xD;
      ventilation when they are using the NIV. The investigators hope that EIT will provide&#xD;
      information on which type of blowing is more effective and more comfortable than the others.&#xD;

      Chronic lung disease can sometimes progress to the extent that patients can no longer clear&#xD;
      the waste gas from their blood. Treatment can be offered with a mask and machine (ventilator)&#xD;
      that helps people breathe and aims to improve their lung condition. It is common for people's&#xD;
      lungs to be affected variably, i.e. left more than right or top of lung more than bases of&#xD;
      lungs. The way in which the ventilator is set may affect how well the machine deals with&#xD;
      these differences. If the lung is better ventilator patients may find the machine more&#xD;
      comfortable and it may be more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a new technology that involves wearing a belt of&#xD;
      sensors around the chest that provides information on how well the lungs are being filled&#xD;
      with air by the ventilator. It allows the assessment of these differences, which previously&#xD;
      required the use of invasive equipment to obtain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimising ventilator settings in the administration of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) can be&#xD;
      improved with the addition of individual physiological data. This approach is limited due to&#xD;
      the invasive techniques required to obtain this information, often leading to less ideal NIV&#xD;
      settings promoting patient-ventilator asynchrony. It has been recently demonstrated by our&#xD;
      group that all patients established on domiciliary NIV have a degree of patient-ventilator&#xD;
      asynchrony and that the commonest type of asynchrony are triggering issues. Triggering&#xD;
      asynchrony is promoted by mismatch between a patient's intrinsic positive end-expiratory&#xD;
      pressure (iPEEP) and applied expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) with these&#xD;
      ineffective efforts contributing to an increased work of breathing and patient discomfort.&#xD;
      Previous strategies used to optimise patient triggering have involved the placement of&#xD;
      oesophageal catheters in order to measure neural respiratory drive (NRD) to the diaphragm by&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG) but again this process is invasive and often poorly tolerated.&#xD;
      Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, bedside monitoring technique that&#xD;
      provides semi-continuous, real-time information about the regional distribution of the&#xD;
      changes in electrical resistivity of the lung tissue due to variations in ventilation in&#xD;
      relation to a reference state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information is gained by repeatedly injecting small alternating electric currents (usually 5&#xD;
      mA) at high frequency of 50 - 80 kHz through a system of skin electrodes (usually 16) applied&#xD;
      circumferentially around the thorax in a single plane between the 4th and 6th intercostal&#xD;
      space. While an adjacent pair of electrodes 'injects' the current ('adjacent drive&#xD;
      configuration'), all the remaining adjacent passive electrode pairs measure the differences&#xD;
      in electric potential. A resistivity (impedance) image is reconstructed from this data by a&#xD;
      mathematical algorithm using a two dimensional model and a simplified shape to represent the&#xD;
      thoracic cross-section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting image possesses a high temporal and functional resolution making it possible to&#xD;
      monitor dynamic physiological phenomena (e.g. delay in regional inflation or recruitment) on&#xD;
      a breath by breath basis. It is important to realize that the EIT images are based on image&#xD;
      reconstruction techniques that require at least one measurement on a well-defined reference&#xD;
      state. All quantitative data are related to this reference and can only indirectly quantify&#xD;
      (relative) changes in local lung impedance (but not absolute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EIT can be used in mechanically ventilated patients to assess recruitment and to optimise&#xD;
      ventilator settings to reduce risk of iatrogenic ventilator associated lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the supine posture obese patients can generate significant levels of iPEEP that contribute&#xD;
      to increased levels of neural respiratory drive compared with the upright posture. There has&#xD;
      been much debate regarding the optimal ventilator strategy in patients with obesity related&#xD;
      respiratory failure, with uncontrolled trial data to support simple continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure, pressure support (PSV) NIV and volume targeted (VT) NIV. There has been no&#xD;
      robust evidence to suggest superiority of a single mode but post hoc data suggests superior&#xD;
      control of sleep disordered breathing in patients in pressure controlled mode. It is unclear&#xD;
      whether the extended inspiratory time of pressure controlled mode is allowing superior gas&#xD;
      exchange by maintaining airway distension and preventing regional collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In COPD, patients' response to treatment can be influenced by disease heterogeneity with some&#xD;
      patients showing even distribution of lung damage and others marked differences throughout&#xD;
      the lungs. This variation can lead to significant differences in the lung mechanics in&#xD;
      different regions with optimal NIV settings for some regions having potentially deleterious&#xD;
      effects on neighbouring zones. It has been shown that control of hypoventilation and improved&#xD;
      blood gas exchange is essential in order to improve outcomes with NIV in COPD but is less&#xD;
      clear if pressure control ventilation as advocated by Windisch and colleagues is required in&#xD;
      order to achieve this effect. Inappropriate settings of NIV can also lead to dynamic&#xD;
      distension that results in a decrease of tidal volume and an increase in patient discomfort.&#xD;
