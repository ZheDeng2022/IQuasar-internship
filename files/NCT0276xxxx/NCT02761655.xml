    <textblock>
      Background and Purpose: Previous studies indicate that baseline cognitive abilities,&#xD;
      especially prospective memory (PM) significantly influence medication adherence. However,&#xD;
      there are only three qualified intervention studies on adherences in persons with cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (PWCIs). In addition, family caregivers (FCGs) are often asked to assist PWCIs in&#xD;
      managing their medication but FCGs' medication administration hassles are not intensively&#xD;
      investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to test the effectiveness and&#xD;
      efficacy of a theoretical-based multifaceted memory intervention on medication administration&#xD;
      and quality of life in PWCIs living at home and medication administration hassle of their&#xD;
      FCGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a three-year project (2015, 8, 1-2018, 7, 31). The aims of the&#xD;
      first-year study are: 1.to develop a multifaceted memory intervention based on the paradigm&#xD;
      of prospective memory (PM); 2. to pilot test the feasibility of the multifaceted memory&#xD;
      intervention through a small randomized control trial. The aims of the second- to third year&#xD;
      study are: 3. to examine the effectiveness and efficacy of the intervention (a randomized&#xD;
      control trial). The intervention group will receive a cognitive impairment education,&#xD;
      medication adherence and memory strategies training, while the control group will receive&#xD;
      only the cognitive impairment education program. The duration of the intervention is one&#xD;
      month. There will be 4 data collections (baseline, post-intervention 2 4, 6 months). Sample&#xD;
      size estimation for the pilot study is 5 dyads for each group. Sample size for the randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial is 84 dyads (42 dyads per group). After the attrition rate (10%) is counted,&#xD;
      in total, there will be 200 cases (100 dyads). Implications of this project: This three-year&#xD;
      program can help to identify those who may benefit from memory training and assist those who&#xD;
      may be incompetent living in community. Also this program will extend the current knowledge&#xD;
      of the role of PM playing in medication adherence behavior and its relationships with self&#xD;
      awareness as well as everyday decision making among PWCIs. In addition, health related&#xD;
      professionals can improve PWCI's quality of care and reduce FCG hassle by applying a&#xD;
      theoretical guided practice for memory training.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      These dyad participants are given more information and a follow up phone call to schedule a&#xD;
      home visit for initial screening(24&lt;MMSE&lt;27). During the home visit, the participants will be&#xD;
      given the consent forms and explanation of this project regarding the purpose, length of data&#xD;
      collection and the types of measures of this study. Investigator will use the electronic&#xD;
      monitoring system (EMS) developed by Professor Heh's lab, Chung Yuan Christian University in&#xD;
      the Phase I to monitor the medication adherence behavior and pilot test its agreement with&#xD;
      the pill count and the FCG observation diary. Investigator will apply for the compensations&#xD;
      for participants for who finish the initial adherence observation (4 weeks) (baseline data&#xD;
      collection). Those who are enrolled for the 6 month intervention phase will receive&#xD;
      additional compensation if funded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research assistants are those who received training in the previous project (MOST&#xD;
      102-2314-B-182-050-MY2) but investigator will recruit a new part-time research assistant, a&#xD;
      nursing master student, to receive a one-month training course, including: the purpose of&#xD;
      this study, the procedures for recruitment, test battery interview skills, the test battery&#xD;
      scoring system, data collection using the EMS, data download from the EMS, and basic&#xD;
      statistical techniques. Then the newly trained part-time assistant will go to the&#xD;
      participating sites for observing at least three PWCIs, practicing the interview skills with&#xD;
      dyads, and familiarize herself with the outpatient clinical operational system. The on-site&#xD;
      participant physicians in the memory disorder clinics will receive a written letter to&#xD;
      explain the purpose of this project and the eligible criteria for the dyads. These physicians&#xD;
      will help investigators to identify eligible dyads, while trained research assistants will&#xD;
      implement the intervention and education program. The part-time student assistant is&#xD;
      responsible for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of investigators team. The PI and most of the co-PIs come from the same&#xD;
      research lab-Healthy Aging Research Center, Cognitive and Behavioral Indices Lab, Chang Gung&#xD;
      University. This lab targets on populations such as normal older adults and those with&#xD;
      dementia and disability. Investigator have developed own assessment tools and platform used&#xD;
      to share the data such as the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ). In&#xD;
      the future, Investigator may share imaging technology. Therefore, investigators team has the&#xD;
      advantages of integration of expertise. Interactions between experts will facilitate the&#xD;
      progress of this project. Specifically, Dr. Hsu (a neurologist) will provide the clinical&#xD;
      utility that ensures formal diagnosis and assessment for PWCIs. The external consultant (a&#xD;
      psychologist), Professor Hua, will assist in administering psychometric tests, interpretation&#xD;
      of data, and consultation on the content of intervention. Investigator have international&#xD;
      collaboration partners such as Professor Jersey Liang from the University of Michigan, USA&#xD;
      for longitudinal and experimental data analyses consultation and Dr. Heather Wilkinson from&#xD;
      Edinburgh University, UK to focus on the dementia friendly community issues. Investigator&#xD;
      hold monthly research meeting in the lab. Finally, the PI has research collaboration with&#xD;
      Professor Heh, Chung Yuan Christian University, on the work of interactive mathematic&#xD;
      training APP for MCI patients. Based on this foundation, Investigator will continue to&#xD;
      develop the EMS in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (1st year) procedures. After the dyads sign on the consented forms, Investigator&#xD;
      spend about 3 hours to collect demographic data, test battery and teach the dyads how to move&#xD;
      of patient's medication into the EMS box which contains a sensor to record when the container&#xD;
      is opened. Investigator tell the dyads that the box can help patients count their medication&#xD;
      pills and it must be used in each medication-taking event. Investigator also teach FCGs how&#xD;
      to fill out a medication diary with their observation of patients' medication taking&#xD;
      behavior. For those who have their own medication organizers, Investigator ask them to move&#xD;
      one of their medications into the system for consistent measure. The baseline observation of&#xD;
      medication adherence will last 4 weeks to screen out those who do not have adherence problems&#xD;
      which are defined as adherence is less than or equal to 90% of the inter-dose interval over&#xD;
      this 4-week medication monitoring period. The rationale for this inclusion criterion is that&#xD;
      other studies found that using the EMS introduces some novelty that can initially boost&#xD;
      adherence. Since the EMS is new to the participants who may experience this novelty,&#xD;
      Investigator will adopt this stringent criterion comparing with the general definition of&#xD;
      medication adherence &gt;= 80% the inter-dose interval. At the end of 4 weeks, the trained&#xD;
      part-time student assistant will down load the medication adherence data and remove the&#xD;
      system from the dyad's house. If the PWCIs have multiple medications, Investigator will&#xD;
      select only one (prioritizing order: dementia treatment, antipsychotic medicine,&#xD;
      antihypertensive medicine). All the participant dyads will take turns to use the EMS system.&#xD;
      During the first 6 months of the first year, Investigator will develop the teaching material&#xD;
      and a protocol for phase I pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention procedures in the pilot study consists of 5 stages: (1) initial home visit&#xD;
      for baseline data collection; (2) measurement of baseline adherence over 4 weeks; (3) random&#xD;
      assignment for eligible participants who sign on the informed consent forms to either&#xD;
      intervention group or the educational comparison group; (4) four weekly in-home nurse visit&#xD;
      to deliver the intervention or education control to the dyads; (5) adherence monitoring and&#xD;
      outcome measures (over a 6 month period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the dyad participants are referred by the physicians, they will go through the&#xD;
      five-stage procedures to collect baseline data and 4-week adherence data (week 1 to week 4).&#xD;
      Then the dyads will be randomly assigned into one of the two conditions. Different trained&#xD;
      research assistants will conduct follow-up four-weekly in-home visits (week 5-8) to deliver&#xD;
      the intervention or the educational comparison. During the follow-up (week5-8) home visit,&#xD;
      research nurses assigned to the intervention group will review the recommended strategies and&#xD;
      tailor these strategies based on individual differences and difficulties in implementing the&#xD;
      strategies. Problem-solving will be used to help the dyads. This intervention dose is similar&#xD;
      to other studies but we include FCGs to participate in this study and control for PWCIs'&#xD;
      awareness levels and their medical decision making capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fidelity of the intervention will be monitored by a PhD student, using a voice recorder&#xD;
      on the intervention nurse' interactions with the dyads. Investigator will track the fidelity&#xD;
      whether the intervention protocol is followed. Any difference from the intervention protocol&#xD;
      will be examined by reviewing the voice records. Fidelity in the education control group will&#xD;
      be monitored by the same procedures as well. To prevent loss of 5-month medication adherence&#xD;
      after the end of the 1 month intervention phase, a research assistant will conduct home&#xD;
      visits of the dyads every 2 months to download the medication adherence data from the EMS and&#xD;
      serve as a memory cue to remind the PWCIs to take their medication. This is a strategy&#xD;
      consist with investigator's PM theory as well as Insel et al. and may strengthen the&#xD;
      multifaceted memory intervention. However, the research assistant(s) making visits will be&#xD;
      careful not to discuss the intervention in both education and intervention conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blindness. To avoid bias, the PI and the part-time student nurse who collect data as well as&#xD;
      the participating physicians can be blind to the condition status of the dyads. Investigator&#xD;
      will hire two research assistant(s): one to conduct the memory intervention and the other to&#xD;
      conduct the education intervention without inference from each other. These procedures can&#xD;
      ensure the double blindness in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Indicators for the Phase I-pilot study. The feasibility indicators for the pilot&#xD;
      study include the recruitment rate (60%), attrition rates (&lt; 20%), and protocol completion&#xD;
      rates (&gt;80%) based on investigator's previous research experiences of recruiting PWCIs into a&#xD;
      multiple stimulation intervention through leisure activities.&#xD;
