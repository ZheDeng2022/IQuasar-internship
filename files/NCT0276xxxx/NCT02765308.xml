  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis is a disease that affects over 2 million people around the globe, and can ultimately&#xD;
      lead to blindness. The proportion of patients with uveitis who become blind has not been&#xD;
      reduced over the past 30 years, and this is therefore an area that demands further research.&#xD;
      One of the major causes of blindness in uveitic patients is the development of uveitic&#xD;
      glaucoma, which occurs in 10-20% of uveitic eyes. This is likely to occur for reasons related&#xD;
      to the uveitis itself, but can also be caused as a side effect of the corticosteroids used to&#xD;
      treat uveitis. The raised IOP in uveitis is more difficult to treat than other types of&#xD;
      glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enable more effective treatment of uveitic glaucoma, the investigators need to understand&#xD;
      more clearly the mechanisms which underlie this process. The investigators therefore propose&#xD;
      a study to examine the contribution of altered aqueous dynamics to the development of raised&#xD;
      IOP in uveitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to undertake a cross-sectional observational study of patients with&#xD;
      recurrent idiopathic acute anterior uveitis, to determine the relative contributions of&#xD;
      altered aqueous production and drainage to the development of raised IOP in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design A cross sectional observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection All subjects attending the uveitis and glaucoma clinics at St Thomas'&#xD;
      Hospital will be eligible to be included in the study if they fulfil the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients will be included from each of these three group of patients: 1) recurrent (&gt; 5&#xD;
      attacks) idiopathic acute anterior uveitic with raised intraocular pressure; 2) recurrent (&gt;&#xD;
      5 attacks) idiopathic acute anterior uveitic without raised intraocular pressure; 3) healthy&#xD;
      age matched volunteers as controls. Patients on glaucoma treatment will be washed out for one&#xD;
      month before measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination Schedule and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual acuity:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visual acuity is measured before pupil dilation, tonometry, gonioscopy, or any other&#xD;
           technique that could affect vision. Two different techniques are used to measure visual&#xD;
           acuity, including Snellen and ETDRS visual acuity testing. Refraction is performed prior&#xD;
           to formal measurement of visual acuity by either technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjective Refraction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is permissible to use a phoropter or trial frame to determine best-corrected Snellen&#xD;
           visual acuity. The left eye is occluded first. An approximate beginning refraction may&#xD;
           be determined by retinoscopy, automated refraction, or a subjective refraction from a&#xD;
           prior visit. The sphere is refined first. The cylinder is then refined, first the axis&#xD;
           followed by the power. Finally, the sphere is rechecked. The right eye is then occluded,&#xD;
           and the procedure is repeated for the left eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the patient wears contact lenses and has glasses also, he or she is instructed not to&#xD;
           wear the contact lenses on the day of the assessment. Patients unwilling to discontinue&#xD;
           contact lens use after surgery will be excluded from the study. In the event that the&#xD;
           patient either has no glasses or has forgotten the instructions and reported for the&#xD;
           assessment wearing contact lenses, the contact lenses are removed and at least thirty&#xD;
           minutes allowed to elapse before subjective refraction and visual acuity testing is&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ETDRS Visual Acuity:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The logmar visual acuity testing for the Uveitic Glaucoma study has been adapted from&#xD;
           the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy (ETDRS) at 4 metres. The logmar visual&#xD;
           acuity scale facilitates statistical analysis and simplifies quantification of acuity at&#xD;
           various distances. The right eye is tested with ETDRS logmar chart 1, then the left eye&#xD;
           is tested with ETDRS logmar chart 2. Each chart is hidden from view until the eye being&#xD;
           examined is ready for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Snellen Visual Acuity:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Snellen visual acuity may be measured using any standard visual acuity chart. The same&#xD;
           type of chart must be used throughout the duration of the study. Standardized refraction&#xD;
           is performed prior to Snellen visual acuity testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Slit lamp biomicroscopy Examination of the anterior segment using slit lamp&#xD;
           biomicroscopy will be performed. Slit lamp biomicroscopy may be performed with any&#xD;
           commercially available instrument, and it is used in a standard fashion starting&#xD;
           anteriorly and working posteriorly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gonioscopy Gonioscopy is performed with the patient sitting at the slit lamp using&#xD;
           either a Zeiss type four-mirror gonioprism or Goldmann single- or three-mirror lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pachymetry Central corneal thickness is measured with ultrasound pachymetry. The right&#xD;
           eye is tested first. A drop of 0.5% proparacaine is instilled for anesthesia. The&#xD;
           patient is asked to look straight ahead at a distant object or fixation target. The&#xD;
           pachymeter probe is lined up with the center of the pupil and slowly advanced until it&#xD;
           contacts the cornea. The probe is withdrawn when an audible signal is made indicating&#xD;
           that a measurement has been recorded. The patient is instructed to blink. The procedure&#xD;
           is repeated to obtain three separate readings, and the investigator records the&#xD;
           measurements. After testing of the right eye is complete, the same technique is applied&#xD;
           to testing of the left eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Biometry A Carl Zeiss IOL Master will be used to carry out biometry and assess anterior&#xD;
           chamber depth using A-scan ultrasound. This is a non-contact examination technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Fundoscopy A dilated fundus examination is performed. After pupil dilation with&#xD;
           appropriate mydriatics, the optic nerve and posterior pole are examined at the slit lamp&#xD;
           using Volk 90 diopter, 78 diopter, or 60 diopter lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Flurophotometry The night before (10 PM) the fluorophotometric scans, participants will&#xD;
           self-administered 3 to 6 drops of fluorescein sodium 2% (Minims, Bausch&amp;Lomb, UK)&#xD;
           topically into both eyes at 5 minutes interval depending on their age (age 25 years or&#xD;
           younger, 5-6 drops; age 26 to 35 years, four drops; over 35 years of age, three drops).&#xD;
           Fluorophotometry will be performed in both eyes using a scanning ocular fluorophotometer&#xD;
           from 9AM to 12PM (FM-2, Fluorotron Master Ocular Fluorophotometer; OcuMetrics, Mountain&#xD;
           View, California). The aqueous turnover protocol will be used to calculate the aqueous&#xD;
           flow rate. Duplicate or triplicate scans will be collected and repeated at 1 hour&#xD;
           intervals for 4 measurements to determine the aqueous flow rate (Ft). Following each set&#xD;
           of scans, IOP will be measured using pneumatonometry (Model 30 Classic, Reichert&#xD;
           Ophthalmic Instruments, Depew, New York). IOP will be recorded as the arithmetic mean of&#xD;
           a total of 12 measurements per eye: 3 measurements every hour alternating between eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Tonography Tonographic outflow facility (C) will be performed using an electronic&#xD;
           Schiøtz tonographer (Model 720, Berkeley Bioengineering Inc, USA) at 10AM. The facility&#xD;
           of outflow will be calculated from the rate of decay of intraocular pressure in the&#xD;
           supine position during application of a recording Schiøtz tonometer over a period of 4&#xD;
           minutes with a standard 5.5 gram weight. The &quot;R&quot; values of the curve at every 30-second&#xD;
           time point will be manually entered into the McLaren tonography computer program. The&#xD;
           program fits a second-degree polynomial by least squares to the nine data points and&#xD;
           determines the best-fit values for time 0 and time 4 minutes by extrapolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Uveoscleral outflow will be calculated using the Goldmann's equation with an assumed&#xD;
           episcleral venous of 8, 9, 10 or 11 mmHg. Ft is the rate of aqueous humor formation, C&#xD;
           is the tonographic facility of outflow, IOP is the intraocular pressure, Pv is the&#xD;
           episcleral venous pressure and Fu is the uveoscleral outflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ft = C (IOP-Pv) +Fu Fu = Ft-C (IOP-Pv)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Only one randomly (Excel random number generator) chosen eye per participant will be&#xD;
           included in the data analysis when both eyes fulfilled the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Visual fields Quantitative automated perimetry is performed using the Humphrey Field&#xD;
           Analyzer. Visual field testing is performed before tonometry, gonioscopy, or any other&#xD;
           technique that could affect vision. A visual field should be attempted in any eye that&#xD;
           has sufficient vision to permit finger counting at two feet. Eyes with poor central&#xD;
           vision may have an intact, off-center island of vision which may be measured with&#xD;
           perimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 24-2 threshold test is performed in all patients using a size III white stimulus. Visual&#xD;
      field testing may be performed with the Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm (SITA) or&#xD;
      full threshold strategy, but the same testing strategy must be used throughout the duration&#xD;
      of the study. The pupil diameter should be 3 mm or greater before visual field testing is&#xD;
      undertaken, and this may require pharmacologic dilation. Standardized refraction is performed&#xD;
      to determine the patient's distance refraction and best-corrected visual acuity prior to&#xD;
      visual field testing. The age appropriate plus lens is added to the distance refraction.&#xD;
      Patient education is provided, and the instrument is set up for the test. The technician&#xD;
      should monitor the patient during testing. Visual fields are performed preoperatively (within&#xD;
      one month of enrollment in the study) and annually thereafter. Copies of all visual fields&#xD;
      are faxed to the Statistical Coordinating Center for evaluation.&#xD;
