      The natural history and response to therapy of chronic hepatitis B infection in West Africa&#xD;
      are currently poorly understood. In this study, employees of the Cameroon Baptist Convention&#xD;
      Health Board (CBCHB) and spouses who are found to be hepatitis B positive on screening will&#xD;
      be offered enrollment. Disease monitoring and treatment will be provided following current&#xD;
      WHO guidelines. Clinical data will be prospectively recorded for 5 years, and bio-specimens&#xD;
      will be frozen for future analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is common in Cameroon, and hepatitis B-related hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma is a leading cause of cancer death throughout West and Central Africa. Little is&#xD;
      known about the natural history of CHB in sub-Saharan Africa and the long term response to&#xD;
      antiviral therapy. The study hypothesis is that these can be determined by prospective&#xD;
      follow-up of a population-based cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims, purpose, or objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the characteristics of a population of asymptomatic Cameroonian adults who&#xD;
           work for the Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Board (CBCHB) who have chronic hepatitis&#xD;
           B infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the phase of infection into which these Hepatitis B carriers fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the incidence and risk factors for cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and&#xD;
           hepatocellular carcinoma in this cohort over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To offer treatment according to a standardized protocol, and to determine the outcome of&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To archive serum samples from patients for potential future studies of specific markers&#xD;
           associated with hepatitis B and liver disease outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Adult employees of the Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Board (CBCHB) and their&#xD;
      spouses who are known to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg+) will be offered&#xD;
      the enrollment in a cohort study for CHB. Following enrollment, their stage of disease will&#xD;
      be determined using clinical, laboratory and imaging studies. Patients will then be followed&#xD;
      at regular intervals for 5 years. Antiviral therapy will be offered to patients who qualify&#xD;
      according to current World Health Organization guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This protocol will prospectively determine the scope of CHB-related illness in&#xD;
      an initially asymptomatic, population-based cohort and the outcomes of current WHO treatment&#xD;
      guidelines in this African cohort.&#xD;
