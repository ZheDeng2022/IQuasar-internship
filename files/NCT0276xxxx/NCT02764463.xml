      This prospective clinical study evaluated the performance of indirect, posterior&#xD;
      occlusal-retained, fiber-reinforced-composite restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Between June 1999 and June 2000, a total of 58 patients aged between 33 and 62 years&#xD;
      old ( 33 male, 25 female) received 65 FCRFPD prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All restorations were made indirectly on a plaster model using unidirectional E-glass fibers&#xD;
      (Vectris- Ivoclar Vivadent, liechtenstein) in combination with a laboratory resin composite&#xD;
      (Signum, Heraeus-Kulzer) and cemented according to the instructions of resin cement Variolink&#xD;
      II (Ivoclar Vivadent). After baseline recordings, patients were followed at 6 months and&#xD;
      thereafter annually up to 15 years. The evaluation protocol involved technical (chipping,&#xD;
      debonding or fracture of tooth/restoration) and biological failures (caries).&#xD;

      As of January 1999, FRC FDPs are offered as alternative to other conventional therapy options&#xD;
      at the Department where the study was conducted. Between June-1999 and June-2000, 58 patients&#xD;
      aged between 33 and 62 years old (25 females, 33 males, mean age: 47) received 65 indirect&#xD;
      posterior FRC FDPs. Before enrolment in the trial, all patients were provided with a written&#xD;
      informed consent Information was given to each patient regarding the alternative treatment&#xD;
      options. The inclusion criteria were as follows: all subjects were required to be at least 18&#xD;
      years old, able to read and sign the informed consent document, physically and&#xD;
      psychologically able to tolerate conventional restorative procedures, having no active&#xD;
      periodontal or pulpal diseases, having no primary caries, not allergic to resin-based&#xD;
      materials, not pregnant or nursing, having antagonist teeth opposing the FRC FDP to be&#xD;
      restored, willing to return for follow-up examinations as outlined by the investigators. The&#xD;
      patients who had more absent teeth than the tooth to be replaced in the rest of the dentition&#xD;
      or those having diastemas were not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the restorations were performed by a single operator, selected considering his clinical&#xD;
      experience (&gt;10 years since graduation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All FDPs replaced one missing tooth and bonded to two adjacent abutment teeth were used for&#xD;
      retention. No cantilever FDPs were involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment was performed in two sessions: 1) Teeth preparation and Impression taking and model&#xD;
      analysis, 2) Try-in, cementation and polishing of the FDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first session, after an accurate evaluation of spaces and residual dental tissues and&#xD;
      the acceptance of this type of treatment by the patient, pillar teeth were prepared using&#xD;
      diamond bur on high speed handpiece with mesio-occlusal, disto-occlusal, MOD, onlay or&#xD;
      overlay preparations according to each clinical situation. Cavity preparation is required not&#xD;
      only to remove all carious tissue, but to create a minimal space necessary to the glass&#xD;
      fibers to support occlusal loads. According to &quot;Munack&quot; a cavity with 2x2mm occlusal surface&#xD;
      and 2mm depth is able to support a 600N masticatory stress before breaking, and by increasing&#xD;
      depth to 4mm we can reach 700N.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cavity designs are realized following these criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      minimum preparation depth of 2.5mm minimum cavity width of 2mm divergent proximal boxes&#xD;
      bucco-lingual width of proximal boxes at least 3.5m round internal angles. Cavity&#xD;
      preparations were done under rubber dam with a diamond bur (100micron) with high-speed&#xD;
      handpiece, in case of carious tissue this was removed finely. After finishing, all cavities&#xD;
      were cleaned with air-water spray and gently air-dried in order to apply 37% phosphoric acid&#xD;
      etchant gel on enamel and dentin. The cavities were then rinsed for 30 s with air-water spray&#xD;
      and dried using suction to keep some moisture in dentin and a layer of bonding is applied&#xD;
      onto the surface and light-cured. Composite material was applied in the cavities in order to&#xD;
      create a block-out, that will eliminate undercuts and increase thickness of residual walls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparations were then finished and polished with fine grain burs(60 and 40 micron&#xD;
      respectively). After removing rubber dam, complete arch impressions were taken with a&#xD;
      polyether material followed by disinfecting the impressions for 10 min . Provisional&#xD;
      restorations were placed with eugenol-free temporary cement . Dental impressions and&#xD;
      photographs are sent to dental technician for FRCFPD fabrication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FRC FDPs were made in one dental laboratory on the full arch plaster cast. The model was&#xD;
      first isolated with two coats of isolation medium. One unidirectional pre-impregnated E-glass&#xD;
      fibers (Vectris- Ivoclar Vivadent, Lienchestein) was used to reinforce the veneering&#xD;
      composite. Each bundle consists of about 4000 glass fibers, with a diameter of 1.7 mm,&#xD;
      embedded in a PMMA/bis-GMA matrix. Before the fibers were placed on the cast, a layer of&#xD;
      composite was applied into the interproximal-occlusal box of the abutment teeth. The fiber&#xD;
      bundle was placed in the bed of the flowable resin using metal hand instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After photo-polymerization with a halogen polymerization unit (light output: 1200 mw/cm2),&#xD;
      the framework was veneered with a resin composite An opaque resin was used in some cases to&#xD;
      improve the optical properties. The veneering resin composite was built incrementally; the&#xD;
      construction was polymerized for the final time with a heat-light polymerization oven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second session, after rubber dam placement and removal of provisional restorations,&#xD;
      the teeth were cleaned with a prophylaxis brush and pumice. After try-in of the FRCFPD to&#xD;
      check proximal contacts and marginal fit, all adhesive surfaces of the restoration were&#xD;
      sandblasted, and then cleaned with ethanol and air-dried.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cementation surface of the FDP was treated with resin monomer of the corresponding resin&#xD;
      cement using a micro brush (Heliobond Ivoclar Vivadent, liechtenstein). The resin was left&#xD;
      unpolymerized, shielded from light, for at least 5 minutes to allow the resin to penetrate&#xD;
      and activate the IPN-phase of the polymethacrylate polymer matrix of the FRC framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tooth surface was prepared for adhesion by applying a three step etch and rinse adhesive.&#xD;
      After removal of excess resin, all restorations were cemented using a resin cement Variolink&#xD;
      II . light-cured for 40s on each surface (lingual, labial, mesial, distal) (Astralis 10, SN&#xD;
      018766, Ivoclar Vivadent, light output: 1200 mW/cm2). Static and dynamic occlusion was&#xD;
      adjusted using fine grit diamond burs. The power output of the unit was measured with a&#xD;
      radiometer ( before the placement of each restoration. After polymerization, restoration&#xD;
      margins were finished. Occlusion was adjusted with fine diamond burs (60- and 40-Âµm grit) and&#xD;
      finally, the restoration was polished with pointed silicon polishers and abrasive polishing&#xD;
      brushes. Patients received individual instructions to maintain plaque control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One operator applied all the restorations who has experience in adhesive dentistry (&gt;10 years&#xD;
      since graduation).&#xD;
