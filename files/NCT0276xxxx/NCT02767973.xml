      Purpose: This screening protocol is designed to assess PMN (neutrophil) responsiveness to&#xD;
      wood smoke particles (WSP) and the effect of the GSTM1 null genotype on this response. The&#xD;
      researches will identify persons responsive and resistant to the inflammatory effect of WSP.&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the GSTM1 genotype will be a risk factor for increased response to&#xD;
      WSP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Particulate matter (PM) is a leading cause of respiratory tract and cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      the United States and world-wide. Wood smoke particles (WSP) derived from wild land and other&#xD;
      fires account for a significant fraction of ambient air PM. Health effects associated with&#xD;
      WSP include acute bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, cough and systemic&#xD;
      inflammation. While these effects are seen in both healthy and asthmatic individuals, many&#xD;
      studies indicate that asthmatics have increased susceptibility to the effects of WSP. Though&#xD;
      WSP-related effects on cardiovascular (CV) disease are less well documented, WSP do&#xD;
      contribute to PM levels, and PM exposure is linked to CV health effects (changes in heart&#xD;
      rate variability, vascular reactivity, and lipid profiles). WSP from wild land fires can&#xD;
      cause abrupt increases in ambient air PM 2.5 levels (mean levels ~250µg/m3, peak levels &gt;1000&#xD;
      µg/m3). Avoidance of rapidly increasing PM air pollution due to wild land fires is not&#xD;
      feasible, as many people cannot leave the burn region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a screening protocol to ensure that there ultimately will be adequate subjects&#xD;
      available for testing gamma tocopherol in an appropriate population. It will identify&#xD;
      volunteers who have a ≥10% increase in %PMNs following WSP challenge over baseline values&#xD;
      (SA1). This screening procedure will identify various risk factors that may increase risk of&#xD;
      experiencing airway inflammation and related adverse health outcomes following WSP exposure.&#xD;
      The GSTM1- genotype is a risk factor that has been extensively explored. Researchers at the&#xD;
      CEMALB have reported that GSTM1- healthy volunteers (HVs) have increased inflammatory and&#xD;
      systemic responses to O3 and various components of PM (LPS70 and Diesel exhaust particles).&#xD;
      Using the 10% increase in %PMNs to define PMN responsiveness, results showed that GSTM1-&#xD;
      volunteers had a 13 fold higher risk of being PMN responders to 0.06 ppm O3. When examining&#xD;
      %PMNs as a continuous measure, it was observed that GSTM1- volunteers have increased airway&#xD;
      PMN response O3 as well as increased airway and systemic PMN response to LPS70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers at the CEMALB have also examined various response features of 27 individuals&#xD;
      (13 healthy, 4 allergic non asthmatics, 10 allergic asthmatics) defined as being responsive&#xD;
      (R, n=18) or non-responsive (NR, n=9) to O3 based on airway PMN influx (%PMNs). Among the&#xD;
      factors explored were inflammatory responses, baseline characteristics and gene expression&#xD;
      profiles in recovered sputum cells. The researchers have also observed that within&#xD;
      individuals, PMN response to O3 and LPS correlate, and anticipate that WSP will induce&#xD;
      inflammatory responses via mechanisms similar to those for these pollutants.&#xD;
