    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of triple combination therapy with an&#xD;
      anti-integrin (vedolizumab intravenous [IV]), a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist&#xD;
      (adalimumab subcutaneously [SC]), and an immunomodulator (oral methotrexate) on endoscopic&#xD;
      remission in participants with newly-diagnosed CD stratified at higher risk for&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to&#xD;
      treat people who have CD. This study will look at the endoscopic remission and mucosal&#xD;
      healing of gastrointestinal tract of people who take vedolizumab as triple combination&#xD;
      therapy with adalimumab and methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 60 participants. Participants will receive triple&#xD;
      combination therapy which includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg (intravenous)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adalimumab 160/80/40 mg (subcutaneous)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methotrexate 15 mg (oral)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive vedolizumab intravenous infusion on Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22&#xD;
      along with adalimumab 160 mg, subcutaneous injection at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, then 40 mg&#xD;
      once at Week 4 and every 2 weeks thereafter until Week 26 along with methotrexate tablets&#xD;
      orally, once weekly from Weeks 0 up to Week 34. In monotherapy phase, all participants will&#xD;
      receive vedolizumab intravenous infusion once at Weeks 30, 38, 46, 54, 62, 70, 78, 86, 94 and&#xD;
      102.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time&#xD;
      to participate in this study is 128 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the&#xD;
      clinic, plus a final visit 18 weeks after last dose of study drug for a safety follow-up&#xD;
      assessment. Participants will also participate in a long-term safety questionnaire, by phone,&#xD;
      at 26 weeks (6 months) from the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Endoscopic Remission at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic remission was defined as simple endoscopic score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) scale score from 0-2. The SES-CD evaluated 4 endoscopic variables (ulcer size, proportion of the surface area that was ulcerated, proportion of the surface area affected, and stenosis in 5 colonic segments evaluated during ileocolonoscopy (ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum). The score for each endoscopic variable was the sum of values obtained for each segment. The SES-CD total was the sum of the 4 endoscopic variable scores from 0 to 56, where higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>

        <description>Endoscopic remission was defined as simple endoscopic score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) scale score from 0-2. The SES-CD evaluated 4 endoscopic variables (ulcer size, proportion of the surface area that was ulcerated, proportion of the surface area affected, and stenosis in 5 colonic segments evaluated during ileocolonoscopy (ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum). The score for each endoscopic variable was the sum of values obtained for each segment. The SES-CD total was the sum of the 4 endoscopic variable scores from 0 to 56, where higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>
