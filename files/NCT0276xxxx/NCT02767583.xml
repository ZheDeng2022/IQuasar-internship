      Background / rational:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is associated with significant comorbidities including type 2 diabetes (insulin&#xD;
      resistance), heart disease, stroke, hypertension, sleep apnea syndrome, dyslipidemia, cancer,&#xD;
      hepatobiliary diseases, orthopedic complications and psychosocial impact 1 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral neuropathy is a known complication in the type I and II diabetes and glucose&#xD;
      intolerance and metabolic syndrome in 2. Outside of diabetes (type I and II) that are&#xD;
      associated with cardiovascular risk high vascular, presence of metabolic syndrome constitutes&#xD;
      in itself a well demonstrated vascular risk factor. Its definition requires the presence of&#xD;
      three elements from the following 5: abdominal obesity (high waist circumference), high blood&#xD;
      pressure, high fasting blood sugar, high triglycerides and / low HDL-cholesterol 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This peripheral neuropathy predominantly affects sensory fibers of small poorly myelinated&#xD;
      diameter (Aδ fibers and C) and autonomous sensory fibers and is called small fiber neuropathy&#xD;
      4. The cardinal sign of NAION is the presence of neuropathic pain but abnormalities in&#xD;
      physical examination are often absent and conventional electromyography is faulted to make&#xD;
      the diagnosis. These small fibers are also constituent of the autonomic nervous system and&#xD;
      causes damage autonomic dysfunction that can manifest the cardiovascular system (hypotension,&#xD;
      cardiac conduction disorders), digestive, sweat, sphincter. neuropathy of the diagnosis of&#xD;
      small fibers is suggested clinically by the presence of neuropathic pain often contrasting&#xD;
      with a normal clinical examination. The confirmation is based on electrophysiology with&#xD;
      various techniques and quantification of intra-epidermal nerve fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective / secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the prevalence of a small fiber peripheral neuropathy in nondiabetic obese&#xD;
      patients, by measuring skin conductance ion Chlorine (Sudoscan®) evaluating small fibers C&#xD;
      autonomic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the prevalence of occurrence of peripheral neuropathy by Sudoscan® during&#xD;
           follow-up after treatment of obese patients with bariatric surgery (months) M1, 3, 6, 9,&#xD;
           12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of results obtained Sudoscan® quantitative sensory testing (QST) Thermotest®&#xD;
           evaluating small sensory fibers Aδ, among non-operated non-diabetic obese patients and&#xD;
           in the postoperative follow-up (months) M1, 3, 6, 9, 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterization of electromyographic parameters (motor and sensory conduction) in&#xD;
           patients with a skin conductance measured by lowered Sudoscan® and / or a threshold of&#xD;
           sensitivity to pain increased Thermotest®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation between the presence of a small fiber neuropathy in non-diabetic obese&#xD;
           subjects with clinical and biological parameters collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Design: prospective, single-center Study duration: 24 months (estimate: 3-5&#xD;
      patients included / week of 15 patients collected in central obesity / week) including 12&#xD;
      months of inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of topics to include: 100 over a period of one year to adjust to the rhythm of the&#xD;
      inclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned, patients will be a measure of impedance of the skin to products chlorine ions&#xD;
      by the sweat glands via the Sudoscan®, marketed and used among diabetic patients or not for&#xD;
      the detection of violations neuropathic (cf. references and CE certificate attached to the&#xD;
      dossier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Thermotest® is also marketed and used in diabetic and non-diabetic patients (see&#xD;
      references and CE certificate attached to the dossier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our center has gained experience of these techniques for the detection of peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy in several patient populations (diabetes and cancer in particular); manipulators&#xD;
      (doctors and technicians) are trained in these techniques.&#xD;

      Development of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients the eligibility criteria, it will be proposed at the first consultation in&#xD;
      central obesity, participate in a clinical study to assess the prevalence of subclinical&#xD;
      damage peripheral nerves by simple and painless rapid measurement of skin conductance on the&#xD;
      palm of the feet with the Sudoscan® device during the consultation and a Thermotest®, as well&#xD;
      as monitoring during the various follow-up consultation after any bariatric surgery or not.&#xD;
      This monitoring will be done by the same neurophysiological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the preoperative assessment that will be conducted in the planned hospital in&#xD;
           Diabetology Service, written information will be given to patient and no objection will&#xD;
           be drawn, then the following tests will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The measurement of skin conductance by Sudoscan® and the extent of the painful&#xD;
           sensitivity to temperature Thermotest® will be made for all patients included in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the records Sudoscan® skin conductance less than 60μS, we propose a&#xD;
           Electroneuromyography the patient as usual on GHPSJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of weight, height, waist circumference and hip circumference patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The DN4 scale and Uens clinical neuropathy score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A measurement of blood pressure will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A biological sample will be taken on an empty stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients with plantar skin conductance will be lowered &lt;60μSiemens and / or whose&#xD;
           pain threshold will warm significantly elevated (Thermotest®), if necessary&#xD;
           electromyogram will be realized in the second time (appointment given to the output&#xD;
           consultation with the endocrinologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the postoperative follow-up usually expected for this type of surgery, 1, 3, 6, 9&#xD;
           and 12 months will be made the same clinical examinations than those made during the&#xD;
           preoperative assessment and the type of surgery performed. Laboratory tests will be&#xD;
           carried out in the usual care for surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
