    <textblock>
      The immediate goal of the Imperial County CER Asthma project is to identify strategies to&#xD;
      improve asthma control among children 0-17 years old and the asthma control behaviors of&#xD;
      their families, their health care providers, and the communities in which they live. Our&#xD;
      long-term goal is to improve the quality of life of children with asthma and potentially&#xD;
      reduce families' economic and social burdens of uncontrolled asthma&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a prevalent chronic disease in rural and border communities along the U.S.-Mexico&#xD;
      border. Among 5-17 year olds, 20.2% have physician-diagnosed asthma compared to 16.2%&#xD;
      statewide. Risk factors for poor asthma control are well documented and include ambient air&#xD;
      quality, home environmental factors, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Although directionality&#xD;
      is not well established, obesity and poverty are related to asthma and are also prevalent in&#xD;
      the partner communities. These combined risk factors may explain the elevated rates of&#xD;
      emergency department use for asthma among children in Imperial County compared with the&#xD;
      state. Comprehensive approaches are needed that recognize and involve the various sectors&#xD;
      relevant to asthma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The Imperial County's Asthma CER project is a family-clinic-community&#xD;
      intervention designed to improve asthma control. The objectives of this study are to&#xD;
      determine whether this combined approach (family clinic-community) is more effective at&#xD;
      promoting asthma control, quality of life and improved lung functioning than a&#xD;
      family-community intervention, a clinic-community intervention, or a community only&#xD;
      intervention. The ultimate goal is to identify feasible and effective methods for promoting&#xD;
      lifelong asthma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a 2x2 factorial (family and clinic) study nested within a community&#xD;
      intervention. Four hundred children 6-17 years old and a parent/legal guardian will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate in the study which includes random assignment to family home&#xD;
      visitations or no family home visits. Assignment in the second factor (clinic) will be&#xD;
      determined based on whether the child is a patient of the partner clinic (Clínicas de Salud&#xD;
      del Pueblo, Inc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Outcomes: Changes in children's asthma control, quality of life, and lung functioning&#xD;
      will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partnerships to Facilitate Study: This study is a partnership between an academic/research&#xD;
      institute (San Diego State University and the Institute for Behavioral and Community Health)&#xD;
      with over 30 years of experience conducting rigorous public health research, a Federally&#xD;
      Qualified Health Center (Clínicas de Salud del Pueblo, Inc) with excellent reach and&#xD;
      credibility in the partner community, a community-based organization (Comité Cívico del&#xD;
      Valle) with extensive experience in promoting asthma control, and a division of the state&#xD;
      health department (California Breathing) responsible for asthma control efforts statewide.&#xD;
      Combined, they bring expertise in developing and implementing evidenced-based approaches for&#xD;
      real world settings to address urgent public health problems. Importantly, they have&#xD;
      successfully collaborated in the design, implementation and evaluation of over ten research&#xD;
      studies and/or projects within the last ten years.&#xD;
