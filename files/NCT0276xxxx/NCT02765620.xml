  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemo-radiotherapy and targeted therapy are widely used as non-surgical treatments for solid&#xD;
      tumors. Early assessment of treatment response is considered efficient and helpful to&#xD;
      clinical management and personalized therapy.RECIST 1.1 criteria was accepted widely.&#xD;
      Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease&#xD;
      (PD) are defined in the RECIST criteria. This type of classification divides intrinsically&#xD;
      continuous data (tumor size) into 4 bins, losing statistical power for ease of nomenclature&#xD;
      and convenience. The 18F-FDG PET exam is based on metabolic information and considered to&#xD;
      overcome limitations of anatomic imaging and more suitable for assessment of therapeutic&#xD;
      response.PERCIST 1.0 proposes a series of detailed and unambiguous regulations about&#xD;
      standardization procedures to ensure the reproducibility. Complete metabolic response (CMR),&#xD;
      partial metabolic response (PMR), stable metabolic disease (SMD), and progressive metabolic&#xD;
      disease (PMD) are defined in the PERCIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, there have several studies using metabolic-based PERCIST criteria in patients with&#xD;
      solid tumors, including lung cancer, digestive tumor and lymphoma, etc. But all of these&#xD;
      studies had limitations of small study sample, thus were need to be further investigated.&#xD;
      Compared to RECIST, the advantages of PERCIST were to evaluate chemotherapy, especially&#xD;
      targeted therapy, to distinguish PMR and SMD patients from SD group in RECIST, and to better&#xD;
      predict the response rate. Recently, several studies applied PERCIST criteria to evaluate&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer and rectal cancer, and revealed the metabolic&#xD;
      response results were well related to pathology. All these studies conclude PERCIST criteria&#xD;
      could help making clinical therapeutic decisions. Moreover, several studies have shown that&#xD;
      PERCIST has advantage in predicting early response of several malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this multicenter study is 1) to evaluate treatment response in newly diagnosed and&#xD;
      pre-therapeutic patients with solid tumors who are going to receive a baseline , an early&#xD;
      follow-up (after a certain period of treatment cycle) and a final (after treatment) 18F-FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT; 2) to compared PERCIST criteria to RECIST 1.1 criteria in prediction treatment&#xD;
      response, especially in early stage of treatment; 3) to reveal the value of PERCIST criteria&#xD;
      in clinical therapeutic management and tailed therapy.&#xD;

      Prospective Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET/CT scans were performed before treatment (baseline), after a certain period of&#xD;
      treatment cycle (early follow-up) and after the whole treatment process (final). Using&#xD;
      PERCIST 1.0 criteria in PET imaging and RECIST 1.1 criteria in CT imaging to monitor and&#xD;
      assess treatment response and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Early treatment response assessment: using baseline data and early follow-up data Base&#xD;
           on PERCIST 1.0 criteria, CMR, PMR and SMD were considered response; PMD was considered&#xD;
           non-response; Base on RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR, PR, SD were considered response; PD&#xD;
           considered non-response&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate treatment response: using baseline data, early follow-up data and final data&#xD;
           Base on PERCIST 1.0 criteria, CMR, PMR and SMD were considered response; PMD was&#xD;
           considered non-response; Base on RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR, PR, SD were considered&#xD;
           response; PD considered non-response&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare PERCIST to RECIST criteria: correlation analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate prognostic value: using baseline data, early follow-up data, final data as well&#xD;
           as follow up PFS and OS time (Kaplan-Meier survival plot)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      1)Clinical data: enroll patients according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, record all&#xD;
      clinical information and imaging data and keep to follow-up over one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2)18F-FDG PET/CT protocol: GE Discovery Elite PET/CT scanner was used in multicenter trials&#xD;
      with the same protocol. Patients were instructed to fast for at least 6 hours before 18F-FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT scan. Blood glucose level was measured before tracer was injected. Whole-body PET/CT&#xD;
      images, generally from the top of the skull to mid-thigh, were acquired 50~70 min after&#xD;
      intravenous injection of 18F-FDG at the dose of 0.08~0.10 mCi per kilograms of body weight.&#xD;
      Patients were asked to void their bladder immediately before scanning to minimize the&#xD;
      presence of the tracer in the urinary tract. PET data were acquired and reconstructed using&#xD;
      SharpIR+ VUE Point HD+TOF, 2min/bed. The PET data were attenuation corrected (AC) by the&#xD;
      integrated CTAC technology. CT data were acquired in breath-hold with 120 kV, 30-210 mA&#xD;
      modulated by GE SmartmA technique with a noise index of 25; with slice thickness 3.75 mm,&#xD;
      slice interval 3.27 mm, pitch 1.375, matrix size 512×512 and scan FOV 50cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3)Data archive: All clinical information and original DICOM data were archived in individual&#xD;
      institution. Post-processed results using PETVCAR software were archived and uploaded to&#xD;
      central server. Institutions without PETVCAR software need to uploaded PET/CT DICOM data to&#xD;
      central server which will be analysis by a certain physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4)Data Analysis: patient imaging data were analysis by more than three professional nuclear&#xD;
      medicine physicians in GE Advantage Workstation (AW) using PETVCAR software (based on RECIST&#xD;
      1.1 criteria and PERCIST 1.0 criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fig 1. RECIST1.1 and PERCIST1.0 criteria in PETVCAR software&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurable, unidimensional (LD only: size with conventional techniques≥20 mm, with spiral&#xD;
      CT≥10 mm; nodes: target short axis ±15 mm, nontarget 10- to 15-mm nodes, normal&lt; 10 mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonmeasurable: all other lesions, including small lesions; evaluable is not recommended&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target lesions (change in sum of LDs, maximum of 2 per organ up to 5 total [more than 1&#xD;
      organ]):&#xD;
&#xD;
      CR, disappearance of all target lesions, confirmed at ≥4 wk; PR, ≥30% decrease from baseline,&#xD;
      confirmed at 4 wk; PD, ≥20% increase over smallest sum observed and overall 5-mm net increase&#xD;
      or appearance of new lesions; SD, neither PR nor PD criteria met&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nontarget lesions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CR, disappearance of all nontarget lesions and normalization of tumor markers, confirmed at&#xD;
      ≥4 wk; PD, unequivocal progression of nontarget lesions or appearance of new lesions; non-PD:&#xD;
      persistence of one or more nontarget lesions or tumor markers above normal limits; PD must be&#xD;
      ''unequivocal'' in nontarget lesions (e.g., 75% increase in volume); PD can also be new&#xD;
      ''positive PET'' scan with confirmed anatomic progression. Stably positive PET is not PD if&#xD;
      it corresponds to anatomic non-PD&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERCIST 1.0 criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For target lesions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR: complete resolution of 18F-FDG uptake within measurable target lesion so that it is less&#xD;
      than mean liver activity and indistinguishable from surrounding background blood-pool levels.&#xD;
      Disappearance of all other lesions to background bloodpool levels. Percentage decline in SUL&#xD;
      should be recorded from measurable region, as well as (ideally) time in weeks after treatment&#xD;
      was begun. No new 18F-FDG-avid lesions in pattern typical of cancer. If progression by&#xD;
      RECIST, must verify with follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PMR: reduction of minimum of 30% in target measurable tumor 18F-FDG SUL peak. Absolute drop&#xD;
      in SUL must be at least 0.8 SUL units, as well. Measurement is commonly in same lesion as&#xD;
      baseline but can be another lesion if that lesion was previously present and is the most&#xD;
      active lesion after treatment. ROI does not have to be in precisely same area as baseline&#xD;
      scan, though typically it is. No increase, .30% in SUL or size of target or nontarget lesions&#xD;
      (i.e., no PD by RECIST or IWC) (if PD anatomically, must verify with follow-up). Reduction in&#xD;
      extent of tumor 18F-FDG uptake is not requirement for PMR. Percentage decline in SUL should&#xD;
      be recorded, as well as (ideally) time in weeks after treatment was begun (i.e., PMR 240, 3).&#xD;
      No new lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMD: not CMR, PMR, or PMD. SUL peak in metabolic target lesion should be recorded, as well as&#xD;
      (ideally) time from start of most recent therapy, in weeks (i.e., SMD 215, 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PMD: 30% increase in 18F-FDG SUL peak, with .0.8 SUL unit increase in tumor SUV peak from&#xD;
      baseline scan in pattern typical of tumor and not of infection/treatment effect. OR: Visible&#xD;
      increase in extent of 18F-FDG tumor uptake (75% in TLG volume with no decline in SUL. OR: New&#xD;
      18F-FDG-avid lesions that are typical of cancer and not related to treatment effect or&#xD;
      infection. PMD other than new visceral lesions should be confirmed on follow-up study within&#xD;
      1 mo unless PMD also is clearly associated with progressive disease by RECIST 1.1. PMD should&#xD;
      be reported to include percentage change in SUV peak, (ideally, time after treatment, in&#xD;
      weeks) and whether new lesions are present/absent and their number (i.e., PMD, 135, 4, new:&#xD;
      5). Because SUL is continuous variable, dividing response criteria into limited number of&#xD;
      somewhat arbitrary response categories loses much data. For this reason, PERCIST preserves&#xD;
      percentage declines in SUV peak in each reported category. Because rapidity with which scan&#xD;
      normalizes is important (faster appears better), PERCIST asks for time from start of&#xD;
      treatment as part of reporting. For example, CMR 90, 1, is probably superior to CMR 90, 10,&#xD;
      especially if latter patient were SMD 20, 1. More than one measurement of PET response may be&#xD;
      needed at differing times, and it may be treatment type-dependent. PERCIST 1.0 evaluates SUL&#xD;
      peak of only hottest tumor. This is possible limitation of approach, but lesions and their&#xD;
      responses are highly correlated in general. Additional data are required to determine how&#xD;
      many lesions should be assessed over 1. A suggested option is to include the 5 hottest&#xD;
      lesions, or the 5 observed on RECIST 1.1 that are most measurable. Percentage change in SUL&#xD;
      can be reported for single lesion with largest increase in uptake or smallest decline in&#xD;
      uptake. Additional studies will be needed to define how many lesions are optimal for&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For nontarget lesions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR, disappearance of all 18F-FDG-avid lesions: PMD, unequivocal progression of 18F-FDG-avid&#xD;
      nontarget lesions or appearance of new 18F-FDG-avid lesions typical of cancer; non-PMD:&#xD;
      persistence of one or more nontarget lesions or tumor markers above normal limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5)Follow-ups: including clinical changes (weight, pain) before and after treatment, treatment&#xD;
      regimen, biochemistry result, pathological result, immunohistochemical result; PFS and OS&#xD;
      time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All PET/CT scans were performed in GE Discovery Elite scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reproducibility and accuracy of each institution were analysis by third party using a&#xD;
           PET NEMA phantom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Multiple PET/CT scans of one patient were controlled by Q-Check software to make sure&#xD;
           the data quality for PETVCAR analysis.&#xD;
