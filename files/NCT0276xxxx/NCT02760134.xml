  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a well-established treatment modality for renal&#xD;
      stones. It offers a high stone free rates and less invasive than open surgery. Nevertheless&#xD;
      PCNL is an invasive and technically demanding procedure with inherent risks and&#xD;
      complications. The most troublesome morbidities are bleeding and injury to the kidney and its&#xD;
      adjacent structures. Complications of PCNL tend to be associated with the accuracy of tract&#xD;
      placement and the size of the nephrostomy tract. To improve the safety of PCNL, there is a&#xD;
      trend toward using smaller and smaller nephrostomy tracts . With the smaller nephrostomy&#xD;
      tract, there also arise the problems of compromised visual field and increased difficulty in&#xD;
      stone extraction. Increase irrigation using pressure pump might improve the visualization and&#xD;
      the passive egress of the stone fragments, but it also may concomitantly increase the&#xD;
      intra-luminal pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present system of Super-Mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (SMP) was developed to address&#xD;
      many of these deficiencies. The basic components of SMP system are an 8.0 F miniaturized&#xD;
      nephroscope with a newly designed irrigation-suction sheath with enhanced irrigation&#xD;
      capability and modified nephrostomy sheath with continuous negative pressure aspiration. Its&#xD;
      design was intended not only to prevent the excessive intrarenal pressure but also improve&#xD;
      the visualization and the stone fragments extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little was known about renal pelvic pressure in vivo during SMP and about any correlation it&#xD;
      might have had with postoperative fever and urosepsis. We measure the renal pelvic pressure&#xD;
      during SMP to determine whether it will improve the renal pelvic pressure and improve the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative fever.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To evaluate the influence of SMP on renal pelvic pressure for the treatment of renal calculi&#xD;
      measuring smaller than 25 mm. Investigators will do a single center randomized open-label&#xD;
      trial，and investigators plan to perform this study in the First Affiliated Hospital of&#xD;
      Guangzhou Medical University of China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to beginning their study at April in 2016 and end at March in 2018.One&#xD;
      hundred patients with renal calculi measuring smaller than 25 mm will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study. By simple random sampling technique, patients will be assigned to two 50-patient&#xD;
      groups(group 1:F14,group2 :F12).All the patients will be diagnosed definitely before&#xD;
      operations with non-contrast CT. Patients with positive preoperative urine culture should be&#xD;
      treated with suitable antibiotics based on the culture sensitivity result for at least 72h&#xD;
      before SMP. Patients who have negative urine culture should receive a single dose of broad&#xD;
      spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis just prior to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique Routine preoperative preparations are carried out as for conventional&#xD;
      percutaneous surgery. Under general anesthesia and with the patient in the lithotomy&#xD;
      position, an open-ended 5F ureteral catheter is advanced into the renal pelvis under direct&#xD;
      vision. The patient is then turned into the prone position. Percutaneous access is achieved&#xD;
      using an 18-gauge coaxial needle to puncture the selected calyx under fluoroscopic or&#xD;
      ultrasonic guidance. The success of the puncture is confirmed both by the free flow of the&#xD;
      irrigation fluid and by fluoroscopic images. Using a guidewire, the dilatation is carried out&#xD;
      with 10 F fascial dilators. Thenan irrigation-suction straight sheath, with the obturator, is&#xD;
      advanced over the guidewire and introduced into the pelvicalyceal system. The guidewireis&#xD;
      then removed, and the &quot;handle&quot; is connected to the straight sheath. The irrigation port of&#xD;
      the irrigation-suction sheath is connected to an irrigation pump. The oblique tube of the&#xD;
      sheath is connected to the specimen collection bottle, and the bottle then to the negative&#xD;
      pressure aspirator. The irrigation fluid pressure is set as 200-250 mmHg. The suction&#xD;
      pressure is controlled to a setting of 100-150 mmHg. The irrigation is delivered through the&#xD;
      irrigation channel of the sheath. Thus, a one-way flow is created as the inflow that comes&#xD;
      out of the irrigation channel of the sheath is immediately aspirated through the suction&#xD;
      conduitof the sheath. Stone fragmentation is accomplished using either holmium laser or&#xD;
      pneumatic lithotripter. The tiny pulverized stone fragments will pass around the scope and&#xD;
      evacuate through the oblique sluice. If the stone fragments are too large to pass around the&#xD;
      scope inside the sheath, the scope can be withdrawn slowly to proximal to the bifurcation in&#xD;
      order to create an unobstructed channel for larger fragments evacuation. At the end of the&#xD;
      procedure, a single fluoroscopic image is obtained to assess the stone-free status. A&#xD;
      Double-J stent is placed only when there is the presence of an obstructing inflammatory&#xD;
      ureteric edema, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, or concurrent treatment of ipsilateral&#xD;
      ureteric stone with rigid ureteroscope. The sheath is removed, and the wound is either&#xD;
      sutured or seal with absorbable gelatin. For patients with significant bleeding or&#xD;
      extravasation, a nephrostomy tube is placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Renal Pelvic Pressure In Vivo While preparing for the SMP, the open-ended&#xD;
      ureteric catheter, which had been inserted into the renal collecting system retrogradely, was&#xD;
      connected to the invasive blood pressure channel of patient monitor with a baroceptor. The&#xD;
      baroceptor was fixed onto the horizontal plane of renal pelvis; after a zero adjustment, the&#xD;
      measurement of renal pelvic pressure was in session. A computer collected the renal pelvic&#xD;
      pressure data each second. Any factor that caused a high renal pelvic pressure was noticed .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data for the 2 groups -demographic characteristics, site of access ,Hb&#xD;
      decrease, CRP increase, WBC increase, postoperative pain, operation time, hospital stay,&#xD;
      cases of tubeless, postoperative infection complications (systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      syndrome, urosepsis), stone clearance rate and the need for auxiliary treatment are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study endpoint: The renal pelvic pressure. Secondary endpoint: Postoperative systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome or urosepsis, stone clearance rate, operation time, hospital&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics include age, sex, BMI, stone size and location, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stone size is defined as the maximum diameter. Operation time is recorded from the time of&#xD;
      the first percutaneous renal puncture to the completion of the stone removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital stay are rounded to the nearest whole day and calculated from the day of surgery to&#xD;
      the day of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain (visual analogue scale [VAS], use of analgesics) and Postoperative comfort&#xD;
      scores (Bruggrmann comfort scale [BCS]) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of hemoglobin decrease is assessed by comparing the preoperative Hb level with&#xD;
      24-hour postoperative Hb level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary SFR and final SFR is assessed by KUB at day 1 and 1 month after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stone-free status are defined as either the absence of any residual stone fragments or the&#xD;
      presence of clinically insignificant residual stone fragments in the kidney which were&#xD;
      defined as ≦ 3mm, asymptomatic, non-obstructive and non-infectious stone particles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the procedure is considered as successful, the double J stent is removed as outpatient&#xD;
      after 2 weeks. Follow-up including KUB or non-contrast CT will be generally scheduled in 1&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding severity is judged by the treating physician, and transfusions are administered&#xD;
      according to local practice guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of all patients are recorded according to modified Clavien classification&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
