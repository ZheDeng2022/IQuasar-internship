      Today, dentists tend to use rotary systems. Despite the increasing diversity of these systems&#xD;
      as well as a few studies on the prevalence of pain after root canal treatment by rotary&#xD;
      systems, And in particular, comparing the amount of pain after treatment, between systems&#xD;
      RECIPROCAL AND FULL ROTATION single-file, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      applying canal preparation by the system, Neolix and WaveOne, on the prevalence of pain after&#xD;
      endodontic treatments.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Many studies of pain after root canal treatment experience were taken into consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain after endodontic treatment is still one of the major problems of patients. The&#xD;
      prevalence that widely studied as 6/10% to 9.82% have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the important strategies in endodontic treatment, prevention and control of pain after&#xD;
      treatment. This multi-factorial disorder resulting in a complex process occurs, which affects&#xD;
      the patient's intrinsic factors, the tooth and the dentist's skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical factors include channel instrumentation techniques, over instrumentation or&#xD;
      filling material extrusion channels associated with the presence of pain after treatment were&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apical extrusion of infected debris during instrumentation channel can create or exacerbate&#xD;
      inflammatory process. Channel shaping the apical debris extrusion process can increase even&#xD;
      if the preparation is limited to the channel. Leaving debris in both methods of preparation,&#xD;
      either manually with stainless steel files and rotary technique with nickel titanium files&#xD;
      happen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of rotary technique among dentists has increased. developing of NITI files and rotary&#xD;
      instrumentation system, reduce apical extrusion of debris, so can be expected to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of inflammation and pain after treatment, achieved by these means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that reciprocal shaping techniques, compared with full-rotation&#xD;
      techniques, significantly increased the amount of debris extruded from the apical region of&#xD;
      the root are causing increasing pain after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two rotary system available on the market are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Neolix (france Neolix SAS) recently introduced the file NITI, single file, with full&#xD;
      rotation movements, with square and rectangular cross-section, with a non-uniform shape along&#xD;
      the blade, tip sizes, 25 and Tipper 0 / 08, and a system, Wave one, (DENTSPLY Maillefer),&#xD;
      which is a file NITI, Single file and Single use, and the reciprocation movements, and&#xD;
      cross-Convex triangular Modified and in three sizes: small, primary (tip size 25 and Tipper&#xD;
      0/08), large is contained, which according to the size of the canal, one of them is selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study by Ana Arias et al., Patients in the experimental group by the Rotary Files roots&#xD;
      were treated and patients in control group were treated by the step-back technique, the&#xD;
      results showed that more patients in the control group, experienced pain after root canal&#xD;
      therapy. While the duration of the pain in the control group comparison to the experimental&#xD;
      group, less has been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study by Aqrabawi, teeth with vital pulp were divided into two groups. Root canal&#xD;
      therapy in the first group, was done by manual file, and the second group, by Protaper rotary&#xD;
      files were performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And no significant difference in pain after root canal treatment has not been detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gambarini was shown in the study, patients treated by waveone system they have done,&#xD;
      significantly more pain after treatment compared to TF and TF adaptive experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, dentists tend to use rotary systems. Despite the increasing diversity of these systems&#xD;
      as well as a few studies on the prevalence of pain after root canal treatment by rotary&#xD;
      systems, And in particular, comparing the amount of pain after treatment, between systems&#xD;
      RECIPROCAL AND FULL ROTATION single-file, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      applying canal preparation by the system, Neolix and WaveOne, on the prevalence of pain after&#xD;
      endodontic treatments.&#xD;
