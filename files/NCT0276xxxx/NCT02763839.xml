    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile of BIA&#xD;
      3-202 and its metabolites, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between 4&#xD;
      different single doses of BIA 3-202 (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg) and a single dose of&#xD;
      standard levodopa 100 mg/carbidopa 25 mg (Sinemet® 25/100) in adult male and female healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This was a single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, single-graded-dose,&#xD;
      crossover study with five single-dose treatment periods. The washout period between doses was&#xD;
      15±2 days. For each of the five treatment periods, volunteers were to be admitted at the UFH&#xD;
      on the day before the treatment day. On each treatment period, the pre-dose assessment were&#xD;
      to be completed, BIA 3-202/Placebo was to be administered concomitantly with the dose of&#xD;
      Sinemet® 25/100 and post-dose assessments were to be completed. Subjects were discharged 30 h&#xD;
      post-dose. Subjects should attend five treatment periods and were to receive a different dose&#xD;
      of BIA 3-202 or placebo during each of these treatment periods.&#xD;
