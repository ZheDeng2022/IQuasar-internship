      This research study is evaluating how well Breast Cancer responds to preoperative treatment&#xD;
      with Endocrine treatment in combination with a drug called Palbociclib or Endocrine treatment&#xD;
      alone as possible treatments for Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase II neoadjuvant clinical trial of Palbociclib in combination with&#xD;
      endocrine therapy for hormone receptor positive early-stage breast cancer. The planned sample&#xD;
      size is 180 participants. The study includes a &quot;window treatment&quot; phase followed by a&#xD;
      treatment phase. In the window phase, participants will be treated with a two-week course of&#xD;
      tamoxifen (Arm A) or letrozole (Arm B). In the treatment phase participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive endocrine therapy in combination with palbociclib (Arm C) or endocrine&#xD;
      therapy alone (Arm D) for a total duration of 24 weeks. Premenopausal patients with either&#xD;
      invasive lobular or ductal carcinoma will be eligible to enroll directly into the treatment&#xD;
      phase of the study. The study has two co-primary objectives: 1) To evaluate the difference in&#xD;
      anti-proliferative activity of letrozole versus tamoxifen measured by changes in Ki67 from&#xD;
      baseline to research biopsy (day 15) within cohorts of hormone receptor positive breast&#xD;
      cancer for patients with invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma. 2) To evaluate the pathologic&#xD;
      complete response (pCR) of endocrine therapy plus palbociclib and of endocrine therapy alone&#xD;
      in breast cancer patients diagnosed with hormone receptor positive invasive breast cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with equivocal HER2 in situ hybridization results according to current&#xD;
             ASCO/CAP guidelines are allowed, as long as the clinician has determined that they&#xD;
             should be treated as HER2 negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the window phase: Patients must have histologically confirmed invasive lobular&#xD;
             carcinoma or invasive ductal carcinoma. No central confirmation of histological&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able and willing to swallow and retain oral medication without a&#xD;
             condition that would interfere with enteric absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast imaging should include imaging of the ipsilateral axilla. For subjects with a&#xD;
             clinically negative axilla, a sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed either&#xD;
             before or after preoperative therapy at the discretion of the subject's physicians.&#xD;
             For subjects with a clinically positive axilla, a needle aspiration, core biopsy or&#xD;
             SLN procedure will be performed to determine the presence of metastatic disease in the&#xD;
             lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with multifocal or multicentric disease are eligible if the treating&#xD;
             clinician has determined the patient should be treated as ER+ and HER2- negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral breast cancers are allowed if the treating clinician has determined the&#xD;
             patient should be treated as ER+ and HER2- negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum or urine pregnancy test must be negative in women judged premenopausal within 7&#xD;
             days of randomization, or in women with amenorrhea of less than 12 months at time of&#xD;
             randomization. Pregnancy testing does not need to be pursued in patients who are&#xD;
             judged as postmenopausal before randomization, as determined by local practice, or who&#xD;
             have undergone bilateral oophorectomy, total hysterectomy, or bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal patients must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of&#xD;
             protocol treatment and for 6 months after the last treatment with palbociclib.&#xD;
             Adequate contraception is defined as one highly effective form (i.e. abstinence, male&#xD;
             or female sterilization) OR two effective forms (e.g. non-hormonal IUD and&#xD;
             condom/occlusive cap with spermicidal foam / gel / film / cream/ suppository).&#xD;
             Hormonal contraceptive methods are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of ipsilateral or contralateral DCIS are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may concurrently receive bisphosphonates or rank ligand inhibitors while on&#xD;
             this study if necessary for treatment or prevention of osteopenia or osteoporosis.&#xD;
             Prior treatment with LHRH agonists is allowed for premenopausal women. Topical vaginal&#xD;
             estrogen therapy is allowable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent therapy with other Investigational Products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with any CDK inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Stage IV breast cancer are not eligible. Baseline staging to document&#xD;
             absence of metastatic disease is not required, however is recommended as determined by&#xD;
             institutional practice (in patients where there may be a reasonable suspicion of&#xD;
             advanced disease e.g., large tumors, clinically positive axillary lymph nodes, signs&#xD;
             and symptoms). If performed, reports of these examinations must be available.&#xD;
             Examination type for staging, i.e. X-ray, sonography, bone scans, CT, MRI, and/or&#xD;
             PET-CT, is at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition similar to palbociclib.&#xD;

             inducers of CYP3A isoenzymes within 7 days of randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection,&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,&#xD;
             diabetes, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements. Ability to comply with study requirements is to be assessed by&#xD;
             each investigator at the time of screening for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women, or women of childbearing potential without a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
             (serum or urine) within 7 days prior to randomization, irrespective of the method of&#xD;
             contraception used, are excluded from this study because the effect of palbociclib on&#xD;
             a developing fetus is unknown. Breastfeeding must be discontinued prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of any malignancy are ineligible except for the following&#xD;
             circumstances:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a malignancy history other than invasive breast cancer are eligible&#xD;
                  if they have no active malignancy and are deemed by the investigator to be at low&#xD;
                  risk for recurrence of that malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with the following cancers are eligible: ductal carcinoma in situ of the&#xD;
                  breast, cervical cancer in situ, and non-metastatic non-melanomatous skin&#xD;
                  cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on combination antiretroviral therapy, i.e. those who are HIV-positive, are&#xD;
             ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions or increased&#xD;
             immunosuppression with palbociclib. HIV testing is not required, but patients must not&#xD;
             be known to be HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving concurrent exogenous hormone therapy (hormone replacement therapy,&#xD;
             oral or any other hormonal contraceptives such as hormonal contraceptive coil are not&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are not eligible if they have previously received endocrine therapy within 5&#xD;
             years prior to diagnosis of the current malignancy. This includes use for prophylactic&#xD;
             reasons, including treatment of osteoporosis or cancer prevention with tamoxifen,&#xD;
             raloxifene, or AI.&#xD;
