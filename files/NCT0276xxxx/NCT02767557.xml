  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter center, 2-arms prospective randomized phase II trial which evaluates&#xD;
      whether tocilizumab with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel is more effective than&#xD;
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of new effective treatment strategies remains a major challenge in patients&#xD;
      with PC. High levels of IL-6 and presence of a systemic inflammatory response in PC patients&#xD;
      have been reported to correlate with worse survival. Preclinical PC models have clearly shown&#xD;
      that anti-IL-6-receptor antibody tocilizumab in combination with chemotherapy reduced tumor&#xD;
      growth, number of distant metastases and the local recurrence rate. Thus, blockade of&#xD;
      IL-6-regulated signaling pathways represents a promising approach in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) alone or in combination with hypoalbuminaemia&#xD;
      (Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score - mGPS) are induced by IL-6 and could feasibly represent&#xD;
      surrogate markers for IL-6 bioactivity to stratify patients likely to gain benefit through&#xD;
      targeting IL-6.&#xD;
