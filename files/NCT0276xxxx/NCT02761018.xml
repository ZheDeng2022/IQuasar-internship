    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit DoD beneficiaries, aged 18 years or older and diagnosed as&#xD;
      being Type II diabetic. Patients will be randomized into one of two groups. Group 1 will use&#xD;
      a fitness tracker but will not be able to see other participants data and group 2 will use a&#xD;
      fitness tracker and will be able to see other members daily and weekly results. Outcome&#xD;
      measures will be assessed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months to include hemoglobin A1c,&#xD;
      weight, body mass index, blood pressure, and number of hours and days fitness tracker is&#xD;
      used. The goal is to see if the group randomized into an online community will have improved&#xD;
      activity and outcome measurements compared with those who use the pedometer alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Male and female DoD beneficiaries ages 18 years or older who have been diagnosed with Type II&#xD;
      diabetes, will be recruited at the Mike O'Callaghan Federal Medical Center (MOFMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain signed Informed Consent Document and HIPAA Authorization (research-driven).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record: Date of birth, phone number, age, gender, race, ethnicity, social security&#xD;
           number, current email address, height (in inches), weight (in pounds), blood pressure,&#xD;
           medications list including any over-the-counter and prescription weight loss medication&#xD;
           (name, strength, dose) or supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will have the following standard of care blood test drawn which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemoglobin A1c via 1 venipuncture (5-10 mls, approximately 1-2 teaspoons of blood&#xD;
                will be drawn)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Day 1 within 1 week of Screening Visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record: Weight (in pounds), blood pressure, and any changes to their medications list.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will complete the RAND 36 Item Health Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will complete the Intake Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be assigned their Fitness Tracker username and their username and password&#xD;
           will be recorded by the Research Coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be given User Instructions based off of their randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be instructed to follow all research procedures and that failure to do so&#xD;
           may result in the removal from the study and the return of the Fitness Tracker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be randomized by the research coordinator using a random-number generator&#xD;
           into one of two groups (research-driven):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1: will use a fitness tracker but will not be able to see other participant's&#xD;
                data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2: will use a fitness tracker and will be able to see other member's daily&#xD;
                and weekly results.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Both groups will receive the scripted feedback at set time intervals by the&#xD;
                     Research Coordinators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be provided a fitness tracker and instructed on how to use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If subject is a DoD beneficiary, and finishes all study-related procedures at month&#xD;
                6, they will keep the fitness tracker. If a subject does not complete all&#xD;
                study-related procedures, they will be asked to return the fitness tracker so the&#xD;
                investigators can erase their data and re-issue to another study subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If subject is active duty or a DoD employee, regardless of their study completion,&#xD;
                they will be asked to complete Temporary Issue Receipt and bring back the fitness&#xD;
                tracker at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Month 3/90 days post Visit 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record: Weight (in pounds), blood pressure and any changes to their medications list.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will complete the RAND 36 Item Health Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will complete the Follow up Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain information from their fitness tracker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will have the following standard of care blood test drawn which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemoglobin A1c via 1 venipuncture (5-10 mls, approximately 1-2 teaspoons of blood&#xD;
                will be drawn)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Visit 3 (Month 6/90 days post Visit 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record: Weight (in pounds), blood pressure and any changes to their medications list.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will complete the RAND 36 Item Health Survey and be asked some additional&#xD;
           questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will complete the Follow up Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain information from their fitness tracker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will have the following standard of care blood test drawn which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemoglobin A1c via 1 venipuncture (5-10 mls, approximately 1-2 teaspoons of blood&#xD;
