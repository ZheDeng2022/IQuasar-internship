  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly one out of every two Americans will develop knee osteoarthritis by age 85. Over 20&#xD;
      million Americans, including nearly three million Veterans, currently have painful knee&#xD;
      arthritis that limits their daily activity or recreation. The vast majority of those&#xD;
      individuals will be prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs that provide some pain relief but do&#xD;
      not slow the progression of the disease. Often people with knee arthritis are told they must&#xD;
      live with the pain until they become appropriate candidates for knee replacement surgery, but&#xD;
      that can require tolerating the pain and limiting function for many years. Because of other&#xD;
      health issues, some individuals are never acceptable surgery candidates. What is desperately&#xD;
      needed are better conservative approaches for treating these patients. Two such approaches&#xD;
      will be tested and compared in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial to investigate conservative treatments for&#xD;
      individuals with painful knee osteoarthritis (OA). The study will recruit participants who&#xD;
      have isolated, medial compartment knee OA. Subjects will be assigned to one of two gait&#xD;
      training groups. Both groups will undergo gait analysis to determine their foot progression&#xD;
      angle at their comfortable walking speed. Both groups will receive personalized gait&#xD;
      retraining to either alter their foot progression angle or to achieve consistency of their&#xD;
      natural foot progression angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait retraining will consist of once a week sessions for six weeks. The gait training will&#xD;
      use a fading feedback approach, where the percentage of each weekly session during which&#xD;
      feedback is used is decreased from week to week until no feedback is used by the last&#xD;
      training session. Throughout the six-week training period subjects will be encouraged to&#xD;
      practice their gait for at least ten minutes per day. Subjects will continue to practice&#xD;
      their gait throughout the remainder of the 52-week intervention. Subjects will have their&#xD;
      walking activity recorded using a 3-axis pedometer. Compared to their baseline walking&#xD;
      activity, participants will be instructed to increase their daily walking by ten minutes per&#xD;
      day throughout the 52-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive monthly phone calls to encourage maintaining a regular walking&#xD;
      regimen. Walking activity will be monitored periodically using a pedometer. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive knee MRIs and weight-bearing knee radiographs at the start and end of the study. All&#xD;
      participants will complete pain evaluations and clinical knee score questionnaires during the&#xD;
      study. The investigators expect that subjects in both groups will have a reduction in knee&#xD;
      pain over the course of the 52-week intervention. The primary objective of the study it to&#xD;
      determine if the change in pain between baseline and week 52 is different between the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive personalized gait training while walking on a treadmill with real-time, haptic feedback. The goal of the training is to encourage participants to adopt an altered foot progression angle in an attempt to alter the distribution of forces crossing the knee joint. Training will occur once a week for six weeks. This will be followed by a 46-week home and community-based walking program to practice and internalize the new personalized, gait pattern and to encourage daily walking. Refresher training with haptic feedback will be offered at weeks 11, 25 and 39 to enhance internalization of the new foot progression angle.</description>
