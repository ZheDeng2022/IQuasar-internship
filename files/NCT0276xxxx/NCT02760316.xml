      ascending doses of AZD9567.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomised, single-blind, multiple ascending dose, double-dummy sequential&#xD;
      group study in healthy subjects .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned to have 6 cohorts with the option to include up to two additional&#xD;
      cohorts if deemed necessary. Nine subjects participated in the first cohort (7 subjects&#xD;
      randomised to receive AZD9567 and 2 subjects randomised to receive prednisolone 20 mg)and&#xD;
      eleven subjects will participate in subsequent 3 cohorts (7 subjects will be randomised to&#xD;
      receive AZD9567 and 4 subjects randomised to receive prednisolone 20 mg). A cohort 5 was&#xD;
      included in the study in version 4.0 of the CSP. In this cohort two doses of prednisolone was&#xD;
      tested, 5 mg and 20 mg. Up to six dose levels of AZD9567 are planned to be tested in the&#xD;
      study and an additional cohort will be used in case any previous dose needs to be repeated or&#xD;
      a new lower dose explored (ref CSP 5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore a maximum of 95 individuals could be included in the study (as stated in version&#xD;
      5.0 of this protocol). Subjects will be dosed for 5 consecutive days and a follow-up visit&#xD;
      will occur 10-14 days after the last dose.&#xD;
