  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of administering&#xD;
      investigational drugs (meaning not Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for kidney&#xD;
      cancer) prior to surgical treatment for kidney cancer. The first drug is called MEDI4736, and&#xD;
      the second drug is called tremelimumab. Both of these drugs work by attaching to certain&#xD;
      proteins on immune cells with the goal of stimulating an immune response against cancer&#xD;
      cells. This is a phase 1 trial, with the primary goal of identifying if this treatment is&#xD;
      safe and possible side effects when given prior to surgery for kidney cancer.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To investigate the safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant plus adjuvant dosing of durvalumab&#xD;
      +/- tremelimumab in patients with localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immune response to neoadjuvant plus adjuvant dosing of durvalumab +/-&#xD;
           tremelimumab in patients with localized RCC as measured an increased density of&#xD;
           tumor-infiltrating CD8 T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the antitumor effect of neoadjuvant durvalumab +/- tremelimumab in patients&#xD;
           with RCC as measured by change in tumor size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore pharmacodynamic and microbiome markers of response to checkpoint inhibition&#xD;
           in pre- and post-treatment blood and tissue samples (e.g. infiltration of T cells, T&#xD;
           regulatory cells and/or Myeloid-derived suppressor cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand changes in the immunological milieu mediated by pre-surgical immune&#xD;
           checkpoint blockade (e.g. change in T cell repertoire, expression of T cell agonist&#xD;
           targets).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a single-arm open-label phase Ib study of neoadjuvant durvalumab +/-&#xD;
      tremelimumab in localized / locally advanced, non-metastatic RCC patients suitable for&#xD;
      nephrectomy. Upon selection as appropriate for study, patients will undergo computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT)-guided biopsy of renal mass to obtain histological confirmation of diagnosis,&#xD;
      and immunologic characterization of the RCC tumor. Peripheral blood will also be drawn at&#xD;
      time of screening. Patients will subsequently receive systemic neoadjuvant treatment in one&#xD;
      of 5 cohorts as defined below. Following systemic therapy, patients will undergo nephrectomy.&#xD;
      Type of surgery (open vs. minimally invasive, radical vs. partial) and template for lymph&#xD;
      node dissection are at the discretion of surgeon. Timing of surgery in relation to adverse&#xD;
      events and/or treatment for adverse events from neoadjuvant dosing of study drugs is at the&#xD;
      discretion of the surgeon. Adjuvant therapy will be administered within 4-6 weeks of surgery.&#xD;
      Subsequent follow-up will then be completed to assess adverse event resolution and long-term&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical, endoscopic, and radiological interventions&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells after treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months after screening</time_frame>
    <description>The primary readout here will be increased CD8 infiltration versus a large historical control cohort already in our possession. Preliminary studies will focus on peri-tumoral and inter-tumoral CD8 infiltration, as those parameters are associated with responsiveness to immunotherapy in melanoma patients. Secondary efforts will focus on the induction of a pro-inflammatory infiltrate by comparing the surgical specimen to pre-treatment biopsies. Those assays will be challenged by the small amount of tissue generally available from biopsy, but are important since the biopsy could potentially serve as a valuable prediction tool to guide early treatment.</description>

    <description>RECIST 1.1 Criteria Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.&#xD;
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).&#xD;
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

    <description>o The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).
