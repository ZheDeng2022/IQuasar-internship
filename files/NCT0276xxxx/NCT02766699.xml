    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Cerebral EDV study is to determine the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      EGFR(V)-EDV-Dox in order to establish the best dose level to be used in future studies. The&#xD;
      study will also examine the body's immune response to EGFR(V)-EDV-Dox and assess if it is&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, dose exploration and preliminary immunogenicity study of&#xD;
      single agent EGFR(V)-EDV-Dox in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Eligible subjects&#xD;
      enrolled in the study will receive EGFR(V)-EDV-Dox administered weekly for 7 weeks via IV 20&#xD;
      minute infusion, followed by radiological evaluation at week 8 (1 Cycle). Subjects may&#xD;
      continue to receive subsequent cycles of EGFR(V)-EDV-Dox unless the subject becomes&#xD;
      intolerant to investigational product (IP), withdraw consent or the individual is no longer&#xD;
      receiving clinical benefit (factors taken in to consideration will be disease progression&#xD;
      radiologically or clinically, and clinical benefits to quality of life). Tumour assessment&#xD;
      will be repeated after each 7 week cycle (week 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in two parts, Part 1 (Dose Exploration) and Part 2 (Dose&#xD;
      Expansion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 - Dose Exploration will assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of drug&#xD;
      at two dose levels (5 x 10^9 and 8 x 10^9) and will enroll prior to Part 2. Three subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited per dose level. Enrollment will begin with the 5 x 10^9 dose level, and the&#xD;
      decision to enroll to the 8 x 10^9 dose level will follow a comprehensive safety evaluation&#xD;
      and a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - Dose Expansion will be conducted pending safety results of Part 1 to provide&#xD;
      guidance regarding the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Subjects will be treated and assessed&#xD;
      as outlined in Part 1 above. If 0 out of 3 subjects, or 1 out of 6 subjects, experience dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities (DLTs) at the 5 x 10^9 dose level in Part 1, additional subjects to a&#xD;
      total of 10 will be recruited to this dose level in Part 2. Similarly, if 0 out of 3&#xD;
      subjects, or 1 out of 6 subjects, experience DLTs at the 8 x 10^9 dose level in Part 1,&#xD;
      additional subjects to a total of 10 will be recruited to this dose level in Part 2. If both&#xD;
      dose levels are tolerated, a total of 10 subjects per dose level will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety follow-up visit must be performed 30 (+5) days after the last dose of drug for all&#xD;
      subjects.All subjects who discontinue investigational product and who have not withdrawn full&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study will continue in the long term follow-up phase. Long term&#xD;
      follow-up will continue approximately every 1 month for 12 months, from the 30 (+5) day&#xD;
      follow-up visit, then approximately every 2-3 months for the extent of subject survival.&#xD;

    <description>EGFR(V)-EDV-Dox using EnGeneIC EDV™ technology is a bacterially derived minicell which packages a toxic payload, Doxorubicin, into a 400 nm particle which targets specific cancer cells using bispecific antibodies (BsAb). BsAb-targeted, payload-packaged EDV nanocells only exit the leaky blood vessels associated with tumors and enter into the tumor microenvironment. The BsAb binds to the tumor cell-surface receptor, where the EDV is taken up, broken down within the cancer cell and releases the Doxorubicin. The residual EDVs that do not make it into the tumor microenvironment, are engulfed by cells of the immune system and since the EDVs are derived from bacteria, they carry potent immuno-stimulating components which appear to bypass the immuno-suppression caused by the tumor.</description>
