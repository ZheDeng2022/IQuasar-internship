    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein&#xD;
      before surgery in treating patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, prostate&#xD;
      cancer, or kidney cancer. Recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein may block an enzyme needed for&#xD;
      tumor cells to multiply and may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that bring&#xD;
      nutrients to the tumor. Giving recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein before surgery may make&#xD;
      the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of, and adverse events associated with, treatment with&#xD;
      soluble ephrin type-B receptor 4 (sEphB4)-human serum albumin (HSA) (recombinant EphB4-HSA&#xD;
      fusion protein) prior to minimally invasive robotic surgery in patients with either&#xD;
      muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder; clear cell renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (4 cm or greater); or prostate cancer Gleason (7 or under).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine tumor response to neoadjuvant sEphB4 as measured by imaging response and&#xD;
      pathologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the expression of ephrin type-B receptor 4 (EphB4) and eph-related receptor&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase ligand 5 (EphrinB2) in the archival tumor samples and explore potential&#xD;
      associations with outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To bank specimens for future correlative biomarker studies based on the results of&#xD;
      ongoing biomarkers analyses in the phase I of sEphB4-HSA as a single agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate changes in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation of the surgical specimen&#xD;
      after being treated with sEphB4-HSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the infiltration of immune cells into the tumor due to administering&#xD;
      sEphB4-HSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the impact sEphB4-HSA has on vessel density on the tumor tissue. VI. To assess&#xD;
      the applicability of using sEphB4-HSA for treating genitourinary cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess the applicability of using contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging for&#xD;
      determining pathological complete response (pCR) rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes once&#xD;
      weekly for 3 weeks (3 doses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients who agree may receive the fourth dose after an additional week as determined by the&#xD;
      study medical oncologist. Two to four weeks after the last dose of recombinant EphB4-HSA&#xD;
      fusion protein, patients undergo robotic-assisted radical cystectomy or robotic-assisted&#xD;
      radical or partial nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
