  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of total knee replacement are improvement in functional activities and&#xD;
      reduce pain due to degenerated knee joints. However, there are around 20-30% of patients&#xD;
      would develop significant pain problem despite uncomplicated total knee replacement. It&#xD;
      accounts for major post-operative problems and burdens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is glucocorticoid which is associated with anti-inflammatory response. It is&#xD;
      well known to have prophylaxis effect for post-operative nausea and vomiting. Perioperative&#xD;
      single dose of systemic dexamethasone have shown to be useful for reduction in pain and&#xD;
      cumulative opioid consumption. Meta-analysis from De Oliveira et al supports that&#xD;
      dexamethasone (up to 0.2 mg/kg) is a safe and effective multimodal pain strategy after&#xD;
      surgical procedures. However, this dose recommendation is not surgery specific. It is&#xD;
      essential to have more RCTs evaluating the optimal dose of steroid for pain management after&#xD;
      hip and knee surgery.&#xD;

      Patients will be approached at the preadmission clinic or in the general ward before&#xD;
      operation. The analgesic methods will be explained and s/he will be recruited into the study&#xD;
      if s/he agrees. There are standardized preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      analgesic regimes for patients undergoing total knee replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For preoperative analgesic regime, pregabalin 50mg are given the night before operation. Same&#xD;
      analgesic regime is used on the day before operation. For intraoperative regime, standardized&#xD;
      intraarticular local anaesthetic infiltration is used. For postoperative analgesic regime,&#xD;
      PCA using morphine is used. In addition to PCA using morphine, standardized analgesic regime&#xD;
      is used -- regular pregabalin 50mg nocte, paracetmal 1g QID, Celebrex 200mg BD will be given&#xD;
      for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into one of three groups. Patients in the first group (D1) will&#xD;
      receive standardized oral analgesic regime pre-operatively, intraoperatively and&#xD;
      postoperatively. In addition to the above, they will be given preoperative intravenous 8mg&#xD;
      dexamethasone. Patients in the second (D2) group will be given preoperative intravenous 16mg&#xD;
      dexamethasone, in addition to same pre-operative, intraoperative and post-operative analgesic&#xD;
      regimes. Patients in the third (C) group will be given preoperative intravenous 4ml 0.9%&#xD;
      saline, in addition to same pre-operative, intraoperative and post-operative analgesic&#xD;
      regimes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Care Assessment will be done at the preadmission clinic or at the general ward.&#xD;
      Pre-operative pregabalin will be given before operation and on the day before operation.&#xD;
      Fasting will start six hours before operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Range of movement of the operating knee, quadriceps function, pain scores of the affecting&#xD;
      knee will be assessed on day before operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative inflammatory marker (e.g. CRP, ESR, tumour necrosis factor Î±, interleukin IL-6)&#xD;
      and H'stix will be taken on day of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthetic and intraoperative care&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be anaesthetized according to the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival to the operation theatre, a 18 or 16 gauge intravenous cannula will be inserted.&#xD;
      Standard monitoring with pulse oximeter, non-invasive blood pressure, and three lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram will be applied prior to induction. Non-invasive blood pressure will be&#xD;
      checked at least every 5 minutes throughout the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be provided with spinal anaesthesia for the operation with 2.4 ml 0.5% heavy&#xD;
      Marcaine will be administrated into spinal space after position confirmed with spinal needle.&#xD;
      No intrathecal opioid will be given during the procedure. Patient will be sedated with TCI&#xD;
      propofol (0.3 -1 ug/ml) throughout the whole total knee replacement after successful spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous antibiotic will be given before skin incision. Hypotension will be managed with&#xD;
      intravenous phenylephrine or ephedrine at the discretion of the anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
      Intra-operative fluid 8-10ml/kg/hr will be infused as maintenance. Also intravenous bolus of&#xD;
      fluid will be given for replacement of blood loss. Infusion fluid warmer and thermal blanket&#xD;
      will be used with the aim of keeping a core temperature of 35.5-37.5 degrees Celsius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anaesthetic infiltration of 40ml 0.75% ropivacaine, 0.5ml 1:200,000 adrenaline, 30mg&#xD;
      ketorolac in 60ml normal saline will be administrated by orthopaedic surgeons after implant&#xD;
      insertion and wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will subsequently be transferred to the post anaesthetic care unit (PACU) for&#xD;
      monitoring for at least 1 hour. H'stix and H'cue will be checked 2 hours and 4 hours after&#xD;
      preoperative injection of dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesic modalities and pain assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for the all analgesic modalities are described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D1 Patients from group D will be given a bolus injection of 2 ml saline with 2 ml&#xD;
      dexamethasone (4mg/ml) before skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D2 4ml bolus injection of dexamethasone (4mg/ml) will be given intravenously prior to&#xD;
      incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C 4ml bolus injection of 0.9% saline will be given intravenously prior to incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all groups In the recovery room after surgery, boluses of 2mg intravenous morphine will&#xD;
      be given every 5 minutes until numerical rating pain score (NRS) is less than 4/10. A PCA&#xD;
      machine will then be connected. The machine will be configured to give 1mg of morphine at a&#xD;
      time and the lockout duration will be set to 5 minutes. No background infusion will be given&#xD;
      and the maximum dose limit will be 0.1mg/kg per hour of morphine sulphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intramuscular morphine sulphate at a dose of 0.1mg/kg will be prescribed every 4 hours if&#xD;
      necessary for breakthrough beginning from postoperative day 0. Intravenous 4mg ondansetron is&#xD;
      used every 4 hours if necessary if there is any nausea or vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On postoperative day 0, patient will resume oral diet if not contraindicated. Oral&#xD;
      paracetamol and COX-2 inhibitor will be given for 5 days. Oral pregabalin will be given for 7&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on PCA morphine, the patient's respiratory rate, SpO2 and sedation score will be&#xD;
      monitored every hour. Heart rate and blood pressure will be checked every 4 hours. NRS pain&#xD;
      scores at rest, during knee movement, during sleep, cumulative PCA morphine doses, and number&#xD;
      of PCA demands/goods delivered, and side effects (nausea, vomiting, dizziness) will be&#xD;
      recorded every 4 hours. Patients will be assessed by pain team everyday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be on PCA morphine for at least 2 days. If NRS pain scores during knee movement&#xD;
      on postoperative day 2 is less than 4/10 or clinically low morphine consumption, PCA morphine&#xD;
      will be stopped. PCA morphine will be continued if NRS is equal or greater than 4, or if the&#xD;
      patient remains on a high PCA consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After PCA morphine has stopped, NRS pain scores at rest and during knee movement, as well as&#xD;
      the dose and frequency of rescue analgesia used will be charted once a day until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique/Prosthesis The surgery will be performed by the same surgical team with&#xD;
      standardized surgical technique. All the patients will have posterior stabilized knee&#xD;
      prosthesis. Tranexamic acid will be given according to our protocol. Standardized regimen and&#xD;
      technique of local infiltration of analgesic at the end of the surgery will be given as part&#xD;
      of the multi-modal pain control protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care and assessment Day zero mobilization or early mobilization with PT and OT&#xD;
      rehabilitation is encouraged after operation. Fluid diet will be allowed on postoperative day&#xD;
      0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical team will assess for occurrences of postoperative surgical complications,&#xD;
      suitability for discharge (good pain control, ambulation, normal bowel function, and ability&#xD;
      to eat properly without vomiting. Urinary retention will be documented as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Range of movement of the operating knee and other rehabilitation parameters will be&#xD;
      assessment by allied health staffs from Day 0 till day of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects of steroid are documented e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding, hyperglycaemia, wound&#xD;
      infection (Southampton wound assessment scale), or other systemic infections are documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose level will be measured in 7am and 5pm on Day 1 and Day 2. Insulin will be used to&#xD;
      keep glucose &lt;15 mmol/dl. Blood investigations will also be performed. Inflammatory marker&#xD;
      e.g. ESR, CRF, tumour necrosis factor Î±, interleukin IL-6 will be taken on Day 0, Day 1 and&#xD;
      Day 2. Haemoglobin level and the need of transfusion will be documented.&#xD;
