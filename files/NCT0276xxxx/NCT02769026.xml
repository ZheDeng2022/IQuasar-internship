      This multicenter study will validate a panel of serum, imaging, and clinical biomarkers to&#xD;
      classify patient outcome early after out-of-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest. Results are&#xD;
      expected to have a positive and immediate impact in advancing clinical care and outcomes for&#xD;
      these children. This work will provide clinicians, families, and researchers with superior&#xD;
      tools to assess the severity of brain injury early after resuscitation in order to know who&#xD;
      is at risk of brain injury and may benefit from neuroprotective interventions, to monitor&#xD;
      response to these interventions, to plan rehabilitation strategy, and to optimize the design&#xD;
      of research studies that test novel interventions to improve neurological outcome after&#xD;
      cardiac arrest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with cardiac arrest (CA) have mortality rates of 50-90%, largely due to neurological&#xD;
      failure as part of the post-resuscitation syndrome. There is a critical gap of knowledge and&#xD;
      tools to accurately classify outcome after pediatric CA. Physical examination and laboratory&#xD;
      testing inadequately assess the severity of neurologic injury and outcome. Hazards of&#xD;
      misclassification include risking adverse effects from ineffective therapies and&#xD;
      non-treatment of ostensibly well patients who later are found to have neurologic deficits.&#xD;
      Early and accurate identification of the eventual severity of neurologic injury would allow&#xD;
      for timely neuroprotective interventions and/or more targeted testing of new therapies in&#xD;
      specific risk populations. The long term objective is to improve the neurological outcome of&#xD;
      children surviving CA. In this study, investigators will model and validate serum and imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers of brain injury with empirical support, and assess their accuracy together with&#xD;
      clinical variables in classifying outcome after pediatric CA. The central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      serum and imaging biomarkers of brain injury, together with clinical variables, will&#xD;
      critically aid in the early classification of favorable outcome after pediatric CA (Vineland&#xD;
      Adaptive Behavior Scales score [VABS] &gt; 70) 1 year after pediatric CA in a multicenter&#xD;
      prospective study (8-12 centers and 248 subjects). Strong preliminary data supports this&#xD;
      hypothesis, and biomarkers will be tested for outcome classification accuracy in the&#xD;
      following 3 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1) Serum biomarkers of neuronal (neuron specific enolase and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal&#xD;
      hydrolase-L1) and glial injury (S100b and glial fibrillary acidic protein) Aim 2) Regional&#xD;
      (occipital-parietal cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus) brain MRI (T1/T2 and&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted imaging) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) biomarkers of neuronal&#xD;
      injury (N-acetyl-aspartate) and energy failure (lactate) Aim 3 will model the combination of&#xD;
      strong serum and imaging biomarkers of brain injury with clinical variables. We will assess&#xD;
      serum biomarkers of brain mitochondrial injury with potential for novel therapeutic targets&#xD;
      (cardiolipin and oxidized cardiolipin) in an exploratory aim. This proposed research is&#xD;
      innovative, because a combined panel of serum and imaging biomarkers with clinical variables&#xD;
      to accurately classify outcome after pediatric CA will be prospectively developed and&#xD;
      optimized. These proposed aims leverage recent pilot successes and should generate accurate&#xD;
      and reliable models of biomarkers that markedly improve post-resuscitation clinical care in&#xD;
      children after CA. Furthermore, these results are expected to have a positive impact in&#xD;
      advancing neurocritical care for these children, with forthcoming development of a serum&#xD;
      biomarker point of care test and biomarker panels that will accurately classify risk of&#xD;
      unfavorable outcome for clinicians and researchers needing to stratify by severity of injury,&#xD;
      to monitor response to therapy, and ultimately to assist in their rehabilitation and&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
