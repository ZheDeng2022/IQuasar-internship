      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile&#xD;
      of an injection of RBP-6000.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, first-in-human study, designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of&#xD;
      RBP-6000 in opioid dependent subjects. Enrollment will begin with 6 subjects, and additional&#xD;
      subjects will not be enrolled until safety through Day 4 has been reviewed and analyzed.&#xD;
      Subjects will remain in a residential unit through Day 30 post-injection and will continue&#xD;
      with visits to the clinical unit until Day 85 or plasma buprenorphine levels are below 100&#xD;
      pg/mL, whichever comes later. The expected maximum duration of participation for each subject&#xD;
      (including screening) is 120 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by adverse events, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      assessments, local injection site tolerability and vital signs. PK will be assessed by&#xD;
      measuring concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine in plasma. The need for rescue&#xD;
      medication will be assessed using clinical judgment along with information provided by the&#xD;
      COWS scores.&#xD;
