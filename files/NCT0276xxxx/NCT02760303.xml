  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence and young adulthood may be particularly stressful developmental periods due to&#xD;
      the numerous transitions into new roles and the need for increased independence. Stress can&#xD;
      affect metabolic control in older adolescents and young adults with T1D directly through its&#xD;
      impact on cortisol and other hormones that affect insulin metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a pilot randomized clinical trial using a three-group randomized,&#xD;
      repeated measures design to assess the efficacy of two treatments (Mindfulness Based Stress&#xD;
      Reduction (MBSR) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or (CBT) versus an attention control&#xD;
      condition for older adolescents and young adults with poorly controlled Type 1 diabetes. As a&#xD;
      pilot study, the goal of the research is to test recruitment and retention procedures,&#xD;
      finalize intervention measures, training, and fidelity protocols, and estimate effect sizes&#xD;
      for a larger clinical trial.&#xD;

      This study will use a randomized, repeated measures design. A sample of 125 participants will&#xD;
      be recruited and consented from the Children's Hospital of Michigan and outpatient diabetes&#xD;
      clinics affiliated with the Detroit Medical Center. 108 will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      treatment conditions (remaining participants are expected to consent but not enroll or fail&#xD;
      to initiate treatment). These participants will be enrolled in 3 cohorts of 30-36&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures will be administered at 3 home-based study visits to maximize participant&#xD;
      convenience. The initial study visit (Visit 1) will be scheduled at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study. Visit 2 will coincide with the end of treatment which is approximately 3 months after&#xD;
      the initial study visit. Visit 3 is the 3-month follow up and will be scheduled about 6&#xD;
      months after the initial study visit. At each visit, participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing their current diabetes management, stressors, quality of life,&#xD;
      mental health, and demographic characteristics. These questionnaires will be completed using&#xD;
      Qualtrics accessed via the internet on a university laptop computer. A research assistant&#xD;
      will download the participant's glucose meter to obtain the frequency of blood glucose&#xD;
      testing during the two weeks preceding data collection. The research assistant will also&#xD;
      assist participants with providing a blood sample via fingerstick (HbA1c) and saliva samples&#xD;
      by mouth (cortisol, Visits 1 and 2 only). All participants will be asked to take part in an&#xD;
      exit interview at Visit 3 to obtain feedback on the treatment they received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Visit 1, participants will be randomized using a 1:1:1 ratio to MBSR, CBT, or Diabetes&#xD;
      Support and Education (DSE). All three treatments are group format meeting (10-12&#xD;
      participants per group) for nine consecutive weeks at a location convenient to the&#xD;
      participants. In MBSR treatment focuses on the instruction and practice of mindfulness&#xD;
      techniques, such as meditation and yoga, and the application of these practices to everyday&#xD;
      activities. CBT utilizes activities to understand how thoughts affect emotions and behaviors,&#xD;
      the application of these activities to current stressors, and strategies to apply these new&#xD;
      skills to future stressors. The DSE group is the attention control condition; DSE&#xD;
      participants will receive diabetes education via a support group format. All group sessions&#xD;
      will be audiotaped for treatment fidelity monitoring and assessment. There are no planned&#xD;
      research interventions for the DSE group.&#xD;
