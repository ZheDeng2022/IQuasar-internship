      The aims of the present project are to study possible differences in inflammatory gene&#xD;
      expression and protein secretion in various compartments of adipose tissue being exposed&#xD;
      during open cardiac surgery in patients with coronary heart disease undergoing coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass surgery.&#xD;

      The present study is observational with biochemical end-points to disclose inflammatory&#xD;
      mechanisms in various compartments of adipose tissue in patients with coronary heart disease&#xD;
      (CHD) compared to patients without significant CHD. Fifty patients with CHD undergoing&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass surgery with open chest procedure will be included and 20 patients&#xD;
      with valve disease without overt CHD undergoing open valve surgery will serve as a control&#xD;
      group. No specific restrictions to inclusion other than lack of consent to participate after&#xD;
      written and oral information are listed. In patients undergoing open heart surgery for CHD,&#xD;
      representative peri-operative biopsies from epicardial, pericardial and subcutaneous fat will&#xD;
      be gathered, carefully processed and deep-frozen to 80 degrees of frost for later analyses on&#xD;
      histological/cellular components and on messenger ribonucleic acid for selected inflammatory&#xD;
      variables. Simultaneously, blood samples (arterial blood at start of operation) will be&#xD;
      collected, processed and deep-frozen at 80 degrees of frost for later analyses of relevant&#xD;
      circulating inflammatory variables to correlation analyses with tissue samples, possibly also&#xD;
      PaxGene tubes for messenger ribonucleic acid in circulating leukocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and in accordance with&#xD;
      approval from the Regional Ethics Committee.&#xD;

    <description>Inflammasome-related proteins (IL-18, IL-1b, NLRP3, Caspase, TLR4, IL-6, IL-6R, gp130), markers of remodeling (i.e. MMP-9, TIMP-1, PAI-1, Galectin, EMMPRIN), adipokines (i.e adiponectin, visfatin), other relevant pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines (like TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-gamma, MCP-1, IL-4, IL-10, TGF beta.) Relevant laboratory methods; qPCR (mRNA - all compartments + PAXGenetubes (leukocytes); Immunohistochemically; Circulating (where possible) (ELISAs and/or Multiplex).
