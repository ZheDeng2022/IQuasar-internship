  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic health conditions, affecting 900,000 Ontarians, 2.4&#xD;
      million Canadians and over 300 million people worldwide. Unlike most other chronic diseases,&#xD;
      asthma affects a significant proportion of children - an estimated 21% in Ontario. Asthma is&#xD;
      also the leading cause of hospitalization for children in Canada and is a significant cause&#xD;
      of school and work absenteeism. Though asthma is generally considered a chronic disease, it&#xD;
      can be fatal in some instances - in 2009, an estimated 91 Ontarians died of this condition.&#xD;
      Effective management of asthma can prevent exacerbation and more severe negative health&#xD;
      consequences. In fact, estimates show that over 80% of the asthma-related deaths could be&#xD;
      prevented through proper education. However, evidence also shows that over 55% of patients&#xD;
      with moderate to severe asthma do not have their asthma symptoms under control, despite&#xD;
      regular doctor visits. Less than a third (31%) of asthma patients report receiving an asthma&#xD;
      action plan from their physicians, although such plans are associated with fewer ER visits,&#xD;
      lower hospitalization rates and improved lung function. Hence, there is a clear opportunity&#xD;
      to improve the management of asthma and reduce the incidence of related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the scientific evidence of pharmacists effect on asthma management there is a strong&#xD;
      rationale for introducing an asthma-specific pharmacist-led intervention for Ontarians&#xD;
      suffering from this chronic disease. However, the implementation of such a program should be&#xD;
      preceded by a pilot test to ensure that the program parameters are optimized to drive&#xD;
      improved patient outcomes and maximum quality of service. The primary goals of this research&#xD;
      project are to examine the impact of a pharmacist led asthma management intervention on&#xD;
      patient health outcomes and to determine the optimum program structure to ensure quality of&#xD;
      service delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study employs a mixed-methods study design. Investigators will begin with a cluster&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial and end with exit interviews.This study will consist of a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized controlled trial conducted in the community setting. A total of 12&#xD;
      pharmacies across the Greater Toronto Region will be recruited for this study. Each of these&#xD;
      pharmacies will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention group or the&#xD;
      control group. All data will be analyzed using statistical software. Significance level will&#xD;
      be set at 0.05. Pharmacy level descriptive characteristics, including mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation for the number of patients will be reported. There is a low perceived risk for this&#xD;
      study; however, the investigators will take every precaution to ensure this study is&#xD;
      conducted in an ethical manner, including protecting patient confidentiality and anonymity.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the control group will receive standard, dispensing services they currently receive from pharmacists. Control group pharmacists will continue to provide these services in accordance with the standards of practice adopted by the Ontario College of Pharmacists. They will not provide either of the 3 intervention components outlined above. Should a control group patient request additional information and/or services, the pharmacist will comply and provide these as deemed necessary for the particular patient. This could include the full range of educational and drug therapy optimization services outlined for the intervention group. If this occurs then the pharmacists will document all services provided in order for the research team to account for this in the analysis.</description>
