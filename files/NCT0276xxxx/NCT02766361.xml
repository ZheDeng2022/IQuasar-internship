      The study consists of a clinical trial comparing a new structured group intervention,&#xD;
      denominated &quot;Cognitive-Behavioral Rehabilitation&quot;, to treatment as usual (TAU) for bipolar&#xD;
      patients. The new approach is a combination of cognitive behavioral strategies and cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation exercises, consisting of twelve weekly group sessions of 90 minutes each. To&#xD;
      be included in the study, patients must be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, type I or II, be&#xD;
      18 to 55 years old, in full or partial remission and have an IQ of at least 80. A&#xD;
      comprehensive neuropsychological battery, followed by mood, social functioning and quality of&#xD;
      life assessments will occur in three moments: pre and post-intervention and after 12 months.&#xD;

      Methods/Design The study compares Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation with Treatment as Usual&#xD;
      (TAU), the latter being the commonly offered pharmacological treatment to bipolar patients.&#xD;
      The psychological intervention will consist of twelve weekly group sessions, lasting 90&#xD;
      minutes each, and including 8 to 10 individuals. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      the two arms, and submitted to a 12-month follow-up. During the entire study, all patients&#xD;
      will be medicated accordingly to their clinical needs, and all changes in medication will be&#xD;
      recorded as a secondary outcome , following the Necessary Clinical Adjustment (NCA)&#xD;
      instrument. The NCA records medication adjustments implemented to reduce symptoms, improve&#xD;
      response and functioning, or handle unbearable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants In order to be included, patients must be between 18 to 55 years old, literate,&#xD;
      present an IQ score higher than 80 and have been diagnosed with bipolar I or II accordingly&#xD;
      to DSM-V criteria (APA, 2014). Excluding conditions are: presence of substance or alcohol&#xD;
      abuse in the last 6 months, current suicide risk, organic mental disorders or scores higher&#xD;
      than 12, in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) or the Young Mania Rating&#xD;
      Scale (YMRS) at the beginning of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting will take place at an outpatient service provided by the Bipolar Disorder Research&#xD;
      Program (PROMAN) at the University of São Paulo Medical School, Brazil. Patients will receive&#xD;
      invitations individually, and sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and Outcomes Once included, patients will complete the Portuguese versions of the&#xD;
      following self-report questionnaires: the abbreviated instrument of quality of life&#xD;
      (WHOQOL-bref), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 (BIS 11), the Social Skills Inventory (IHS)&#xD;
      and the Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) . Patients will&#xD;
      also complete the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) and a brief questionnaire about&#xD;
      bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief neuropsychological battery will be conducted, which includes the Wechsler Abbreviated&#xD;
      Scale of Intelligence (WASI) (Wechsler, 1999), and following subtests from the Cambridge&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): Motor Screening Task (MOT); Rapid Visual&#xD;
      Information Processing (RVP); Reaction Time (RTI); Spatial Span (SSP); Spatial Working Memory&#xD;
      (SWM); One Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS); Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM); Delayed&#xD;
      Matching to Sample (DMS); Attention Switching Task (AST); Emotion Recognition Task (ERT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also complete the initial assessment and mood module of the Structured Clinical&#xD;
      Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) (APA, 2014) post-intervention at week 12, and 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation, in comparison to TAU, will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Decrease the recurrence rates of new episodes; our primary outcome measure. II. Improve&#xD;
      attention, mental flexibility, working memory and emotional recognition; our secondary&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an exploratory analysis we will also assess whether Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation&#xD;
      may:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Enhances functional, social skills and quality of life scores; B. Increases sleep quality&#xD;
      and knowledge about the disorder; and C., Reduces impulsivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment as Usual (TAU) The control group from this study will receive standard out-patient&#xD;
      treatment offered in our clinic, which involves psychopharmacological mood stabilization and&#xD;
      regular contacts with mental health nurses. The number and amount of pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment will follow the physician decision, respecting individual demands. All&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment will be monitored and recorded in accordance to the Litmus study&#xD;
      (Nierenberg et al. 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
      We developed a 12-session intervention combining previous experience in cognitive behavior&#xD;
      therapy for bipolar patients with several elements of cognitive remediation. The first step&#xD;
      was to identify behaviors that have an important role in patients´ autonomy, followed by&#xD;
      determining which cognitive domains are involved. The core objective was to promote the&#xD;
      generalization of the learnt behaviors in the daily routine. Described below is the&#xD;
      arrangement of each session, divided in three major Modules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first Module comprises four sessions that attempt to improve attention and memory,&#xD;
      considering the necessity to retain the information discussed throughout the sessions. There&#xD;
      are two target behaviors involved: adherence to pharmacological treatment and mood&#xD;
      monitoring. The cognitive remediation exercises seek to enhance verbal and visual memories,&#xD;
      while secondarily enhancing attention with the paper material included in the manual. In the&#xD;
      first session, group members and psychotherapists introduce themselves, followed by a&#xD;
      discussion regarding the manual, individual´s expectations and the importance of attendance.&#xD;
      The second session explores the concept of attention, and its importance as a door to further&#xD;
      cognitive functions; the group also learns exercises aimed at training attention and memory.&#xD;
      The third session focuses on medication adherence and its relation to attention. The core of&#xD;
      the third session is the organization of the patient´s environment, which is frequently&#xD;
      chaotic; a discussion about cues is encouraged at the end of the session. The fourth session&#xD;
      starts by introducing mood graphics to patients and the importance of the early identifying&#xD;
      of mood episodes. At the end of the first module, patients are stimulated to cook as method&#xD;
      of reinforcing what they have learned while enhancing their autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second module targets social cognition and communication. The fifth session familiarizes&#xD;
      the patients with the concept of automatic thoughts (Rush and Beck, 1978), and a guide to&#xD;
      identify its presence. Cognitive distortions are discussed along with examples provided by&#xD;
      the subjects´ own experiences. The sixth session begins returning to the initial theme by&#xD;
      habituating patients to the automatic thought record (Beck, 1997), patients are stimulated to&#xD;
      restructure their own thoughts during experiences identified in previous sessions. Mental&#xD;
      flexibility and empathy are introduced and discussed. The seventh session acquaint patients&#xD;
      to assertive communication and emotion recognition by teaching role-playing exercises and the&#xD;
      importance of positive assertiveness. The eighth session follows the same agenda as the&#xD;
      seventh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last module of Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation aims at problem solving strategies and&#xD;
      relapse prevention. The ninth session begins with the identification of personal problems,&#xD;
      mainly by distinguishing it from preoccupations; the topic is important because patients&#xD;
      often incorporate their problems to expectations and desires, generating an urge to abandon&#xD;
      them, the session ends by emphasizing the importance of mental flexibility in generating as&#xD;
      many responses as possible to each identified problem. In the tenth session, patients learn&#xD;
      solving-problem techniques in a systematic setting. The eleventh session devotes to review&#xD;
      information and clarify possible doubts from the patients; patients are also encouraged to&#xD;
      debate the importance of regular routines and regular sleep, which can be adjusted using&#xD;
      sleep hygiene techniques. A progressive muscle relaxation ends the session. Finally, the last&#xD;
      session´s target is to avoid future mood relapses, it by returning to the personal goals&#xD;
      defined in session one and prompting patients to develop a prevention plan. The acronym&#xD;
      H.U.M.O.R. resumes the core points of the post-intervention maintenance program: 1) Habituate&#xD;
      to a regular routine; 2) Use what you have learnt; 3) Monitor your mood; 4) Observe arising&#xD;
      problems and deal effectively with it; and 5) Respond to automatic thoughts. All patients in&#xD;
      the cognitive behavioral rehabilitation group will also receive TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Sample Size The sample size calculation was based on the proportion of&#xD;
      patients that remain episode-free after 12 months following a group intervention. Previous&#xD;
      studies utilizing TAU exhibited a decrease of bipolar relapses in 30% of patients after a&#xD;
      one-year follow-up. The present study anticipates a 55% success rate in prevention of mood&#xD;
      relapses, during the same period, in patients assigned to the Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Rehabilitation. Thus, considering an 80% power to obtain a 5% significance, an estimated&#xD;
      sample of 28 individuals per group, 56 in total, should be sufficient to achieve significant&#xD;
      results. A previous study conducted by the same research team measured a drop-out rate of 10%&#xD;
      in a one year follow-up, for this latter reason, the study will consist of 60 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and Follow up Data. In order to measure the effects of the interventions, the study&#xD;
      will employ the following statistical tests: 1) Qui-squared and Mann-Whitney to test&#xD;
      homogeneity between the groups at the beginning of the interventions; 2) Student t test or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney to investigate the effects of such interventions, pre and post treatment,&#xD;
      depending on the distribution of the data; 3) An analysis of variance, with and without&#xD;
      adjustment for mood symptoms scores, IQ and BD duration, for comparison between groups; and&#xD;
      4) The Kaplan-Meyer survival method with log rank test for statistical analysis, to&#xD;
      investigate the survival data between groups, which measures in weeks, the time to the first&#xD;
      episode as an event.&#xD;
