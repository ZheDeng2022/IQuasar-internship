  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputation (LLA) is a major public health problem, with significant human and&#xD;
      financial impact. Epidemiological data remain scarce in the literature. The primary objective&#xD;
      of the equipment of lower limb amputees is to give a walking ability and autonomy that are&#xD;
      closest to the previous state before the amputation. About microprocessor-controlled&#xD;
      prosthetic knees (MPKs), there are currently three in France who benefit from support by&#xD;
      health insurance : 3C100 knee C-leg (Otto Bock HealthCare, Duderstadt, Germany), the Rheo&#xD;
      Knee (Ossur, Reykjavik, Iceland) and knee HYBRID 1P360 (Proteor, Saint Apollinaire, France).&#xD;
      These prostheses have the common feature of being equipped with a single-axis prosthetic&#xD;
      knee, controlled by a microprocessor, wich allows to adapt instantly to the user's walking&#xD;
      speed changes. They are indicated in the proximal amputations of the lower limbs from knee&#xD;
      disarticulation included. Their prescription can only be made by a doctor of Physical&#xD;
      Medicine and Rehabilitation. These prostheses are subject to four criteria attribution and&#xD;
      reimbursement by the List of Products and Services Refundable (LPPR = Liste des Produits et&#xD;
      Prestations Remboursables). This criteria are the ability to: have a walking speed greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 4 km/h, walk 2km continuous, descend an inclined slop of 15% and to walk&#xD;
      down the stairs step by step. These criteria must be validated after a minimum trial period&#xD;
      of 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These attribution criteria raise the question today of how they are measured, no&#xD;
      recommendation defining this procedure. While many standardized assessment tests of different&#xD;
      gait parameters are available and used in clinical research, the attribution criteria are not&#xD;
      being built in reference to these tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of two simple clinical&#xD;
      tests, the 2 and 6 minutes walk tests, to assess functional performance in patients with&#xD;
      transfemoral amputees with a microprocessor-controlled Prosthetic Knees (MPKs).&#xD;
