           (ECV) as an indicator of fibrosis severity in calf muscles, from one to 52 weeks&#xD;
           post-revascularization in patients with peripheral artery disease who have undergone&#xD;

      Patients will be randomly assigned to PRU-guided and non-PRU-guided group. In the non-PRU&#xD;
      -target group, dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel 75 mg and aspirin 100 mg daily will&#xD;
      be continued for 6 months after the procedure for patient followed with single antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy with clopidogrel 75 mg daily throughout the follow-up period. In the PRU-target&#xD;
      group, dual antiplatelet therapy will be the same protocol as in the non-PRU-target group for&#xD;
      patients with PRU &lt;234 seconds. However, for patients in the PRU-target group with PRU ≥234&#xD;
      seconds, rescue medicine will be added to keep PRU&lt;234 seconds.&#xD;
