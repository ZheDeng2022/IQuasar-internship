    <textblock>
      RAL is considered one of the better-tolerated antiretroviral medications, due to limited side&#xD;
      effects and few long-term safety concerns. Five-year clinical trial outcomes and clinical&#xD;
      experience have demonstrated durable virologic suppression in both treatment-naïve and&#xD;
      treatment-experienced patients, including patients with extensive antiretroviral history and&#xD;
      documented antiretroviral resistance. Studies have also exhibited low adverse effect rates&#xD;
      and reliable long-term safety lending to improved tolerance. Several trials have evaluated&#xD;
      the reduction in adverse effects in patients switched from various antiretroviral agents to&#xD;
      RAL. Treatment-naïve studies have demonstrated a lipid-neutral effect in patients on&#xD;
      RAL-containing regimens. When transitioning patients from a ritonavir-boosted PI regimen,&#xD;
      statistically significant decreases in total plasma cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and&#xD;
      triglycerides were demonstrated. Given its negligible interaction with the cytochrome P450&#xD;
      system, RAL displays minimal drug-drug interactions, making it a good option for ageing&#xD;
      patients on multiple medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational retrospective cohort in real world to describe RAL data, including&#xD;
      NUC-sparing regimens, in aged HIV patients. It is a phase IV study. 90 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled from the Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases of &quot;Sapienza&quot;&#xD;
      University of Rome. More than 4000 HIV patients are followed at this Department of Public&#xD;
      Health and Infectious Diseases of &quot;Sapienza&quot; University of Rome. More than 50% of these&#xD;
      patients are ≥ 50 years. From 10 to 12% are treated with a raltegravir based- regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the description of the proportion of participants with an HIV-1&#xD;
      viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change from Baseline in CD4+ T-cell counts, CD8 cell counts, CD4/ CD8 ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects with laboratory alterations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients with adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), also&#xD;
           according to their severity&#xD;

      Objectives The primary endpoint will be the description of the proportion of participants&#xD;
      with an HIV-1 viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change from Baseline in CD4+ T-cell counts, CD8 cell counts, CD4/ CD8 ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects with laboratory alterations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients with adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), also&#xD;
           according to their severity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Being this a retrospective study, a formal hypothesis is not formulated.&#xD;
      Background and Rationale Antiretroviral therapy has changed the natural history of HIV&#xD;
      infection. However, antiretroviral therapy must be maintained for life. Its potential&#xD;
      long-term adverse effects may interact synergistically with the ageing process, resulting in&#xD;
      a higher incidence of comorbidities. The increasing number of non-antiretroviral drugs used&#xD;
      to treat comorbidities may also place the patient at a higher risk of clinically meaningful&#xD;
      interactions. Nowadays, efficacy is well demonstrated by all antiretroviral drugs compared&#xD;
      with previous times. In fact a substantial number of HIV-infected patients from areas where&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy is widely available have achieved sustained suppression of plasma HIV&#xD;
      replication. In contrast, the contributions of antiretroviral therapy to the development and&#xD;
      progression of comorbidities and to the risk of potentially severe interactions have gained&#xD;
      increasing importance as HIV-infected patients are getting older. More than half of&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients aged ≥ 50 years have been reported to suffer from two or more&#xD;
      concomitant comorbidities. In some of these patients, maintenance of antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      with combinations including NRTIs or PIs may be challenging. Data on ageing HIV patients&#xD;
      under antiretroviral therapy are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAL is considered one of the better-tolerated antiretroviral medications, due to limited side&#xD;
      effects and few long-term safety concerns. Five-year clinical trial outcomes and clinical&#xD;
      experience have demonstrated durable virologic suppression in both treatment-naïve and&#xD;
      treatment-experienced patients, including patients with extensive antiretroviral history and&#xD;
      documented antiretroviral resistance. Studies have also exhibited low adverse effect rates&#xD;
      and reliable long-term safety lending to improved tolerance. Several trials have evaluated&#xD;
      the reduction in adverse effects in patients switched from various antiretroviral agents to&#xD;
      RAL. Treatment-naïve studies have demonstrated a lipid-neutral effect in patients on&#xD;
      RAL-containing regimens. When transitioning patients from a ritonavir-boosted PI regimen,&#xD;
      statistically significant decreases in total plasma cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and&#xD;
      triglycerides were demonstrated. Given its negligible interaction with the cytochrome P450&#xD;
      system, RAL displays minimal drug-drug interactions, making it a good option for ageing&#xD;
      patients on multiple medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is an observational retrospective cohort in real world to describe RAL&#xD;
      data, including NUC-sparing regimens, in aged HIV patients. It is a phase IV study. 90&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled from the Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases of&#xD;
      &quot;Sapienza&quot; University of Rome. More than 4000 HIV patients are followed at this Department of&#xD;
      Public Health and Infectious Diseases of &quot;Sapienza&quot; University of Rome. More than 50% of&#xD;
      these patients are ≥ 50 years. From 10 to 12% are treated with a raltegravir based- regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this retrospective analysis all naïve patients on raltegravir-based regimens and all&#xD;
      patients switched to raltegravir-based regimens will be considered. For raltegravir-based&#xD;
      regimens the investigators mean raltegravir as third agent in a triple regimen with NRTIs and&#xD;
      also raltegravir-based regimens in NUC-sparing therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raltegravir initiation is equivalent to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients fulfilling the following inclusion criteria are considered eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV-1 infected patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aged ≥ 60 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  naive patients receiving raltegravir based-regimen, including Nuc-sparing regimens,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  experienced patients with virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA&lt;50 copies) who had switched&#xD;
           from any antiretroviral drug to raltegravir-based regimens (including Nuc-sparing&#xD;
           regimens) because of toxicity, convenience or other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are collected from medical records. The Time horizon for patient follow-up for outcome&#xD;
      is at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be extracted from the database of the Department:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demographics (age, sex, race)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  risk factors for HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time from HIV-1 diagnosis (years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  history of AIDS diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  presence of co-morbidities (including diabetes, hypertension, CVD, CKD, cancer, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reasons for switching to raltegravir&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL before switch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematology (Hb, PLT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  eGFR (CKD-EPI formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phosphorus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calcium&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AST&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ALT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  total, direct, indirect bilirubin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  proteinuria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  total, HDL-, LDL-cholesterol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  triglycerides&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  glycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV-RNA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD4+, CD8, CD4/CD8 ratio since the start of raltegravir&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  previous ART regimen and number of previous antiretroviral agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will count from the date of start of raltegravir to VF/TF or last available visit,&#xD;
      whichever first occurred&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs were classified as mild/moderate, severe or life threatening, according to DAIDS&#xD;
      Classification. AEs were considered unrelated to RAL, possibly related or related, according&#xD;
      to physician criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data will be descriptive; no comparison data will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures At study visits, clinical data are collected and laboratory analyses&#xD;
      comprising CD4+ T cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA, blood cells, and plasma chemistry profiles,&#xD;
      including fasting lipids (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL], low-&#xD;
      density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, triglycerides) are recorded. Plasma HIV-1 RNA and all&#xD;
      other laboratory determinations are performed locally at each site throughout the follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration The Time horizon for patient follow-up for outcome is at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis and Sample Size Justification Descriptive analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics of enrolled patients will be presented as mean values ± standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD) and median value with interquartile range, absolute frequency (relative&#xD;
      frequency) according to the variable type and distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis The proportion of patients with an HIV-1 viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL will be&#xD;
      expressed as frequency and percentage. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of proportion and&#xD;
      corresponding incidence rate will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses The change from baseline of continuous variables will be assessed by the&#xD;
      Student's t-test for paired data for normally distributed variables (based on the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk statistics) and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non normally distributes ones.&#xD;
      All tests will be two-sided and a p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered as&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data analysis will be descriptive only. Safety data (AEs, SAEs) and laboratory&#xD;
      alterations will be tabulated, according to their severity, for a descriptive purpose only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power/Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 90 subjects produces two-sided 95% CI with the following width: when the&#xD;
      sample proportion of patients with an HIV-1 viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL is between 40% and 60%,&#xD;
      the 95% CI width is 0.2, that correspond to the possible maximum width in this study.&#xD;
      Corresponding widths are 0.17 for a sample proportion of 0.30 (or 0.70), 0.15 for a sample&#xD;
      proportion of 0.20 (or 0.80) and 0.13 for a sample proportion of 0.10 (or 0.90) (PASS 11.&#xD;
      NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Drug Supply Requirements No drug supply is required&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Experience Reporting Safety data will be descriptive; no comparison data will be&#xD;
      analyzed. If adverse events will be identified they will be reported to the Italian agency&#xD;
      for Drugs (AIFA) according to the law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessments For the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), an AE is defined&#xD;
      as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject&#xD;
      administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal&#xD;
      relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign&#xD;
      (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally&#xD;
      associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this&#xD;
      medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Results in death;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is life-threatening;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Is a cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Is associated with an overdose;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Is an Other Important Medical Event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life-threatening in the definition of a serious adverse event refers to an event in which the&#xD;
      subject was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event which&#xD;
      hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an adverse event/reaction is serious&#xD;
      in other situations. Important adverse events/ reactions that are not immediately&#xD;
      life-threatening or do not result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject&#xD;
      or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition&#xD;
      above, should also be considered serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild: awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated; Moderate: discomfort enough&#xD;
      to cause interference with usual activity and may warrant intervention; Severe:&#xD;
      incapacitating with inability to do normal daily living activities or significantly affects&#xD;
      clinical status, and warrants intervention Further details will be included in the study&#xD;
      agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      The publication plan will consider one manuscript.&#xD;
