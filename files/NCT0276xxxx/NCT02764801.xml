      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 2D and&#xD;
      4D contrast enhanced ultrasound for monitoring transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)&#xD;
      response 1-2 weeks and 1 month post treatment as an alternative to contrast-enhanced magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) imaging&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized trial that will be conducted at three clinical sites.&#xD;
      The subject population will be patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization for the&#xD;
      treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at Thomas Jefferson University, The University of&#xD;
      California, San Diego, and Vanderbilt University. Patients will receive a contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound (CEUS) exam the morning prior to embolization, approximately one week&#xD;
      post-embolization, and at their one month MRI follow up (scheduled as part of their clinical&#xD;
      standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will consist of up to 210 adults (70 per institution) undergoing transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization for the treatment of HCC split evenly between Thomas Jefferson University,&#xD;
      The University of California, San Diego, and Vanderbilt University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified and consecutively approached from each institution's Hepatology /&#xD;
      Transplant Surgery and Interventional Radiology practices (by each site's Hepatology or&#xD;
      Interventional Radiology co-investigators). An investigator or research coordinator will&#xD;
      explain the study to the patient. The patient will be given time to consider the risks and&#xD;
      benefits of the study and to ask questions about participation. A consent form will be&#xD;
      reviewed with the patient. A full history and physical examination will be obtained from the&#xD;
      patient's referring physician. If the subject is a woman of childbearing potential, she will&#xD;
      have a urine pregnancy test prior to each CEUS study (the results of which will be made&#xD;
      available to the subject prior to study initiation). In the event a patient presents with a&#xD;
      lesion that is expected to be difficult to view on ultrasound (for example, smaller lesions&#xD;
      located high on the liver dome), grayscale ultrasound imaging will quickly be performed to&#xD;
      ensure the lesion is visible on ultrasound and that the patient is suitable for study&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a total of three separate CEUS exams. These exams will consist of the&#xD;
      baseline study the morning prior to TACE therapy, a study 1-2 weeks post treatment that will&#xD;
      coincide with clinical post-procedure follow-up by the interventional radiologist, and a&#xD;
      study approximately one month post treatment when patients return for clinically scheduled&#xD;
      CE-CT/MRI follow-up. If the patient fails to show up for the 1-2 week CEUS exam, they will&#xD;
      not be excluded from the final ultrasound exam. Procedures and equipment for this trial will&#xD;
      be used in accordance with standard clinical protocols and good clinical practices already in&#xD;
      place at our hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first three cases at each institution (baseline and at least one follow-up) will be&#xD;
      performed under the guidance of at least one of the study PIs to ensure standardization&#xD;
      amongst all three sites. The ultrasound examinations will be performed by a qualified&#xD;
      sonographer. Efforts will be made to have all CEUS scans performed by the same dedicated&#xD;
      sonographer, enabling us to evaluate operator dependence. During the ultrasound examination,&#xD;
      the patient will be asked to lie in the supine position and a 20-22 gauge cannula will be&#xD;
      placed in a superficial vein (preferably an antecubital vein). Ultrasound imaging will be&#xD;
      performed using a state of the art Logiq E9 scanner with C1-5-D broad-spectrum convex&#xD;
      transducer and a RAB2-5-D broad-spectrum real-time 4D transducer (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa,&#xD;
      WI). As part of this study, the investigators have budgeted for the purchase of 3 4D probes&#xD;
      (not routinely available in clinical practice) and the installation of GE's ultrasound&#xD;
      volumetric and contrast imaging packages that provide 2D and 4D CEUS capabilities. In the&#xD;
      event the patient has multiple lesions scheduled for treatment, up to 2 lesions will be&#xD;
      imaged independently on CEUS. Patients will first undergo 2D baseline imaging. B-mode&#xD;
      measurements and sweeps of the lesion in the transverse and sagittal planes will be&#xD;
      performed, followed by standard power Doppler imaging (PDI). Following baseline imaging,&#xD;
      patients will receive a bolus IV injection of up to 0.6 ml of Definity, followed by a 10 cc&#xD;
      saline flush. Since Definity is currently only approved for echocardiography, the&#xD;
      investigators have applied to the FDA for an investigational new drug application for CEUS&#xD;
      evaluation of TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CEUS imaging will be performed using the dual B-mode (used to locate anatomical features)&#xD;
      and nonlinear contrast (to identify the ultrasound contrast agent) imaging mode. A low&#xD;
      mechanical index (&lt; 0.1) will be used to minimize microbubble destruction during imaging. The&#xD;
      standard nonlinear imaging frequency pairings in the contrast imaging software will be used&#xD;
      (transmitting at 2 MHz, receiving at the 4 MHz harmonic), and gain settings will be adjusted&#xD;
      to minimize nonlinear signals prior to contrast injection. Additionally, the focal zone will&#xD;
      be placed at the approximate depth of the lesion to maximize the generation of nonlinear&#xD;
      signals during CEUS. During the first contrast injection, 2D CEUS will be performed using the&#xD;
      coded harmonics nonlinear imaging package on the unit. The approximate tumor mid-line will be&#xD;
      imaged until homogenous liver enhancement is achieved (approximately 45 seconds post&#xD;
      injection), followed by imaging sweeps through the tumor. Sweeps will then be acquired in the&#xD;
      sagittal plane, before returning to the original plane. Imaging will be continued until&#xD;
      contrast washout is observed (approximately 3-4 minutes), after which data will be digitally&#xD;
      stored for later review. A fifteen minute wait period will be observed between injections to&#xD;
      allow for complete ultrasound contrast agent clearance. A region of interest encompassing the&#xD;
      entire tumor volume and margin will then be selected in 4D mode. Baseline imaging of the&#xD;
      tumor will be repeated in 4D mode in grayscale B-mode. A second bolus injection of up to 0.6&#xD;
      ml Definity followed by 10 cc saline flush will again be administered during continuous tumor&#xD;
      imaging in 4D, which uses the machine's coded harmonics package. Data will be obtained until&#xD;
      contrast washout is observed and then digitally stored in digital imaging and communications&#xD;
      in medicine (DICOM) format for later review.&#xD;
