    <textblock>
      This is a two center, single arm, investigator sponsored trial (IST) with the PET tracer&#xD;
      89Zr-pembrolizumab to evaluate in vivo whole body distribution of 89Zr-Pembrolizumab in a&#xD;
      registered indication: locally advanced metastatic melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      before Pembrolizumab treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Immunotherapy targeting specific immune-regulatory checkpoints, mainly cytotoxic&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Death (PD1) or PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) have shown&#xD;
      spectacular effects in a broad range of solid malignancies, including melanoma and non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Pembrolizumab, is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction&#xD;
      between PD-1 on T-cells with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Anti-tumor activity with an&#xD;
      acceptable side effect profile have been shown in melanoma and NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radio-labeling of pembrolizumab with the positron emission tomography (PET) radionuclide&#xD;
      89Zirkonium (89Zr) enables serial non-invasive imaging and quantification of distribution of&#xD;
      PD-1 in melanoma patients. By performing a 89Zr-pembrolizumab-PET scan prior to treatment&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab, the uptake of the tracer in the tumor lesions and normal organ&#xD;
      distribution can be evaluated, this could lead to new insights about heterogeneity of PD-1&#xD;
      expression, as well as the use of a 89Zr-pembrolizumab-PET as a complementary tool for&#xD;
      patient selection in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Primary objective: To evaluate whole body distribution of 89Zr-pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma or NSCLC. Secondary objectives: i) To&#xD;
      evaluate pharmacokinetics of 89Zr-pembrolizumab; ii) To assess the heterogeneity of&#xD;
      89Zr-pembrolizumab tumor uptake; iii) To describe safety of 89Zr-pembrolizumab; iv) To&#xD;
      correlate the tumor response of pembrolizumab, as measured by objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      according to standard RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator, with specific tumor tracer&#xD;
      uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a two center, single arm, investigator sponsored trail (IST) with the&#xD;
      PET tracer 89Zr-pembrolizumab to evaluate in vivo whole body distribution of&#xD;
      89Zr-pembrolizumab in a registered indication for locally advanced metastatic melanoma or&#xD;
      NSCLC before Pembrolizumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Eligible are patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma or&#xD;
      NSCLC, who are eligible to receive Pembrolizumab treatment and who have at least one tumor&#xD;
      site that is accessible for a tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention : In part A of the imaging trial, a dose finding imaging study will be performed&#xD;
      to assess the optimal tracer protein dose of 89Zr-pembrolizumab and the optimal interval&#xD;
      between tracer injection and scanning. Approximately 3 cohorts of about 2-3 patients each&#xD;
      will undergo 89Zr-pembrolizumab-PET imaging before start of treatment with pembrolizumab. In&#xD;
      part B, 12 eligible patients will undergo 89Zr-pembrolizumab-PET imaging at baseline, with&#xD;
      the optimal tracer protein dose and scanning schedule as determined in part A. In total, a&#xD;
      maximum of 21 patients will be included.The purpose of part B of the study is to analyze the&#xD;
      whole body distribution and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 89Zr-Pembrolizumab. Tumor and normal&#xD;
      organ radioactive tracer uptake will be quantified as standardized uptake values (SUV). Tumor&#xD;
      biopsies will be collected at baseline and studied for various characteristics including&#xD;
      Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PDL-1), PD-1 expression and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab treatment will be administered as standard of care Main study&#xD;
      parameters/endpoints: To evaluate whole body distribution of 89Zr-pembrolizumab in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: For this imaging study patients have to make maximal 6 extra visits to the&#xD;
      clinic for screening, to receive tracer injection and for maximal 3 PET/CT scans and the&#xD;
      biopsy before start of standard treatment with pembrolizumab. The study ends after the last&#xD;
      imaging or biopsy (whichever comes first) and will approximately take 7 days. Whenever&#xD;
      possible, all procedures that are part of the study protocol will be planned during regular&#xD;
      visits to the hospital as part of care as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      89Zr-pembrolizumab-PET/CT implements a radiation burden of about 20 millisievert (mSv), and&#xD;
      1.5 mSv per low-dose CT scan. Besides PET imaging, patients will be asked to give in total 12&#xD;
      blood samples (85 mL), which will give minor discomfort. A metastases biopsy will be&#xD;
      performed, preferably from an easily accessible lesion to minimize the burden and risk for&#xD;
      the patient. Based on a literature review, the risk of tumor biopsies is considered low with&#xD;
      a small risk on significant/major complications or death. The risk associated with the&#xD;
      89Zr-pembrolizumab seems minor and although patients do not directly benefit from this study,&#xD;
      results of this study will be valuable for our understanding of the tumor immune response and&#xD;
      will guide further prospective research.&#xD;
