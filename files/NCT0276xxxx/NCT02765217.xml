      Recent studies showed that intestinal microbiota consist more than thousand bacteria, and&#xD;
      these microorganisms play the role as balance and continuity of the anatomical and functional&#xD;
      integrity gastrointestinal tract. Chronic diseases, nutritional factors, lifestyle factors&#xD;
      and medications including antibiotics changes the host microbiota in short or long-term&#xD;
      period. Antibiotics are the most commonly used drugs in pediatrics routine practice. Although&#xD;
      frequency and severity of side effects alter the choice of drug, mild complications may be&#xD;
      taken into consideration for treatment by a physician in the profit and loss balance. Our&#xD;
      study group (PROBAGE Working Group) have been recently showed that Lactobacillus reuteri DSM&#xD;
      17938 reduced the duration of diarrhea in children with acute infectious diarrhea, and are&#xD;
      safe and well-tolerated. In this study the investigators aim to evaluate the potential effect&#xD;

      Recent studies showed that intestinal microbiota consist more than thousand bacteria, and&#xD;
      these microorganisms play the role as balance and continuity of the anatomical and functional&#xD;
      integrity gastrointestinal tract. Chronic diseases, nutritional factors, lifestyle factors&#xD;
      and medications including antibiotics changes the host microbiota in short or long-term&#xD;
      period. Antibiotics are the most commonly used drugs in pediatrics routine practice. Although&#xD;
      frequency and severity of side effects alter the choice of drug, mild complications may be&#xD;
      taken into consideration for treatment by a physician in the profit and loss balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is one of the side effects that occur during antibiotic use,&#xD;
      the frequency varies according to region and antibiotic type. Aminopenicillins,&#xD;
      cephalosporins and clindamycin antibiotics has been identified as the most affected group of&#xD;
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Development of antibiotic associated diarrhea are associated&#xD;
      with the intestinal microbiota balance , the mucosal integrity and changes of vitamin /&#xD;
      mineral metabolism 3. Majority cases with antibiotic associated diarrhea admit with the&#xD;
      complaints of abdominal crampy pain and diarrhea while pseudomembranous enterocolitis, in&#xD;
      severe cases, even death have been reported. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea can be occur&#xD;
      during antibiotic treatment but may seen at 2-3 weeks later after termination of treatment.&#xD;
      Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents have been related 11-40% of antibiotic associated&#xD;
      diarrhea cases in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Turkey there are no large studies on the frequency of antibiotic associated diarrhea in&#xD;
      children, but antibiotics are the most commonly used drug classes in childhood. The use of&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibiotics, which creates more risk than narrow-spectrum antibiotics, and the&#xD;
      highest risk have been observed during use of clindamycin, cephalosporins and&#xD;
      fluoroquinolones. However, there is no consensus about which antibiotics which are high risk&#xD;
      or which have significant negative impact on the microbiota. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea,&#xD;
      has been shown to increase the growth of enteropathogens after antibiotic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infections are the most common infections&#xD;
      which related with antibiotic associated diarrhea 2. Although C. difficile diarrhea mostly&#xD;
      occurs in adults and hospitalized immunocompromised patients, it can be seen in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. difficile leads to mild diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis according to toxins. C.&#xD;
      difficile associated 10-20% of all antibiotic-associated diarrhea forms and can be seen until&#xD;
      after eight weeks of treatment with antibiotics. Antibiotics disrupt the integrity of the&#xD;
      normal colonic mucosa, affect carbohydrate metabolism as a result of antimicrobial activity&#xD;
      in the colon leads to the development of osmotic diarrhea and pathogenic bacteria associated&#xD;
      diarrhea. The slowing of the metabolism of carbohydrates results in the reduction of&#xD;
      short-chain fatty acids in the intestinal lumen and cause accumulation of carbohydrates which&#xD;
      can not be absorbed. Besides the harm normal microbiota have provided the protective barrier&#xD;
      and intestinal system becomes sensitive to resistant microorganisms. Reduction of intestinal&#xD;
      lumen and in the number of Bacteroides and Bifidobacteria strains of facultative anaerobes&#xD;
      (Fusobacterium the Clostridia, Eubacteria) results in the increase. Antibiotic-associated&#xD;
      diarrhea, alongside a negative effect on the quality of life of the host, the cost of&#xD;
      treatment in patients hospitalized in the hospital and also negatively affects the length of&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of outpatient treatment, or in hospitalized patients, antibiotic treatment usually is&#xD;
      terminated or is changed, it affects the success of the treatment in this case and leads to a&#xD;
      longer stay in hospital. Especially the long-term hospitalization in the intensive care unit&#xD;
      at the hospital caused by an increase in the risk of nosocomial infections and has been shown&#xD;
      to cause mortality 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of diarrhea in patients treated ambulatory during treatment if the patient's symptoms&#xD;
      also declined, antibiotic treatment is interrupted by family. If cases can result in use&#xD;
      therefore again brought to the physician if the physician broader spectrum antibiotics or&#xD;
      parenteral drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In studies with probiotics, some of the probiotic strains of antibiotic-associated diarrhea&#xD;
      development when used in combination with antibiotics it has been shown to be significantly&#xD;
      reduced. Harvard / Yale probiotic Workshop Group, World Gastroenterology Organization in the&#xD;
      prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea probiotic strains showed that the level of&#xD;
      evidence A1. However, probiotics effects are strain specific. Although Saccharomyces&#xD;
      boulardii and Lactobacillus GG are well known strains for prevention of antibiotic associated&#xD;
      diarrhea, knowledge about the Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study group (PROBAGE Working Group) have been recently showed that Lactobacillus reuteri&#xD;
      DSM 17938 reduced the duration of diarrhea in children with acute infectious diarrhea, and&#xD;
      are safe and well-tolerated. In this study the investigators aim to evaluate the potential&#xD;
      effect of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 on the prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea&#xD;
      in children.&#xD;
