      Background During ventilatory assistance, optimization of settings is critical to allow a&#xD;
      personalized support and avoid over- or under-assistance. But little data are available in&#xD;
      clinical practice to guide the adjustment of the support. In adults, esophageal pressure&#xD;
      (PES) has been shown to be a reliable surrogate of pleural pressure (PPL) and clinical&#xD;
      studies suggest that PES may be useful to guide the management of mechanical ventilation. In&#xD;
      children, the PES measurement could have similar potential benefits, but beforehand the&#xD;
      reliability of PES to estimate PPL needs to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The primary objective of this study is to validate the reliability of PES directly&#xD;
      monitored using a miniature catheter tip pressure transducer (Gaeltec® system) to estimate&#xD;
      PPL, when compared to a gold standard, i.e the direct PPL measurement in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method This is a prospective single center study. Children &lt;18 years old, hospitalized in the&#xD;
      pediatric intensive care unit, requiring invasive ventilation and with at least one chest&#xD;
      tube will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol A pressure transducer will be connected to the existing chest-tube and PES (measured&#xD;
      by Gaeltec® and feeding tube), PPL, PAW, respiratory volume and flow will be simultaneously&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results We expect that the PES-based methods will provide an accurate estimation of&#xD;
      PPL. Once this tool validated, PES could be helpful to optimize mechanical ventilation in&#xD;
      children, and further interventional trials would be warranted to evaluate if its use could&#xD;
      allow a reduction of the ventilation support duration.&#xD;
