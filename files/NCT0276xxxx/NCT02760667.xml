  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of induction chemotherapy followed by&#xD;
      transoral surgical treatment and neck dissection, in definitive management of moderately&#xD;
      advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. The surgical treatment will carry out&#xD;
      Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) or Transoral Laser Microsurgery (TLM) for the primary tumor,&#xD;
      and neck dissection for the management of cervical lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be disease specific survival (DSS). The secondary oncologic&#xD;
      outcome measures will be locoregional control, relapse free survival, overall survival, and&#xD;
      Quality of Life (QOL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for advanced (stage III and IV) oropharyngeal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma are concomitant chemoradiation, or surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy&#xD;
      with or without concomitant chemotherapy. These approaches have persistent and significant&#xD;
      lifelong side effects and sequella related to treatment, and in particular radiotherapy. The&#xD;
      side effects of radiotherapy (augmented with concomitant chemotherapy) include soft tissue&#xD;
      fibrosis, loss of salivary function, dry mouth, life long disturbed taste function, poor&#xD;
      dental health with rapidly decaying teeth, dysfunction of swallowing, significant loss of the&#xD;
      mobility of the base of tongue and pharyngeal constrictors, loss of laryngeal elevation,&#xD;
      esophageal stricture, and at times severe side effects such as soft tissue necrosis or&#xD;
      osteoradionecrosis of the mandible. About 10% of the patients undergoing chemoradiation for&#xD;
      oropharyngeal cancer develop long term swallowing dysfunction with feeding tube dependency.&#xD;
      As a result , patient's quality of life (QOL) is adversely affected. Improvements in the side&#xD;
      effect profile of treatment, the functional outcome, and the QOL remain very important areas&#xD;
      of advancement in treating this patient population. Improvements in functional outcome need&#xD;
      to be achieved while maintaining or improving the oncologic outcome and cure rates for&#xD;
      cancer, compared to the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of new Taxane based chemotherapy along with Platinum drugs (Cisplatin and Carboplatin) in&#xD;
      high dose neoadjuvant setting, coupled with novel minimally invasive Transoral Laser&#xD;
      Microsurgery (TLM) and Transoral Robotic Assisted Surgery (TORS), allows potential for&#xD;
      improved oncologic outcome as well as avoidance of long term sequalla of high dose radiation&#xD;
      therapy to head and neck. These transoral surgical approaches (TLM and TORS) provide improved&#xD;
      functional outcome compared with traditional open composite resections and complex&#xD;
      reconstructive algorithms for oropharynx. TLM and TORS are currently in clinical use for&#xD;
      early (stage T1 and T2 with N0 or N+ve) oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An area not adequately or at all investigated in treating moderately advanced oropharyngeal&#xD;
      cancer is combining neoadjuvant high dose chemo-induction followed by minimally invasive&#xD;
      transoral surgery (TLM and TORS) and neck dissection as the definitive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach has the potential for far improved functional outcome by avoiding short and&#xD;
      more importantly long term and permanent sequella of radiation therapy in oropharyngeal&#xD;
      cancer treatment. This approach is a new paradigm in treatment of oropharyngeal cancer, and&#xD;
      can significantly improve the functional outcome of cancer treatment.&#xD;
