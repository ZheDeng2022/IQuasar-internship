  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD) is the most common cause of blindness in the adult&#xD;
      population of the Western World. It affects the macula - the region of the retina most rich&#xD;
      in photoreceptors and responsible for central vision. The ethiology of ARMD remains poorly&#xD;
      understood. Population-based studies have demonstrated a complex ethiology, with&#xD;
      contributions from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two major forms of ARMD are clinically distinguishable: the dry and wet form. The latter&#xD;
      represents the more aggressive clinical subgroup, and is characterized by the abnormal growth&#xD;
      of new blood vessels (neovascularization) under the macula, thus leading to the accumulation&#xD;
      of fluid under the retina, bleeding, progression to fibrosis, and finally loss of central&#xD;
      vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of this neovascularization is not fully understood, although the VEGF&#xD;
      pathway is well known to be involved in angiogenesis and was implicated in the development of&#xD;
      the new vessels under the macula. The VEGFs are the most specific and potent stimulators of&#xD;
      the angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecules that bind and inactivate the VEGF have been developed for the treatment of ARMD and&#xD;
      they are applied in ARMD clinic through intra vitreal injections.The difference seen in&#xD;
      response to anti VEGF treatment for ARMD between the patients is suggestive for the presence&#xD;
      of factors influencing the effect of the drug. Some of these could be genetic variants within&#xD;
      genes involved in ARMD pathogenesis or VEGF pathway. Few associations with markers within&#xD;
      genes previously found to be related with the pathogenesis of ARMD have been found. It&#xD;
      remains unknown whether variants involved in the anti VEGF treatment response could influence&#xD;
      the therapeutic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the association between a panel of selected&#xD;
      polymorphic markers in the VEGF pathway and the response to therapy with anti VEGF antibody&#xD;
      for ARMD. The hypothesis is that the individual genotype influences the response to the anti&#xD;
      VEGF. This can lead to identification of genetic biomarkers allowing treatment&#xD;
      individualization and optimization of the visual outcomes.&#xD;

      Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD) is the most common cause of blindness in the adult&#xD;
      population of the Western World. It affects the macula - the region of the retina most rich&#xD;
      in photoreceptors and responsible for central vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this manifest importance, the ethiology of ARMD remains poorly understood.&#xD;
      Population-based studies have demonstrated a complex ethiology, with contributions from a&#xD;
      combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies revealed&#xD;
      the presence of loci associated with susceptibility in a wide range of genes, including genes&#xD;
      involved in the complement system, cholesterol homeostasis, growth factor diffusion and&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Smoking has been identified as a major environmental factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two major forms of ARMD are clinically distinguishable: the dry and wet form. The latter&#xD;
      represents the more aggressive clinical subgroup, and is characterized by the abnormal growth&#xD;
      of new blood vessels (neovascularization) under the macula, thus leading to the accumulation&#xD;
      of fluid under the retina, bleeding, progression to fibrosis, and finally loss of central&#xD;
      vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of this neovascularization is not fully understood, although the VEGF&#xD;
      pathway is well known to be involved in angiogenesis and was implicated in the development of&#xD;
      the new vessels under the macula. The VEGFs are the most specific and potent stimulators of&#xD;
      the angiogenesis. VEGF-A is a 45kD glycoprotein binding to transmembrane tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      receptors, VEGFRs, which activates a cascade of downstream factors. VEGF-A has the strongest&#xD;
      pro-angiogenic effect in the retina by promoting proliferation, sprouting and tubing of the&#xD;
      endothelial cells. It can bind to at least two receptors -VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, although the&#xD;
      most of the proangiogenic activity appears to be mediated through VEGFR2. Expression of a&#xD;
      VEGFR2 isoform that lacks both the intracellular signaling domain and the transmembrane&#xD;
      domain, represents a soluble form of the receptor, inactivating VEGF extracellularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, molecules that bind and inactivate the VEGF have been developed for the treatment&#xD;
      of ARMD and they are applied in ARMD clinic through intra vitreal injections. These include&#xD;
      antibodies, a recombinant receptor fusion protein and a synthetic aptamer. The anti-VEGFA&#xD;
      antibodies - ranibizumab and bevacizumab, off-label, have been associated with limited&#xD;
      side-effects and significant therapeutic improvement, and became the standard in the&#xD;
      treatment of the wet form of ARMD. Indeed, for example in the first clinical trials for&#xD;
      ranibizumab, monthly injections of ranibizumab demonstrated an average gain in visual acuity&#xD;
      of 6.6 and 10.7 ETDRS letters after 24 months. However, currently most clinical centres apply&#xD;
      modified treatment protocols. Commonly used is an initial loading dose of three consecutive&#xD;
      monthly injections and subsequent follow-up and administration of additional injections&#xD;
      depending on the evolution of visual acuity, optical coherence tomography and fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography data . 25% of the ARMD patients show significant improvement of the visual&#xD;
      acuity, 70% maintain or show slightly increased visual acuity, and the remaining 5 percent of&#xD;
      the patients fail to respond to the treatment and continue to loose vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference seen in response to anti VEGF treatment for ARMD between the patients is&#xD;
      suggestive for the presence of factors influencing the effect of the drug. Some of these&#xD;
      could be genetic variants within genes involved in ARMD pathogenesis or VEGF pathway. Few&#xD;
      associations with markers within genes previously found to be related with the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of ARMD have been found. It remains unknown whether variants involved in the anti VEGF&#xD;
      treatment response could influence the therapeutic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study demonstrated that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in VEGFR1 rs7993418 (TAC&#xD;
      codon) form is associated to resistance to the anti VEGF therapy in carcinoma patients. This&#xD;
      specific genotype leads to an increased expression of the VEGFR1 without changing the amino&#xD;
      acid content of the protein. The increased VEGFR1 protein is most likely due to higher&#xD;
      efficiency of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) translation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the association between a panel of selected&#xD;
      polymorphic markers in the VEGF pathway and the response to therapy with anti VEGF antibody&#xD;
      for ARMD. The hypothesis is that the individual genotype influences the response to the anti&#xD;
      VEGF. This can lead to identification of genetic biomarkers allowing treatment&#xD;
      individualization and optimization of the visual outcomes.&#xD;
