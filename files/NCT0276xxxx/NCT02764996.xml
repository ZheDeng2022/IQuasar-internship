  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an exploratory observational trial of rescue acupuncture for the treatment of&#xD;
      acute migraine in military beneficiaries to gain information to inform the power analysis of&#xD;
      a larger, more definitive trial. Researchers do not seek to definitively answer the question&#xD;
      of whether this acupuncture protocol is effective; rather, we seek to estimate the proportion&#xD;
      of migraine episodes that result in headache-free status 20-30 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, and&#xD;
      24 hours after an acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture treatments will be subject dependent,&#xD;
      and points could include the N point (on scalp); various auricular points to include Shen&#xD;
      Men, Point Zero, thalamus and Omega-2; body points to include Liver 2, Liver 3, Gall Bladder&#xD;
      20, bladder 10; and surface release over tense areas in the neck or shoulders. Researchers&#xD;
      will document the points used, and data will be aggregated to determine overall&#xD;
      effectiveness. Sub-group analysis by points will be performed to determine if there is more&#xD;
      usefulness in 1 point or combination of points. These estimates will inform statistical power&#xD;
      calculations for a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) that directly compares the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Rescue Acupuncture with medical management of acute migraine with rescue&#xD;
      medication. Researchers will also assess the feasibility of this study protocol as well as&#xD;
      patient receptivity and satisfaction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Male and female (DoD beneficiaries). Age 18 years or older, who meet eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be offered an opportunity to participate via Primary Care Manager (PCM) referrals and&#xD;
      posted advertisements will be utilized for recruiting subjects to the study. Some patients&#xD;
      may be patients of the Principal Investigator or Associate Investigator, however, they will&#xD;
      have the study staff recruit their patients to prevent any misconception of coercion or undue&#xD;
      influence. When a potential subject is identified by the treating PCM, the patient will&#xD;
      either be provide a contact number to the Research Staff, the Research Staff will be given&#xD;
      the potential subjects contact information by the PCM, or the PCM will come and get the&#xD;
      Research Staff to speak with the patient directly. Researchers will administer acupuncture&#xD;
      treatments for up to 6 different migraine episodes per subject over the course of 3 months.&#xD;
      This type of Acupuncture for this indication is routinely done as part of standard-of-care in&#xD;
      our Family Medicine and acupuncture clinics both in conjunction with rescue medications and&#xD;
      as a stand-alone therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit:&#xD;

           (AHLTA) to verify the inclusion/exclusion criteria including previous encounter, vital&#xD;
           signs review, medication list, co-morbidities, demographics, problems list, and note any&#xD;
           prior acupuncture received. (research only)&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Researchers will ask what the subjects expectations are regarding acupuncture's&#xD;
           effectiveness for migraine. (research only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will instruct subjects not to take their over-the-counter and prescription&#xD;
           headache medications until after their visit with the research staff. (Standard care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will instruct subjects to bring their over-the-counter and prescription&#xD;
           headache medications with them to each visit if their symptoms do not resolve from the&#xD;
           acupuncture treatment. (research only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will be instructed to contact the Research Coordinator, as soon as possible,&#xD;
           after onset of migraine symptoms (including prodromal symptoms) to schedule an emergent&#xD;
           visit with the research staff. (research only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will be given a contact card with the names and phone numbers of the research&#xD;
           staff to contact when they have a migraine episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine Episode:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported headache pain severity (0=no headache, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe)&#xD;
           (Standard care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record type and amount of rescue medications (over-the-counter and prescription) use in&#xD;
           the past 7 days. (research only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acupuncture treatments will be subject dependent, and points could include the N point&#xD;
           (on scalp); various auricular points to include Shen Men, Point Zero, thalamus and&#xD;
           Omega-2; body points to include Liver 2, Liver 3, Gall Bladder 20, bladder 10; and&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Researchers will document the points used. (Standard care)&#xD;
&#xD;
           *If after 20-30 minutes these patients have not had resolution of their headache, they&#xD;
           may take their standard of care rescue medication. (research only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject will sit for 20-30 minutes post-acupuncture(research only), and then the&#xD;
           needles will be removed and the subject will be asked:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Self-reported headache pain severity (0=no headache, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe)&#xD;
           (research only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject is allowed to leave and will be informed of the following telephone follow ups:&#xD;
&#xD;
