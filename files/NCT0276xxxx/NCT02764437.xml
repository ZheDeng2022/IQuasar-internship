      The investigators have identified areas of the brain that are activated in response to&#xD;
      disease-related emotional information, following whole lung allergen challenge in asthma.&#xD;
      They propose that activity in these central nervous system locations, as measured by fMRI, is&#xD;
      associated with the intensity of allergic inflammation, provoked by segmental bronchial&#xD;
      challenge, in the absence of significant airflow obstruction. The investigators predict that&#xD;
      this relationship will be mediated by changes in expression of genes in the IL-1β/IL-17&#xD;
      pathway.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airflow&#xD;
      obstruction. The development of symptoms in patients with asthma is initiated by exposure to&#xD;
      a variety of airborne substances including aeroallergens. The inhalation of these allergens&#xD;
      by asthmatic subjects initiates a series of complex, interactive immune events through&#xD;
      activation of cell bound IgE, which serve to further existing airway inflammation, intensify&#xD;
      underlying airway hyperresponsiveness and cause airflow obstruction. Although the immune&#xD;
      events and processes associated with these reactions are largely localized to the airways&#xD;
      themselves, a variety of other factors can contribute to the ongoing allergic response in&#xD;
      either an enhancing or inhibitory manner. The regulation and modulation of these inflammatory&#xD;
      actions is a key determinant to the eventual severity of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial step in the activation of the allergic airway response is the ability of inhaled&#xD;
      allergen to activate IgE molecules on the pulmonary mast cell to release stored mediators and&#xD;
      generate synthesis of new products, which can acutely contract airway smooth muscle. The mast&#xD;
      cell also is capable of generating a variety of cytokines, which, in turn, can cause&#xD;
      persistence and progression of the allergic response by furthering the underlying&#xD;
      inflammation. In addition to mast cell activation, inhaled allergens are capable of&#xD;
      stimulating resident lymphocytes in the lung. It is proposed that these allergen-responsive&#xD;
      lymphocytes belong to a subpopulation of T helper cells (Th2), which are capable of&#xD;
      generating a variety of cytokines, i.e. interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. These Th2&#xD;
      cytokines can activate the local inflammatory response and can also serve to initiate events&#xD;
      outside the lung, which can then further promote the persistence of the allergic inflammatory&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To illustrate the means by which newly generated lung mediators can affect allergic&#xD;
      inflammation, investigators have shown that inhaled allergen is associated with enhanced bone&#xD;
      marrow generation of eosinophils. This enhanced bone marrow production of eosinophils is&#xD;
      associated with bone marrow cell generation of IL-5, which causes terminal differentiation of&#xD;
      eosinophils and their release into the circulation. Presumably, these recently generated&#xD;
      eosinophils enter the circulation and are recruited to the lung where they may further the&#xD;
      development of eosinophilic inflammation and the severity of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other factors also influence the development and intensity of the allergic inflammatory&#xD;
      response to inhaled allergen. In preliminary studies, the investigators have found that the&#xD;
      stress associated with the final examination period in college students will enhance the&#xD;
      eosinophilic inflammatory response to inhaled allergen. In addition, the investigators have&#xD;
      found that during the final examination period, and independent of an allergen challenge,&#xD;
      circulating eosinophils increase. Moreover, Marin and colleagues (2009) studied children with&#xD;
      asthma over a two-year period and found that mononuclear cells from children who reported&#xD;
      persistent life stress coupled with an acute stressful event produced elevated levels of&#xD;
      asthma-promoting cytokines compared to asthmatic children without chronic stress or healthy&#xD;
      controls. These findings suggest that the persistent stress associated with an acute stressor&#xD;
      may promote allergic inflammatory events and that these processes include regulation of&#xD;
      eosinophil numbers and recruitment to the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From these studies, the investigators have evidence to suggest that stress-related events can&#xD;
      influence allergic inflammation and, presumably, that these peripheral responses are&#xD;
      regulated by central nervous system (CNS) events. Although stress-related events can modulate&#xD;
      inflammatory processes, the mechanisms and CNS-site of this activity are poorly understood.&#xD;
      It is proposed that areas of the brain are activated by stress and that these areas of&#xD;
      activation may represent sites in the CNS that integrate information concerning the internal&#xD;
      state of the body and signal the generation of modulating factors in the enhancement or&#xD;
      inhibition of the allergic airway inflammation. To visualize these potential sites of CNS&#xD;
      activation in asthma, it is possible to use neuroimaging techniques, such as positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The investigators&#xD;
      have completed two prior studies that used fMRI to evaluate the central mechanisms associated&#xD;
      with allergic inflammation, and in both studies, the anterior insula was identified as a&#xD;
      region activated by asthma-related emotional cues that predicted the subsequent development&#xD;
      of airway inflammation (e.g. Rosenkranz, M et al (2005) Proceedings of the National Academy&#xD;
      of Science 102, 13319-13324.). In addition, the investigators have completed a study using&#xD;
      PET to evaluate the neural mechanisms through which stress along contributes to&#xD;
      asthma-related inflammation in individuals with high and low levels of chronic stress. This&#xD;
      study corroborated our findings using fMRI, showing involvement of the insula, and also&#xD;
      revealed new mechanisms involving IL-1β/IL-17 as a potential pathway linking through which&#xD;
      stress-reactivity primes airway inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the research described here, these two experimental paradigms will be merged to 1)&#xD;
      determine the contribution of the IL-1β/IL-17 pathway in response of emotion neural circuitry&#xD;
      provoked by airway inflammation in the absence of bronchoconstriction and 2) to determine the&#xD;
      neural mechanisms and impact of acute stress on the airway inflammatory response to whole&#xD;
      lung allergen challenge.&#xD;
