  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Some patients with unusual genetic conditions are referred to the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health (NIH). They may not be eligible to join current research studies.&#xD;
      Testing such patients is a good way to improve the skills of research staff. The findings&#xD;
      could lead to new processes and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To recruit a diverse group of pediatric subjects with genetic disorders. To give clinic staff&#xD;
      hands-on experience working with these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children any age with a known or suspected genetic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They may have lab and&#xD;
      other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members may give DNA samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height, weight, and other measurements taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical evaluation of their disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They may have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and saliva samples taken&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging tests. These may include x-rays, scans, ultrasound, or skeletal survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sleep study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A visit with other specialists at NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
      A genetic test from a commercial lab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical photographs taken&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have follow-up visits. They may get medical or surgical treatment.&#xD;

      The aim of this protocol is to allow genetic-related evaluations for patients with a variety&#xD;
      of known or suspected genetic disorders, supplement and offer an additional opportunity for&#xD;
      training in clinical genetics, dysmorphology and metabolic genetics in the National Institute&#xD;
      of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and other Institutes of the National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health (NIH). If not eligible for a specific NICHD research protocol, patients with&#xD;
      genetic-related conditions may be evaluated under the auspices of this protocol to advance&#xD;
      the clinical skills of physicians participating in NICHD clinical research and training&#xD;
      programs, and to provide stimuli for new clinical research initiatives. Standard&#xD;
      medically-indicated laboratory or radiological studies may be performed to confirm a&#xD;
      diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient. In some cases, the subjects may receive&#xD;
      medical or surgical treatment for their disorder at the NIH CC according to current clinical&#xD;
      practice. The overall purpose of genetic evaluations under this protocol is to support our&#xD;
      clinical training and research missions. Family members of subjects evaluated on this&#xD;
      protocol (who have informative meiotic inheritance relationships to the proband or index&#xD;
      case) may also be enrolled.&#xD;
