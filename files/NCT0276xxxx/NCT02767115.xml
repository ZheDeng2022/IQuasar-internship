      The aim of this study was to formulate a mucoadhesive gel of grapes seed extract (GSE)&#xD;
      followed by short-term clinical study for the effectiveness of this gel onto the pocket depth&#xD;
      (PD), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and bleeding on probing (BOP) when applied in&#xD;
      periodontal pockets as an adjunct treatment for chronic periodontitis.&#xD;

      Before commencing with the study, the trial proposal was registered in the research center&#xD;
      and ethical clearance was taken from the ethical committee (FUGRP/2014/182)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials used in the study::&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pure Grape Seed Extract (GSE) supplied by pure bulk supplements (Bulksupplements, USA).&#xD;
           It contains natural ingredient of more than 180 mg of proanthocyanidins for every 200 mg&#xD;
           of serving size of the powder. GSE has been considered safe by the National Center for&#xD;
           Complimentary and Integrative Health if used orally for up to 8 weeks of clinical trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Carbapol &quot;CB 934&quot; (Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sodium- carboxy methly cellulose &quot;Na-CMC&quot; supplied (Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sodium phosphate monobasic and sodium phosphate dibasic (Acros organic Ltd., Mumbai)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Parabens (Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GSE mucoadhesive gel preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Formula 1: 2% GSE mucoadhesive gel based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and&#xD;
      minimum toxic concentration (MTC) and depending on the concentration of adhesive polymers&#xD;
      that were added to the formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weighed CB 934 was dissolved in 50 ml of phosphate buffer of pH 6.6 with a vigorous mixing&#xD;
      until it dissolved completely. Then, GSE and preservatives were dissolved in about 25 ml of&#xD;
      phosphate buffer of pH 6.6. After that, the GSE solution was slowly added into the solution&#xD;
      of CB 934 with a continuous stirring that was achieved by magnetic stirring at a speed of 100&#xD;
      rpm until a homogenous mixture was obtained. The gelling agent (Na-CMC) was added slowly&#xD;
      under a continuous magnetic stirring. Then, the volume was increased up to 100 ml with the&#xD;
      addition of phosphate buffer. Finally, the prepared gel was kept for 24 hours at room&#xD;
      temperature (25°C) for a complete polymer dissolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Formula 2: controlled gel without GSE. A controlled mucoadhesive gel was used in the&#xD;
      clinical study to be compared with GSE gel. This control gel contained all above mentioned&#xD;
      substances except for the GSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial limit test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One gram of the gel was suspended in 2.9 ml of phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. Different sterile&#xD;
      media (Bismuth Sulfite Medium, Mannitol salt agar medium, Muller Hinton agar medium,&#xD;
      cetrimide agar medium and sabaroud agar medium) were inoculated with the gel, then, incubated&#xD;
      for 24 hours. After that, the media were examined to ensure no growth of bacterial genera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random sample of 24 patients were screened and examined. Five patients with mean age 43.5&#xD;
      ±7.9 years were found to comply with the study inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measurements and application of gels A total of 86 Sites of pocket depth (PD) of 5&#xD;
      mm and above were identified. Sites were divided randomly by split mouth technique into two&#xD;
      groups: Test group (GSE group) who will receive GSE mucoadhesive gel (N=48) and Control group&#xD;
      who will receive the control gel (N=38). The two prepared formulas were placed in identical&#xD;
      containers providing that neither the patient, nor the clinician were aware of which was&#xD;
      applied on which quadrant of the mouth &quot;i.e. double blinded study&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first visit, an informed written consent was obtained from all patients. scaling and&#xD;
      root planing (SRP) were performed by the same calibrated examiner using an ultrasonic scaler&#xD;
      (miniPiezon, EMS, Switzerland) and Gracey curettes (Hu-Friedy Mfg, USA). Seven days after,&#xD;
      the patients were recalled for clinical examination and baseline measurement (T0) were taken&#xD;
      for Plaque index (PI), Gingival index (GI), Pocket depth (PD), and bleeding on probing (BOP)&#xD;
      by a single calibrated examiner. PD was measured using a manual probe (UNC 15). PI and GI&#xD;
      were assessed according to Silness and Loe (1964). BOP was assessed within 30 seconds after&#xD;
      probing. In the same visit, the examiner applied the two prepared formulas into two opposite&#xD;
      quadrants using a disposable syringe with a 23-gauge needle. Patients were given oral hygiene&#xD;
      instructions and were instructed not to drink or eat for a minimum of 3 hours, not to brush&#xD;
      the area for 24 hours and not to use mouth wash during the course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were recalled again after 3, 6, and 9 days to reapply the two formulas in the&#xD;
      examined sites by the same examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revaluation The first re-evaluation visit (T1) was after 28 days from the baseline&#xD;
      measurements (T0). During this visit, the calibrated clinician measured and recorded PI, GI,&#xD;
      PD, BOP for all examined sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second re-evaluation visit (T2) was after 6 months from the baseline measurements (T0)&#xD;
      and the same measurements were retaken for all sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v20 package (IBM Corp) was used for&#xD;
      statistical analysis. Significance of the change in PI, GI, and PD within each group were&#xD;
      determined using paired t-test while the significance of difference in the change between the&#xD;
      two groups was determined using the independent t-test. The difference was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
