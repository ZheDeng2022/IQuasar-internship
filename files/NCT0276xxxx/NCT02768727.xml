      The dual objectives of this study are to determine if the phenomenon of neural inertia is&#xD;
      present in humans and to determine whether the order of neurocognitive function is invariant&#xD;
      among anesthetic agents. This study will enroll 24 healthy volunteers, ages 20-40 years, who&#xD;
      will receive xenon gas (concentrations ranging from 0% to 60%) delivered via inhaled route&#xD;
      through the ENHANCER 3000.&#xD;

      This is a multimodal, nonrandomized study of healthy subjects. After meeting enrollment&#xD;
      criteria, subjects will receive a baseline neurocognitive testing on a computer for 15&#xD;
      minutes and will then receive a wrist watch actigraphy device to record their rest/activity&#xD;
      patterns over 8-14 days. On the study day (roughly two weeks later), repeat baseline&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing will be performed after subjects are fitted with a high density EEG&#xD;
      head cap. The actual intervention (delivery of inhaled xenon gas in stepwise increasing&#xD;
      followed by decreasing doses) should occur over 2 hours along with verbal tests to assess the&#xD;
      presence/absence of consciousness at each xenon concentration. Xenon doses have been chosen&#xD;
      specifically to evaluate the point at which individuals lose and then regain consciousness.&#xD;
      Doses are escalated up through those used in human anesthesiology (75%) that permit surgery.&#xD;
      After exposure, serial neurocognitive testing will occur every 30 minutes for 3 hours post&#xD;
      emergence. Subjects are discharged from the study's intervention day to home only upon&#xD;
      reaching standard post-anesthesia care unit criteria (modified Aldrete score â‰¥9). A&#xD;
      post-procedure follow up phone call will occur within 24 hours of anesthetic exposure to&#xD;
      ensure that the subject remains well. The individual's involvement is completed upon&#xD;
      returning the Actigraphy watch 1 week after the exposure day. The expected duration of&#xD;
      subject participation is 3 weeks.&#xD;
