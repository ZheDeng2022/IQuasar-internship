      The aim of the study is to explore short and longer-term effects of the Endobarrier™&#xD;
      implantation on insulin resistance and beta-cell function assessed by repeated Botnia clamps.&#xD;
      In addition changes in gut peptides and gut permeability after implantation of a removable&#xD;
      duodeno-jejunal bypass device to induce diabetes remission in obese subjects with&#xD;
      sub-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus will be determined. Further changes in body&#xD;
      weight and body composition, the change in global cardiovascular risk from baseline to 12&#xD;
      months, estimated using the UKPDS risk engine will be recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and diabetes probably represent the most challenging threat to public health in the&#xD;
      21st century. Obesity has multiple deleterious effects on health, significantly increasing&#xD;
      the risk of fatal and non-fatal diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Bariatric surgery&#xD;
      is a well-established method for the treatment of morbid obesity and has increasingly been&#xD;
      recognized as an effective, long-lasting treatment option for T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a potential, non-invasive alternative to bariatric surgery, a duodenal-jejunal&#xD;
      bypass liner (EndoBarrierTM) has been introduced. It is an endoscopically implantable and&#xD;
      removable device that prevents contact between partially digested nutrients and the proximal&#xD;
      intestine. This device was shown to reduce body weight and to improve glycaemic control in&#xD;
      subjects with diabetes. Small pilot studies suggested a change in incretin levels, similar to&#xD;
      that observed after gastric surgery with an improvement of insulin sensitivity and glucose&#xD;
      metabolism. To better understand and characterize the hormonal and/or metabolic effects after&#xD;
      the implantation and removal of the EndoBarrierTM, this monocentric, prospective, trial is&#xD;
      being performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to clarify the changes in gut peptides and gut&#xD;
      permeability after implantation the EndoBarrierTM in obese subjects with sub-optimally&#xD;
      controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, the investigators aim to determine the&#xD;
      changes in body weight and measure of adiposity, the change in global cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      from baseline to 12 months as well as the changes in insulin sensitivity and beta-cell&#xD;
      function over time.&#xD;
