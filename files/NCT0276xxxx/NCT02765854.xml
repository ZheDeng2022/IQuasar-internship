    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well ixazomib and dexamethasone or ixazomib,&#xD;
      dexamethasone, and lenalidomide work based on the presence of the rearrangement of a gene&#xD;
      called nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 2 (NFKB2) in&#xD;
      treating patients with multiple myeloma that has returned after a period of improvement or&#xD;
      does not respond to treatment. Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking&#xD;
      enzymes called proteasomes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Lenalidomide&#xD;
      may stimulate the immune system against cancer cells and may also prevent the growth of new&#xD;
      blood vessels that tumors need to grow. It is not yet known whether ixazomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone, or ixazomib, dexamethasone, and lenalidomide are more effective in treating&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether the NFKB2 rearrangement can guide the selection of treatment (ixazomib&#xD;
      [ixazomib citrate] plus dexamethasone [Id] or ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone&#xD;
      [IRd]) by conducting the following comparisons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the response rate at 4 cycles between patients treated with Id and patients&#xD;
      treated with IRd and confirm the lack of significant difference in overall response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the response rate at 4 cycles between non-rearranged and rearranged NFKB2&#xD;
      treated with Id and confirm that NFKB2 rearrangement is associated with reduce response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the responses rate at 4 cycles of patients with rearranged NFKB2 treated with&#xD;
      Id or IRd and confirm that adding lenalidomide increases the response rate in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine time to treatment failure (TTF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events (AE) in IRd treated cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify novel transcribed mutations associated with Id and IRd resistance in&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the prevalence of NFKB2 rearrangement in relapsed/refractory MM patients&#xD;
      screened in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the prevalence of NFKB2 rearrangement according to the type of previous&#xD;
      therapies received in all patients screened in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the toxicity profile of the study drugs according to the presence of NFKB2&#xD;
      rearrangement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Delineate transcribed mutations associated with relapse or refractoriness to Id or IRd&#xD;
      treatment by ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A (UNMUTATED NFKB2 REARRANGEMENT): Patients receive ixazomib orally (PO) on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      and 15 and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with mutated NFKB2 rearrangement are randomized in to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B (MUTATED NFKB2 REARRANGEMENT): Patients receive ixazomib and dexamethasone as in arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C (MUTATED NFKB2 REARRANGEMENT): Patients receive ixazomib and dexamethasone as in arm A&#xD;
      and lenalidomide PO daily on days 1-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all arms, cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may proceed to autologous stem cell transplant after 4 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up monthly.&#xD;
