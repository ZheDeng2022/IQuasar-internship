    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine study is intended to replicate and extend the&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety results obtained in earlier Phase 1-2 and Phase 2 studies. The&#xD;
      study is being conducted to demonstrate that the immunogenicity profile of the Quadrivalent&#xD;
      VLP Vaccine meets the US Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) licensure&#xD;
      criteria. The study will also help to define the optimal dose, establish potential&#xD;
      competitive advantages, and support the design of future studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized, observer-blind, multicenter, Phase 2 study will be conducted at multiple&#xD;
      sites across the United States and Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influenza strain composition of the Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine used in this study includes&#xD;
      2 influenza A virus strains (A/California/7/2009 [H1N1] and A/Switzerland/9715293/2013&#xD;
      [H3N2]) and 2 influenza B virus strains (B/Phuket/3073/2013 [Yamagata lineage] and&#xD;
      B/Brisbane/60/2008 [Victoria lineage]), based on the 2015-2016 recommended World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) strains for vaccination in the Northern hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 900 healthy subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 parallel&#xD;
      treatment groups. Subjects in each group will be stratified into 2 age strata: 18 to 49 years&#xD;
      and 50 to 64 years in a 2:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive one intramuscular (IM) injection of their assigned vaccine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 µg/strain of Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 µg/strain of Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 µg/strain of the licensed and commercially available quadrivalent vaccine FluLaval®&#xD;
           Tetra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in this study for approximately 8 months, during which 5 visits&#xD;
      will be scheduled, and phone contact will be made on Day 1, Day 8, and every 2 months&#xD;
      thereafter for up to 6 months post-Day 21 visit (Day 201). Safety laboratory assessments will&#xD;
      be performed at Screening, on Day 3 and within 48 hours of Day 3 results availability, for&#xD;
      grade 3 or grade 4 abnormalities or if deemed necessary by the investigator or early&#xD;
      termination.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Male and female subjects must be 18 to 64 years of age, inclusive, at Screening (Visit&#xD;
             1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects have a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 18.0 and ≤ 32.4 kg/m2 at Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must be in good general health prior to study participation (no more than 30&#xD;
             days prior to study vaccine administration) with no clinically relevant abnormalities&#xD;
             that could jeopardize subject safety or interfere with study assessments as assessed&#xD;
             by the Principal Investigator or sub-Investigator (thereafter referred as&#xD;
             Investigator) and determined by medical history, physical examination, biochemistry,&#xD;
             hematology, and urinalysis. Note: Subjects with a pre-existing chronic disease will be&#xD;
             allowed to participate if the disease is stable and, according to the Investigator's&#xD;
             judgment, the condition is unlikely to confound the results of the study or pose&#xD;
             additional risk to the subject by participating in the study. Stable disease is&#xD;
             generally defined as no new onset or exacerbation of pre-existing chronic disease 6&#xD;
             months prior to immunization. Based on the Investigator's judgment, a subject with&#xD;
             more recent stabilization of a disease could also be eligible.&#xD;

                  bilateral oophorectomy performed more than 1 month prior to immunization); or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post-menopausal (absence of menses for 24 consecutive months and age consistent&#xD;
                  with natural cessation of ovulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participating in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  diseases, significant change in medication dosage within 6 months prior to study&#xD;
                  vaccine administration based upon the investigator's judgment (elective dosage&#xD;
                  adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition or any history of excessive alcohol use or&#xD;
             drug abuse which, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject unable to&#xD;
