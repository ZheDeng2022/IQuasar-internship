      The study aims to evaluate the possible effects of an exercise program, nutritional and&#xD;
      psychological, postural orientation and guidance of oral health on body composition, physical&#xD;
      activity levels and lifestyle, physical fitness and health and motor performance, the factors&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular disease, eating habits, the cognition levels, the psychological&#xD;
      profile, the body posture of children and adolescents with overweight and obesity,&#xD;
      considering the presence of risk genotype associated with the development of obesity. In&#xD;
      addition, identify the effects of orientation for oral health on the quality of life and&#xD;
      healthy oral habits.&#xD;

      The study aims to evaluate the possible effects of an exercise program, nutritional and&#xD;
      psychological, postural orientation and guidance of oral health on body composition, physical&#xD;
      activity levels and lifestyle, health-related physical fitness and motor performance in&#xD;
      factors risk of cardiovascular disease, eating habits, cognition levels, psychological&#xD;
      profile and body posture of adolescents with overweight and obesity. In addition, identify&#xD;
      the effects of orientation for oral health on the quality of life and healthy oral habits. A&#xD;
      quasi-experimental research will consist of a sample of approximately fifty adolescents with&#xD;
      overweight and obesity, ages 10 to 17, of both sexes, selected voluntarily in two schools in&#xD;
      Santa Cruz do Sul. The sessions will last two hours (one hour of physical exercise and the&#xD;
      second time divided into nutritional counseling, postural, psychological and oral&#xD;
      orientation) with a frequency of three times a week. The exercise session will consist of 10&#xD;
      minutes of warm-ups, 40 minutes of aerobic exercise, recreational and sports activities&#xD;
      (moderate to severe) and 10 minutes back to calm, and the intensity of the activities will be&#xD;
      monitored through a frequency (target heart rate: 60 to 70% of maximum heart rate of each&#xD;
      subject). Nutritional, psychological, postural and oral guidance will be given by a&#xD;
      nutritionist, psychologist, physiotherapist/physical education professional and odontologist&#xD;
      respectively, which present lectures and educational games. The following parameters will be&#xD;
      evaluated: anthropometric (BMI, waist circumference and skinfold thickness); hematologic and&#xD;
      biochemical analysis (HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides,&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, adiponectin, leptin, resistin, C reative protein, ALT, AST, glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, cortisol, irisina, F2 isoprostane and uric acid);&#xD;
      polymorphism related to obesity (FTO rs9939609); related-health physical fitness&#xD;
      (flexibility; sit and reach test; abdominal strength and cardiorespiratory fitness); postural&#xD;
      deviations evaluated by the photogrammetry method - SAPO program. The nutritional habits and&#xD;
      lifestyle will be assessed by self-report a validated and adapted questionnaire for Brazilian&#xD;
      children and adolescents as well as a recall and diet calculation for nutrients through&#xD;
      Virtual Nutri 1.0. Oral health will be evaluated according to the criteria of the SB Brazil&#xD;
      Project 2010. The psychological and cognitive assessment will be done through instruments&#xD;
      that determine self-esteem, body awareness, stress and possible mental health problems of&#xD;
      adolescent. The results will be presented by means of statistical tests performed using SPSS&#xD;
      23.0. The comparison of the average values of variables between pre- and post-intervention&#xD;
      will be carried out through the Anova test for repeated measures (generalized linear models),&#xD;
      with subsequent calculation of the effect size; the two-way ANOVA is used to analyze the&#xD;
      differences among the changes in the control group and the experimental group. Expected&#xD;
      results: It is expected that after the completion of this research project, there are&#xD;
      increases in the levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, flexibility and abdominal strength,&#xD;
      changes in postural deviations and dietary habits, increased cognitive function and&#xD;
      psychological aspects and improved hygiene and perception of oral health of adolescents with&#xD;
      overweight and obesity and consequent reduction in rates of overweight and obesity and the&#xD;
      risk factors of cardiovascular disease. The aim is to collaborate with public health policies&#xD;
      in the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity and consequences in schools.&#xD;
