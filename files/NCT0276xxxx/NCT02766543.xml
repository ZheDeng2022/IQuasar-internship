    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-center, single-arm study, planned in 150 patients. The primary objective&#xD;
      of the study is to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of a magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI)-guided transurethral ultrasound therapy system (TULSA-PRO) intended to ablate prostate&#xD;
      tissue of patients with localized, organ-confined prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Profound Medical Inc. has developed a novel technology called the MRI-guided transurethral&#xD;
      ultrasound therapy system (TULSA-PRO). The technology is developed for patients with organ&#xD;
      confined prostate cancer. The therapeutic endpoint of this technology is thermal coagulation&#xD;
      of prostate tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is conducted within a MRI suite, which enables real-time temperature images of&#xD;
      the heated region to be acquired as the ultrasonic treatment is delivered. Using MRI&#xD;
      thermometry during treatment, dynamic temperature feedback control over the intensity of the&#xD;
      ultrasound beams and rotation of the Ultrasound Applicator can shape the pattern of thermal&#xD;
      coagulation accurately and precisely in the prostate gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It provides advantages of a non-invasive procedure with short treatment times.&#xD;
