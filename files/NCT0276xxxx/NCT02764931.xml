  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research aims to investigate the effects of gluten-free oats to the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      health in celiac disease patients and healthy subjects. The effects of gluten-free oats on&#xD;
      the several intestinal parameters, on the composition of the gut microbiota as well as on the&#xD;
      metabolic profile of celiac patients and healthy controls will be studied. The study is&#xD;
      divided into two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will be conducted as a double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled cross-over&#xD;
      study. Healthy subjects will be recruited to the study. The aim is to recruit 15 participants&#xD;
      for the part 1. The study will be conducted with a cross-over setting, where the subjects&#xD;
      will go through exposure meals and SmartPill ingestion three times (two different oat&#xD;
      products and placebo) in a randomized order. The study meals are identical in appearance and&#xD;
      fiber content. After consuming the meal subjects will ingest the SmartPill capsule, which&#xD;
      will send data on intestinal pH, pressure and temperature to the external portable device.&#xD;
      Before and during the passage of capsule the subjects will fill a symptom and food diary. The&#xD;
      capsule will exit the body in 1 to 3 days and the data collected by the external device will&#xD;
      be collected and analyzed. Before the oat/placebo exposure the subjects will give a fecal and&#xD;
      a blood sample. In addition, 36 hours urine samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part 2 celiac disease patients, non-celiac gluten sensitive subjects and healthy controls&#xD;
      will be recruited and they will be divided into four groups: oat-avoiding celiacs (1),&#xD;
      oat-consuming celiacs (2), non-celiac gluten sensitive subjects (3) and healthy controls (4).&#xD;
      Recruiting aim for each group is 15 subjects. In addition to dietary data, a blood, and a&#xD;
      fecal sample will be collected from the subjects. The gut microbiota will be analyzed from&#xD;
      the fecal samples. The metabolic products will be analyzed from the fecal, urine and blood&#xD;
      samples. The gut microbiota composition will be analyzed with next-generation DNA sequencing&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
