  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a monoclonal antibody which has shown its efficacy in Crohn's disease by&#xD;
      inducing and maintaining clinical response/remission. The French marketing authorization was&#xD;
      obtained for Crohn's disease in patients in failure with anti-TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor)&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Crohn's disease patients treated with vedolizumab, a strong association between&#xD;
      vedolizumab serum levels and clinical response to induction and maintenance was demonstrated&#xD;
      by anterior studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It could be of paramount interest to early identify Crohn's Disease patients under&#xD;
      vedolizumab who will be responders to vedolizumab induction and to identify those who will&#xD;
      achieve clinical remission under maintenance therapy with vedolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers decided to assess the clinical response to vedolizumab induction at week 10. For&#xD;
      clinically non-responders at week 10, an additional dose of 300 mg of vedolizumab will be&#xD;
      infused at week 10 and then every four weeks.&#xD;

      Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the heterodimer alpha 4 beta 7&#xD;
      integrin and which has shown its efficacy in Crohn's disease by inducing and maintaining&#xD;
      clinical response/remission. The French marketing authorization was obtained for Crohn's&#xD;
      disease in patients in failure with anti-TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Crohn's disease patients treated with vedolizumab, a strong association between&#xD;
      vedolizumab serum levels and clinical response to induction and maintenance was demonstrated&#xD;
      by anterior studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It could be of paramount interest to early identify Crohn's Disease patients under&#xD;
      vedolizumab who will be responders to vedolizumab induction and to identify those who will&#xD;
      achieve clinical remission under maintenance therapy with vedolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers decided to assess the clinical response to vedolizumab induction at week 10, as&#xD;
      the Gemini III trial has reported, among patients who had experienced previous TNF (Tumor&#xD;
      Necrosis Factor) antagonist failure. 15% of those given vedolizumab were in remission at week&#xD;
      6 (P=0.433) versus 12% under placebo. At week 10, 26% under vedolizumab were in remission&#xD;
      versus 12% in the placebo arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, at week 10, the proportion of patients presenting a clinical response was&#xD;
      significantly higher in Crohn's Disease patients treated with vedolizumab (46% vs 24%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, for clinically non-responders at week 10, an additional dose of 300 mg of&#xD;
      vedolizumab will be infused at week 10 and then every four weeks. In a post hoc analysis of&#xD;
      GEMINI 2, additional dose of vedolizumab in patients clinically non responders to vedolizumab&#xD;
      obtained a clinical remission in 33% of case.&#xD;
