      This prospective randomized study aims to determine the influence of the use of local&#xD;
      hemostatic on the incidence of local complications derived from the edge of transection:&#xD;
      biliary fistula or bleeding, after scheduled hepatic resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Achieving adequate hemostasis is a fundamental prerequisite to successfully perform any&#xD;
      surgical procedure, but particularly in cases of visceral abdominal surgery, where a slight&#xD;
      bleeding, apparently insignificant, can end in significant bleeding (Haas et al Clinic and&#xD;
      Applied thombosis 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control of intraoperative bleeding is initially performed using traditional techniques such&#xD;
      as compression, ligatures, clips, Electrocautery, or clamps. The traditional surgical&#xD;
      techniques often fail to prevent bleeding, despite performing a careful and meticulous&#xD;
      hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The morbidity after elective liver surgery has been reduced in hepatobiliary surgery centers&#xD;
      mainly after standardizing anatomical liver resections. These techniques decrease necrosis,&#xD;
      bleeding, and the incidence of biliary fistulas (Kraus et al J Am Coll Surg 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding and biliary fistula are the main determinants of postoperative liver morbidity, with&#xD;
      an incidence around 4.2-10% and 4-17% respectively (Yamashita et al Ann Surg 2001; Jin et al&#xD;
      World J Gastroenterology 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This complication is difficult to handle especially in patients with cirrhosis or liver&#xD;
      cancer, because of reduced platelet and blood coagulation activity (Figueras et al Ann Surg&#xD;
      2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it is particularly difficult to determine the individual risk of rebleeding or&#xD;
      biliary fistula during the intraoperative time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many adjuvant surgical hemostatic procedures have been tested in the liver: such as oxidized&#xD;
      cellulose, absorbable sponges, fibrillar collagen, and fibrin sealants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an extensive published literature reporting the use of adhesives, Sealants, and&#xD;
      topical hemostatics in surgery. There is little doubt that the hemostatic effects of these&#xD;
      devices produce a beneficial impact on blood loss. However, there is a wide variation in the&#xD;
      literature results. Most of the initial clinical data were obtained in cardiovascular&#xD;
      surgery. The only trial that has provided the most significant data in hemostatic efficacy&#xD;
      was published by Rousou et al in J Thorac Cardiol South 1999. In this randomized multicenter&#xD;
      study, 333 patients that underwent emergency cardiac reoperations were randomized to receive&#xD;
      either conventional treatment with fibrinogen or other hemostatic. The 92% of the patients&#xD;
      assigned to receive fibrin sealant had a complete hemostasis at 5 minutes, compared with the&#xD;
      12% of those treated with other topical hemostatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice is difficult to quantify the efficacy of the topical hemostatics on&#xD;
      hemostasis. The overall effect of perioperative blood loss can only be inferred indirectly by&#xD;
      volume drainage and the number of transfused concentrates (Kraus et al J Am Coll Surg 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume of blood loss during liver surgery depends on many factors: systemic coagulation,&#xD;
      underlying disease, surgery complexity, surgeon experience, central venous pressure, and&#xD;
      local hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, bile leakages are much harder to identify, define, and particularly to quantify,&#xD;
      when compared to bleeding. The biliary system is a low pressure system (less than venous&#xD;
      pressure). Animal studies have shown that the use of collagen adhesives is effective for&#xD;
      preventing biliary fistulas (Wise et al Am Surg 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a cohort study of 32 adult patients, in which a right hepatic lobe Split was held, it was&#xD;
      compared the use of Tachosil ® versus fibrin glue. The transection area was treated with&#xD;
      fibrin glue in 16 patients and with Tachosil ® in the other 16 ones. No differences were&#xD;
      observed regarding the need of postoperative transfusion. Nevertheless, the group of patients&#xD;
      treated with the fibrin patch showed a significantly lower incidence of bile leakage. Those&#xD;
      findings were justified based on the assumption that the use of a fibrin patch, according to&#xD;
      its base rich in fibrin, prevents bile leakage, occluding the biliary radicals at the&#xD;
      transection (Toti et al Dig Liver Dis. 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first clinical trial comparing a hemostatic patch (Tachosil ®) versus the standard&#xD;
      surgical hemostasis with Argon was published by Frilling et al in 2005 (Frilling et al&#xD;
      Langenbecks Arch Surg. 2005). It was observed a reduction in the intraoperative time for&#xD;
      hemostasis and less posterior drain in the Tachosil ® group (N = 121).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2007, Figueras et al (Figueras et al Ann Surg 2007) published the results of a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial comparing the fibrin glue administration (Tissucol ® + collagen sponge) versus&#xD;
      control in 300 patients. The results showed no differences between groups in blood loss,&#xD;
      transfusions, and incidence of biliary fistula, and therefore it was concluded that the&#xD;
      cessation of the use of fibrin sealant would be a justified saving cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical trial recently published by Moench et al (Langenbecks Arch Surg. 2014) they&#xD;
      studied the intraoperative time of hemostasis evaluated at 3 minutes by a non-inferiority&#xD;
      design. The collagen hemostatic agent Sangustop ® proved to be as effective as the fibrinogen&#xD;
      and thrombin sponge Tachosil ® in times of intraoperative hemostasis (n = 128).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different results observed among studies may be due to the diversity of the agents&#xD;
      evaluated, the poor standardization of the application techniques, and especially by the&#xD;
      clinical differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemopatch® is indicated as a hemostatic device in procedures when the surgical control of&#xD;
      bleeding by pressure, ligation, or conventional methods is inefficient or impractical. It&#xD;
      consists in a soft, thin, foldable, and flexible collagen patch derived from bovine skin, and&#xD;
      NHS-PEG coated (pentaerythritol polyethylene glycol ether tetrasuccinimidil glutarate). The&#xD;
      white face, which is applied on the tissue, is covered with a thin layer of NHS-PEG providing&#xD;
      a firm adherence to it, thus sealing the bleeding surface and inducing hemostasis at the same&#xD;
      time. Because of its flexible structure, the application of Hemopatch ® on the site to&#xD;
      achieve hemostasis is easily controlled. The uncoated side is marked with blue squares of a&#xD;
      biocompatible dye, to differentiate it from the coated side.&#xD;
