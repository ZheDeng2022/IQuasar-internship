    <textblock>
      Data from experimental animals and human epidemiological studies have suggested that&#xD;
      hypohydration and/or low water intake is linked to poor glucose regulation and diabetes. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to investigate the effects of cellular dehydration on glucose in healthy&#xD;
      non-diabetic individuals. METHODS: 60 males and females (30-55 y) will will undergo two&#xD;
      experimental trials (ISO and HYP), consisting of a 2-h intravenous infusion of isotonic or&#xD;
      hypertonic saline on two separate occasions, followed by a 4-h oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
      Blood samples were taken from an antecubital vein in 30-min intervals starting at baseline&#xD;
      for assessment of fluid and glucose regulating factors. Thirst will be assessed via visual&#xD;
      analog following each blood sample. Energy substrate oxidation will be calculated via&#xD;
      indirect calorimetry every 60 min.&#xD;

      Introduction The neurohypophysial hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), also known as&#xD;
      antidiuretic hormone, was one of the first hormone identified for its vasopressin properties&#xD;
      in 1895 by Oliver and Schäfer. They showed that extract of pituitary gland increased blood&#xD;
      pressure in anesthetized dogs. AVP is mainly synthesized in the paraventricular and&#xD;
      supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The hormone is transferred to the neural lobe of the&#xD;
      posterior pituitary where it is released to the circulation. Target organs perceive the&#xD;
      hormonal stimuli by three different receptors: V1a, V1b and V2. The receptor V1a is mainly&#xD;
      expressed in the vascular wall and is responsible for vasoconstriction. The receptor V1b is&#xD;
      mainly found in the anterior pituitary, mediating the secretion of the adrenal corticotropin&#xD;
      hormone, while the V2 receptor is mainly expressed in nephron tubules triggering water&#xD;
      reabsorption. Since the discovery of AVP, both the vasopressin and antidiuretic properties&#xD;
      have been very well studied and documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other than the AVP effects on blood pressure and water homeostasis, the hormone is implicated&#xD;
      in a variety of other functions including pain, bone and lipid metabolism, hypertension,&#xD;
      social behavior, aging, cognitive function, cellular proliferation, inflammation, infections,&#xD;
      homeostasis, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and diabetes. All these effects could&#xD;
      provide useful insight into many diseases. Therefore, the focus of this application is on the&#xD;
      effects of AVP on glucose regulation in healthy humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVP is known to enhance hepatic glycogenolysis by activation of V1a receptors and by&#xD;
      increasing the release of glucagon, resulting in increased glucose levels in experimental&#xD;
      animals. Even when glucagon receptors in the liver are blocked, AVP still increases blood&#xD;
      glucose. The V1b receptors have been identified in both alpha and beta cells of the islets of&#xD;
      Langerhans. Thus, AVP stimulates insulin secretion counteracting the increase in blood&#xD;
      glucose. In an experiment with AVP V1a and V1b receptor knockout mice, alterations in glucose&#xD;
      and fat metabolism were observed, suggesting that AVP might play a role in glucose regulation&#xD;
      and metabolic disorders. Studies in humans with a genetic variation of AVP V1a receptor&#xD;
      showed increased prevalence of diabetes in overweight or subjects with high fat diet.&#xD;
      Recently, a study in rats prone to metabolic dysfunction, examined the effect of long-term&#xD;
      influence of vasopressin on glucose homeostasis. It reported that high vasopressin enhanced&#xD;
      hyperinsulemia and glucose intolerance in obese rats, while treatment with vasopressin&#xD;
      receptor V1a antagonist reduced glucose intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a French epidemiological study, a cohort of 3,615 males and females with normal fasting&#xD;
      blood glucose was followed for 9 years. It indicated that water intake was inversely and&#xD;
      independently associated with the risk of developing hyperglycemia. The authors hypothesized&#xD;
      that their results were due to hypohydration related increase in plasma vasopressin. More&#xD;
      recently, a Swedish cohort of 2,064 subjects from the malmo diet and cancer study was&#xD;
      analyzed after 15.8 y with an oral glucose tolerance test. They found that copeptin (a&#xD;
      reliable and clinical surrogate marker of AVP) independently predicted diabetes mellitus and&#xD;
      abdominal adiposity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, hypohydration and low water drinking is linked to chronic elevated AVP. In a&#xD;
      recent study with free-living adults, low habitual water intake led to significantly elevated&#xD;
      AVP compared to adults with high water intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design Sixty subjects between the age of 30 to 55 with absence of insulin&#xD;
      resistance will be recruited in the study. Thirty of the adults will be with normal body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI; 15 males and 15 females, 18.5 kg∙m-2 &lt; BMI ≤25 kg∙m-2) and thirty overweight or&#xD;
      obese adults (15 males and 15 females, 28 kg∙m-2 ≤ BMI ≤35 kg∙m-2) will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Sample size estimation showed that 60 subject will provide power of&#xD;
      0.8 with alpha level set at 0.05. The effect of vasopressin on glucose metabolism will be&#xD;
      studied via osmotic stimulation of vasopressin (AVP) utilizing hypertonic saline infusion&#xD;
      followed by an oral glucose tolerance test. Each subject will perform two identical&#xD;
      experiments, differing only in the sodium chloride (NaCl) content of the infusion (isotonic&#xD;
      vs. hypertonic saline). All female subjects will perform both trials during their early&#xD;
      follicular phase, approximately 2-6 days post menses onset to ensure low endogenous levels of&#xD;
      estrogen and progesterone. After resting in a seated position for 30 min, subjects will be&#xD;
      infused intravenously either 3% NaCl (Hypertonic saline, hence HYPER) or 0.9 % NaCl (Isotonic&#xD;
      saline, hence ISO) over a 120 min period at an infusion rate 0.1 ml/min/kg of body weight in&#xD;
      a single-blind fashion and in counterbalanced order. This hypertonic saline infusion&#xD;
      increases plasma osmolality from 285 to at least 300 mmol/kg. From a separate venous&#xD;
      catheter, blood samples will be taken every 30 min. Following infusion, subjects will rest&#xD;
      for an equilibration period of 30 min before they start a 4-h oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject preparation for oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): Subjects should eat a normal diet&#xD;
      for 3 days prior to the test, and undertake normal physical activity. Dinner will be&#xD;
      standardized the day before and no alcohol will be allowed. Subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
      fast at least 10 h prior to the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for OGTT: The OGTT test will consist of a 75 g of glucose ingestion followed by&#xD;
      blood sampling period, with samples collected every 30 min for 240 min. Urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected at the end of the infusion and at the end of the OGTT. Blood pressure will be&#xD;
      recorded via an automated sphygmomanometer following each blood sample. Oxygen uptake and&#xD;
      respiratory exchange rate will be assessed hourly via indirect calorimetry, for a total of&#xD;
      seven times per trial. During blood sampling, thirst perception and mouth dryness will be&#xD;
      also assessed via visual analog scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples Analysis A total of fourteen blood samples will be collected in each experimental&#xD;
      trial and analyzed for: hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), osmolality (Osm), sodium (Na) and&#xD;
      potassium (K), total plasma protein, glucose, insulin, c-peptide, glucagon, copeptin, plasma&#xD;
      renin activity, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRF), cortisol, triglycerides and free fatty&#xD;
      acids (FFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples will be analyzed for osmolality and urine specific gravity fresh. Backup&#xD;
      samples of serum, plasma, and urine will be stored, frozen at -80°C, in the event additional&#xD;
      analysis are needed, or as replacements for broken vials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Handling &amp; Analysis To ensure quality and integrity of the data collected case report&#xD;
      forms will be utilized. The case report forms (CRF) will be designed to record data collected&#xD;
      in a way that will meet the highest standards. CRF will be developed, tested and approved&#xD;
      prior to any subject enrolment. The scientist involved in the data collection of the study&#xD;
      will be trained on the use of CRF prior to beginning of data collection. A paper and digital&#xD;
      library for all CRFs will be established and maintained during the experiment and at least&#xD;
      for 2 more years after the publication of the manuscripts. The data base manager and the&#xD;
      principal investigator will be the only person that will have access to identifiable subject&#xD;
      information. All the rest of the documents will be coded to ensure subject anonymity. Data&#xD;
      and Safety Monitoring Plan includes: Overall framework for data and safety monitoring,&#xD;
      responsible party for monitoring, and procedures for reporting adverse events/unanticipated&#xD;
      problems. Following data collection, data entry will take place by two authorized scientists.&#xD;
      Data from Quest diagnostics are available in PDF format and data entry will be also performed&#xD;
      and verified by two scientists. Data integration and database cleaning will be performed in&#xD;
      statistical software via analysis and visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary response variable glucose metabolism will be captured by 4 variables (glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, C-Peptide and glucagon) all measured on a ratio scale, and on 14 occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes will be: Hb, Hct, Total Proteins, Osmolality, Na, K, Copeptin, adrenal&#xD;
      corticosteropin releasing hormone (ACTH), CRH, Angiotensin II, plasma renin activity (PRA),&#xD;
      Aldosterone, Triglycerides, FFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional repeated continuous outcomes will be: (1) Blood pressure which will be measured on&#xD;
      14 occasions; (2) Oxygen uptake and respiratory exchange rate which will be assessed on 7&#xD;
      separate occasions; and (3) thirst perception and mouth dryness which will be measured on 14&#xD;
      occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates Measurements Treatment groups (isotonic vs. hypertonic saline) will be the primary&#xD;
      comparison of interest. Other covariates will include sex (Females vs. males) and weight&#xD;
      status (normal weight vs. overweight/obese), age (30-55) and time (1-14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine if the mean response profiles are similar in the groups, i.e. whether patterns of&#xD;
      change over time in the mean response vary by group, the present study will further explore&#xD;
      group by time interaction effects: (e.g. treatment by time interaction; weight by time&#xD;
      interaction; sex by time interaction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For this quasi-experimental with repeated measure-design, the researchers will conduct a&#xD;
           longitudinal analysis to describe changes in the mean response over time, and how these&#xD;
           changes are related to the covariates of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The normality of these continuous variables will be assessed by conducting the&#xD;
           Shapiro-Wilk test of normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For all continuous outcomes, summary statistics (mean and standard deviations) will be&#xD;
           conducted at each time and by sequence. Moreover, correlations between glucose&#xD;
           metabolism measures will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentages will be calculated for covariates that are measured on a nominal scale, and&#xD;
           mean and ± standard deviations presented for those measured on a continuous scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The distributions of insulin sensitivity indexes and areas under the curve will be will&#xD;
           be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Modeling To study how changes in the mean response relate to covariates over&#xD;
      time, Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Modeling -with random intercepts and slopes- will be&#xD;
      employed using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimation. It is assumed that each group's&#xD;
      mean response will change linearly over time. However, if the mean response over time is not&#xD;
      linear, higher-order polynomial trends will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will fit the appropriate covariance pattern model to account for the&#xD;
      correlations among the repeated measures so that appropriate inferences are made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical significance will be determined at an alpha of 0.05. All statistical analyses&#xD;
      would be carried out with the following statical software STATA©, JMP© or SAS©.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Findings and Conclusions During the hypertonic saline infusion trial water&#xD;
      balance will be artificially manipulated (hypertonic hypervolemia). The increase in plasma&#xD;
      osmolality will stimulate vasopressin secretion. It is anticipated that AVP stimulation will&#xD;
      elevate insulin to a greater degree than glucose resulting in higher insulin resistance. It&#xD;
      is also expected that great urine osmolality as a response to elevated vasopressin levels and&#xD;
      lower urinary output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the Project Diabetes along with obesity is one of the leading&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases in the developed and developing countries. More than 29 million&#xD;
      Americans are diabetic and another 86 million are in a pre-diabetic state. The cost of&#xD;
      diabetes in 2012 was $245 billion and it is growing. Hypohydration on the other side, is a&#xD;
      quite common phenomenon linked to many health issues like urinary tract infections, kidney&#xD;
      stones, cardiovascular diseases, mood state and cognitive performance. One of the potential&#xD;
      mechanisms behind the effects of hypohydration is the elevated level of AVP. Recent&#xD;
      epidemiological data and experiments in animals indicate that hypohydration and high&#xD;
      vasopressin are linked to both diabetes and glucose dysregulation. However, no experimental&#xD;
      data from a controlled trial in humans exist. The purpose of the proposed study is to perform&#xD;
      a controlled trial on healthy humans to examine the effect of elevated vasopressin on glucose&#xD;
      regulation.&#xD;
