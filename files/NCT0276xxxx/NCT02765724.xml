  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study of the PK and safety of 400 mg&#xD;
      pacritinib administered orally to patients with stable chronic liver disease and healthy&#xD;
      control subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study participants will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility for the&#xD;
      study. All screening evaluations must be performed within 28 days of pacritinib dosing (Day&#xD;
      1). Assignment of patients to each hepatic impairment group will be defined by Child-Pugh&#xD;
      Clinical Assessment Score at the time of Screening. Group 3 patients will not be dosed until&#xD;
      at least 2 patients combined from Groups 1 and 2 have completed the study (Day 8). Healthy&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled after hepatic impairment accrual is complete to allow for age-,&#xD;
      gender- and body mass index- (BMI) matching with the hepatic impairment population.&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the study site on Day -1 (i.e., Check-in). On Day 1, upon&#xD;
      receipt of all baseline safety evaluation results and confirmation of eligibility, study&#xD;
      participants will be administered a single dose of 400 mg pacritinib orally under fasting&#xD;
      conditions. Fasting will start 10 hours prior to pacritinib administration and continue for&#xD;
      an additional 4 hours after administration. Following administration of pacritinib,&#xD;
      participants will remain confined to the study site for 168 hours (8 days) after pacritinib&#xD;
      dosing for collection of blood for PK and safety assessments.&#xD;
