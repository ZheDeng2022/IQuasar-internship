  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of PET/MRI (Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to give physicians preoperative information about&#xD;
      specific sites in the body that the endometrial cancer may be present. If the PET/MRI is&#xD;
      accurate and successful in providing this information, then women in the future may be able&#xD;
      to have less extensive surgery for their endometrial cancer after evaluation with PET/MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PET/MRI has recently become available at the institution and reports of its sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, NPV (Negative predictive value) , PPV (Positive predictive value), and accuracy&#xD;
      in endometrial cancer are not found in the literature to date, to the best of the&#xD;
      investigator's knowledge. The GE PET/MRI recently obtained here at Mayo, Rochester has the&#xD;
      potential to improve the sensitivity of detection of metastatic disease, compared to other&#xD;
      imaging modalities, because of its superior PET technology and updated Q Clear software. For&#xD;
      these reasons it is reasonable to expect improved sensitivity to detect metastatic disease in&#xD;
      endometrial cancer, possibly proving PET/MRI to be a superior modality for preoperative&#xD;
      screening and potentially allowing for less morbid surgical management for patients with high&#xD;
      risk endometrial cancer.&#xD;
