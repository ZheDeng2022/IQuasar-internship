    <textblock>
      The study was conducted between April 2013 and October 2014. In the parent study, 600&#xD;
      foreign-born Asian American adults 18 years of age and older were drawn from the community in&#xD;
      the Baltimore Washington Metropolitan Area. Using a non-probability sampling method,&#xD;
      foreign-born Asian American adults, 18 years of age and older, were recruited from the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing informed consent, all the participants were asked to complete a&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire in English, Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese with the&#xD;
      assistance of a bilingual interviewer when necessary. Then, all of the participants were&#xD;
      instructed and given 5 to 10 to minutes to read culturally integrated and linguistically&#xD;
      appropriate educational material (e.g., Photo novel) developed and validated for efficacy&#xD;
      from a prior study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants received hepatitis B testing: HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), HBsAb&#xD;
      (hepatitis B surface antibody) and, HBcAb (hepatitis B core antibody). A total of 600&#xD;
      completed the survey and screening. A week later, they received the results of the screening&#xD;
      test. Based on the screening results, all participants were categorized into three groups:&#xD;
      (1) infected (HbsAg+), (2) unprotected (HbsAg-/HbsAb-), or (3) protected (HbsAg-/HbsAb+). We&#xD;
      sent the results by mail to participants who were unprotected and protected. Among those 600&#xD;
      screened participants, 33(5.5%) had chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and 335 (55.8%)&#xD;
      had evidence of resolved HBV infection (protected). A total of 232 (38.7%) were susceptible&#xD;
      to HBV infection (unprotected).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LHW (lay health worker) Intervention for those unprotected: Those unprotected (n=232) were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the intervention (n=124) or the control (n=108) groups by&#xD;
      computer-automated random assignment. Randomization was used to assure equivalence between&#xD;
      groups on key factors that may potentially influence the outcome of HBV vaccinations: gender,&#xD;
      age, education, length of stay in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LHWs conducted phone interventions by reminding participants of a series of vaccinations at&#xD;
      months 1, 2, and 5 among those assigned to the intervention group. Those in the control group&#xD;
      received a list of resources along with their results by mail that offered free vaccinations,&#xD;
      such as local health departments. Seven months after mailing the results, those unprotected&#xD;
      were followed up by phone to ask about their status of the series of vaccinations and about&#xD;
      promoters or barriers to vaccinations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1. Develop a training protocol and certification program for lay health workers&#xD;
      (LHWs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      People of Asian backgrounds are likely to exhibit cultural relativism leaning toward&#xD;
      collectivism compared to individualism. The personal interactions within their&#xD;
      self-identified cultural communities may closely relate to development of their perceived&#xD;
      beliefs and subjective norms, which influence to act upon identified health behaviors (Ajzen,&#xD;
      Albarracin &amp; Hornik 2007). The investigators will develop a lay health worker (LHW) model&#xD;
      that highlights the effects of culturally competent human and educational interactions on&#xD;
      facilitating the Chinese-, Korean- and Vietnamese-American (CKV-A) community's active&#xD;
      behaviors in hepatitis B screening, vaccination, and treatments. To develop an efficacious&#xD;
      and effective LHW intervention that will contribute for creating a critical mass toward&#xD;
      sustainable Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese (CKV) changes, our strategic approaches include as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Review the liver cancer education program guidebook in English, (developed by previous&#xD;
           project R25).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Refine/revise the approaches through work group reviews: Through a series of bi-monthly&#xD;
           meetings with participants from community advisory board (CAB), CKV-A communities,&#xD;
           health practitioners and outreach workers, and experts in hepatitis B virus (HBV) and&#xD;
           liver cancer education (Juon and Lee), and education and evaluation (Park), the&#xD;
           investigators will confirm/specify the approaches of the available materials and develop&#xD;
           additional assessment approaches and forms in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test the validities of subgroup language versions with pilot CKV groups: Through&#xD;
           assessments with each group (n=10) of CKV-As, the investigators will produce the refined&#xD;
           validated LHW protocol (after translation and back-translation). It will include common&#xD;
           and unique approaches across/within subgroup(s) to be congruent with cultural values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Test the pilot LHW implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Establish the LHW model to certify satisfactory practicum experience in Patient&#xD;
           Navigation training module: Through ongoing assessments with the study participants and&#xD;
           participating health care systems, the investigators will monitor the LHW experiential&#xD;
           learning module to provide patient navigation function. The approach will identify&#xD;
           barriers to hinder access to timely screening, follow-up, and treatment upon diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Earp et al. (1997) suggest effective LHWs would have some or all of the&#xD;
      following characteristics and skills: (1) the ability to comfortably and effectively access&#xD;
      the health care system; (2) the ability to balance the demands of lay helping with other life&#xD;
      responsibilities; (3) an interest in AA's health and social issues; (4) maintain close,&#xD;
      supportive, and reciprocal connections with others; and (5) leadership skills. LHW models&#xD;
      depend on genuine natural helpers to function. To increase recruitment potential for CKVs&#xD;
      having desired characteristics: First, the investigators will reach a broad pool of adult&#xD;
      volunteers, regardless of gender, income level, or health care experience, who have these&#xD;
      characteristics and also have the ability to speak, read and write Chinese, Korean, or&#xD;
      Vietnamese languages at or above 2nd grade level. Second, adopting a referral recruitment&#xD;
      strategy in social market theory (Lefebvre et al. 1988) as it may be more effective for&#xD;
      people who may be more responsive to their sense of collective cultural group's interactions,&#xD;
      the investigators will recruit the first 10 LHW candidates per each ethnic group referred by&#xD;
      word of mouth, faith-based organization leaders, community advisory groups, and health and&#xD;
      social service agencies. Finally, the investigators will expand our recruitment continuously&#xD;
      in the community. In Year 1, the investigators plan to train a total of 60 certified LHWs (20&#xD;
      from each ethnic group). The investigators estimate retention of 40 (67%) certified LHWs at&#xD;
      the end of the Year 1, based upon literature reviews (Anderson 2000; Caulfield et al. 1998;&#xD;
      Han et al. 2009). To replace drop-out LHWs in subsequent years, the investigators plan to&#xD;
      recruit and train a total of 30 additional LHWs (10 for each ethnic group) from Years 2 to 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Evaluation: Using evaluation model of Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation&#xD;
      and Maintenance (RE-AIM) (Glasgow et al. 2001), a framework that emphasized on Reach,&#xD;
      Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance, the investigators will examine the&#xD;
      extent to which the LHW program is carried out through processes as intended. At individual&#xD;
      level, the investigators will focus on Reach (R) of the LHW certification program and&#xD;
      hepatitis B free events and on the Efficacy/Effectiveness (E) of the LHW certification&#xD;
      program. For the group level of aggregated individuals, the investigators will assess on&#xD;
      Adoption (A), Implementation (I), and Maintenance (M). The investigators will assess general&#xD;
      administrative processes of LHW program during the study period in the selected perspectives&#xD;
      of fidelity (e.g. logistic reviews, completion rates), dose (e.g. satisfaction survey), and&#xD;
      method on translated forms and tools (Saunders, Evans, &amp; Joshi 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. To assess the prevalence of HBV infection by providing screening test&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 600 Asian American adults (200 Chinese, Koreans, and Vietnamese each), 18 years of&#xD;
      age and older will be drawn from the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment strategy. The investigators have two major channels to recruit participants with&#xD;
      the help of certified LHWs including hepatitis B initiative of Washington DC (HBI-DC)&#xD;
      screening events and Asian American Health Center (AAHC). First, in the past 10 years, the&#xD;
      HBI-DC has screened over 3000 individuals in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and&#xD;
      approximately 8 to 11% are positive for the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBsAg).&#xD;
      Thus, many individuals are availing themselves of the free testing services. LHWs will&#xD;
      announce upcoming screening events in their community by advertising in Korean churches or&#xD;
      Chinese language schools or by word-of-mouth. Our research team and LHWs will attend these&#xD;
      events to recruit potential participants. Based on previous experiences, each screening event&#xD;
      attracted about 100 to 150 Asian Americans. Second, the investigators will go to AAHC&#xD;
      volunteer clinics to recruit participants every Saturday. About 10 to 12 Chinese or Korean&#xD;
      patients visit the clinic. Patients usually come with family members. So, the investigators&#xD;
      estimate to recruit about 15 to 20 participants at the clinics every Saturday. Finally, the&#xD;
      investigators will identify potential participants by advertising in ethnic media and ethnic&#xD;
      groceries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimate: Based on our previous studies (Juon et al. 2008; Hsu et al. 2007), the&#xD;
      investigators estimate that about 10% of all the participants will test hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV) positive, 40 to 50% will be HBV negative but protected, and about 50% will be&#xD;
      unprotected. In the preliminary analysis of R25, there were significant mean differences of&#xD;
      knowledge of HBV transmission (score ranged 0-10) in intervention (7.21±1.83SD) and control&#xD;
      group (5.54±2.07SD) in post-test. The investigators estimated our sample size to be 50 in&#xD;
      each intervention and control group among those unprotected. Assuming a conservative rate of&#xD;
      attrition about 20%, the investigators calculated the study power based on sample size at&#xD;
      follow-up. The sample size of 50 at pre-test is to detect mean difference in knowledge&#xD;
      outcome at 96% power (1-β) and type I error of 0.05.Thus, our proposed sample size (n=50) for&#xD;
      each group among those unprotected has sufficient power. Our total sample size is 600&#xD;
      (50/group x 2 groups x 2 (infected and protected-50% of study population) x 3 ethnic groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3. To implement LHW intervention among those unprotected Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-test/Education program: After obtaining the informed consent for pre-test, screening&#xD;
           test, and blood banking, all the participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
           self-administered questionnaire in English, Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese, with the&#xD;
           assistance of a bilingual interviewer when necessary. Then, LHW will provide a liver&#xD;
           cancer education session to all participants in a small group setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HBV screening test/initial biospecimen banking: All participants will receive hepatitis&#xD;
           B testing. For blood sampling procedure, the investigators will have a part-time&#xD;
           phlebotomist working in the field with a bilingual staff and LHW. The phlebotomist will&#xD;
           draw two tubes of blood from study participants at the study site. He/she will then&#xD;
           transport one tube of the blood in red-top tube to certified clinical labs (i.e., Johns&#xD;
           Hopkins Medical Institute (JHMI), Quest, LabCorp) for hepatitis B tests (e.g., HBsAg,&#xD;
           HBsAb (surface antibody of HBV), HBcAb (core antibody of HBV)). The other tube will be&#xD;
           processed for research sample banking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informing the results of screening test: All the participants will receive the results&#xD;
           one week after their screening. Based on the screening results, all participants will be&#xD;
           categorized into three groups: (1) infected (HbsAg+), (2) unprotected (HbsAg-/HbsAb-),&#xD;
           and (3) protected (HbsAg-/HbsAb+). The investigators will order all screening tests and&#xD;
           review all test results from the certified clinical labs. The investigators will mail&#xD;
           the results to participants who are unprotected and protected. The investigators will&#xD;
           not follow up healthy participants who are protected. The investigators will be&#xD;
           responsible for informing the results by calling those infected individuals. The&#xD;
           participants will provide counseling on what the results mean and treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow up for those infected: Those infected can either be referred through their&#xD;
           primary care physicians to a hepatologist or directly to a hepatologist. If participants&#xD;
           do not have a hepatologist, participants will be referred to hepatologists in the study&#xD;
           team. This will be based on their language preference and geographic location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. LHW Intervention/follow up for those unprotected: Those unprotected will be randomly&#xD;
           assigned to either the intervention or the control groups by computer-automated random&#xD;
           assignment. Randomization will be used to assure equivalence between groups on key&#xD;
           factors that may potentially influence the primary outcome of HBV vaccinations (e.g.,&#xD;
           gender, age, education, length of stay in the U.S.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LHWs will conduct telephone interventions by reminding participants of a series of&#xD;
      vaccinations at Months 1, 2, and 6 among those assigned to the intervention group. Those who&#xD;
      have health insurance will be encouraged to complete vaccinations through their providers. If&#xD;
      participants do not have health insurance, LHWs will provide resources to help those in the&#xD;
      intervention access vaccinations by referring them to the AAHC, or County Health Departments&#xD;
      who provide vaccinations to at risk populations. Those in the control group will receive a&#xD;
      list of resources by mail that offers free vaccinations, such as local health departments&#xD;
      along with their results. Upon completing follow-up, the investigators will provide the&#xD;
      delayed LHW intervention for those who do not have vaccinations in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven months after mailing the results, those unprotected will be followed by phone to ask&#xD;
      about their status of the series of vaccinations and promoters or barriers to vaccinations.&#xD;
      Their self-reported vaccination will be verified with medical records. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to provide information about the date of vaccinations, as well as the location of the&#xD;
      clinic or doctor's office where participants received vaccinations. Participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to sign a medical release form giving project staff permission to request medical&#xD;
      records for their vaccinations. The bilingual interviewers are blinded about participants&#xD;
      being in the intervention or control group at post-test.&#xD;
