      This prospective, two-site, two-arm, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial will&#xD;
      examine the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a polyurethane tenofovir disoproxil fumarate&#xD;
      (TDF) vaginal ring when used continuously for 84 consecutive days by sexually active women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the safety of TDF vaginal rings when used continuously for&#xD;
      84 days by healthy, HIV-uninfected, sexually active women, as compared with a placebo vaginal&#xD;
      ring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a prodrug of TFV, an adenosine nucleoside&#xD;
      monophosphonate (nucleotide) derivative with potent antiretroviral (ARV) activity. TDF is&#xD;
      licensed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in the US, the European Union, Middle East, and&#xD;
      Africa. TDF permeates cells more rapidly than TFV resulting in increased intracellular&#xD;
      accumulation of TFV- diphosphate (TFV-DP), the active metabolite. TDF is more potent than TFV&#xD;
      and inhibits HIV-1 and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection in cell and tissue&#xD;
      culture models at approximately 100-fold lower concentrations than TFV, suggesting that it&#xD;
      may be an excellent candidate for prevention of HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, USA and the&#xD;
      Thick Partners Study Clinic (Partners in Health Research and Development) in Thika, Kenya.&#xD;
      This is the the second clinical study of the polyurethane TDF vaginal ring (TDF IVR-002)&#xD;
      following the successful completion of a first-in-human study (TDF IVR-001). It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the TDF IVR will be safe and well tolerated among healthy, sexually active&#xD;
      women in the US and Kenya. It is also hypothesized that there will be a favorable PK profile&#xD;
      in sexually active women. The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the&#xD;
      safety profile between the active product and the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive an IVR containing TDF or a placebo ring. The vaginal ring will&#xD;
      be worn continuously for 14 days. It will be inserted into the vagina following cessation of&#xD;
      participant's menses, by the study clinician at Visit 3 and removed by the study clinician at&#xD;
      Visit 7. Each participant will be followed for 7 days following ring removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on the results of the first TDF IVR study in sexually abstinent women, a longer&#xD;
      Phase 1 study was designed in order to assess the safety and PK of TDF IVR in sexually active&#xD;
      women. Vaginal rings have been tested in several clinical trials in women 18 years of age and&#xD;
      older and have been found to be safe. Given the drug release kinetics observed in vitro, in&#xD;
      preclinical studies, and in the first Phase 1 study, TDF and TFV (formed following hydrolysis&#xD;
      of the prodrug TDF) concentrations in CVF are expected to reach steady state within one day&#xD;
      and within one month for tissue and maintain steady state concentrations for the duration of&#xD;
      the planned 84 days of ring use. Sampling at multiple time points will provide information on&#xD;
      drug kinetics, and, by sampling after ring removal how long drug persists. The latter may be&#xD;
      important as behavior studies suggest that some women may remove a ring at time of menses or&#xD;
      around sex. Tissue sampling in US women in the hours and days immediately following ring&#xD;
      insertion will provide valuable information about early tissue levels and the time required&#xD;
      to achieve drug concentrations needed for protection. To capture systemic absorption, blood&#xD;
      will be sampled to determine drug concentrations in plasma and DBS. To capture the&#xD;
      concentrations of drug within the genital tract, CVF will be collected from the posterior&#xD;
      fornix using Dacron swabs. Cervical tissue sampling will be highly informative given that it&#xD;
      is the likely site of drug action. However, biopsies must be taken sparingly as they are&#xD;
      uncomfortable to some and alter the healing process. Accordingly, 2 biopsies for PK studies&#xD;
      will be obtained in US women at Days 28 and 56 when the ring is changed, and at Day 84 when&#xD;
      the final ring is removed. US women will also have an additional 2 biopsies collected at only&#xD;
      1 of 7 time-points (5 or 6 women per time-point at either 1 hour, 4 hours, 1, 7, 14, or 21&#xD;
      days after ring insertion, or 5-7 days after ring removal). Participants in Kenya will have 2&#xD;
      cervical biopsies collected at each of 2 study visits (Days 28 and 84). The study will be&#xD;
      single-blinded because the TDF and placebo rings are not identical in appearance. All&#xD;
      participants will be informed that 2 biopsies will be taken during study visits in which&#xD;
      biopsies will be collected. Cervical biopsies will be obtained without local anesthetic.&#xD;
      Participants may take acetaminophen before and/or after the biopsies are collected, if&#xD;
      desired. Participants will be instructed to abstain from sex for 7 days after biopsy&#xD;
      collection to allow adequate time to heal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Assess the safety of TDF IVR when used continuously for 84 days by healthy, HIV-uninfected,&#xD;
      sexually active women, as compared with the placebo IVR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine systemic and genital tract PK of TDF release during and after 84 days of&#xD;
           continuous IVR use in sexually active women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the acceptability of the study IVR in HIV-uninfected, sexually active women&#xD;
           over 84 days of use&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-site, two-arm, randomized single blind placebo-controlled trial. The study&#xD;
      population will include approximately 80 healthy, 18-45 year old females who are&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected, non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding, sexually active and using contraception.&#xD;
      Forty US women and 40 Kenyan women will be stratified by site and will be randomized 3:1 (30&#xD;
      TDF:10 placebo at each site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kenya site will not initiate enrollment until an interim analysis is performed on the&#xD;
      first 20 US women who have completed 30 days of ring use. Enrollment at both sites will&#xD;
      include women using a copper intrauterine device (IUD) or a hormonal contraceptive method&#xD;
      other than an IVR. To ensure participants are protected from pregnancy and sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infections (STI) during study participation, condoms will be distributed at each&#xD;
      study visit. As this is a Phase 1 trial of a TDF IVR, only healthy women with a low risk&#xD;
      profile for HIV will be recruited and will be asked to wear a TDF or placebo IVR for 84 days.&#xD;
      Participants will be strongly encouraged to include their male partner in the study. If&#xD;
      participants are willing, education and counseling will be provided to male partners at all&#xD;
      study visits and up to 20 males at the Thika site will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      qualitative interviews if able and willing to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approximate time to complete study enrollment is expected to be 12 months. Given the need&#xD;
      to carefully screen and exclude women who are not able to comply to study procedures, we&#xD;
      anticipate that the Thika site will not enroll more than 1 participant per week. Two study&#xD;
      groups are planned at each site. All groups will be assigned to complete a total of 9 study&#xD;
      visits (Screening [visit 1], Enrollment [visit 2], Day 14 [visit 3], 28 [visit 4], 42 [visit&#xD;
      5], 56 [visit 6], 70 [visit 7], 84 [visit 8], 89 [visit 9]). Each US participant will be&#xD;
      asked to undergo additional PK sampling at one of the following time-points: either 1 hour&#xD;
      (visit 2a), 4 hours (visit 2b), 1 (visit 2c), 7 (visit 2d), 14 (visit 3a), or 21 days (visit&#xD;
      3b) after ring insertion, or 5-7 (visit 9a) and 10-12 days (visit 10) after ring removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two study groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reservoir-type polyurethane TDF IVR group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reservoir-type polyurethane Placebo IVR group;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration for participants is approximately 120 days (including a screening&#xD;
      visit, an enrollment visit, 84 days of continuous IVR use, and 5-7 days following IVR&#xD;
      removal). Participants will undergo Visit 2 within 28 days of screening. No study data will&#xD;
      be collected after the Final Study/Early Termination Visit unless the participant is pregnant&#xD;
      at the Final Study/Early Termination Visit. Participants who have AEs at the Final&#xD;
      Study/Early Termination Visit that have not resolved or stabilized will be followed beyond&#xD;
      the Final Study/Early Termination Visit until a clinically acceptable resolution of the AE(s)&#xD;
      is confirmed and documented. Clinical acceptability of resolution will be determined by the&#xD;
      Project Leader (PL) in consultation with the Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT). Participants&#xD;
      identified as infected with HIV during the study will be managed in accordance with the study&#xD;
      protocol. Participants who are pregnant at the Final Study/Early Termination Visit may be&#xD;
      followed in accordance with procedures described in the study protocol.&#xD;
