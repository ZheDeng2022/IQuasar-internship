      This phase II, single-arm, multicenter study will evaluate pembrolizumab therapy in patients&#xD;

      This phase II, single-arm, multicenter study will evaluate pembrolizumab therapy 200 mg IV&#xD;
      given every 3 weeks (Q3W), following a single priming dose of cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 IV&#xD;
      in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have received at least one&#xD;
      prior line of therapy. The primary objective is to estimate progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      for cyclophosphamide + pembrolizumab in advanced TNBC patients compared to pembrolizumab&#xD;
      alone (historical PFS = 1.9 months).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;
             information. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or&#xD;
             obtained separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 (see section 6.7 for details).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1 as defined in Appendix A ECOG Performance Status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject must have histologically confirmed stage IV TNBC (ER-, PR-, HER2-negative) and&#xD;
             have received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ER- and PR-negative: defined as &lt; 1% staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HER2-negative disease, defined as IHC 0-1+ or fluorescence in situ hybridization&#xD;
                  (FISH) ratio &lt; 2.0&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with stable brain metastases will be allowed provided the following criteria&#xD;
             are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Brain radiation was already provided at least 4 weeks prior to initiating study&#xD;
                  treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The subject has no new or progressive neurologic symptoms AND neurological&#xD;
                  symptom stability for the last 4 weeks prior to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The subject has been off of corticosteroids for at least 7 days prior to trial&#xD;
                  treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The subject does not have carcinomatous meningitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the table below; all screening labs&#xD;
             to be obtained within 72 h of initiating study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72&#xD;
             hrs prior to treatment. NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential unless&#xD;

             or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months without an&#xD;
             alternative medical cause. In women &lt; 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating&#xD;
             hormone level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal&#xD;
             state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In&#xD;
             the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Consent for the use of any residual material from biopsy (archival tissue) and serial&#xD;
             blood draws will be required for enrollment; fresh biopsy (pre and post dose) of tumor&#xD;
             tissue will be optional. NOTE: Patients without adequate tissue for bio correlates&#xD;
             will not be excluded or required to have a repeat biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, the subject should be&#xD;
             able to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to receipt of study medication or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤&#xD;
             Grade 1 or at baseline; excludes alopecia and Grade 2 neuropathy) from adverse events&#xD;

             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;

             after cyclophosphamide dosing. Patients must not have received any drug that is a&#xD;
