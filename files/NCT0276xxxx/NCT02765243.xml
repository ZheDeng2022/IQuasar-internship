      Patients with refractory and/or recurrent neuroblastoma have poor prognosis despite complex&#xD;
      multimodel therapy and therefore, novel approaches are urgently needed. The investigators are&#xD;
      attempt to treat this disease using T cells genetically modified with a 4th generation&#xD;
      lentiviral chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting GD2 (4SCAR-GD2). The 4SCAR-GD2-modified&#xD;
      T cells can recognize and kill neuroblastoma through the recognition of GD2, a surface&#xD;
      protein expressed at high levels on neuroblastoma but not on normal tissues. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the side effects and effective doses of 4SCAR-GD2 T cells in treating refractory&#xD;
      and/or recurrent neuroblastoma.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with refractory and/or recurrent neuroblastoma have poor prognosis despite complex&#xD;
      multimodal therapy; therefore, novel curative approaches are needed. The investigators are&#xD;
      attempting to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically&#xD;
      modified to express a 4th generation GD2-specific chimeric antigen receptor (4SCAR-GD2). The&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) molecules enable the T cells to recognize and kill&#xD;
      neuroblastoma through the recognition of a surface antigen, GD2, which is expressed at high&#xD;
      levels in neuroblastoma but not at significant levels on normal tissues. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the side effects and the best dose of a novel 4th generation anti-GD2 CAR T cells to&#xD;
      refractory and/or recurrent neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Primary: To determine the safety and feasibility of administration of 4SCAR-GD2 T cells to&#xD;
      children with neuroblastoma following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine preparative regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if the administration of 4SCAR-GD2 T cells can establish an antitumor&#xD;
           effects in children with neuroblastoma who receive preparative regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the toxicity of administration of anti-GD2 CAR T cells in children with or&#xD;
           without high-burden disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the incidence and the treatment effect of cytokine release syndrome (CRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the expansion and functional persistence of 4SCAR-GD2 T cells in the&#xD;
           peripheral blood of patients and the correlation with antitumor effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 1-14 years of age, at least 10 kg, with neuroblastoma that has recurred after or not&#xD;
      responded to standard therapy and is deemed incurable by standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened through physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies or bone marrow aspirates may be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained by apheresis, and T cells&#xD;
           will be activated and modified to express the 4SCAR-GD2 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day -7, PBMC will be activated and enriched for T cells, which will be followed by&#xD;
           4SCAR-GD2 lentiviral transduction. The total culture time is approximately 5-10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a preparative conditioning regimen comprising&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide/fludarabine to prepare their immune system to accept the modified CAR T&#xD;
           cells. The preparative regimen is consisted of fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) on days -4, -3 and&#xD;
           -2 and cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m(2) on day-4, -3 and -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive an infusion of the modified 4SCAR-GD2 T cells and closely&#xD;
           followed up for treatment related responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have frequent follow-up visits to monitor the outcome of the&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
