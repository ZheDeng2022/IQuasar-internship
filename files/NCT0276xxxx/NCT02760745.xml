      Febrile shivering in the pediatric population is assumed to be related to a Severe Bacterial&#xD;
      Infection (SBI). Research supporting this assumption is scant. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to describe the frequency of febrile shivering in the pediatric population arriving at the&#xD;
      emergency department and to define its role in predicting a SBI.&#xD;

      Background: Fever is a common complaint and lacking localizing signs poses a diagnostic&#xD;
      dilemma, mostly, but not only, in children under 3 years of age. Recent years studies found&#xD;
      common clinical markers for a Serious Bacterial Infection (SBI) to be ineffective in&#xD;
      confirming or ruling out a suspected SBI in an environment with low prevalence of SBI such as&#xD;
      developed countries. Shivering (chills, rigors) during a febrile illness is a common&#xD;
      complaint in children but it's true incidence is unknown. It is assumed that shivering&#xD;
      appears more frequently in children with SBI but only one study in the pediatric population&#xD;
      was found to support this assumption. No studies were found to describe the frequency of&#xD;
      shivering in the emergency department. Study purpose: To describe the frequency of febrile&#xD;
      shivering in the pediatric population arriving at the emergency department and it's relation&#xD;
      to a Severe Bacterial Infection. Participants: Children in the age range of 3 months to 18&#xD;
      years presenting with fever. Intervention: During the study time frame the frequency of&#xD;
      febrile shivering will be documented . Patients with febrile shivering who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, a sepsis workup will be done including blood samples for inflammatory markers,&#xD;
      blood culture, urinalysis and urine culture when a urinary tact infection is suspected. Other&#xD;
      systems (CSF sampling, joint fluid aspiration, stool culture, chest x ray) will be examined&#xD;
      according to an appropriate history and clinical suspicion. The same work up will be done in&#xD;
      next consecutive patient presenting with fever without shivering. Results: The frequency of&#xD;
      febrile shivering, positive cultures, lobar pneumonia in a chest x ray. A comparison between&#xD;
      the study and the control group will be made. Categorical variables will be compared using&#xD;
      the Chi square test or Fisher exact test (as appropriate). Continuous variables will be&#xD;
      compared using the student t test or Mann Whitney test. The relation between a bacterial&#xD;
      infection and clinical variables will be analyzed using a logistic regression. Study group&#xD;
      size: This is a pilot study. Investigators will use a convenience sample of all children&#xD;
      admitted with shivering during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: All examinations will be held by the emergency department organic staff in the same&#xD;
      routine methods done otherwise outside the study settings. The emergency department and&#xD;
      hospital protocols for patients identification and infection control will be carried out&#xD;
      before invasive procedures. Ethics: Parents will be asked for their agreement to answer a&#xD;
      questioner as part of the study and their agreement will be documented. Informed consent will&#xD;
      be asked for each patient, of the legal guardian. The study will be held according to the&#xD;
      ethics rules of the Helsinki declaration and was approved by the local Ethics board. Access&#xD;
      to the database will be restricted to the study investigators. The database will be encrypted&#xD;
      by a password. After gathering the data and before statistical analysis information&#xD;
      identifying the patients will be removed. The importance of the study: Fever in children is a&#xD;
      common complaint frequently posing a dilemma on the extent of workup needed beyond clinical&#xD;
      evaluation. This study aims to examine the frequency of shivering among children presenting&#xD;
      to the ED with fever , its ability to predict the risk of severe bacterial infection.&#xD;
