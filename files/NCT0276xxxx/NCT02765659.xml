      This implementation study is testing whether community members can use a 3-step model&#xD;
      (prepare, roll-out and sustain) to implement an efficacious peer group HIV prevention&#xD;
      intervention with fidelity and effectiveness in a single district in Southern Malawi. A&#xD;
      collaborative partnership including university researchers and district government, health&#xD;
      system and traditional leaders will support community volunteers in implementation. Both the&#xD;
      implementation process and the effectiveness of the intervention when implemented by&#xD;
      communities will be evaluated.&#xD;

      In response to the National Institutes of Health's call for empirically-supported models to&#xD;
      implement research-tested health behavior change interventions, the investigators are testing&#xD;
      a 3-step (prepare, roll-out, and sustain) Community Implementation Model (Model) in&#xD;
      low-resource African communities. The Model is adapted from a theory-based model that was&#xD;
      effective in implementing a hospital-based intervention in South Africa. Its participatory&#xD;
      approach, clear steps, observable benchmarks and multimedia Toolkit will facilitate community&#xD;
      ownership and build capacity to use the Model with fidelity. The investigators test whether&#xD;
      community members can use the Model to effectively implement a peer group HIV prevention&#xD;
      intervention called Mzake ndi Mzake (Friend to Friend) with fidelity and effectiveness.&#xD;
      Developed and tested among several populations in Malawi (R01-NR08058), This intervention was&#xD;
      efficacious in rural, central Malawi. Intervention communities had significantly better&#xD;
      outcomes, including higher condom use and HIV testing for both adults and adolescents, than&#xD;
      control communities. The investigators evaluate the Model's implementation success in&#xD;
      Phalombe District, in southern Malawi, where the HIV prevalence of 14.5% is twice that of&#xD;
      other regions. Our implementation partnership builds on the strengths and contributions of&#xD;
      four sectors. Traditional community leaders mobilize their communities' assets, including&#xD;
      volunteers to implement the peer group intervention. The District health system has formal&#xD;
      authority in health organizations, contributes health knowledge, and provides local District&#xD;
      health data. The District political administration supports this effort by negotiating&#xD;
      donated space for an HIV/AIDS Resource Centre and by pledging funds to sustain and expand&#xD;
      implementation of the intervention if communities demonstrate that they can use the Model.&#xD;
      Researchers from both US and Malawi universities contribute the Model and the Mzake ndi Mzake&#xD;
      peer group intervention, provide supportive technical assistance for program implementation&#xD;
      and conduct evaluations. Specific aims and their evaluation are: Aim 1) Prepare and support 3&#xD;
      communities in using the Model to implement Mzake, evaluated with community self-rated&#xD;
      benchmarks. Aim 2) Identify implementation patterns across sites and over time, evaluated&#xD;
      using mixed-methods to integrate benchmarks with observations, focus groups, and interview.&#xD;
      Aim 3) Assess communities' effectiveness in using the Model to implement Mzake, evaluated&#xD;
      with a stepped wedge design (N = 864). Analysis uses multi-level hierarchical models to&#xD;
      detect improvements over time in HIV-related behavioral outcomes and a symptoms interview&#xD;
      with a nurse for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in participants who have received the&#xD;
      intervention compared to the delayed-intervention control group. (Our original plan to use&#xD;
      rapid STI tests appropriate for community use had to be modified because of new data&#xD;
      indicating unacceptable reliability and withdrawal of one test from the market). Aim 4)&#xD;
      Evaluate whether the Model is feasible, acceptable, effective and sustainable when used by&#xD;
      communities to implement Mzake, examined by integrating data from Aims 1-3. If successful,&#xD;
      this study will advance implementation science by providing a replicable evidence-based model&#xD;
      for implementation of HIV prevention interventions and other health interventions by&#xD;
      low-resource communities.&#xD;
