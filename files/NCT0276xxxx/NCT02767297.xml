      This is a three-part study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study is a single dose, open-label, randomized crossover study in healthy male&#xD;
      and female subjects to compare the relative bioavailability of two formulations of FDL169.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study is a multiple, escalating dose study of three different doses of the test&#xD;
      formulation of FDL169 in healthy male and female subjects to evaluate the PK profile of the&#xD;
      test formulation of FDL169.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 of the study is a single dose, open-label study in male and female subjects with CF to&#xD;
      determine the PK profile of the test formulation of FDL169.&#xD;
