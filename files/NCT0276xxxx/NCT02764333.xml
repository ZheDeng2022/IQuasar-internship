  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 clinical trial, which tests two investigational drugs: TPIV200/huFR-1 (also&#xD;
      called TPIV200), which is a vaccine consisting of proteins from the folate receptor alpha&#xD;
      mixed with GM-CSF, and durvalumab (MEDI4736) , which is an antibody drug that help un-block&#xD;
      parts of the immune system. The aim of this study is to find out whether these drugs, when&#xD;
      given together are safe, and whether they are effective in treating cancer.&#xD;
