  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this project is to to quantify the physiology of neonatal drug&#xD;
      withdrawal and develop non-pharmacological techniques to help improve the therapeutic&#xD;
      management of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel approaches to diagnosing and treating Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) are needed for&#xD;
      reducing prolonged pharmacological management, minimizing hospitalization and improving&#xD;
      developmental outcomes in drug exposed newborns. This study seeks to examine the physiology&#xD;
      and symptoms of drug withdrawal (e.g., irritability marked by movement activity;&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory instabilities) in infants exposed to drugs in utero and test whether&#xD;
      sensory stimuli (tactile, auditory) reduce dysregulated systems in the withdrawing infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates at-risk for NAS due to fetal drug exposure will be identified to investigators by&#xD;
      the infant's primary medical caregiver. Investigators will use a modified-consecutive&#xD;
      sampling technique, restricted by equipment and personnel availability, for enrolling&#xD;
      infants. Participants will be studied throughout their hospitalization. Effects of&#xD;
      stimulation will be examined at different stages of withdrawal. Efficacy of stimulation will&#xD;
      be examined as a potential complementary treatment of NAS.&#xD;

    <description>Prospective, within-subject design. Compare effects of mattress SVS (ON) and Control (SVS OFF) on physiology in opioid-exposed newborns. SVS is alternated in intervals between continuous stimulation (ON) and no stimulation (OFF/Control) throughout inter-feed intervals. The order of the ON-OFF cycles is randomized across subjects and counterbalanced between feeding periods within subjects.</description>
