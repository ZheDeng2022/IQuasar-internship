  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of data analyzing the influence of Cardio-vascular Diseases (CVD) risk factor&#xD;
      control on graft survival disparities in Black transplant recipients. Studies in the general&#xD;
      population indicate that CVD risk factor control is poor in Black patients, leading to higher&#xD;
      rates of renal failure and CV events. However, with the exception of hypertension, there is&#xD;
      paucity in data demonstrating similar results within transplant recipients. Recent analyses&#xD;
      conducted within our transplant program, indicate that CVD risk factors, especially diabetes,&#xD;
      are poorly controlled in Black recipients, which likely impacts graft loss. Since these data&#xD;
      were collected in a retrospective manner, larger analyses are needed to validate these&#xD;
      exploratory findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if the study is feasible, as measured by the proportions of enrolled to&#xD;
           approached and completed to enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure and compare, at baseline versus the end of the intervention, the medication&#xD;
           safety events, including the number of medication errors, medication non-adherence and&#xD;
           medication side effects, in patients enrolled in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure and compare, at baseline versus the end of the intervention, CVD risk factor&#xD;
           control, including hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, in patients enrolled in the&#xD;
           study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measure and compare, at baseline versus the end of the intervention, patient reported&#xD;
           survey results, in patients enrolled in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine if the impact of the intervention is more pronounced in Black recipients, as&#xD;
           compared to non-Black recipients&#xD;
