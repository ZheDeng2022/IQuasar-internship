      Children without consistent access to sufficient and nutritious food show sustained&#xD;
      disadvantages. To improve food security, households utilize three types of coping strategies-&#xD;
      participating in governmental feeding and financial assistance programs; obtaining food from&#xD;
      nongovernment providers; and using individually developed strategies. To understand the&#xD;
      interdependencies among strategies and decision-making processes used to select them, the&#xD;
      investigators conducted a two-phased, mixed-methods study using a socio-ecological&#xD;
      theoretical framework. First, employing a cross sectional, observational design the&#xD;
      investigators administered in-person surveys to 320 adults in very low food secure (VLFS)&#xD;
      households with children. Over 1 year later, the investigators repeated select questions and&#xD;
      conducted in depth interviews with a cohort (n=28) of participants. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      defined magnitude of associations among strategies. Following bivariate analysis, the&#xD;
      investigators assessed interdependencies and factors affecting relationships with log-linear&#xD;
      models. The investigators analyzed interviews using an hierarchically ordered, analytical&#xD;
      coding structure. With Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), the investigators developed&#xD;
      typologies of VLFS and created models treating food security as an outcome. The association&#xD;
      of soup kitchen use and nutritionally risky behavior was altered by Supplemental Security&#xD;
      Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). Food safety-related risky&#xD;
      behavior level related to intensity of food pantry use by participation in school food&#xD;
      programs. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) did not affect the association&#xD;
      between soup kitchen use and risky food safety behaviors. Key interview constructs included&#xD;
      becoming and being short of food; coping strategies; decisions used to inform choice of&#xD;
      strategies; and managing a devalued social status. Improved income stability was a necessary&#xD;
      condition for improving food security.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food insecurity is a serious issue facing households in the United States. In 2012, the time&#xD;
      this study was begun, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that almost 15% of U.S.&#xD;
      households and one in five households with children were considered to be food insecure. Over&#xD;
      one third of these experienced very low food security (VLFS), with multiple indicators of&#xD;
      disrupted eating patterns due to inadequate resources. These statistics are of particular&#xD;
      concern because children without consistent access to sufficient and nutritious food show&#xD;
      sustained disadvantages, including effects on cognition, academic performance, long-term&#xD;
      nutritional status, and psychosocial development. To improve their food security, households&#xD;
      utilize three types of coping strategies- (1) participating in federal feeding and financial&#xD;
      assistance programs (&quot;safety net&quot;), (2) obtaining food from nongovernment Emergency Food&#xD;
      Providers (EFPs), and (3) using individually developed coping strategies. The objectives of&#xD;
      this study related to developing a better understanding of the coping strategies that VLFS&#xD;
      households with children use to ensure that their households have sufficient food.&#xD;
      Specifically, the study addressed two main research questions: What are the interdependencies&#xD;
      among three types of coping strategies: participating in federal feeding and financial&#xD;
      assistance programs (&quot;safety net&quot;), obtaining food from EFPs, and using individually&#xD;
      developed coping strategies. What decision-making processes do people in VLFS households with&#xD;
      children use when selecting coping strategies to ensure that their households have sufficient&#xD;
      food? The investigators conducted a two-phased mixed-methods study of coping strategies used&#xD;
      by VLFS households with children &lt;18 years in North Carolina (NC), using a socio-ecological&#xD;
      theoretical framework to guide their hypotheses, methods, and analyses. For phase I, the&#xD;
      investigators employed a cross sectional, observational design. The investigators used a&#xD;
      two-stage sample to recruit 320 clients of service providers who offer assistance to people&#xD;
      with limited resources within eight NC counties with the highest food insecurity rates.&#xD;
      Trained interviewers administered in-person a survey interview asking clients&#xD;
      socio-demographic questions and about their use of three categories of coping strategies.&#xD;
      Using a longitudinal design, more than a year after Phase I, in Phase II, the investigators&#xD;
      completed in depth interviews with a cohort (n=28) of Phase I participants, selected using&#xD;
      maximum variation sampling. During the largely unscripted interviews, participants were asked&#xD;
      a select number of close ended questions from Phase I, including the 18 item food security&#xD;
      module, to assess changes over the past year and permit comparisons between times one and&#xD;
      two. To address the first question, two by two and multi-dimensional contingency tables were&#xD;
      constructed to analyze the interdependencies among the three types of coping strategy&#xD;
      outcomes. Descriptive statistics (odds ratios, counts and percentages) were performed to&#xD;
      define the magnitude of the association among coping strategies. Fisher's exact tests and&#xD;
      Chi-square statistics were then employed to assess the statistical significance of the&#xD;
      interdependency among the outcomes. To further determine the interdependencies among the&#xD;
      three coping strategies, and to assess how individual and household-level factors affect&#xD;
      those interdependencies, the investigators employed log-linear models. To address the second&#xD;
      research question, the investigators formulated a hierarchically ordered, analytical coding&#xD;
      structure that reflected key decision-making constructs (e.g., knowledge of coping&#xD;
      strategies, perception of risk of accessibility and availability of coping strategies,&#xD;
      barriers to participation in &quot;safety net&quot; programs) and examined the results in terms of the&#xD;
      key constructs. Lastly, responses to both sets of questions were jointly reviewed using&#xD;
      Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), a mixed-methods analysis technique. The investigators&#xD;
      implemented a conventional, crisp set for (1) developing typologies of households and&#xD;
      individuals experiencing very low food insecurity, and (2) exploring pathways to improving&#xD;
      food security status among participants in the follow-up interviews. All procedures involving&#xD;
      human participants was reviewed and approved by RTI International's Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board (IRB).&#xD;
