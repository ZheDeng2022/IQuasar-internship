  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: EP0057 consists of a sugar molecule cyclodextrin linked to a chemotherapy drug&#xD;
      called camptothecin. The combined molecule or &quot;nanoparticle drug conjugate&quot; travels through&#xD;
      the blood. Once inside cancer cells, the chemotherapy drug is released from the molecule.&#xD;
      Olaparib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from repairing the DNA damage caused by&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Researchers want to see how safe it is to give EP0057 and olaparib together and&#xD;
      to see how well the combination treats a specific type of lung cancer called small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (SCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety and maximum dose of EP0057 and olaparib together. To test how well they&#xD;
      treat small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older with small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with standard cancer care tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the 2 study drugs in 28-day cycles. EP0057 will be given every 2 weeks,&#xD;
      through a small plastic tube in an arm vein. Olaparib will be taken by mouth twice a day most&#xD;
      days. Participants will keep a pill diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cycle 1, participants will have 3 visits. All other cycles will have 2 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study visits, participants may have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and hair samples taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about health and side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional tumor biopsy where a piece of tumor is removed by needle after numbing the&#xD;
           skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injection of EP0057 (twice per cycle)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Olaparib prescription &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 4 weeks after finish taking the drugs. They will&#xD;
      have a physical exam and blood tests. They may have a tumor biopsy. The study team will call&#xD;
      the patient every 3 months for follow up after completing the study treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although highly responsive to chemotherapy initially, SCLC relapses quickly and becomes&#xD;
      refractory to treatment within a few months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urothelial Carcinoma (UC) of the Bladder is the fourth most common malignancy in men and the&#xD;
      ninth most common in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States. While prostate&#xD;
      cancer is initially responsive to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the median duration of&#xD;
      sensitivity is 24-36 months. Moreover, patients develop resistance to current treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of PARP inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy builds upon pre-clinical data in&#xD;
      lung cancer and other cancers supporting the notion that PARP inhibitors potentiate the&#xD;
      effect of DNA damaging therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite their highly synergistic activity in preclinical models, human studies combining PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors and camptothecins have not translated into clinical benefit due to enhanced&#xD;
      toxicity with the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach to improve ability to combine camptothecins with agents that sensitize their&#xD;
      activity like PARP inhibitors is to use alternative formulations that minimize toxicity to&#xD;
      the normal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EP0057 is a nanoparticle drug conjugate composed of 20 (S)-camptothecin (a potent and highly&#xD;
      selective topoisomerase I inhibitor) conjugated to a linear, cyclodextrin-polyethylene&#xD;
      glycol-based polymer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor indicated as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or&#xD;
      suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated&#xD;
      with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Olaparib has an established safety profile&#xD;
      and it is under investigation in a number of different cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: To determine the MTD/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of EP0057 in combination with&#xD;
      olaparib in patients with refractory cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: To determine the antitumor activity of olaparib plus EP0057 with respect to&#xD;
      progression free survival at 16 weeks in SCLC patients with resistant or sensitive relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Cohorts: To determine overall response rate of EP0057 plus olaparib in patients&#xD;
      with mCRPC and urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male or female adult patients &gt;=18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically or cytologically confirmed, advanced solid tumor that is refractory to&#xD;
      standard therapy and/or for whom no further standard therapy is available&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male or female patients (Bullet) 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a pathologically (histology or cytology) confirmed diagnosis of SCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease progression on or after at least one platinum-based standard chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
      and/or an immune-checkpoint inhibitor for either limited or extensive stage disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Expansion Cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a pathologically (histology or cytology) confirmed diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma or&#xD;
      metastatic, progressive, castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease progression on or after at least one platinum-based standard chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
      and/or an immune-checkpoint inhibitor (except prostate cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 (except prostate cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior treatment with enzalutamide and/or abiraterone (prostate cancer cohort only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl [1.74 nmol/l]) (Prostate cohort&#xD;
      only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting eligibility criteria will receive EP0057 (IV Q 2weeks) plus olaparib (PO BID&#xD;
      days 3-13 and days 17-26 administered in 28-day cycles, until disease progression or&#xD;
      development of intolerable side effects. The MTD of the combination will be used in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Phase II will receive, the RP2D at DL4R EP0057 12 mg/m^2 and olaparib 250 mg BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, tumor and hair samples will be collected at multiple time points for PK, PD analyses.&#xD;
      Hair sample collection is optional. Tumor biopsies are optional for SCLC and UC patients and&#xD;
      mandatory for mCRPC patients (only baseline biopsy is mandatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments will be made using CT scans (chest, abdomen and pelvis) at baseline and&#xD;
      after every 2 cycles (3 cycles for mCRPC) according to RECIST version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discontinuation of study treatment, follow-up for survival will be carried out every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum number of patients on the phase I portion of the trial is 30, the SCLC cohort in&#xD;
      phase II may accrue up to 27 evaluable patients, urothelial carcinoma expansion cohort may&#xD;
      accrue up to 34 patients and mCRPC may accrue up to 25 patients. Thus, the maximum number of&#xD;
      evaluable patients who may enroll on this trial is 116. In order to allow for a small number&#xD;
      of in-evaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set at 123.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that approximately 1 to 2 patients per month may enroll onto this trial;&#xD;
      the trial is expected to complete accrual in 6-8 years.&#xD;
