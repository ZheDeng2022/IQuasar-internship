  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is unknown whether beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in Gestational Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus (GDM) is representative of a chronic maternal defect, unmasked by pregnancy, or&#xD;
      whether it is the result of an imbalance of a placental hormones. Undiscovered placental&#xD;
      factors which vary between pregnancies likely contribute to the pathogenesis of GDM. To&#xD;
      elucidate the pathophysiology underlying GDM, the investigators will attempt to discover&#xD;
      these factors and characterize pregnancy-associated changes in insulin secretion and&#xD;
      sensitivity in women with and without GDM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) complicates 3-7% of pregnancies in the United States and&#xD;
      is associated with perinatal morbidity and a high risk of future maternal type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Current prevention and treatment of GDM relies on techniques developed in the type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      population, without regard to unique physiology in pregnancy. GDM occurs in the setting of&#xD;
      profound pregnancy changes in glucose metabolism: late pregnancy is normally characterized by&#xD;
      marked insulin resistance. In order to maintain normal glucose levels and avoid GDM,&#xD;
      pancreatic beta cells must augment insulin secretion to compensate. Women with GDM have&#xD;
      inadequate beta-cell compensation for pregnancy-induced insulin resistance, resulting in&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. It is unknown whether beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in GDM is&#xD;
      representative of a chronic maternal defect, unmasked by pregnancy, or whether it is the&#xD;
      result of an imbalance of a placental hormones. Undiscovered placental factors which vary&#xD;
      between pregnancies likely contribute to the pathogenesis of GDM. Discovery of these factors&#xD;
      and elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying GDM will allow for the development better&#xD;
      GDM-specific prevention and treatment strategies.&#xD;
