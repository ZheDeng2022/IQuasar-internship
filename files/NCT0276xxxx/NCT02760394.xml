      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is proposed as a possible in vivo angiogenic stimulator for&#xD;
      improving microvascular myocardial perfusion and anginal symptoms as assessed by myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion imaging and angina questionnaire in patients with chronic stable ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease, when no other means to relief symptoms and/or ischemia are available.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States and second most&#xD;
      common in Israel. Myocardial ischemia prevails when imbalance between oxygen demand and&#xD;
      delivery to the myocardium occurs: due to increased oxygen demand beyond what can be&#xD;
      delivered by increased coronary flow; due to restriction of blood flow from obstruction or&#xD;
      stenosis in the coronary circulation in the face of preserved oxygen demand; or combination&#xD;
      of these processes. There are two main causes for restricted blood supply to the myocardium:&#xD;
      Epicardial atherosclerotic coronary disease or dysfunctional coronary microcirculation. The&#xD;
      two processes are often co-occurring in the same patient given the similarities between the&#xD;
      risk factors underlying both. As the blood vessels fail to deliver adequate resting or&#xD;
      maximal coronary blood flow, either gradually over many years or abruptly during a course of&#xD;
      an acute event, myocardial segmental compromise and thus, global cardiac function&#xD;
      deteriorates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional hallmark of ischemic left ventricular (LV) segments is their inadequate&#xD;
      contractility, manifested as hypokinetic or akinetic segments when examined using either&#xD;
      invasive or non-invasive LV functional studies. Ischemic myocardial cells may progress to&#xD;
      cellular death, and irreversible scar formation. However, other cells may maintain viability.&#xD;
      These viable myocardial segments are of particular clinical importance given their ability to&#xD;
      resume contractility with adequate optimal medical therapy and/or revascularization&#xD;
      optimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gate SPECT technology allows evaluation of myocardial perfusion and myocardial segmental&#xD;
      viability in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease. Studies evaluating the ability of&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion studies to predict clinical outcomes are contradictory in that many have&#xD;
      shown ability to predict morbidity and mortality endpoints while others didn't .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is intuitively conceivable that invasive and non invasive approaches that are&#xD;
      able to reduce ischemic burden as determined by myocardial perfusion imaging, are an&#xD;
      important goal for the treatment of patients with chronic ischemic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different standard invasive approaches as percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI) and&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have been shown to increase myocardial perfusion when&#xD;
      serial studies were compared before and after the intervention. Furthermore, non invasive&#xD;
      anti-anginal medications as calcium channel blockers, beta blocker and nitrates as well as&#xD;
      statins have been shown to similarly produce improvement in myocardial perfusion images as&#xD;
      are combinations of these treatments, as required by modern evidence-based guidelines. It is&#xD;
      presumed that these non-invasive approaches either decrease myocardial oxygen demand (e.g.&#xD;
      Beta blocker) or increase coronary dilation (e.g. Nitrates) as the therapeutic means by which&#xD;
      they contribute to ischemia reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past decade or so, the concept of &quot;therapeutic angiogenesis&quot; has emerged out of&#xD;
      the observation that a significant number of patients are not candidates for standard&#xD;
      revascularization procedures or have incomplete revascularization with conventional&#xD;
      procedures like PCI or CABG. For example, in patients with two or three vessel coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, complete revascularization was successful in 23% and 9% of cases,&#xD;
      respectively in one report. The goal of therapeutic angiogenesis is the induction of new&#xD;
      coronary arterial vessels that can effectively provide blood supply to the area of myocardium&#xD;
      subtended by diseased or occluded native coronary arteries. These &quot;native bypass&quot; vessels&#xD;
      could then relieve myocardial ischemia, improve regional and global left ventricular&#xD;
      performance, lessen symptoms of angina, and potentially improve patient prognosis. Candidates&#xD;
      for pharmacological stimulation of therapeutic angiogenesis in cardiac ischemia include&#xD;
      angiogenic cytokines such as Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth&#xD;
      Factors (VEGF), Hepatocyte Growth /Scatter Factor (HGF/SF), CXC chemokines such as&#xD;
      interleukin 8 (IL8) and monocytes chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), growth factors involved&#xD;
      in maturation of the vascular tree such as angiopoietins and Platelet Derived Growth Factor&#xD;
      (PDGF) and transcription factors that stimulate expression of angiogenic cytokines and their&#xD;
      receptors such as Hypoxia-Induced Factor 1α (HIF1α).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following promising results from pre-clinical and non-controlled studies, several randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trials in humans, using some of these candidates, have shown at best,&#xD;
      modest clinical endpoints improvement or perfusion enhancing capabilities. Although&#xD;
      therapeutic angiogenesis using angiogenesis-enhancing factors is an active research arena, it&#xD;
      is still in its infancy and no such strategy have yet achieved acceptance as adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      for chronic ischemic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is proposed as a possible in vivo angiogenic&#xD;
      stimulator for improving microvascular myocardial perfusion. Surprisingly, HBOT has not been&#xD;
      extensively evaluated in patients with chronic stable ischemic heart disease and to date, its&#xD;
      evaluation in cardiovascular diseases was primarily in the context of acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome, amelioration of ischemic-reperfusion injury and stem cell research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBOT has been investigated for treatment of numerous diseases for more than 300 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal effect of HBOT is increasing the solubility of oxygen in plasma to a level&#xD;
      sufficient to support tissues with minimal oxygen supply carried on by hemoglobin. Transport&#xD;
      of oxygen to mitochondria, the main sites of oxygen utilization within each individual cell,&#xD;
      occurs by diffusion, via a stepwise decrease in the driving oxygen pressure gradient.&#xD;
      Diffusion oxygen gradient is a vector indicating the direction of the greatest rate of change&#xD;
      between oxygen dissolved in the blood and oxygen within the cell/entire tissue. As a whole,&#xD;
      breathing oxygen under hyperbaric conditions has been shown to be a potent means of&#xD;
      increasing arterial oxygen tension, as well as tissue oxygen tension. For example, at 2&#xD;
      absolute atmospheres (ATA), plasma O2 tension rises above 1110 mmHg, whereas at normal&#xD;
      environmental conditions, i.e. at the sea level, it reaches only 98 mmHg. As can be&#xD;
      concluded, hyperbaric conditions can provide about a ten-fold increase in the amounts of O2&#xD;
      reaching the hypoxic cardiac tissue. HBO therapy is well tolerated and has been considered&#xD;
      safe when used according to the standard protocols, with oxygen pressure not exceeding 3 ATA&#xD;
      and treatment sessions limited to a maximum of 120 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have suggested that HBOT can enhance angiogenesis but demonstrating enhanced&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion (presumably via therapeutic angiogenesis) in humans, have never been&#xD;
      attempted. The investigators hypothesized that chronically ischemic viable myocardial tissue&#xD;
      is in a state of chronic oxygen demand/delivery imbalance and that physiologic&#xD;
      ischemia-induced angiogenesis during regenerative/repair processes, aimed to restore oxygen&#xD;
      delivery, has been &quot;burned out&quot;. Since all the regenerative/repair processes have common&#xD;
      denominator: they are all energy/oxygen dependent, it might be possible that HBOT can enables&#xD;
      the metabolic changes needed to reignite those regeneration processes, simply by supplying&#xD;
      the missing energy/oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent, patients will be randomized in 1:1 manner into the&#xD;
      treated or the control-cross group. After the randomization, patients will be invited for&#xD;
      baseline evaluation that included full review of their medical status and complete physical&#xD;
      examination. Patients will be instructed to refrain from any changes in their chronic&#xD;
      medications or life style (e.g. exercise regimen) and to avoid new medications unless&#xD;
      clinically indicated and approved by the study investigators. Quality of life (QOL)&#xD;
      assessments (Seattle Angina Questionnaire [SAQ] translated to Hebrew) will be completed at&#xD;
      baseline and every 2 month in the control period or following the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After their inclusion, all patients will undergo baseline myocardial perfusion study.&#xD;
      Afterwards, patients will be randomized to two groups: a treated group and a cross group.&#xD;
      Patients in the treated group will undergo HBOT treatment for 2 months and after that will&#xD;
      repeat the same-protocol myocardial perfusion study and questionnaire, before entering a 2&#xD;
      month control period. Patients in the cross group will be evaluated at baseline, after a 2&#xD;
      month control period of no treatment and after 2 month period of HBOT treatment (after the&#xD;
      cross to HBOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following HBOT treatment protocol will be practiced: 40 daily sessions, 90 minutes of&#xD;
      100% oxygen at pressure of 2 ATA each, five days a week for 8 weeks.&#xD;
