  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pembrolizumab, when given after salvage&#xD;
      surgery, is effective in increasing the time a person with squamous cell cancer of the head&#xD;
      and neck remains disease-free following locoregional disease recurrence.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open label, phase II study with a window of opportunity&#xD;
      component in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)&#xD;
      treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab following salvage surgery. Forty-five (45) patients will&#xD;
      participate in this study to determine disease-free survival probability at 12 months.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include assessments of disease-free survival probability at 2 years,&#xD;
      overall survival, adverse events and toxicity, and immune and molecular correlatives. For the&#xD;
      window of opportunity component, patients will be randomized 3:1 in favor of receiving&#xD;
      pembrolizumab 200 mg administered intravenously (IV) every three weeks for a maximum of two&#xD;
      doses, versus placebo prior to salvage surgery. Approximately three to six weeks following&#xD;
      the first dose of pembrolizumab, patients will undergo salvage surgery. Tumor tissue and&#xD;
      blood will be collected at the time of surgery for immune correlative studies.&#xD;

             included if there is evidence of extralaryngeal spread, or there is associated nodal&#xD;
             disease. For all other sites, superficial tumors can only be included if there is&#xD;
             associated nodal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a documented disease-free interval (minimum 16 weeks) after initial curative&#xD;
             intent therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidate for salvage resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide tissue from diagnostic core biopsy of tumor lesion(s).&#xD;
