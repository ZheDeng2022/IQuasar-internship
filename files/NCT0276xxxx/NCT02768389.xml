  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients may participate in this research study if they have glioblastoma. (a brain tumor)&#xD;
      that has come back after being treated. Standard treatment for this cancer is a chemotherapy&#xD;
      drug called bevacizumab. This research study involves bevacizumab in combination with a&#xD;
      special diet called the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to research if patients can stay on the MAD when it is added to&#xD;
      the standard bevacizumab treatment.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Determine compliance to treatment at 6 and 12 weeks. Compliance is assessed by review of&#xD;
      the daily food diary and the urine and serum ketone levels. Diet compliance is defined as&#xD;
      following the diet guidelines 80% of the time with resultant ketosis 80% of the time. If 60%&#xD;
      of the patients are compliant with the diet, as defined above, that is a considered a&#xD;
      positive result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine patient compliance in monitoring of blood glucose and urine levels of ketosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine obstacles to compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the frequency of achieving ketosis, as measured by urine ketones checked daily&#xD;
           and serum BHB checked every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine quality of life (FACT-BR) and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine response, progression free survival at 6 months (PFS 6), and overall survival&#xD;
           (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate levels of ketosis and blood sugar with treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate the level of MCT4 expression and IDH1 mutation status with treatment&#xD;
           outcome.&#xD;

             remission. Patients with other malignancies must also be disease free for at least&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must be maintained on a stable corticosteroid regimen from the time of their&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partners must agree to&#xD;
             follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. The effects of&#xD;
             bevacizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (double&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control or abstinence prior to study entry, for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation and after completing treatment. Should a woman become pregnant&#xD;
             or suspect that she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform the treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more&#xD;
             than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;

             (NYHA &gt; 2), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab is an&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with bevacizumab. These potential risks may also apply to other&#xD;
             agents used in this study.&#xD;
