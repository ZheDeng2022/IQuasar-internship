    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a step-wise approach the disease drug-drug&#xD;
      interaction (DDI) potential for vedolizumab to indirectly affect the exposure of cytochrome&#xD;
      P-450 (CYP) substrate drugs by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines in participants with&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who are treated with vedolizumab.&#xD;

      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab, which is being tested to assess&#xD;
      the possibility of drug-drug interactions when administered with other medications. The study&#xD;
      will comprise of 2 parallel parts: Part 1 and Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will enroll approximately 40 participants: 20 healthy participants and 20 participants&#xD;
      with UC or CD who are not currently being treated with vedolizumab. All participants will&#xD;
      receive the following medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caffeine 100 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Losartan 50 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Omeprazole 20 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dextromethorphan 30 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Midazolam 2 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will enroll approximately 20 participants on established vedolizumab intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      maintenance treatment of 300 mg for the treatment of UC or CD. Participants will receive the&#xD;
      same medications and dosages as in Part 1 in addition to their scheduled vedolizumab 300 mg&#xD;
      IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. For Part 1 and Part 2,&#xD;
      participants will arrive at study unit for check-in (Day -1) and will return to the study&#xD;
      unit for dosing and PK assessment on Day 1 and study exit on Day 2 or will be kept from&#xD;
      Check-in through at least 24 hours after dosing for safety and PK assessments before&#xD;
      discharge. The total confinement period (optional) will be up to 3 days for both the parts.&#xD;
      The overall time to participate for each participant in Part 1 will be approximately 6 weeks&#xD;
      and for Part 2, it will be approximately 12 weeks.&#xD;
