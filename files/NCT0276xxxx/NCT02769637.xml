  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mucus in the airways of patients with CF represents an area for bacteria proliferation,&#xD;
      microbial infection and inflammation. Similar to the lung, the esophagus provides an&#xD;
      environment for bacterial to grow. The overall goal of this proposal is to characterize the&#xD;
      esophageal microbiota of children with CF that are treated or untreated with acid blockade&#xD;
      medication and to measure its possible impact on respiratory disease to develop novel&#xD;
      treatment strategies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have significant morbidity and mortality due to airway&#xD;
      infections. These infections are related to the deficiency of mucociliary clearance due to&#xD;
      thick dehydrated secretions. Thus, considerable effort is spent managing airway infections.&#xD;
      This includes therapies to improve mucus clearance and antibiotic treatments that target&#xD;
      important pathogens. Understanding the source of airway microbiota, increased risk of&#xD;
      infection, and exacerbation is critical to improve management of airway infection. A large&#xD;
      proportion of CF patients are also treated with anti-acid medications. These medications&#xD;
      decrease symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and improve the&#xD;
      efficacy of enzyme replacement therapies. Critical for this proposal is the fact that&#xD;
      aspiration may represent a potential route for airway infection from microorganisms in the&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and anti-acid treatments shift the GI microbiota. In&#xD;
      preliminary studies we have identified a strong alteration of the esophageal microbiota in&#xD;
      subjects using acid blocking medications. Thus, these treatments may have a significant&#xD;
      effect on the bacterial communities present in the upper GI tract and may play a role in&#xD;
      infection and exacerbation in CF. Traditionally, access to the upper GI tract has required&#xD;
      endoscopy to acquire biopsy tissue, which is an invasive procedure and not routinely&#xD;
      performed in CF. To circumvent the invasive sampling required for study of the esophagus we&#xD;
      have recently shown that a minimally invasive test, the esophageal string test (EST), is&#xD;
      capable of sampling the upper GI tract, and has performance comparable to biopsy for a number&#xD;
      of measurements including assessment of the esophageal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis for this proposal is that acid blockade medication alters the&#xD;
      esophageal microbiota in CF, increasing the presence of pathogenic bacteria and inflammation.&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis we propose three Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 1: Determine whether esophageal microbial composition in children with CF&#xD;
      changes after withdrawal of acid blockade&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison of esophageal bacterial load by 16S qPCR in subjects on acid blockade and&#xD;
           after withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the stability of the esophageal bacterial communities based on longitudinal&#xD;
           collection of the esophageal string test (EST) prior to withdrawal of acid blockade&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if there are changes after withdrawal of acid blockade in both sputum&#xD;
           microbiota composition and esophageal microbiota (including presence of pathogenic&#xD;
           bacteria) and whether the changes are correlated across the two sample types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2: Determine whether esophageal microbiota in children with CF changes after&#xD;
      initiation of acid blockade in patients started for clinical indications&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison of esophageal bacterial load by 16S qPCR of the esophageal bacteria in&#xD;
           subjects pre and post acid blockade treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the stability of the esophageal bacterial communities based on longitudinal&#xD;
           collection of the esophageal string test (EST) prior to acid blockade treatment&#xD;
           initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if there are changes after initiation of acid blockade in both sputum&#xD;
           microbiota composition and esophageal microbiota (including presence of pathogenic&#xD;
           bacteria) and whether the changes are correlated across the two sample types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim3: Examine the relation between acid blockade medication and inflammation in&#xD;
      association with bacterial communities in subjects from aim 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CompareIL-8 in the esophagus in subjects with and without acid blockade&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare IL-8 in the sputum in subjects with and without acid blockade and determine&#xD;
           relation between inflammation and association with shifts in the bacterial communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together, these aims will provide novel information regarding the impact of acid blockade&#xD;
      treatment on the esophageal and lung microbiota that may impact management of respiratory&#xD;
      disease in CF. We anticipate similar effects of acid blockade on the esophageal bacterial&#xD;
      communities as we observed in non-CF pediatric and adult subjects, but acknowledge that&#xD;
      treatment burden in CF, particularly antibiotics, may affect the expected outcome. These data&#xD;
      will provide critical information to evaluate the effect of acid blockade on infection risk,&#xD;
      which could affect therapeutic choices for patients with CF. The long-term goal of these&#xD;
      studies, is to improve patient care by assessing the effect of acid blocker therapy on the&#xD;
      microbiota and inflammation.&#xD;
