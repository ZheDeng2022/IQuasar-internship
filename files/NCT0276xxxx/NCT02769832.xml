  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if Abraxane and Gemcitabine given together will&#xD;
      be effective in treating small cell cancer that has progressed after one line of treatment.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a second-line therapy for patients with histologically or&#xD;
      cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer or small cell cancer from other organs or&#xD;
      poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors that are treated like small cell cancer. This&#xD;
      study is for patients with metastatic or recurrent disease. Eligible patients will receive&#xD;
      Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane), 100 mg/m2, IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle&#xD;
      followed by Gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
      Participants can continue receiving Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal from the study. Tumor measurements will be done every 2&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥18 years old, both male and female&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed SCLC SCLC or small cell cancer from other&#xD;
             organs or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors that are treated like small cell&#xD;
             cancer. This study is for patients with metastatic or recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion as defined per RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Progression during or after prior first line chemotherapy. Prior maintenance therapy,&#xD;
             targeted therapy and immunotherapy are allowed. Prior use of Rovalpituzumab or other&#xD;
             ADC agent is allowed. Immunotherapy or targeted therapy if used as 2nd line therapy&#xD;
             will not be considered as second line therapy as these are not true chemotherapeutic&#xD;
             agents. Patients treated with definitive chemo-radiation will be eligible if they&#xD;
             progressed within a year of definitive therapy (as definitive therapy will be&#xD;
             considered 1st line therapy for these patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Before study therapy, a minimum of 21 days must have elapsed since any prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy and 2 weeks from the last dose of prior targeted or immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior definitive XRT is allowed if it has been 2 weeks since the end of definitive&#xD;
             XRT. For palliative XRT, protocol-specified treatment can begin at minimum 48 hours&#xD;
             after completion of radiation. Lesions within the XRT field can only be used as target&#xD;
             lesions if definite progression has been demonstrated since the completion of&#xD;
             radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate major organ function including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hematologic function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1800 /mm3, platelet count&#xD;
                  ≥ 100,000/mm3, and Hgb ≥ 9.0 gm/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic function: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, AST and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 x ULN. If liver&#xD;
                  metastases are present, then AST and ALT ≤ 5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must be willing and able to sign informed consent for themselves&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. If female: childbearing potential either terminated by surgery, radiation, or&#xD;
             menopause, or attenuated by use of an approved contraceptive method (intrauterine&#xD;
             device [IUD], birth control pills, or barrier device) during and for 6 months after&#xD;
             trial. If male, use of an approved contraceptive method during the study and 6 months&#xD;
             afterwards. Females with childbearing potential must have a urine negative hCG test&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to the study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Females of child-bearing potential (defined as a sexually mature woman who (1) has not&#xD;
             undergone hysterectomy [the surgical removal of the uterus] or bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
             [the surgical removal of both ovaries] or (2) has not been naturally postmenopausal&#xD;
             for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., has had menses at any time during the&#xD;
             preceding 24 consecutive months]) must:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on&#xD;
             a monthly basis), or agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception&#xD;
             without interruption, 28 days prior to starting IP therapy (including dose&#xD;
             interruptions), and while on study medication or for a longer period if required by&#xD;
             local regulations following the last dose of IP; and&#xD;
&#xD;
             Have a negative serum pregnancy test (β -hCG) result at screening and agree to ongoing&#xD;
             pregnancy testing during the course of the study, as per clinical judgement of the&#xD;
             investigator, and after the end of study therapy. This applies even if the subject&#xD;
             practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Male subjects must practice true abstinence* or agree to use a condom during sexual&#xD;
             contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while&#xD;
             participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for 6 months following IP&#xD;
             discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods&#xD;
                  of contraception].&#xD;
