    <textblock>
      Consuming plant chemicals (e.g., polyphenols) may have beneficial effects on human health&#xD;
      that, if confirmed, may warrant inclusion in combat rations. Ration developers would like to&#xD;
      determine whether the fortification of a high sugar food item with a polyphenol-rich&#xD;
      freeze-dried fruit and/or a fruit extract improves blood sugar response and promotes other&#xD;
      positive physiological changes (e.g., satiety) in a dose-response manner. This study will&#xD;
      test four different types of snack bar with various polyphenol doses, and compare blood&#xD;
      response to a snack bar without polyphenols.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      High glycemic index (GI) foods generally contain simple sugars and/or highly processed and&#xD;
      refined carbohydrates (e.g., instant oatmeal and white bread). These foods are rapidly&#xD;
      digested, which raises blood glucose and insulin to higher concentrations and more rapidly&#xD;
      compared to low GI food items. In some situations, it is advantageous to consume high&#xD;
      glycemic response food items to promote recovery from intense exercise/work. However, there&#xD;
      is some suggestion that low/moderate-GI foods may better maintain glucose levels and enhance&#xD;
      performance if consumed before and during prolonged exercise. Further, impaired blood glucose&#xD;
      regulation (e.g., that can occur with chronic intake of high GI foods) may stimulate the&#xD;
      development of oxidative stress, inflammation, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and&#xD;
      diabetes; and, it is associated with changes in body weight due to stimulating hunger and&#xD;
      excessive food intake. These negative consequences are concerning, given the prevalence of&#xD;
      overweight/obesity and comorbidities (including metabolic syndrome) within the Department of&#xD;
      Defense (DoD). Polyphenols are a heterogeneous group of phytochemicals that are found in&#xD;
      plant-based foods; and they have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may&#xD;
      ultimately help protect against chronic diseases, such as cancer and cardiometabolic disease.&#xD;
      Berry polyphenols are predominantly comprised of proanthocyanidins and/or ellagitannins&#xD;
      (collectively referred to as &quot;tannins&quot;); and, berries have been shown to promote glycemic&#xD;
      control when consumed with a high-carbohydrate containing food item. These beneficial health&#xD;
      effects may warrant polyphenol fortification of combat rations and Garrison food items. For&#xD;
      example, Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center's (NSRDEC) Combat&#xD;
      Feeding Directorate demonstrated that tannins extracted from berries effectively inhibits the&#xD;
      activity of enzymes that metabolize starch in vitro, an underlying mechanism for slowing&#xD;
      starch digestion in vivo. However, whether consumption of a high GI food item containing&#xD;
      polyphenol-rich freeze-dried fruit and/or fruit extracts improves glucose control, reduces&#xD;
      oxidative stress, and promotes satiety in human volunteers is unknown. In this randomized,&#xD;
      cross-over, placebo-controlled, dose-response trial, at least 20 civilian and/or military&#xD;
      personnel will be asked to consume one of five food items during separate trials: 1) a high&#xD;
      glycemic snack bar (control) without any fruit ingredients; 2) a high glycemic snack bar with&#xD;
      cranberry extract (0.5% total weight); 3) a high glycemic snack bar with cranberry extract&#xD;
      (1% total weight); 4) a high glycemic bar with freeze-dried black raspberries (10% total&#xD;
      weight); and, 5) a high glycemic snack bar with freeze-dried black raspberries (20% total&#xD;
      weight). Serial blood sampling to measure acute changes in circulating glucose, insulin,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal hormones and biomarkers of oxidative stress and satiety will occur at&#xD;
      baseline and for three hours after consumption of each food. Appetite will also be assessed&#xD;
      at an ad libitum meal after the three hour period. The only known risks, which this study&#xD;
      presents to participants, are those associated with venous catheter placement. The fruit&#xD;
      concentrates for the present study are either commercially available (black raspberry&#xD;
      powders) or used as an ingredient to boost the phenolic content of commercial items&#xD;
      (cranberry extract). The results will help determine whether fortifying high glycemic food&#xD;
      items with polyphenols may benefit the Warfighter in the ration- or Garrison-feeding&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
