      This study will develop and then test a web-based guided self-help version of Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy (ACT) to be utilized at college counseling centers (CCCs). ACT is an&#xD;
      evidence-based transdiagnostic therapy found to effectively treat a range of psychological&#xD;
      problems. An ACT program would provide a means of implementing effective treatment for the&#xD;
      range of problems in the CCC setting, while the guided self-help format would reduce&#xD;
      counselors' workload, improving cost-effectiveness and reducing waiting lists. This would&#xD;
      both treat students and train counselors in how to implement the ACT intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of all college students have a diagnosable mental health problem. College&#xD;
      counseling centers (CCCs) are faced with increasing demands for services from Universities,&#xD;
      students, and parents to meet the treatment needs of their students, in the context of&#xD;
      increasingly severe cases and declining resources. Innovative, cost effective solutions are&#xD;
      needed that can improve treatment effectiveness with a range of presenting problems while&#xD;
      reducing counselor workloads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project seeks to meet these needs by building a user-informed guided self-help&#xD;
      version of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an evidence-based transdiagnostic therapy&#xD;
      that has been found to effectively treat a range of mental health problems by targeting&#xD;
      experiential avoidance, the tendency to avoid unwanted emotions and negative thoughts.After&#xD;
      the program has been built in the first stage of the study, the investigators will then test&#xD;
      this program at several CCCs throughout the country. An ACT program would provide a means of&#xD;
      implementing effective treatment for the range of problems encountered in the CCC setting,&#xD;
      while the online guided self-help format would reduce counselors' workload for each client,&#xD;
      improving cost effectiveness and reducing waiting lists. This product would both treat&#xD;
      students through a series of self-help modules and train CCC counselors in how to implement&#xD;
      the guided self-help ACT intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the current phase (Phase II) of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant, 8&#xD;
      student self-help sessions will be developed, as well as a counselor portal with counselor&#xD;
      training sessions to review students' use of the program and to receive training on&#xD;
      implementing ACT guided self-help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will consist of two stages: Stage 1 will study user preferences and testing&#xD;
      of the program as it is developed, and Stage 2 will be a randomized trial of the program in&#xD;
      several CCCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 will consist of ongoing interviews with a total of 6 students, 7 counselors and 1&#xD;
      director, who will be contacted intermittently throughout the program to participate in&#xD;
      web-conference interviews in which they provide feedback on the current development, and test&#xD;
      individual components of the program. Development will be iterative, and will be updated and&#xD;
      adjusted based on the feedback from these focused interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 will consist of a randomized trial of 40 counselors using the program, and a nested&#xD;
      program evaluation of 400 students (10 students per counselor). Counselors will be randomized&#xD;
      to either the ACT on College Life program, or to a control website. After completing the&#xD;
      condition's training, counselors will invite students to participate in the site to which the&#xD;
      counselor has been randomized. Participants in both conditions will complete assessments at&#xD;
      baseline, post, and follow-up. The study will examine the feasibility, efficacy, and&#xD;
      acceptability of the program with both students and counselors.&#xD;
