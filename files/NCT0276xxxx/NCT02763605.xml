  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acanthamoebic keratitis is an important corneal disease which may cause severe complication.&#xD;
      The difficulty in diagnosis, the difficulty in treatment, and the long treatment process are&#xD;
      factors leading to the poor prognosis of these patients. In this retrospective study, the&#xD;
      investigators try to analyze the tissue proven Acanthamoebic keratitis diagnosed in our&#xD;
      hospital. The investigators will focus on the in vivo confocal microscopic results, the&#xD;
      medical history and the medical/surgical treatment outcome. The investigators will collect&#xD;
      the tissue proven cases according to the data provided by laboratory diagnosis department and&#xD;
      pathological department. The in vivo confocal microscopic results will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed. The investigators will also look through the photography of the external eyes from&#xD;
      data stored in PAC system. The medical history and treatment outcome will be studied from&#xD;
      clinical chart review. From this study, the investigators aimed to find out a easy way of&#xD;
      diagnosing Acanthamoebic keratitis from in vivo confocal microscopy, and find out a better&#xD;
      way for treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), caused by a pathogenic amoeba, is a sight-threatening corneal&#xD;
      infection with severe pain, epithelial defect, epithelial haze, pseudodendrites, and, most&#xD;
      characteristically, radial keratoneuritis. The corneal infection of AK was first recognized&#xD;
      in the mid 1970s. Since then, a growing number of AK cases were diagnosed, mainly resulting&#xD;
      from improper use of soft contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical diagnosis of AL is difficult, especially in the early phases of the disease, and it&#xD;
      often is misdiagnosed and treated as a herpes simplex infection. It was reported a diagnostic&#xD;
      delay of more than 18 days between onset of symptoms and start of anti- amoebic treatment&#xD;
      results in a poor disease progress. While definitive diagnosis is made by confirmation of&#xD;
      Acanthamoeba cysts or trophozoites in corneal lesions by staining, corneal biopsy, or tissue&#xD;
      culturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo confocal microscopy was considered useful in the rapid diagnosis of AK. The&#xD;
      Acanthamoeba cysts were observed almost exclusively in the epithelial cell layer as highly&#xD;
      reflective, round or stellate, high-contrast particles with a diameter of 10 to 20 μm. It was&#xD;
      suggested that invasion of Acanthamoeba cysts into Bowman's layer may be a useful predictor&#xD;
      for a persistent clinical course. The trophozoites are pear-shaped or irregularly&#xD;
      wedge-shaped structures, some surrounded by a brilliant halo some exhibiting fine&#xD;
      pseudopodia-like extensions, with mean size of 30.2 µm (range 19.2-55.6μm). It was reported&#xD;
      to present in cornea stroma. Highly reflective activated keratocytes forming a honeycomb&#xD;
      pattern change was reported to be present around the keratoneuritis. In addition,&#xD;
      infiltration of inflammatory cells, possibly polymorphonuclear cells, was observed along with&#xD;
      the keratocytes in cases of AK. However, the in vivo confocal microscopic findings in&#xD;
      patients with AK is still limited. Some clinical findings may not be correlated with the&#xD;
      reports published before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      John K.G. et al recommended clinical treatment toward Acanthamoeba keratitis using Diamidine&#xD;
      and Biguanide which are the only two proofed Acanthamoeba cysticidal medication, while&#xD;
      Metronidazole is effective in vivo but not in vitro. Topical steroid was considered rather&#xD;
      controversial but important and beneficial. It was recommended to use a minimum of 2 weeks of&#xD;
      Biguanide prior to the use of topical steroid for inflammation control. When Acanthamoeba&#xD;
      keratitis was diagnosed early in the disease course, topical steroid can be spared for the&#xD;
      immediate using Diamidine and Biguanide to kill pathogen. In a United Kingdom multicenter&#xD;
      study of 218 patients, the average duration of medical therapy was 6 months (range, 0.5 to 29&#xD;
      months). In 2011, a little over half of respondents using corticosteroids in the treatment of&#xD;
      Acanthamoeba keratitis. Surgical managements including epithelial debridement, cryotherapy&#xD;
      and corneal graft surgery may itself be therapeutic if performed early and promote&#xD;
      penetration. Therefore, when Acanthamoeba keratitis was suspected, a long-term and immediate&#xD;
      medical treatment may be needed ,and the use of topical steroid toward Acanthamoeba keratitis&#xD;
      is still worth investigating.&#xD;
