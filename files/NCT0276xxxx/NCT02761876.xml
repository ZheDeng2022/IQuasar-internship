  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if a participatory, agroecological peer farmer-led&#xD;
      education intervention can be effective at improving legume production, food security, and&#xD;
      infant and young child feeding practices in Singida District, Tanzania.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40% of under five children in Tanzania are stunted, with higher levels in rural&#xD;
      areas. Our inception research in Singida identified five pressing issues faced by smallholder&#xD;
      farmers that may contribute to this high rate of stunting. They are (A) hierarchical, or &quot;top&#xD;
      down&quot; farmer education, (B) low soil fertility and little knowledge of agroecological&#xD;
      solutions, (C) high levels of gender inequality and high workloads for women, (D) food&#xD;
      insecurity and low dietary diversity, and (E) sub-optimal infant and young child feeding.&#xD;
      Singida Nutrition and Agroecology Project (SNAP) is a randomized effectiveness trial of a&#xD;
      participatory, agroecological peer farmer education intervention. Each intervention village&#xD;
      will choose 2 mentor farmers, 1 man and 1 woman, who will participate in a field visit to and&#xD;
      training by existing mentor farmers in Malawi and a two week long follow-up and refresher&#xD;
      trainings in Tanzania integrating agroecology, climate change, nutrition, and gender&#xD;
      equality. Mentor farmers will then conduct monthly visits to participating households and&#xD;
      support the households in conducting experimentation with agroecological practices and/or new&#xD;
      behaviors regarding nutrition and gender equality. Quarterly meetings among mentor farmers&#xD;
      and biannual meeting of participating farmers within each village will be held to discuss&#xD;
      progress and challenges of peer education and household experimentations.&#xD;
