  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is geared toward characterizing the recovery of brain activity and cognitive&#xD;
      function following treatments of electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine general anesthesia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seizures are often associated with loss of consciousness, possibly through effects on&#xD;
      sub-cortical arousal systems, disruption of cortical-subcortical interactions, and ultimately&#xD;
      through depressed neocortical function. Furthermore, people are often confused in the&#xD;
      post-ictal state even when consciousness returns after a seizure. Disrupted cognitive&#xD;
      function during the postictal phase has not been fully characterized but presents short and&#xD;
      long-term implications. Many experience an acute disorder of attention, consciousness, and&#xD;
      cognition, referred to as delirium. Memory deficits are also common. The neurobiology for&#xD;
      these phenomena are incomplete and challenging to test, as seizures are typically sporadic&#xD;
      and vary in intensity and character. In contrast, the setting of electroconvulsive therapy&#xD;
      (ECT) provides the opportunity to study the reconstitution of consciousness and cognition&#xD;
      following seizures in an elective and predictable context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no standard agent used to induce general anesthesia during ECT. Ketamine is&#xD;
      receiving greater attention as an infusion for treating depression and for its potential&#xD;
      benefits on improving ECT efficacy and expediting cognitive recovery. Further data are needed&#xD;
      to determine whether ketamine may improve recovery of cognitive function relative to&#xD;
      etomidate, a commonly used anesthetic for general anesthesia during ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the cognition function and electroencephalographic patterns&#xD;
      that accompany the recovery from ECT and general anesthesia. Twenty patients with refractory&#xD;
      depression will be randomized in this interventional single-blinded randomized crossover&#xD;
      trial. Each patient will complete seven study visits. The first visit will be conducted&#xD;
      during the dose-charge titration ECT treatment with etomidate anesthesia. After this session,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to three sessions each week for two weeks (six treatments total).&#xD;
      Over the first week patients will be randomized in order for three treatment arms: (1)&#xD;
      etomidate general anesthesia and ECT, (2) ketamine general anesthesia and ECT, and (3)&#xD;
      ketamine alone. Patients will be blinded to the treatment arm for each session. Baseline and&#xD;
      post-treatment measurements of cognition and ECT will be acquired on each of the six&#xD;
      treatment sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that agree will have a MRI.&#xD;

    <measure>Suicidality</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed at baseline on treatment days 1-6.</time_frame>
    <description>The groups/arms for this outcome are combined as a whole-group analysis due to the crossover design of this study, as pre-specified by the study protocol. Breaking up the analyses into the various arms of the study would change our scientific questions and approach. All participants included in analyses completed all treatments, the various arms for the study vary only in the order in which participants received each treatment. These data show the change in suicidality from baseline to treatment 6 based on the Scale of Suicide Ideation.&#xD;
The measure completed was the Scale of Suicide Ideation. For this study, participants completed the following questions of the questionnaire:&#xD;
wish to live (0 Moderate to Strong, 1 Weak, 2 None)&#xD;
wish to die (0 None, 1 Weak, 2 Moderate to Strong)&#xD;
The total scores range from 0-4. Lower scores indicate high suicide ideation, and high scores indicate low suicide ideation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mood Assessed Using the Mood Self-Assessment Manikin</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 120 minutes after return of responsiveness, assessed on treatment days 1-6</time_frame>
    <description>Mood Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) Scale: 1 (very unpleasant) - 9 (very pleasant).&#xD;
The groups/arms for this outcome are combined as a whole-group analysis due to the Crossover design of this study, as pre-specified by the study protocol. Breaking up the analyses into the various arms of the study would change our scientific questions and approach. Further, any statistical analyses would be underpowered due to low participant numbers in each arm. Thus, the results are combined and reported as a whole group analysis. All participants included in analyses completed all treatments included in the study, the various arms for the study vary only in the order in which participants received each treatment. These data show the change in mood from baseline to treatment 6 based on the SAM. Additionally, data collected at baseline are not dependent on the study group/arm.</description>

    <measure>Change in Anterior-Posterior Functional Connectivity in the Scalp During Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-ECT from 0-120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>High-density EEG collected during 5-minute epochs of eyes-closed quiet resting at baseline and post-ECT. Results are reported as the coherence measure, which is used for tracking changes in anterior-posterior functional connectivity.&#xD;
Coherence is a measure of synchronization between two signals which is used to measure anterior-posterior functional connectivity. Coherence is a unitless measure between 0 and 1. High coherence between time-series of two neural populations reflects higher efficiency in communication between those populations and therefore stronger functional connectivity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anterior-Posterior Phase-lag in the Scalp EEG During Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-ECT from 0 -120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>High-density EEG collected during 5-minute epochs of eyes-closed quiet resting at baseline and post-ECT. Phase-lag was assessed using the Phase-Lag Index (PLI), a measure ranging from 0 - 1. A consistent phase-lag between two tim-series results in a PLI of 1. A time-series without coupling results in a PLI near or equaling 0. Results show the difference in anterior-posterior PLI between baseline and post-ECT.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in EEG Entropy in the Scalp EEG During Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, Post-ECT from 0 -120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>High-density EEG collected during 5-minute epochs of eyes-closed quiet resting at baseline and post-ECT. Results are reported as permutation entropy (PE) measures in posterior regions, which we are using to track changes in scalp EEG entropy.&#xD;
Permutation Entropy (PE) is a measure that is used to quantify the complexity of time series signals. It is a unitless measure between 0 and 1. Lower the PE represents a more regular and more deterministic time series while higher PE represents a more complex time series.</description>

Breaking up the analyses into the various arms of the study would change our scientific questions and approach. All participants included in analyses completed all treatments, the various arms for the study vary only in the order in which participants received each treatment. These data show the change in suicidality from baseline to treatment 6 based on the Scale of Suicide Ideation.&#xD;
The measure completed was the Scale of Suicide Ideation. For this study, participants completed the following questions of the questionnaire:&#xD;
wish to live (0 Moderate to Strong, 1 Weak, 2 None)&#xD;
wish to die (0 None, 1 Weak, 2 Moderate to Strong)&#xD;
The total scores range from 0-4. Lower scores indicate high suicide ideation, and high scores indicate low suicide ideation.</description>

The groups/arms for this outcome are combined as a whole-group analysis due to the Crossover design of this study, as pre-specified by the study protocol. Breaking up the analyses into the various arms of the study would change our scientific questions and approach. Further, any statistical analyses would be underpowered due to low participant numbers in each arm. Thus, the results are combined and reported as a whole group analysis. All participants included in analyses completed all treatments included in the study, the various arms for the study vary only in the order in which participants received each treatment. These data show the change in mood from baseline to treatment 6 based on the SAM. Additionally, data collected at baseline are not dependent on the study group/arm.</description>

        <title>Change in Anterior-Posterior Functional Connectivity in the Scalp During Recovery</title>
        <description>High-density EEG collected during 5-minute epochs of eyes-closed quiet resting at baseline and post-ECT. Results are reported as the coherence measure, which is used for tracking changes in anterior-posterior functional connectivity.&#xD;
Coherence is a measure of synchronization between two signals which is used to measure anterior-posterior functional connectivity. Coherence is a unitless measure between 0 and 1. High coherence between time-series of two neural populations reflects higher efficiency in communication between those populations and therefore stronger functional connectivity.</description>

          <title>Change in Anterior-Posterior Functional Connectivity in the Scalp During Recovery</title>
          <description>High-density EEG collected during 5-minute epochs of eyes-closed quiet resting at baseline and post-ECT. Results are reported as the coherence measure, which is used for tracking changes in anterior-posterior functional connectivity.&#xD;
Coherence is a measure of synchronization between two signals which is used to measure anterior-posterior functional connectivity. Coherence is a unitless measure between 0 and 1. High coherence between time-series of two neural populations reflects higher efficiency in communication between those populations and therefore stronger functional connectivity.</description>
