  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Alpha Lipoic Acid(ALA) as an&#xD;
      adjuvant in the management of patients with acute phosphide poisoning.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out following approval of the research ethical committee of Tanta&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine on patients admitted to The Poison Control Unit (Emergency Hospital,&#xD;
      Tanta University and Emergency Hospital, Mansoura University) with acute phosphide poisoning&#xD;
      in the period from January 2016 to January 2018. A written informed consent will be taken&#xD;
      from each patient or his/her guardians (if the patient was unable to participate in the&#xD;
      consent process). Confidentiality of the data will be maintained by making code numbers for&#xD;
      each patient. The investigators plan to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of ALA as an adjuvant in treatment of patients with acute phosphide&#xD;
      poisoning. Fifty patients will be randomized to ALA or a non ALA in a 1:1 ratio (25 patients&#xD;
      in each group). ALA will be given IV, as a dose of 600 mg/12 hours. Patients will be&#xD;
      monitored and a detailed documentation of any adverse effect due to ALA therapy will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention represents an added treatment to the existing standard of care. All&#xD;
      patients will continue to receive standard treatment, which is determined by the attending&#xD;
      physician who maintains clinical responsibility for all patients. It consists of patient&#xD;
      resuscitation, gastric decontamination (with sodium bicarbonate, and activated charcoal [1&#xD;
      g/Kg, orally] in the first 6 hours after onset of poisoning), adequate hydration and&#xD;
      supportive treatment. All the patients will be followed up until discharge or death. All&#xD;
      patients will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. History. II. Clinical examination. III. Laboratory investigations: At admission and&#xD;
      repeated before discharge.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients (male or female, aged 12 years or older) with symptomatic acute phosphide&#xD;
        poisoning (deliberate or accidental), with diagnosis made on the basis of:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The typical clinical manifestations due to and following shortly after a single&#xD;
             exposure to phosphide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Reliable identification of the compound based on the container brought by patient&#xD;
             attendants or a subsequent confirmation by silver nitrate test for phosphine detection&#xD;
             in stomach contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
