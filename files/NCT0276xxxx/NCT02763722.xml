    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease that has potential&#xD;
      for profound and far-reaching effects on all aspects of children and their families lives,&#xD;
      significantly reducing the quality of life. Atopic dermatitis typically appears in infancy&#xD;
      and nowadays is affecting up to 10-30% of children and 2-10% of adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diminished skin barrier is the essential factor that plays a role in the initiation,&#xD;
      consolidating and exacerbating AD. Treatment options for AD typically address skin barrier&#xD;
      protection or inflammatory components of disease. Proper care using mild and appropriately&#xD;
      formulated emollient preparations may provide significant benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In investigators prior study, more than half of pharmacy-derived emollient preparations&#xD;
      contained potential contact haptens listed in the European baseline series (EBS), used in&#xD;
      diagnosing contact dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of regularly applied emollient&#xD;
      in an atomiser (in the form of oil-in-water emulsion) in maintenance therapy, in children&#xD;
      presenting from mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study 3 visits are planned (for a period of 4 weeks). During each visit investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate transepidermal water loss (TEWL), capacitance of outer areas of the stratum&#xD;
      corneum as an indirect assessment of skin hydration. Moreover, investigators will assess&#xD;
      three-them-severityIndex and the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product that participants will use in the study, was prepared at investigators request,&#xD;
      in collaboration with the cosmetics company, which according to investigators knowledge at&#xD;
      present, will not be benefited from the audit. The following described study project&#xD;
      (prospective clinical trial, uncontrolled, open-label) will be conducted within the framework&#xD;
      of the statutory tasks of the Department of Pulmonology and Allergology of Children Medical&#xD;
      University of Warsaw and is a non-commercial project.&#xD;

      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease that has potential&#xD;
      for profound and far-reaching effects on all aspects of children and their families lives,&#xD;
      significantly reducing the quality of life. Atopic dermatitis typically appears in infancy&#xD;
      and nowadays is affecting up to 10-30% of children and 2-10% of adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diminished skin barrier is the essential factor that plays a role in the initiation,&#xD;
      consolidating and exacerbating AD. The skin exposed to aeroallergens (pollen, pet dander,&#xD;
      dust mites), or food allergens (eggs, milk, wheat protein, chocolate, strawberry), hard&#xD;
      water, and soaps and detergents, loses the protective barrier composed of lipids (ie. Lipid)&#xD;
      and becomes the victim of harmful, exogenous substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main symptoms of atopic dermatitis are redness and dry skin, itching, moreover patients&#xD;
      are susceptible to recurrent superficial skin infections. Skin lesions in AD are mostly&#xD;
      located on the elbows and knees, face and neck, however they can spans the entire body.&#xD;
      Treatment options for AD typically address skin barrier protection or inflammatory components&#xD;
      of disease. Proper care using mild and appropriately formulated emollient preparations may&#xD;
      provide significant benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous observations indicated to be reasonable to selection carefully composition of&#xD;
      emollient preparations. In investigators prior study, more than half of emollient&#xD;
      preparations, available in online drugstores, contained potential contact sensitizers,&#xD;
      included to 28, the most common, haptens listed in the European baseline series (EBS), used&#xD;
      in diagnosing contact dermatitis. A significant number of investigated products contained at&#xD;
      least two different haptens which may threaten unpredictable allergic reactions in the case&#xD;
      of concomitance of various allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of regularly applied emollient&#xD;
      in an atomiser (in the form of oil-in-water emulsion) in maintenance therapy, in children&#xD;
      presenting from mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composition of the tested emollient is typical and based on the frequently occurring&#xD;
      substances found in public preparations of this kind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emollient spray (composition INCI):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aqua, Glycerin, Aqua, Parfum, Glyceryl Caprylate, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Butyrospermum&#xD;
      Parkii Butter, Adansonia digitata Seed Oil, Oenothera Biennis Oil, Perilla ocymoides Seed&#xD;
      Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palm Kernel Glycerides, Squalane, behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl&#xD;
      Stearate, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Lecythin, Cetyl Alcohol, Myristyl Alcohol, Ceramide&#xD;
      NP, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caprylic / Capric&#xD;
      Trigliceride, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Tocopherol, Etylhexyl Stearate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product that will be used in the study (emollients in spray- composition of the product&#xD;
      given above) was prepared at investigators request, in collaboration with the cosmetics&#xD;
      company, which according to investigators knowledge at present, will not be benefited from&#xD;
      the audit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following described study project will be conducted within the framework of the statutory&#xD;
      tasks of the Department of Pulmonology and Allergology of Children Medical University of&#xD;
      Warsaw and is a non-commercial project.&#xD;
