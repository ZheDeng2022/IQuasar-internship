      The aim of the study is to test whether a resource-sparing 4-week, 20-fraction course of&#xD;
      accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy is non-inferior to accelerated radiotherapy&#xD;
      delivering 33 fractions over 5.5 weeks in the treatment of patients with Stage I-IV squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma of the pharynx, larynx and oral cavity with the exception of paranasal sinus,&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal and stage I-II glottic carcinomas.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) constitute approximately 7% of all&#xD;
      incident cancers, and 75% of these are seen in low- and middle-income countries. Life-style&#xD;
      factors, in particular tobacco and alcohol consumption, are major etiological factors&#xD;
      although an increasing number of HNSCC cases are associated with viral infections (Epstein&#xD;
      Barr Virus and Human Papilloma Virus). Radiation therapy (RT) alone or combined with&#xD;
      cytotoxic or molecular targeted agents is a mainstay as definitive treatment for previously&#xD;
      untreated locally advanced disease. This therapy offers organ and functional preservation in&#xD;
      many cases with an approximate 30 to 50% of cases obtaining longterm loco-regional tumor&#xD;
      control. Accelerated RT, that is increasing the weekly delivered radiation dose above the&#xD;
      conventional 10 Gy per week, has been shown in a large number of randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      to be associated with an improved efficacy to toxicity ratio relative to standard&#xD;
      fractionation provided a careful balance between total dose, dose per fraction and overall&#xD;
      treatment time is chosen. The Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group trial DAHANCA 6/7 tested a&#xD;
      schedule of accelerated normofractionated radiation therapy for HNSCC delivering 6 fractions&#xD;
      of 2.0 Gy per week to a total dose of 66-68 Gy. This schedule gave a 10% improvement in&#xD;
      loco-regional tumor control compared with the same dose delivered with 5 fractions per week.&#xD;
      The DAHANCA 6/7 schedule was tested in the IAEA ACC trial, comparing again 6 vs. 5 fractions&#xD;
      per week but allowing the total dose to range from 66 Gy to 70 Gy. The outcome of the IAEA&#xD;
      ACC trial also showed a significant 13% improvement in loco-regional control in the&#xD;
      accelerated arm. Thus, accelerating RT by delivering 6 fractions per week may reasonably be&#xD;
      considered a standard of care for definitive RT alone. Clinical evidence points in the&#xD;
      direction of a 4 week accelerated, hypofractionated schedule as being a radiobiologically&#xD;
      interesting alternative to accelerated schedules using more fractions for treatment of HNSCC.&#xD;
      A series of exploratory calculations suggested that an attractive schedule could be 55 Gy in&#xD;
      20 fractions (2.75 Gy per fraction) delivered over 4 weeks and this schedule was chosen for&#xD;
      the test arm of HYPNO. There is historical experience with this schedule in the North of UK&#xD;
      and in many countries in the British Commonwealth. The aim of this study is to test whether&#xD;
      this resource-sparing 4-week course of accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy is&#xD;
      non-inferior to radiotherapy delivering 33 fractions over 5.5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a stratified, balanced, and randomized study (phase III) recruiting&#xD;
      patients with Stage I to IV squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx, larynx and oral cavity&#xD;
      with the exception of paranasal sinus, nasopharyngeal and stage I to II glottic carcinomas.&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to the test arm or the control arm by central, randomization,&#xD;
      stratified according to the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Institution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status, WHO 0-1 vs. 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor sub-site within the head and neck: pharynx, larynx, oral cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy (yes/no) Other important prognostic parameters are: 2D vs. 3DCRT vs. IMRT;&#xD;
           Tumor stage: T1-2 vs. T3-4; Nodal stage: N0-1 vs. N2-3. These will be randomly&#xD;
           distributed among the treatment arms as a result of the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are reviewed at least once a week during treatment. Time and severity of early&#xD;
      radiation reactions in mucosa and skin are noted. These data are registered on the Treatment&#xD;
      Response Form. Patients are seen about 2 months after the end of treatment to record&#xD;
      persistent early toxicities and early tumor response, both at the primary and nodal site.&#xD;
      Afterwards, the patients are seen every 3 months for 2 years and 6 monthly for 3 years&#xD;
      bringing the total trial follow-up to just over 5 years. CRFs are designed to record all the&#xD;
      information for an individual study subject required by the study protocol. The purpose of&#xD;
      the CRF is threefold: i) to ensure data collection in accordance with the study protocol; ii)&#xD;
      to fulfill the regulatory requirements for data collection; iii) to facilitate the effective,&#xD;
      comprehensive data processing and analysis, results reporting, and to promote structured&#xD;
      collection of safety and efficacy data. The completed CRF's are submitted by email to the&#xD;
      Data Center: hypno@humonc.wisc.edu where the data will be electronically transferred to the&#xD;
      central trial database. HYPNO uses a rather novel design as a non-inferiority trial with dual&#xD;
      primary endpoints. The primary efficacy endpoint is 3 year loco-regional control (LRC) - even&#xD;
      though 5 year disease status will also be collected - and the primary toxicity endpoint is 3&#xD;
      year grade 2 or higher (moderate or severe) side effects (TOX). All times to events will be&#xD;
      measured from the date of randomization. The test arm (HYPNO -T) will be declared&#xD;
      non-inferior to the control arm if both i) LRC in the test arm is non-inferior to that of the&#xD;
      control arm AND ii) Late toxicity in the test arm is non-inferior (i.e. not worse) than in&#xD;
      the control arm. This design has been developed in collaboration with the HYPNO trial&#xD;
      statistician, Prof. Richard Chappell, Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics,&#xD;
      University of Wisconsin - Madison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical formulation of the non-inferiority hypotheses with dual primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: LRC in the TEST arm less than LRC in the CONTROL arm (Test arm inferior to control arm&#xD;
      with respect to LRC). HA: LRC in the TEST arm greater than or equal to LRC in the CONTROL arm&#xD;
      (Test arm non-inferior to control arm with respect to LRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: TOX in the TEST arm greater than TOX in the CONTROL arm (Experimental treatment inferior&#xD;
      to control treatment with respect to late toxicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HA: TOX in the TEST arm less than or equal to TOX in the CONTROL arm (Experimental treatment&#xD;
      non-inferior to control treatment with respect to late toxicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required sample size in this kind of design depends heavily on the choice of the&#xD;
      inferiority margin, with decreasing values leading to a steep increase in the sample size. It&#xD;
      also depends to some extend on the baseline 3 year LRC and TOX rates. These were selected&#xD;
      based on the published results from the IAEA-ACC trial. Thus, the target sample size is 836&#xD;
      patients. The primary analysis will be performed for all randomized patients using the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A QA committee will be formed and they will be charged with all aspects of quality assurance&#xD;
      and credentialing of centers for participation in HYPNO. Each participating center should&#xD;
      appoint a contact person for QA issues (physician or physicist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data exchange dummy run Before the first patient can be randomized in a center, a 'dry run'&#xD;
      of the data exchange is conducted. To this end, a HNSCC patient from the center will be&#xD;
      arbitrarily chosen by the local investigator and a set of CRFs filled in for this case and&#xD;
      submitted electronically to the Data Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine level QA An associated GCP and QA program securing compliance with the protocol will&#xD;
      be established between the IAEA, the Data Center and involved departments. Participation in&#xD;
      the IAEA TLD audit is mandatory for centers participating in the HYPNO trial. A credentialing&#xD;
      QA program will be developed for departments using IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient level QA Radiotherapy plans and dose-volume histogram (DVH) data for the first two&#xD;
      patients on trial from a center will be submitted for central review, if possible in&#xD;
      electronic form. During the period when a center is accruing patients for the trial, the Data&#xD;
      Center will randomly select a subset of patients (5-10%, a smaller proportion reviewed for&#xD;
      highly accruing centers) for a 'crossed' review where 3-4 centers will review cases. It is&#xD;
      expected that the total number of cases reviewed for HYPNO will not exceed 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be appointed. Recommendations to stop&#xD;
      patient accrual early for safety or efficacy reasons can only be made by the IDMC.&#xD;
      Participating centers will not be informed about comparative effectiveness or toxicity in the&#xD;
      trial arms as long as the trial is open for accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An associated translational research program is planned. Formally these studies will run as&#xD;
      separate research protocol and separate informed consent from patients will have to be&#xD;
      obtained according to the relevant national regulations.&#xD;
