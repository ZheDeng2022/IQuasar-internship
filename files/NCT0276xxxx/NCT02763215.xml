  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a 24-month study to assess copper parameters in participants with Wilson disease&#xD;
      (WD) treated with standard of care (SoC) medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing informed consent, participants meeting all inclusion and no exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were enrolled into the study as outpatients. The participants' routine clinic visits&#xD;
      were scheduled according to the standard clinical practice at the study center and at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician at approximate 6-month intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment, participants were receiving SoC medications for the treatment of&#xD;
      WD, which could include penicillamine, trientine, zinc, or a combination of a copper chelator&#xD;
      and zinc. If treatment was interrupted or stopped during the course of the study,&#xD;
      participants continued in the study and biological samples and clinical data were continued&#xD;
      to be collected for the full 24-month study period. Dosing with SoC agents was individualized&#xD;
      and managed by the treating physician at the study center according to standard clinical&#xD;
      practice at the site.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage Of Participants Who Achieved Or Maintained Normalized Concentrations Of Non-ceruloplasmin-bound Copper (NCC) Or Reached A Reduction Of ≥ 25% In NCC During 6 Months Of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>To achieve a normalized NCC concentration, participants must have had 2 consecutive measures within (or below) the normal concentration range (0.8 to 2.3 micromolar [μM]). Two consecutive measurements required that the measurements occurred on separate dates and were assigned to 2 different visits. Non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper was calculated by subtracting the amount of copper bound to the ceruloplasmin from the total plasma copper concentration.</description>

    <description>The CGI scale item 1 (severity of illness) rating scale is a commonly used measure of symptom severity, treatment response, and the efficacy of treatments in treatment studies of participants with mental disorders. It uses the Clinical Global Impression - Severity Scale (CGI-S), a 7-point scale that requires the Investigator to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the Investigator's past experience with participants who had the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a participant was assessed on severity of illness at the time of rating as: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill. A decrease in score indicates improvement in disease severity. Last Assessment was the last available post-baseline result for each participant (ranging from 1 to 24 months).</description>

    <description>The CGI scale item 2 (global improvement) is a rating scale commonly used measure of symptom severity, treatment response, and the efficacy of treatments in treatment studies of participants with mental disorders. It uses the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale (CGI-I), a 7-point scale that requires the Investigator to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to the Baseline state at the beginning of the study and rate as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. A decrease in score indicates improvement in disease severity. Last Assessment was the last available post-baseline result for each participant (ranging from 1 to 24 months).</description>

        <description>To achieve a normalized NCC concentration, participants must have had 2 consecutive measures within (or below) the normal concentration range (0.8 to 2.3 micromolar [μM]). Two consecutive measurements required that the measurements occurred on separate dates and were assigned to 2 different visits. Non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper was calculated by subtracting the amount of copper bound to the ceruloplasmin from the total plasma copper concentration.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale Item 1 (Severity Of Illness) At Month 6, Month 24, And Last Assessment</title>
        <description>The CGI scale item 1 (severity of illness) rating scale is a commonly used measure of symptom severity, treatment response, and the efficacy of treatments in treatment studies of participants with mental disorders. It uses the Clinical Global Impression - Severity Scale (CGI-S), a 7-point scale that requires the Investigator to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the Investigator's past experience with participants who had the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a participant was assessed on severity of illness at the time of rating as: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill. A decrease in score indicates improvement in disease severity. Last Assessment was the last available post-baseline result for each participant (ranging from 1 to 24 months).</description>

To be eligibly enrolled, participants must have been receiving the SoC medications (penicillamine, trientine, zinc, or copper chelators with zinc) for the treatment of WD at the time of enrollment and for no more than 60 months prior to enrollment.

        <description>The CGI scale item 2 (global improvement) is a rating scale commonly used measure of symptom severity, treatment response, and the efficacy of treatments in treatment studies of participants with mental disorders. It uses the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale (CGI-I), a 7-point scale that requires the Investigator to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to the Baseline state at the beginning of the study and rate as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. A decrease in score indicates improvement in disease severity. Last Assessment was the last available post-baseline result for each participant (ranging from 1 to 24 months).</description>
