      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocrine glands give off hormones. Researchers want to learn more about the disorders that&#xD;
      affect these glands in children. These disorders might be caused by changes in genes. Genes&#xD;
      contain DNA, which is the blueprint of how a cell works. Researchers want to identify the&#xD;
      genes involved in endocrine and metabolic disorders. This might help develop new ways to&#xD;
      diagnose and treat the disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the inheritance of endocrine or metabolism disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children ages 3month-18 with known or suspected endocrine or metabolism disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members ages 3months-100. They may participate in the DNA part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records. Their parents or&#xD;
      guardians will allow the records to be released.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a clinic visit. This may include a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents or guardians will give their consent for the study. Participants may have tests,&#xD;
      surgery, or other procedures to help diagnose or treat their condition. These could include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and saliva tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth hormone test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pituitary and adrenal function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Picture of chromosomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging tests. These may include X-ray, ultrasound, scans, or a skeletal survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical photographs&#xD;
&#xD;
      If surgery is done, a tissue sample will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have follow-up visits for diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating relatives will have one visit. This will include medical history and blood and&#xD;
      saliva tests. The blood and saliva will be used for DNA testing.&#xD;

      This protocol is designed to allow endocrine-related evaluations of children with known or&#xD;
      suspected endocrine or metabolic disorders. Children with endocrine or metabolic-related&#xD;
      condition(s) who may or may not be eligible for a specific NICHD research protocol, may be&#xD;
      evaluated under the auspices of this protocol to advance the clinical skills of physicians&#xD;
      participating in NICHD clinical research and training programs, and to provide stimuli for&#xD;
      new clinical research initiatives. Standard medically-indicated laboratory or radiological&#xD;
      studies may be performed to confirm a diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient.&#xD;
      In some cases, the child participant may receive medical or surgical treatment for their&#xD;
      disorder at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) according to current&#xD;
      clinical practice. The overall purpose of endocrine evaluations under this protocol is to&#xD;
      support our clinical training and research missions. Family members of children evaluated on&#xD;
      this protocol (who have informative meiotic inheritance relationships to the proband or index&#xD;
      case) may be enrolled in the genetic/DNA testing part of the protocol.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known or suspected endocrine disorder ages 1-18 years are eligible&#xD;
             for this protocol. Protocol investigators will make the actual selection of patients&#xD;
             most appropriate for clinical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relatives ages 3 months- 100 years may be enrolled if clinically indicated for the&#xD;
             diagnosis of a proband.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are no formal exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical, physical, psychiatric, or social conditions, which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators, would make participation in this protocol not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the patient, will exclude participation. Patients who are critically ill, unstable, or&#xD;
             with severe organ failure that may affect/limit the endocrine evaluation and place&#xD;
             unsustainable demands on Clinical Center or NICHD resources will be excluded.&#xD;
