  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iodine is an essential trace element necessary for the synthesis of thyroid hormones which&#xD;
      are critical for human growth and development throughout the lifecycle. Iodine is&#xD;
      particularly important during pregnancy and infancy for brain and neurological development.&#xD;
      Severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy can cause severe mental impairment and stillbirth&#xD;
      while mild-to-moderate deficiency has been associated with impaired infant development. As&#xD;
      such, pregnant women and women of child-bearing age are particularly vulnerable to the&#xD;
      effects of iodine deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, 241 million (30%) school aged children are iodine deficient. Historically, the UK&#xD;
      and Ireland were believed to be iodine sufficient but concern has been expressed in the last&#xD;
      decade regarding the iodine status of the UK and Irish populations. A study of Irish women in&#xD;
      2004 reported 55% of pregnant women in their sample population to be moderately iodine&#xD;
      deficient and 53% of non-pregnant women to be moderately iodine deficient. A study of UK&#xD;
      schoolgirls found that 51% were mildly iodine deficient and 16% were moderately deficient.&#xD;
      Importantly, the prevalence of iodine deficiency was highest in Northern Ireland where 85% of&#xD;
      those sampled were iodine deficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine is known to interact with selenium in the conversion of the thyroid hormone thyroxine&#xD;
      (T4) to the metabolically active triiodothyonine (T3) hormone. Selenium is also important for&#xD;
      immune, cardiovascular and cognitive function. Selenium status has been reported to be&#xD;
      moderately low using pooled English data on blood selenium concentrations from 1984 to 1992.&#xD;
      In addition, the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey reports that selenium intakes are&#xD;
      below recommendations for several population groups including women of childbearing age where&#xD;
      mean selenium intakes are 76% of the recommended 60µg/day. This national survey also reported&#xD;
      that 49% of women aged 19-64 years failed to meet the lower reference nutrient intake of&#xD;
      40µg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milk and dairy products are the major source of iodine for the UK population and are also a&#xD;
      source of selenium. The contribution of milk and dairy products to iodine and selenium&#xD;
      intakes is greatest in adult females (35% and 6% respectively). Observational evidence has&#xD;
      repeatedly reported milk consumption to be positively correlated with iodine status and&#xD;
      iodine intakes. Research in Iceland and New Zealand has reported that milk consumption is not&#xD;
      associated with selenium status; however it is unknown if this is true for the UK population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no randomised controlled trial has examined the effect of milk consumption on either&#xD;
      iodine or selenium status. The possibility of increasing iodine and selenium intake by&#xD;
      increasing milk consumption, a widely available and consumed foodstuff, in a population group&#xD;
      vulnerable to micronutrient deficiency should be investigated. This would add valuable data&#xD;
      to the knowledge base for iodine, where there is ongoing debate over the most appropriate&#xD;
      means of increasing iodine intake amongst women of childbearing age in the UK where salt&#xD;
      iodisation, the key strategy in preventing deficiency, is not implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of cow's milk consumption on the&#xD;
      biological status of iodine and selenium among women of child-bearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a 12 week randomised-controlled human intervention study. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomised to consume additional semi-skimmed milk in the Following amounts, control group&#xD;
      (0mls/day), intervention group (430mls/day or 3l per week).&#xD;
