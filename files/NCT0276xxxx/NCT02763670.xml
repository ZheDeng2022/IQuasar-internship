  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heart failure is a chronic pathology with prevalence from 2 to 3% of general population,&#xD;
      a death rate of 50% at 6 months for patients with stage IV, and a probability of death or&#xD;
      hospitalization or emergency consultation of 40% at 3 years. The care of patients is&#xD;
      heterogeneous, especially in light of the organization of therapeutic education offered to&#xD;
      patients and patient monitoring modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the management strategies for patients with chronic&#xD;
      heart failure stage III or IV NYHA, and heart failure patients with stage II NYHA with&#xD;
      previous hospitalization for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a longitudinal observational multicenter study comparing a management strategy&#xD;
      including patient education and monitoring as part of a hospital dedicated organization and&#xD;
      an organization of care as usually done in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was a composite endpoint of morbidity and mortality involving deaths,&#xD;
      unplanned readmissions and emergency visits for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected number of patients is 720 patients (360 per strategy). The follow-up duration of&#xD;
      24 months.&#xD;

    <description>A standardized and specialized network to take care of the severe cardiac insufficiency:&#xD;
An initial assessment and consultations with health professionals specialized in severe cardiac insufficiency during the hospitalization for cardiac insufficiency&#xD;
At 1 months, consultations and acts realized by health professionals specialized (one hospital day care)&#xD;
At 2 months, a therapeutic education program for heart failure patients, approved by the Rhône-Alpes regional public health authorities (week hospital: two days and one night).&#xD;
At 6 and 18 months, one cardiology consultation&#xD;
At 12 and 24 months, consultations and acts realized by health professionals specialized (one hospital day care)</description>

    <description>Conventional management of heart failure patients is defined in the guide HAS (&quot;Haute Autorité de Santé&quot;) care course. Patient follow-up, however, is defined by the patient's physician and / or cardiologist at the waning of his hospitalization, according to the usual practice for patients with stage II, III or IV NYHA.&#xD;
According to these recommendations, the patient should see his cardiologist at least once a year.&#xD;
Usual practices are:&#xD;
An initial assessment and consultations with health professionals specialized in severe cardiac insufficiency during the hospitalization for cardiac insufficiency&#xD;
At 12 months, a cardiologic consultation. For the study, three evaluation points are programmed: two by phone at 6 and 18 months, two by a consultation at 24 months. This interview aimed to evaluate the number of hospitalization, consultations and acts realized by health professionals specialized (the information in the logbook).</description>
