  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Miscarriage is a common event associated with severe psychological and social morbidity,&#xD;
      further tormenting in women suffering recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) by at least three&#xD;
      consecutive losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography and biomarkers have yet to precisely predict viability in pregnancies with&#xD;
      symptoms of threatening miscarriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel biomarker Preimplantation Factor (PIF) derived by the developing embryo might be the&#xD;
      key factor for this prediction ameliorating the implantation process by promoting a favorable&#xD;
      local immune system in the uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to establish a prospective early pregnancy cohort (PEP-cohort) that&#xD;
      includes women throughout the first trimester by both assisted reproductive technology (ART)&#xD;
      and spontaneous conceptions. By a combination of consecutive ultrasonographys and blood&#xD;
      samples of known predictors of implantation PIF as a predictor of viability will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data are finally compared to the same data in a retrospective cohort of RPL patients&#xD;
      emphasizing the role of PIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All collected data will be stored in a Research Biobank for the current studies outlined as&#xD;
      well as potential future studies of reproductive medicine in the first trimester.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate Preimplantation Factor (PIF) throughout the first trimester&#xD;
      we need to employ two settings of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PEP in ART (PEP-A) will enroll participants referred for fertility treatment at&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet and North Zealand Hospital. Participants all have cryopreserved embryos&#xD;
      suitable for frozen embryo transfer in a natural menstrual cycle. No type of ovulation&#xD;
      trigger will be employed, as the LH peak is monitored via home urine-LH test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a thorough examination of the luteal phase, participants are recalled for blood samples&#xD;
      on day 7, 11, 14 and 16 after positive urine-LH test. Hereafter positive serum human&#xD;
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) denotes a pregnancy and these participants are offered to&#xD;
      continue in the later part of the PEP-cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEP in Spontaneous conceptions (PEP-S) represents the sampling of expected normal pregnancies&#xD;
      from the local community. Enrolled at the time of the first positive pregnancy test,&#xD;
      participants are expected to be included from approximately 5 weeks of gestation. Hereafter&#xD;
      participants are recalled every two weeks for blood sampling and transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasonographys of endometrial thickness until a gestational sac and yolk sac are visible&#xD;
      for mean sac diameter measuring and eventually the crown-rump-length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research biobank All collected data: questionnaires of medical history before enrollment,&#xD;
      ultrasonographys and blood samples of progesterone, 17-OH-progesterone, estradiol,&#xD;
      alpha-feto-protein (AFP), pregnancy associated placental protein A (PAPP-A), hCG and PIF are&#xD;
      stored in a research biobank.&#xD;
