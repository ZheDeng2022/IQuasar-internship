             Numerical Pain Rating scale (NPRS) where 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain; subjects must&#xD;
             have a level of 4 or more) after a pediatric surgical procedure (at baseline) that&#xD;
             requires hospitalization. Sponsor will pre-approve a list of acceptable surgical&#xD;
             procedures prior to study start for each site. Surgical procedures other than those on&#xD;
             the pre-approved list may be acceptable on a case by case basis if approved by the&#xD;
             medical monitor (MM) and sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject, if female of child-bearing potential (defined as postmenarche), must agree to&#xD;
             abstain from unprotected sexual activity during study participation and for 2 weeks&#xD;
             after study exit/early termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject, if male with reproductive potential, must agree to abstain from unprotected&#xD;
             sexual activity during study participation and for 2 weeks after study exit/early&#xD;
             termination.&#xD;

          6. Subject, if female of childbearing potential, must have negative pregnancy test (serum&#xD;
             or urine) results at screening and check-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject's legally authorized representative (eg, parent, legal guardian) must&#xD;
             voluntarily sign and date a parental permission/ Informed Consent that is approved by&#xD;
             an Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the subject must sign an IRB approved assent,&#xD;

             differential &gt; 2 x ULN , will be left to the investigator's discretion (no increased&#xD;
             risk of participation in study based upon judgment of the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has any history of renal disease that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             would contraindicate study participation; or subject has significantly impaired renal&#xD;
             function, in the opinion of the investigator as evidenced by an estimated glomerular&#xD;
             filtration rate calculated using a pediatric appropriate formula such as the Schwartz&#xD;
             Equation (Schwartz et al, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has a history or laboratory evidence of bleeding or clotting disorders or&#xD;
             conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject has a known or suspected history of alcoholism, marijuana or illicit drug&#xD;
             abuse or misuse within 2 years before screening as evidence from medical history or&#xD;

             within 6 months prior to screening. A history of attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
             disorder requiring medication is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has a diagnosis of epilepsy or other seizure disorder (a history of febrile&#xD;
             seizures is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject has had previous cardiothoracic surgery (subjects who have a history of patent&#xD;
             ductus arteriosus ligations/surgery as infants are acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject has a history of conditions which might be specifically contraindicated or&#xD;
             require caution while using hydrocodone bitartrate (HB), acetaminophen (APAP), and/or&#xD;
             ibuprofen (if used as rescue medication) per the Investigator's Brochure (IB) and&#xD;
             product information per the appropriate package insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject has a history of any drug allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance including&#xD;
             HB, APAP, ibuprofen or excipients, or any opioid drug product which, in the opinion of&#xD;

             intractable nausea and/or vomiting, severe GI narrowing, perforation, obstruction,&#xD;
             bleed, or gastric band surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subject has a history of a GI event (eg, perforation, obstruction, bleed) within 6&#xD;
             months prior to screening or any GI event greater than 6 months before screening that,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject has received any investigational product or device within 30 days before&#xD;
             screening, or is scheduled to receive an investigational device or another&#xD;
             investigational drug (other than those in this study) during the course of this study.&#xD;

             hepatic, pulmonary, or renal function, myxedema or hypothyroidism, adrenocortical&#xD;
             insufficiency (Addison's disease), central nervous system (CNS) depression or coma,&#xD;
             toxic psychosis, urethral stricture, acute alcoholism, delirium tremens, severe&#xD;
             kyphoscoliosis, or biliary tract dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Subject has any other medical condition, abnormal vital sign (blood pressure, pulse&#xD;
             rate, respiratory rate), body temperature, pulse oximetry; or any physical examination&#xD;
             or ECG finding at screening which, in the investigator's medical opinion, would&#xD;
             preclude safe participation in a clinical study.&#xD;
