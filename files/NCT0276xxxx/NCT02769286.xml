      Treatment efficacy of osimertinib will be assessed in patients with lung cancer harboring&#xD;
      activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (cohort 1) and those harboring&#xD;
      T790M (cohort 2) which were detected from circulating tumor DNA&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, single centre study of AZD9291 administered orally in&#xD;
      patients with advanced lung cancer with activating mutations of EGFR gene with or without&#xD;
      T790M which were detected from circulating tumor DNA. EGFR-TKI naïve patients with activating&#xD;
      EGFR mutation will be enrolled in cohort 1. Patients with acquired resistance to prior EGFR&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) due to T790M mutation is going to be enrolled in cohort 2.&#xD;

             class to AZD9291) or any excipients of these agents&#xD;
