    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cough &lt;14 days or difficult breathing with fast breathing (for children 2&#xD;
             to &lt;12 months of age, &gt;50 breaths/minute and for children &gt;12 months of age, &gt; 40&#xD;
             breaths/minute).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness of children's caregiver to provide informed consent and to be&#xD;
             available for follow-up for the planned duration of the study, including accepting a&#xD;
             home visit if he/she fails to return to Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) with the child&#xD;
             for a scheduled study follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If fast breathing observed at screening resolves after bronchodilator challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chest-indrawing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe respiratory distress, classified by World Health Organization (WHO) pocketbook&#xD;
             guidelines (e.g., grunting, nasal flaring, head nodding, crackles on auscultation, or&#xD;
             very severe chest-indrawing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of WHO Intergrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) danger signs&#xD;
             including: lethargy or unconsciousness, convulsions, vomiting everything, or inability&#xD;
             to drink or breastfeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypoxia (SaO2 &lt; 90% on room air, as assessed by a Lifebox pulse oximeter).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stridor when calm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 seropositivity or HIV-1 exposure, assessed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An HIV-positive result upon rapid antibody test will exclude any child from this&#xD;
                  study. If a child is less than 12 months or age or breastfeeding with a positive&#xD;
                  rapid test result, the child will be referred to receive additional confirmatory&#xD;
                  HIV testing (e.g., dried blood spot filter paper test) and follow-up from KCH&#xD;
                  staff, as per standard of care. Even if the confirmatory HIV testing subsequently&#xD;
                  shows that child is HIV-negative, he or she will remain excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a child is less than 12 months of age or breastfeeding and has an HIV-negative&#xD;
                  result upon rapid antibody test, the child's biological mother's HIV status will&#xD;
                  need to be assessed. If the mother is HIV-positive, the child will be excluded.&#xD;
                  If the mother has a documented HIV-negative test result from within the past 3&#xD;
                  months, the child will be included. If the mother does not have documentation of&#xD;
                  an HIV-negative test result, she will be tested via rapid antibody testing to&#xD;
                  determine the child's eligibility for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a child is over 12 months of age and not breastfeeding, an HIV-negative rapid&#xD;
                  antibody test is required for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: If a child has documentation of an HIV-negative test result from within the&#xD;
                  past 3 months, that test result will be used for the child's eligibility&#xD;
                  assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe acute malnutrition (weight for height/length &lt; -3 SD, mid-upper arm&#xD;
             circumference &lt;115 mm, or edema).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Possible tuberculosis (coughing for more than 14 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe anemia, classified by WHO pocketbook guidelines (i.e., severe palmar pallor or&#xD;
             hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe malaria, classified by WHO pocketbook guidelines (i.e., positive mRDT with any&#xD;
             danger sign, stiff neck, abnormal bleeding, clinical jaundice, or hemoglobinuria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to penicillin or amoxicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of an antibiotic treatment in the 48 hours prior to the study based on&#xD;
             caregiver's self-report and/or documentation in child's medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospitalized within 14 days prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Living outside Lilongwe urban area, the study catchment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or psychosocial condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators, would interfere with the conduct of the study or for which study&#xD;
             participation might jeopardize the child's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any non-pneumonia acute medical illness which requires antibiotic treatment per local&#xD;
             standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical study of another investigational product within 12 weeks&#xD;
             prior to randomization or planning to begin participation during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior participation in an Innovative Treatments in Pneumonia study during a previous&#xD;
             pneumonia diagnosis.&#xD;
