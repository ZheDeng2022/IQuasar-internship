      The purpose of this study is to better enhance transitions of care for the highest risk,&#xD;
      complex patients, Carolinas HealthCare System (CHS) has designed an Integrated Practice Unit,&#xD;
      called Transition Services (CHS-TS).CHS-TS aims to improve patient outcomes through&#xD;
      innovative approaches that leverage analytics and technology, while bridging care&#xD;
      coordination and communication gaps. During their hospitalization, CHS-TS patients enter into&#xD;
      a transition pathway that includes the following key services: integrated access to medical,&#xD;
      pharmacist, and specialty providers; access to CHS disease specific management programs;&#xD;
      dedicated care management services delivered in home and at the clinic; lab and infusion&#xD;
      services; palliative care consultations when appropriate; and paramedicine for 24 hour&#xD;
      support. AIRTIGHT (Aiming to Improve Readmissions Through InteGrated Hospital Transitions) is&#xD;
      a pragmatic, randomized quality improvement evaluation, which seeks to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of the role-out of CHS-TS services for patients at high risk for a 30-day readmission.&#xD;
      AIRTIGHT will test the hypothesis that patients that receive care through CHS-TS will have a&#xD;
      lower all cause, 30-day readmission rate than patients that receive usual care.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital inpatient care accounts for the largest share of total health care expenses in the&#xD;
      US. In 2012, the average cost per inpatient stay was $10,400 with total aggregated hospital&#xD;
      costs of $377.5 billion. (Moore, 2012; and Weiss, 2012) In addition to this expense,&#xD;
      transitions from the hospital represent a particularly vulnerable time when patients are&#xD;
      susceptible to experiencing adverse events, which is especially true for patients with&#xD;
      complex chronic comorbidities. For example, twenty percent of Medicare patients are&#xD;
      readmitted to the hospital within 30 days, and 20% of all discharged patients suffer from a&#xD;
      preventable adverse event within three weeks of discharge.(Rennke, 2013) Despite national&#xD;
      efforts to improve transitions, the hospital discharge process largely remains chaotic,&#xD;
      fragmented, and associated with poor outcomes. (Rennke, 2013; Hansen, 2011; Jack, 2009;&#xD;
      Kansagara, 2015; Kansagara, 2011; &amp; Kripalani, 2014). Currently, even the highest risk&#xD;
      patients leave a complex, acute hospital stay to then arrive in primary care offices that are&#xD;
      often neither equipped nor resourced to manage the challenges inherent to such transitions.&#xD;
      Indeed, transitioning the highest risk, complex patients will require a paradigm shift in&#xD;
      care delivery that is intensive, multidisciplinary, coordinated, and encompasses wrap-around&#xD;
      services.(http://www.isc.hbs.edu/health-care/vbhcd/Pages/integrated-practice-units.aspx.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better enhance transitions of care for the highest risk, complex patients, Carolinas&#xD;
      HealthCare System (CHS) has designed an Integrated Practice Unit, called Transition Services&#xD;
      (CHS-TS). The IPU model is based on the concept that significant improvements in outcomes&#xD;
      will come from physician-led, team based, integrated services that are focused on a specific&#xD;
      condition or segment of the&#xD;
      population.(http://www.isc.hbs.edu/health-care/vbhcd/Pages/integrated-practice-units.aspx)&#xD;
      Also integral to the IPU model is having an advanced informatics platform to continuously&#xD;
      measure costs, processes, and patient outcomes. CHS-TS aims to improve patient outcomes&#xD;
      through innovative approaches that leverage analytics and technology, while bridging care&#xD;
      coordination and communication gaps. During their hospitalization, CHS-TS patients enter into&#xD;
      a transition pathway that includes the following key services: integrated access to medical,&#xD;
      pharmacist, and specialty providers; access to CHS disease specific management programs;&#xD;
      dedicated care management services delivered in home and at the clinic; lab and infusion&#xD;
      services; palliative care consultations when appropriate; and paramedicine for 24 hour&#xD;
      support. Because this population faces many barriers to accessing traditional care, CHS-TS&#xD;
      leverages virtual technology to provide visits with patients in their home setting when&#xD;
      necessary and appropriate. Whether virtual or in person, each patient will receive the&#xD;
      following seven core components (the first four of which will be used as markers for the&#xD;
      implementation (RE-AIM) evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Introduction to CHS-TS process prior to discharge (ii) Hospital follow-up evaluation&#xD;
      within 72 hours either in home with paramedicine or CHS-TS clinic (iii) Medication&#xD;
      reconciliation by a pharmacist within 72 hours (iv) Weekly contact with care management team&#xD;
      (v) Entry into the Heart Success Program if appropriate (vi) Access to 24/7 phone support,&#xD;
      24/7 paramedicine visits, and same day clinic scheduling (vii) Coordinated transition to the&#xD;
      next appropriate care location after 30 days from time of discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHS strives to provide extraordinary care to patients and the communities it serves. This&#xD;
      proposed evaluation is designed to guide CHS strategy and quality improvement by applying&#xD;
      research methodology and data analytics to support the environment of a Learning Health&#xD;
      System. Ultimately, as CHS deploys resource intensive interventions like the CHS-TS, it is&#xD;
      important for the system and its patients to know answers to questions such as: What type of&#xD;
      patient does the CHS-TS help?; How much benefit might be expected?; and At what cost?&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIRTIGHT (Aiming to Improve Readmissions Through InteGrated Hospital Transitions) is a&#xD;
      pragmatic, randomized quality improvement evaluation, which seeks to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      the role-out of CHS-TS services for patients at high risk for a 30-day readmission. This&#xD;
      outcomes evaluation of a quality improvement intervention is designed to be a seamless part&#xD;
      of the routine care in a real-world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIRTIGHT is a pragmatic, randomized quality improvement evaluation. Patients who are&#xD;
      identified by risk modeling as having a high risk (&gt;20%) for a 30-day readmission will be&#xD;
      eligible for CHS-TS referral (referral eligible). Each weekday, referral eligible patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to CHS-TS referrals with a total number targeted to the CHS-TS's&#xD;
      capacity. The CHS TS capacity will be revaluated on a daily. Because variables that affect&#xD;
      eligibility may change throughout the course of a hospital stay, exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      applied again at the time of discharge for the purposes of analysis. For example, patients&#xD;
      not discharged to home are excluded. A diagnosis of heart failure is also added as an&#xD;
      additional exclusion criterion at the time of discharge because CHS Heart Success recruits&#xD;
      patients from a similar population and there is significant overlap in the services offered&#xD;
      between CHS TS and CHS Heart Success. All patients who remain eligible at the time of&#xD;
      discharge (discharge eligible) will be included in the analysis. Planned enrollment is 1520&#xD;
      patients (n=760 per arm) with the engagement in CHS-TS services ending at the 30th day after&#xD;
      discharge. Outcomes data will be tracked for 90 days. To mitigate the risk of selection bias,&#xD;
      all eligibility criteria are objective and determined using data analytics within the&#xD;
      software package, SAS. Additionally, analysis will be by intention to treat. With the use of&#xD;
      this pragmatic design, crossovers from the CHS-TS arm to usual care are expected and may&#xD;
      attenuate the measured effect of the CHS-TS. Since this evaluation protocol is part of a&#xD;
      quality improvement intervention, the investigators requested that the CHS institutional&#xD;
      review board designate the study as expedited research and grant a waiver of informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Variable&#xD;
&#xD;
      30-day all cause readmission with index visit as defined by the Centers for Medicaid and&#xD;
      Medicare Services (CMS) and with inclusion of observation patients at any CHS facility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Variable(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 30-day all cause CHS readmission (as defined by CMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Length of stay upon the index visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Length of stay upon the readmission visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All cause, 60 and 90-day readmission rate as defined by CMS with inclusion of&#xD;
           observation patients at any CHS facility&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 30-day readmission rate among patients with a primary diagnosis of congestive heart&#xD;
           failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 30-day readmission rate among patients with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 30-day readmission rate among patients with a primary diagnosis of sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Number of Emergency Department visits within 30 days of discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Intensive Care Unit visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent and Dependent Variable(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dependent variable under assessment is 30-day all cause readmission (yes/no). The primary&#xD;
      independent variable of interest is the program assignment (usual care vs. CHS-TS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection will be through an automated process that generates a referral list at 03:00 of&#xD;
      patients admitted during the preceding 24 hour period, called the CHS-TS Referral Eligible&#xD;
      List (REL). At the CMC Main campus, where patient enrollment occurs Monday through Friday,&#xD;
      the Monday REL contains admissions that meet criteria from Friday-Sunday. At the CMC Mercy&#xD;
      campus, where patient enrollment occurs Tuesday through Friday, the Tuesday REL contains&#xD;
      admissions that meet criteria from Friday-Monday. The REL is generated based on the study's&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that meet the eligibility criteria at the time of admission will be randomized into&#xD;
      one of two groups on the CHS-TS Referral Eligible List (REL). A constrained randomization&#xD;
      scheme will be utilized allocating referrals into permuted blocks each day for up to 30 total&#xD;
      referrals (total includes CHS-TS and usual care). The total referrals are based on daily&#xD;
      estimates of clinic capacity. The allocation will be 1:1 CHS-TS: usual care.&#xD;
