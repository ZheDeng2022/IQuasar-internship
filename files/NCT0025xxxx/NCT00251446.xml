  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single-arm study in patients with stage IIIB (with malignant pleural&#xD;
      effusion) and IV NSCLC who have been previously treated with a platinum-based doublet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle will be 21 days. On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will receive vinflunine 320&#xD;
      mg/m2 as a 20-minute IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated every 2 cycles for response using RECIST criteria.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for the study, patients must fulfill all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed an IRB-approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recurrent or metastatic stage IIIB (with malignant pleural&#xD;
             effusion) and IV NSCLC that has progressed after receiving a platinum-based doublet as&#xD;
             first-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Previously irradiated lesions will not be allowed as&#xD;
             measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be &lt;18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous chemotherapy must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must either be not of child bearing potential or have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration. Patients are considered not of&#xD;
             child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are&#xD;
             postmenopausal for at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraceptive measures&#xD;
             during study treatment and for a reasonable time thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1500/uL, platelet count&#xD;
             &gt;100,000/uL, and hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a serum creatinine &lt;2 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a total bilirubin &lt;2.5 x ULN and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt;5.0&#xD;
             x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Significant history of uncontrolled cardiac disease; i.e., uncontrolled hypertension,&#xD;
             unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction (within prior 6 months), uncontrolled&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, and cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a serious uncontrolled intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness,&#xD;
             including serious infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a co-existing malignancy or had a malignancy diagnosed within the last 3&#xD;
             years, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient received treatment with a non-approved or investigational drug within 30 days&#xD;
             before planned start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is not completely healed from a previous oncologic or other major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is receiving or planning to receive any concurrent chemotherapy not indicated&#xD;
             in the study protocol or an investigational agent during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to vinflunine or any of the components&#xD;
             in vinflunine or another vinca alkaloid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient who is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient who is unable to comply with requirements of study.&#xD;
