      This is a Phase II, open label, non-randomized study in patients with histologically or&#xD;
      pathologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV, EGFR+ adenocarcinoma of the colon or&#xD;
      rectum who have not received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall safety profile of a&#xD;
      modified FOLFOX 6 plus cetuximab regimen in the first-line treatment of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Study Endpoint(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess overall survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who receive&#xD;
      first-line therapy with a modified FOLFOX 6 + cetuximab regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current treatment options for metastatic colon cancer are in need of further improvement.&#xD;
      The three-drug combination of oxaliplatin with 5-FU/LV for the first-line treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer has shown a significant increase in response rate compared to&#xD;
      IFL (irinotecan and bolus 5-FU plus leucovorin ) and IROX (irinotecan plus oxaliplatin.&#xD;
      Cetuximab has shown activity with and without irinotecan in subjects with colorectal cancer&#xD;
      refractory to irinotecan alone.30,31 Cetuximab has also been shown to be safe and effective&#xD;
      when administered with infusional 5-FU/folinic acid plus irinotecan. These results suggest&#xD;
      that the addition of cetuximab to a 5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin-based regimen (FOLFOX) used in the&#xD;
      1st line setting may lead to the development of more treatment options for subjects with&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase II, open label, non-randomized study in patients with histologically or&#xD;
      pathologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV, EGFR+ adenocarcinoma of the colon or&#xD;
      rectum who have not received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a modified FOLFOX 6 regimen (5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) every 2&#xD;
      weeks in combination with cetuximab given weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for response and progression-free survival. Overall survival will&#xD;
      also be evaluated, as well as the safety profile of the regimen.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients must have signed an IRB approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with histologically or pathologically documented, stage IIIB or IV&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection (i.e.,&#xD;
             inoperable metastatic disease).&#xD;
