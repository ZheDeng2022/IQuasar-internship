      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of risperidone (an&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication) versus placebo as add-on therapy to mood stabilizers, in the&#xD;
      treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Risperidone, widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia, has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      the treatment of manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorders. Antipsychotic&#xD;
      drugs like risperidone have also been used as therapeutic agents in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      who are not responsive to mood stabilizers alone. This is a randomized, double-blind study to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of risperidone compared with placebo, as an addition to&#xD;
      mood stabilizing drugs, in the treatment of patients experiencing manic episodes associated&#xD;
      with bipolar disorder. The study has two phases: a double-blind treatment phase (3 weeks) and&#xD;
      an open-label phase (10 weeks). To participate in the study, patients must be in-patients for&#xD;
      a minimum of the first 4 days of double-blind treatment. During the double-blind treatment&#xD;
      phase, patients receive risperidone or placebo tablets to be taken once a day at gradually&#xD;
      increasing doses at investigator's discretion, up to a maximum dose of 6 mg/day, while&#xD;
      continuing their treatment with a mood stabilizer (lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine). In&#xD;
      the open-label phase, therapy with a mood stabilizer continues, and all patients receive&#xD;
      risperidone with dosage gradually adjusted to achieve optimal effectiveness. The primary&#xD;
      measure of effectiveness is the change in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score from&#xD;
      baseline to end of double-blind treatment. Additional efficacy measures include the Brief&#xD;
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), (which evaluates the&#xD;
      change in severity of the disorder), and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Safety&#xD;
      assessments include the incidence of adverse events throughout the study; measurement of&#xD;
      vital signs (pulse and blood pressure) and evaluation of the presence and severity of&#xD;
      extrapyramidal symptoms by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) at specified&#xD;
      intervals; and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) before study&#xD;
      initiation, at completion of the double-blind treatment, and at the end of the study. The&#xD;
      study hypothesis is that daily treatment with risperidone as add-on therapy provides better&#xD;
      effectiveness than the addition of placebo, as measured by Young Mania Rating Scale scores,&#xD;
      in the treatment of the manic phase of bipolar disorder. Risperidone 1 mg tablets, taken&#xD;
      orally, once daily; Doses of 2 mg on Days 1 and 2, up to 4 mg on Days 3 and 4, and up to 6 mg&#xD;
      (maximum dose) on Days 5 through 21. Same dose maintained through the 10 week open-label&#xD;
      phase. Gradual dose adjustments are allowed to achieve optimal effectiveness.&#xD;
