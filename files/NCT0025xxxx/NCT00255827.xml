  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-phase study will determine the safety of treating patients with pancreatic cancer with&#xD;
      the genetically engineered HyperAcute-Pancreatic cancer vaccine. It will establish the proper&#xD;
      vaccine dose and will examine side effects and potential benefits of the treatment. The&#xD;
      vaccine contains killed pancreatic cancer cells containing a mouse gene that causes the&#xD;
      production of a foreign pattern of protein-sugars on the cell surface. It is hoped that the&#xD;
      immune response to the foreign substance will stimulate the immune system to attack the&#xD;
      patient's own cancer cells that have similar proteins without this sugar pattern, causing the&#xD;
      tumor to remain stable or shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older with pancreatic cancer that has been surgically resected&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination, blood tests, urinalysis, chest x-rays and CT scans. MRI, PET, and ultrasound&#xD;
      scans may be obtained if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive twelve vaccinations two weeks apart from each other. The vaccines&#xD;
      will be injected under the skin, similar to the way a tuberculosis skin test is given. Phase&#xD;
      I of the study will treat successive groups of patients with increasing numbers of the&#xD;
      vaccine cells to evaluate side effects of the treatment and determine the optimum dose. Phase&#xD;
      II will look for any beneficial effects of the vaccine given at the highest dose found to be&#xD;
      safe in Phase I. Monthly blood samples will be drawn during the 6 months of vaccine&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, patient follow-up visits will be scheduled every 2 months for the&#xD;
      remaining first year (6 months) after vaccination and then every 3 months for the next 2&#xD;
      years for the following tests and procedures to evaluate treatment response and side effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history and physical examination Blood tests X-rays and various scans (nuclear&#xD;
      medicine/CT/MRI) FACT-Hep Assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of treatment on the&#xD;
      patient's general well-being. The questionnaire is administered before beginning treatment,&#xD;
      monthly during treatment, and during follow-up visits after completing the treatment. It&#xD;
      includes questions on the severity of pancreatic cancer symptoms and the ability to perform&#xD;
      normal activities of daily life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to statistics of the American Cancer Society, an estimated 31,000 individuals will&#xD;
      be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 25,000 will die of the disease, making it the fifth&#xD;
      leading cause of U.S. cancer deaths this year despite all current therapy. This protocol&#xD;
      attempts to exploit an approach to pancreatic cancer immunotherapy using a naturally&#xD;
      occurring barrier to xenotransplantation in humans in an attempt to vaccinate patients&#xD;
      against their pancreatic cancer. The expression of the murine alpha (1,3)&#xD;
      galactosyltransferase [alpha (1,3) GT] gene results in the cell surface expression of alpha&#xD;
      (1,3) galactosyl-epitopes (alpha-gal) on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These&#xD;
      epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response that occurs when organs&#xD;
      are transplanted from non-primate donor species into man. Human hosts often have pre-existing&#xD;
      anti-alpha-gal antibodies that bind alpha-gal epitopes and lead to rapid activation of&#xD;
      complement and cell lysis. The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies found in most&#xD;
      individuals are thought to be due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are naturally&#xD;
      expressed on normal gut flora leading to chronic immunological stimulation. These antibodies&#xD;
      may comprise up to 1% of serum IgG. In this Phase I/II trial, patients with surgically&#xD;
      resected pancreatic cancer will undergo a series of twelve intradermal injections with a&#xD;
      vaccine composed of irradiated allogeneic pancreatic cancer cell lines (HAPa-1 and HAPa-2)&#xD;
      that have been transduced with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based&#xD;
      retroviral vector expressing the murine alpha (1,3) GT gene. Endpoints of the study include&#xD;
      determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), tumor and&#xD;
      immunological responses.&#xD;
