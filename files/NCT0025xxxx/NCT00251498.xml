  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy (response rate) of cetuximab&#xD;
      when administered in combination with docetaxel and carboplatin for treatment of patients&#xD;
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the time to progression and overall survival for patients with advanced&#xD;
           NSCLC who are treated with the combination docetaxel, carboplatin , and cetuximab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the toxicity of the combination in patients with advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with stages IIIB (pleural or pericardial effusion) and IV NSCLC who have not&#xD;
      received any prior chemotherapy will be eligible to participate in the trial. Other&#xD;
      eligibility criteria include: ECOG PS 0-1, normal hepatic and renal function, age &gt;18 years.&#xD;
      Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3.&#xD;

      This is a phase II, open label, non-randomized study in patients with&#xD;
      histologically/cytologically confirmed stage IIIB (pleural or pericardial effusion) or stage&#xD;
      IV NSCLC who have not received prior chemotherapy. The trial will evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety profile of the combination of docetaxel, carboplatin and cetuximab for patients with&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a combination of docetaxel and carboplatin administered every 3 weeks&#xD;
      plus cetuximab given weekly. A maximum of four cycles of chemotherapy will be administered to&#xD;
      patients. Patients who demonstrate an ongoing response (CR/PR/SD) at the end of 4th cycle of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, may receive two more cycles of treatment. Patients who continue to respond&#xD;
      (CR/PR/SD) after six cycles of therapy may receive therapy with single agent cetuximab (250&#xD;
      mg/m2/week) for up to 1 year or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for response, time to progression, and overall survival. In&#xD;
      addition, the safety profile of the combination will be assessed.&#xD;
