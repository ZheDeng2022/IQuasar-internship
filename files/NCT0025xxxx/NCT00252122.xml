    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to provide a preliminary assessment of the feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of intravenous ketamine in controlling pain in patients with sickle cell disease&#xD;
      (who are admitted to the hospital with severe, acute pain crisis, and who have been resistant&#xD;
      to intravenous narcotics).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is often difficult to manage acute painful crisis in patients with sickle cell disease.&#xD;
      The usual management of these crises relies on hydration, administration of oxygen and&#xD;
      narcotics, like morphine. A select group of patients, for unknown reasons, does not respond&#xD;
      to this management and these patients often require prolonged use (several days) of&#xD;
      intravenous narcotics. Narcotics have proven to be ineffective in controlling this type of&#xD;
      pain and can cause multiple side effects (sedation, vomiting, respiratory depression). We&#xD;
      propose to administer intravenous ketamine in this group of patients who are resistant to&#xD;
      intravenous narcotics. Ketamine has been proven to be effective in controlling pain in&#xD;
      multiple clinical situations. However, there are no data in the literature describing its use&#xD;
      in patients with sickle cell disease.&#xD;
