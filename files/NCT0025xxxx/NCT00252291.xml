  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Aridol bronchial&#xD;
      challenge test to detect bronchial hyperresponsiveness in patients with suspected asthma.&#xD;
      Patients with suspected asthma of either gender, aged between 6 and 50 years, with only&#xD;
      mildly impaired lung function (FEV1 &gt;70%) are to be tested with three different bronchial&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness challenges (Aridol, exercise and methacholine), and the results compared.&#xD;
      A clinical diagnosis will also be made at the end of the study.&#xD;

             has not been given a firm diagnosis of asthma or a firm exclusion of the diagnosis of&#xD;
             asthma (e.g. has an equivocal diagnosis of asthma or been referred for further&#xD;
             investigation of asthma type symptoms)&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Be able to perform all of the techniques necessary to measure lung function including&#xD;
