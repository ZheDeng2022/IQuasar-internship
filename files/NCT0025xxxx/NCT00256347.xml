  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      30 healthy volunteers will be enrolled in this 6-session study. The first visit will be a&#xD;
      screening/orientation session. The next 5 visits will be (full day) outpatient sessions&#xD;
      taking place Monday through Friday during one week. All full day visits will be drug&#xD;
      administration sessions with subjects randomized to one of two groups. The primary purpose is&#xD;
      to investigate the time course of development of analgesic tolerance (loss of pain relieving&#xD;
      effect) to morphine on experimentally produced skin tenderness in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

      30 healthy volunteers will be enrolled in this 6-session study. The first visit will be a&#xD;
      screening/orientation session. The next 5 visits will be (full day) outpatient sessions&#xD;
      taking place Monday through Friday during one week. All full day visits will be drug&#xD;
      administration sessions with subjects randomized to one of two groups. Group A will receive&#xD;
      two daily intramuscular injections of 8 mg morphine on Monday through Thursday and two&#xD;
      intramuscular injections of placebo on Friday. Group B will receive two daily intramuscular&#xD;
      injections of placebo on Monday through Thursday and two intramuscular injections of 8 mg&#xD;
      morphine on Friday. During the Monday through Friday sessions the painfulness of experimental&#xD;
      heat application and the area of skin tenderness (primary and secondary hyperalgesia) will be&#xD;
      assessed before and two times after the intramuscular injections. Heat will be applied by&#xD;
      using a computer controlled probe that applies heat (450 C/1130 F) on the thigh for 3 minutes&#xD;
      (Brief Thermal Sensitization model.)&#xD;
