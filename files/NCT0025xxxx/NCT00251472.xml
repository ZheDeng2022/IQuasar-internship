      This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized study in patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle of treatment will be 4 weeks in length. Patients will be radiologically evaluated&#xD;
      every 8 weeks for response. Patients will continue to receive study treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for the study, patients must fulfill all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed an IRB-approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or pathologically confirmed and documented locally&#xD;
             advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients may be Her2+ or Her2-.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as lesions that can be accurately&#xD;
             measured in at least one dimension as &gt;2 cm with conventional techniques or as &gt;1 cm&#xD;
             with spiral CT scan. Palpable disease is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be &gt;18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 (see Appendix I).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients' estimated life expectancy must be at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, including&#xD;
             taxane-containing regimens, provided this treatment was completed at least 12 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior radiation (except for radiation to the entire&#xD;
             pelvis), provided that less than 25% of the bone marrow has been treated, and the&#xD;
             patient has recovered from the acute toxic effects of treatment prior to trial&#xD;
             enrollment. Prior radiation treatment must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to enrollment. Lesions that have been irradiated in the advanced disease setting may&#xD;
             not be included as sites of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior hormonal, AI (aromatase inhibitors) therapy, or&#xD;
             immunotherapy. All hormonal, AI, and immunotherapy must have been terminated prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate liver function defined as: for patients with no liver&#xD;
             metastases, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and bilirubin&#xD;
             levels can be up to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). For patients with liver&#xD;
             metastases, ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels can be up to 2.5 times the ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate renal function defined as: creatinine &lt; 2mg/dL or&#xD;
             calculated creatinine clearance must be &gt; 40mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function, including absolute neutrophil count&#xD;
             (ANC) ³1500/µL, platelet count ³100,000/µL, and hemoglobin ³9 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must either be not of child bearing potential or have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration. Patients are considered not of&#xD;
             child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are&#xD;
             postmenopausal for at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraceptive measures&#xD;
             during study treatment and for a reasonable time thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan and&#xD;
             laboratory testing, and be accessible for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any of the following criteria will make the patient ineligible to participate in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic breast&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior Abraxane.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to taxanes or any of the components in&#xD;
             taxanes or Abraxane.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with serious intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a second primary malignancy, except carcinoma in situ of the cervix or&#xD;
             adequately treated nonmelanomatous carcinoma of the skin or other malignancy treated&#xD;
             &gt;5 years previously and with no evidence of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with only non-measurable disease, defined as all other lesions including&#xD;
             small lesions and truly non-measurable lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with parenchymal or leptomeningeal brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients planning to receive any concurrent therapy to treat metastatic or locally&#xD;
             advanced breast cancer during the study treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient who is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
