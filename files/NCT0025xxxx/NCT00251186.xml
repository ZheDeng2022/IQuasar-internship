  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical trial measuring the effectiveness of the combination of&#xD;
      Capecitabine and cetuximab for first line treatment of colorectal cancer in elderly patients&#xD;
      and/or those with multiple comorbidities unable to receive standard chemotherapy. This study&#xD;
      will be open approximately 2-3 years. Approximately 36 patients will be enrolled on this&#xD;
      study. The study will begin enrolling at The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, with 17 patients&#xD;
      in the first group. If more than 4 responses are noted, the accrual will continue to 36&#xD;
      patients throughout CINJOG.&#xD;

             colorectal cancer, not amenable to curative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior therapy for metastatic disease. Only 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin&#xD;
             chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting will be allowed and the last treatment was given&#xD;
             more then 6 months prior to metastatic disease development.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an ECOG performance score of 2 AND/OR Charlson comorbidity index of ³ 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be documented by the physician to be medically unable to tolerate&#xD;
             oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ³&#xD;
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as ³10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values showing adequate organ function prior to going on-study:&#xD;

               -  Platelets (PLT) 100 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin 9g/dl (with or without transfusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metabolic:Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total Bilirubin £ 1.5 x Upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST £ 3 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient should be able to ingest oral medication.&#xD;

             (e.g., unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease) for&#xD;
             which the patient was admitted to the hospital within the prior month. Patients with&#xD;
             stable respiratory, cardiac, hepatic or renal disease may participate subject to the&#xD;
             guidelines in the eligibility criteria above.&#xD;

             are postmenopausal. Men and women must be willing to use adequate birth control&#xD;
             measures to prevent contraception.&#xD;

             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy that specifically and directly targets the EGFR pathway.&#xD;
