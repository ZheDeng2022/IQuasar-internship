  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Sirolimus (Rapamune) in improving&#xD;
      the function of the transplant kidney, without any increase in the risk of acute rejection or&#xD;
      adverse side effects, compared with Tacrolimus (Prograf).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that Sirolimus, as one component of a long-term steroid-free immunosuppressive&#xD;
      regimen, will be effective in maintaining a low incidence of acute rejection and a short- and&#xD;
      long-term graft survival comparable to Tacrolimus with better graft function in the high-risk&#xD;
      African-American renal transplant population with immediate graft function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been repeatedly demonstrated that African-American renal allograft recipients have&#xD;
      worse graft outcomes when compared with Caucasians. This has been attributed to various&#xD;
      immunologic and non-immunologic factors, including a greater rate of acute rejection,&#xD;
      resistance to standard doses of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and corticosteroids, different&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, and noncompliance. It has therefore been&#xD;
      suggested that quadruple immunosuppression, including antilymphocyte antibodies for&#xD;
      induction, should be used in this high-risk population to improve graft survival. CNIs are&#xD;
      currently the mainstay of immunosuppressive regimens. Tacrolimus has been shown to be&#xD;
      significantly more effective than Cyclosporine A in preventing acute rejection. As a result,&#xD;
      Tacrolimus has become the CNI of choice in preventing acute rejection, and has produced&#xD;
      similar graft survival rates at one year, with higher creatinine clearances. However, there&#xD;
      is no report examining the efficacy of Sirolimus in improving renal function and its side&#xD;
      effect profile when compared with Tacrolimus in renal allograft recipients, particularly in&#xD;
      African-Americans with immediate graft function in a steroid-free environment.&#xD;
