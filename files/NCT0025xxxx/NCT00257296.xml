  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate a multi-faceted intimate partner violence (IPV)&#xD;
      screening/intervention targeting abused women who are seen for prenatal care in&#xD;
      obstetrics-gynecology clinics or general medical care in internal medicine clinics. The&#xD;
      intervention is based on our clinical experience and review of the literature which suggests:&#xD;
      1) IPV can vary and no one pattern exists for all women; 2) recovery from abuse usually&#xD;
      occurs over time and not necessarily immediately after it is first detected; 3) women have&#xD;
      gone down many different paths leading to an abusive relationship and there is no single path&#xD;
      to recovery; 4) for screening/interventions to be credible and ultimately disseminated they&#xD;
      must respond to the complexity of the patient stories clinicians see everyday when caring for&#xD;
      women experiencing IPV and 5) busy obstetricians/internists/clinicians are unlikely to&#xD;
      effectively screen and treat women experiencing IPV unless they are supported by other&#xD;
      personnel trained to address IPV as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention also is based on recommendations of IPV experts and on the theory of chronic&#xD;
      disease management that recognizes that the best outcomes are achieved when: 1) patients are&#xD;
      educated and given the support and skills to set their own goals and make their own choices;&#xD;
      2) multidisciplinary teams work better than programs focused only on physician behavior; 3)&#xD;
      active monitoring of progress is essential; 4) active coping styles using a range of&#xD;
      therapeutic modalities are available and 5) a stepped approach is utilized with those not&#xD;
      making progress or with more severe problems receiving the greatest intensity of services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening/intervention will be available to each abused woman for approximately three to&#xD;
      six months. Patients in the evaluation study will be surveyed at the following time points:&#xD;
      baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and for the partial cohort that starts early,&#xD;
      9 months. Additionally, a sample of nonabused women will be surveyed at baseline to serve as&#xD;
      a referent group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypotheses are, that compared to usual care, abused women receiving the&#xD;
      intervention will have a reduction in levels of IPV, decreases in depression and nonspecific&#xD;
      physical symptoms, increase in functional health status, increase in safety behaviors,&#xD;
      increase in help seeking for issues related to IPV, and reduction of general medical&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
