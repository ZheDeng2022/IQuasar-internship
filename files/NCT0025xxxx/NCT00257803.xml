  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin is normally given either rapidly into the vein (bolus) or put into an intravenous&#xD;
      bag and administered more slowly, after delivery of the baby by cesarean section. Both of&#xD;
      these methods are commonly used. To date there has been little research to demonstrate that&#xD;
      one method of giving oxytocin is better than another in women who are more likely to bleed&#xD;
      after delivery. The purpose of the study is to see whether a small bolus of oxytocin makes&#xD;
      the uterus contract better to reduce bleeding and decreases the need to give additional&#xD;
      oxytocin or more powerful drugs in women who are at risk for bleeding after delivery of their&#xD;
      baby by cesarean section.&#xD;

      Oxytocin is normally given either rapidly into the vein (bolus) or put into an intravenous&#xD;
      bag and administered more slowly, after delivery of the baby by cesarean section. Both of&#xD;
      these methods are commonly used. To date there has been little research to demonstrate that&#xD;
      one method of giving oxytocin is better than another in women who are more likely to bleed&#xD;
      after delivery. The purpose of the study is to see whether a small bolus of oxytocin makes&#xD;
      the uterus contract better to reduce bleeding and decreases the need to give additional&#xD;
      oxytocin or more powerful drugs in women who are at risk for bleeding after delivery of their&#xD;
      baby by cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who participate will be randomized (like a toss of a coin) to one of two groups.&#xD;
      Neither the woman nor the anesthesiologist nor the obstetrician will know which group they&#xD;
      are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one group, the women will receive a small injection of saline (salt water) directly into&#xD;
      the vein via their intravenous (bolus) after their baby is born. In the other group, the&#xD;
      women will receive a small injection of oxytocin directly into the vein via their intravenous&#xD;
      (bolus) after their baby is born.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have the standard amount of oxytocin given slowly (over a 30 minute period)&#xD;
      into the intravenous in their arm (infusion). The amount of oxytocin that is put into the&#xD;
      intravenous bag is a normal amount that would be given during cesarean section in any woman&#xD;
      not involved in the study and it will be started after the initial injection has been given.&#xD;
      The only difference between the two groups is that one group will have an extra dose of&#xD;
      oxytocin given directly into the vein via the intravenous while the other will have a saline&#xD;
      solution given directly into the vein via the intravenous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information that will be obtained during the study will include any decrease in blood&#xD;
      pressure or increase in heart rate at the time the saline or oxytocin is given directly into&#xD;
      the vein. The obstetrician will be asked to indicate how well the uterus is contracting and&#xD;
      they can ask the anesthesiologist to give more oxytocin or a more powerful drug if, in their&#xD;
      opinion, the uterus is not contracting well. This is the normal way that this is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the woman should feel dizzy (possibly secondary to low blood pressure) their&#xD;
      anesthesiologist will treat them the same way as they would if this happened to any woman who&#xD;
      is not part of the study. In other words, the anesthesiologist and obstetrician will treat&#xD;
      the woman the way they normally would whether the woman was part of the study or not.&#xD;
