      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is usually triggered by rupture of an&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque that then accumulates platelets and fibrin and leads to an occlusive&#xD;
      coronary thrombus. Clinical benefits obtained with revascularization of the infarct related&#xD;
      artery (IRA) depend on the achievement of four goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Early reperfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Full restoration of normal flow in the epicardial vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Full restoration of flow in the microcirculation, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Preservation of myocardial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reperfusion of the IRA can be achieved pharmacologically with intravenous thrombolytic&#xD;
      agents, or mechanically with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In Canada,&#xD;
      thrombolysis is the current standard of care in most hospitals, although there is mounting&#xD;
      evidence that primary PCI is superior, and many Canadian centres are shifting towards this&#xD;
      strategy. To offer primary PCI to community hospitals without on site cardiac catheterization&#xD;
      facilities, regional programs need to be present that allow rapid transfer to invasive&#xD;
      centers that offer this procedure round-the-clock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence suggests that angiographic and clinical results with primary PCI could be&#xD;
      further enhanced by facilitation with a pharmacological treatment given prior to the&#xD;
      procedure. The present proposal plans to examine the safety and efficacy of eptifibatide to&#xD;
      facilitate coronary angioplasty in STEMI in patients who present to centres with and without&#xD;
      on-site catheterization facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be a composite clinical endpoint including death, recurrent&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, recurrent unstable ischemia, or stroke, at 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include the percent thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 3&#xD;
      coronary flow after the PCI, myocardial perfusion score, individual clinical outcomes as&#xD;
      listed for the primary endpoint, resolution of ST-segment elevation, requirement for&#xD;
      subsequent revascularization, frequency of congestive heart failure (CHF), cardiogenic shock,&#xD;
      and Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina class.&#xD;
