  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and efficacy of TroVax in patients undergoing surgical&#xD;
      resection of colorectal cancer with liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TroVax potentially works by encouraging the immune system to react against the 5T4 protein on&#xD;
      the surface of bowel cancer cells. The immune system is then able to recognise 5T4 and kill&#xD;
      cells that carry it. The hope is that if tumour cells started to grow again after the main&#xD;
      tumour has been surgically removed, the immune system would be able to find and destroy them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer depends on the site of disease. The prognosis for&#xD;
      patients is poor although cure can be obtained if disease is localised and operable. Patients&#xD;
      with metastatic disease confined to the liver may achieve a cure rate of between 20% and 60%&#xD;
      if these metastases are resited, but there is a risk that micrometastatic disease will&#xD;
      persist post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TroVax consists of a highly attenuated vaccinia virus (modified vaccinia Ankara) containing&#xD;
      the human tumour associated antigen ST4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human oncofetal antigen 5T4 a surface glycoprotein expressed by placental tissue, but&#xD;
      also by a wide range of human carcinomas including most colorectal and renal carcinomas. 5T4&#xD;
      exhibits only low level expression in normal tissue and is thus a suitable target for immune&#xD;
      therapy of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate for the first time in man the immunological effects of the TroVax&#xD;
      vaccine locally within a target tumour and in peripheral blood. Tolerability of the vaccine&#xD;
      will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive 2 intramuscular injections of TroVax at a 2 week interval followed by&#xD;
      surgery 10 days later. Two further vaccinations are given at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
      Patients who show a response to the first four vaccinations are given 2 additional&#xD;
      vaccinations 20 and 28 weeks post surgery.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Colorectal adenocarcinoma with metastases confined only to the liver, histologically&#xD;
             proven and considered suitable for treatment by surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All toxic manifestations of previous treatment must have resolved. Exceptions to this&#xD;
             are alopecia or certain Grade 1 toxicities which in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             and Cancer Research UK should not exclude the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, systemic steroids, or chemotherapy&#xD;
             during the previous four weeks (six weeks for nitrosoureas and Mitomycin-C) prior to&#xD;
             treatment or during the course of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are high medical risks because of non-malignant systemic disease,&#xD;
             including those with active uncontrolled infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent serious infections within the 28 days prior to entry to the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current malignancies at other sites, with the exception of adequately treated&#xD;
             cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to be serologically positive for Hepatitis B, C or HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to vaccinations or egg proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of autoimmune disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of cerebral metastases&#xD;
