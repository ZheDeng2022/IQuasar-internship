  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have recently shown that the majority of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have&#xD;
      an abnormal lactulose breath test to suggest the presence of bacterial overgrowth of the&#xD;
      small intestine. In open label and double blind treatment of IBS subjects with antibiotics, a&#xD;
      dramatic improvement in clinical symptoms are observed. In these studies, the antibiotic&#xD;
      chosen was neomycin, which is noted to have an efficacy of 20-25% in normalizing the&#xD;
      lactulose breath test. A more efficacious antibiotic is needed. Therefore the aim of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the efficacy of rifaximin in normalizing the lactulose breath test in&#xD;
      IBS subjects with concomitant improvement in clinical symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Rome I criteria positive IBS subjects will be enrolled in the study after inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria (see below for description of inclusion and exclusion criteria) are&#xD;
           applied. There will be no preference given to constipation or diarrhea predominant forms&#xD;
           of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects will have a 7-day run in phase during which bowel movement consistency and&#xD;
           number will be recorded (see Appendix A for bowel movement record).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At the end of the 7-day run in, subjects will present after a 12 hour fast for a&#xD;
           lactulose breath test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prior to breath testing, subjects will be asked to fill out a symptom questionnaire&#xD;
           (Appendix B) based on the previous 7 days. Completion of the questionnaire is expected&#xD;
           prior to starting the breath test to prevent symptoms from the lactulose interfering&#xD;
           with the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjects will then provide a baseline breath sample after which 10g of lactulose will be&#xD;
           administered. Breath samples will then be obtained every 15 minutes for 180 minutes. The&#xD;
           test will be plotted graphically and sealed by the technician in an envelope. The&#xD;
           subject and the investigators will be blinded to the results of the test. See below for&#xD;
           details of the breath testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Subjects will then be randomized to receive either placebo or rifaximin (400 mg tid) for&#xD;
           10 days. Compliance will be tested by pill count.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. On completion of the treatment, bowel movement consistency and number will again be&#xD;
           recorded for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. 7 days after completion of the antibiotic or placebo, subjects will return for a follow&#xD;
           up questionnaire (Appendix C) and breath test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Subjects will then be sent a weekly questionnaire for a period of 2 months. During the&#xD;
           final 7 days of the 2 months, the bowel movement consistency and number will be tracked&#xD;
           again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject selection and enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be selected for all studies based on the Rome I criteria (36). This will be the&#xD;
      preferred method of identifying IBS patients to avoid pre-selecting patients with C- IBS. The&#xD;
      goal is to evaluate methane as the determinant of transit, not constipation or diarrhea&#xD;
      symptoms as through Rome II criteria (37). All subjects who are receiving a prokinetic drug&#xD;
      at the time of enrollment will need to have a washout period of 7 days before starting the&#xD;
      study protocol. Subjects will be identified through advertising in printed media and through&#xD;
      the clinical operations of the GI motility program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (38), diabetes (39), previous&#xD;
      intestinal surgery (40-42), cirrhosis (43-47), celiac disease, probiotic use, current proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitor use (48-54), recent antibiotic use (past 3 months), history of bowel&#xD;
      obstruction (55), narcotic use (56) or age greater than 65 years (57-63) will be excluded.&#xD;
      Most of these conditions are known to influence enteric bacteria levels. Women of&#xD;
      childbearing years will undergo pregnancy testing before participating in the study (See&#xD;
      below for details on the pregnancy test used). Women with positive pregnancy tests will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactulose Breath test (LBT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will present to the GI Motility clinic after a 12 hour fast. After a baseline breath&#xD;
      sample and ingestion of 10g-lactulose syrup (Inalco Spa, Milano, Italy, packaged by xactdose&#xD;
      Inc., South Beloit, IL), end-alveolar breath samples will be taken every 15 minutes for a&#xD;
      three hours. Breath samples will be analyzed using a model SC Quintron gas chromatograph&#xD;
      (Quintron Instrument Company, Milwaukee, WI) which determines breath hydrogen and methane&#xD;
      concentration in parts per million (ppm). Subjects will not be allowed to smoke or exercise&#xD;
      within 2 hours prior to performing the test (64). Methane exchanges quickly across the&#xD;
      alveolar membrane, so hyperventilation can falsely lower the concentration in breath.&#xD;
      Subjects will also be required to sit for the duration of the breath test such that exertion&#xD;
      will not increase alveolar clearance of this gas. If modest hyperventilation occurs, the&#xD;
      concentration of carbon dioxide in the breath sample will be used to correct for quality of&#xD;
      alveolar sampling. Note that in the clinical study breath test results will be blinded to the&#xD;
      investigator and patient to avoid influencing the interpretation of transit and serotonin&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three questionnaires will be used in this study. The first is a Stool Form and Frequency&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SFFQ). This questionnaire will be designed to determine the consistency of the&#xD;
      stool based on standard consistency plots. The second questionnaire is designed to determine&#xD;
      the duration and degree of IBS symptoms on visual analogue scores. This questionnaire is&#xD;
      specifically administered before the first breath test and is designed to determine baseline&#xD;
      symptoms and severity. The final questionnaire is a follow up questionnaire. This&#xD;
      questionnaire also plots the degree of symptoms based on visual analogue scores. However,&#xD;
      subjects are further asked to rank their degree of improvement based on percent improvement.&#xD;
      In these last two questionnaires, subjects are asked to consider their answers as a summary&#xD;
      of the preceding 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all human studies, pregnancy testing will be performed 1 week prior to initiating study.&#xD;
      The test will specifically be performed in women of childbearing years. This will involve a&#xD;
      blood draw for the quantitative determination of Beta HCG. The testing is an immunoassay for&#xD;
      determination of total Beta HCG (Abbott Axsym Test) and performed by Cedars-Sinai Clinical&#xD;
      Laboratory (Los Angeles, California).&#xD;
