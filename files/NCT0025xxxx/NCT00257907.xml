      This study will examine how the immune system responds to infection with Mycobacterium&#xD;
      tuberculosis bacteria (bacteria that cause tuberculosis) in order to better understand how&#xD;
      the germ produces infection and how the immune response might work to control the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only about one in 10 people infected by M. tuberculosis become sick, sometimes years or even&#xD;
      decades after exposure. It is not known why some people become sick and most do not, but the&#xD;
      immune system of people who never develop disease may be better able to control the bacteria.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the latent form of M. tuberculosis infection to further the&#xD;
      understanding of the immune mechanisms - particularly the role of certain white blood cells -&#xD;
      involved in the disease process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, family history of medical conditions, sexual history,&#xD;
      history of drug use, physical examination and blood tests, including a test for HIV. People&#xD;
      in Mali, West Africa, and in local health clinics in the United States may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the study, participants have blood tests and a tuberculin skin test (PPD&#xD;
      test), which indicates whether a person has been exposed to tuberculosis bacteria. For the&#xD;
      PPD, a tiny amount of liquid containing dead tuberculosis antigen is put under the skin of&#xD;
      the forearm with a needle. The antigen cannot cause infection or disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 days, participants have another blood test and the site of the tuberculin test is&#xD;
      examined for swelling that would indicate a positive result. Participants with a positive PPD&#xD;
      have a chest x-ray to check for tuberculosis disease. Those whose x-ray is also positive are&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study and referred to their doctor for evaluation and treatment. Those&#xD;
      whose x-ray is negative return to the clinic within 3 weeks of the tuberculin test to give&#xD;
      another blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants whose PPD is negative have a second tuberculin test 10 to 21 days later and&#xD;
      return 3 days after the test to determine if it is still negative or if it is positive. (Some&#xD;
      people who are negative after the first test may test positive after the second procedure.)&#xD;
      Those whose test is still negative end their participation in the study at that time.&#xD;
      Participants whose second PPD is positive have a chest x-ray as described above, and those&#xD;
      with a negative chest x-ray return in 3 weeks to donate one last blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the latent form of this infection, the&#xD;
      prevalence of which worldwide exceeds that of active disease. Our hypothesis is that in&#xD;
      latent tuberculosis antigen specific effector memory CD4+ T cells are responsible for the&#xD;
      generation of clinically measurable delayed type hypersensitivity and that central memory&#xD;
      CD4+T cells are not directly involved in this process. We base this idea on the assumption&#xD;
      that latent tuberculosis is a state of antigen persistence and that effector memory T cells&#xD;
      should be maintained as long as antigen/infection is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct this study in Mali, West Africa and local clinics in the U.S.&#xD;
      Tuberculosis affects 593/100,000(2) individuals in Mali and most have been exposed to the&#xD;
      disease. Additionally it would be important to evaluate the same parameters locally as latent&#xD;
      infection is one of the major factors for reactivation tuberculosis in this country. Patients&#xD;
      would be enrolled in 4 major groups: HIV-/TST- (Group A), HIV-/TST+ (Group B), HIV+/TST+(G&#xD;
      roup C) and HIV+/TST- (Group D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate this hypothesis we plan to enroll between 100 - 300 patients over the course of 2&#xD;
      years from both countries. Blood samples before and at predetermined time points after the&#xD;
      application of Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) will be obtained to determine the fraction&#xD;
      of CD4+ T cells which produce interferon gamma in response to stimulation with PPD with a&#xD;
      16hr antigen stimulation assay. Appropriate staining will be done to ascertain the phenotype&#xD;
      as well as cytokine production (Interferon gamma,( IFN gamma), Interleukin 2 (IL2) and Tumour&#xD;
      Necrosis Factor ( TNF)). Additionally lymphocyte proliferation will be studied using&#xD;
      5-(and-6)-carboxyflouorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conducting this study we hope to further the understanding of the immune mechanisms&#xD;
      involved, particularly mechanisms of T cell memory, which would provide insights into TB and&#xD;
      HIV pathogenesis. We also believe that understanding these mechanisms could lead towards&#xD;
      establishment of surrogates for immunity in TB vaccine studies, which could enhance vaccine&#xD;
      trial design. It might also help in understanding better the immunological dynamics of&#xD;
      tuberculosis co-infection in individuals with HIV infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health concern. One third of the world's population is&#xD;
      infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Two to 3 million people die every year of the&#xD;
      disease with 8-10 million new cases per year. It is projected that there will be 90 million&#xD;
      new cases and 30 million deaths over the next decade. For a disease, which we know to have&#xD;
      existed since 2400 BC, our understanding of its pathogenesis is incomplete, especially in&#xD;
      relation to the human immune response and the role of lymphocytes in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the latent form of this infection, the&#xD;
      prevalence of which worldwide exceeds that of active disease. Our hypothesis is that in&#xD;
