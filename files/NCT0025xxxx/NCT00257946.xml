      The objective of this study is to evaluate the use of 2 different types of biosynthetic&#xD;
      material for the repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The research question is: what is&#xD;
      the best material for repairing large congenital diaphragmatic hernias? The primary outcome&#xD;
      variable is recurrence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At birth, the estimated gestational age and birth weight will be recorded, as well as the&#xD;
      presence and type of other congenital anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to operation, the length of time from birth to repair will be recorded. To determine&#xD;
      the severity of physiologic compromise, the need and type of ventilator support as well as&#xD;
      the need and length of ECMO support will be recorded. The amount of time between ECMO&#xD;
      discontinuation and repair will be recorded. The respiratory support required at the time of&#xD;
      operation will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At operation, the size of the defect will be measured and recorded. The location (right&#xD;
      versus left) will be recorded and special notation will be recorded regarding any areas where&#xD;
      no diaphragmatic rim is present. The operative time and charges will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the operation, the length of ventilator support, time to feeds, hospital stay, and&#xD;
      hospital charges will be recorded. Post-operative complications such as bleeding&#xD;
      complications, pneumonia, sepsis, gastroesophageal reflux, early recurrence and bowel&#xD;
      obstruction will be recorded. Future operations and type of procedure will be recorded. If&#xD;
      future operations in the abdomen are required, the amount and severity of intraperitoneal&#xD;
      adhesions will be noted and recorded. Mortality will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge, commensurate with standard current clinical practice, all patients will&#xD;
      receive a follow-up appointment with a chest x-ray at 6 months and 1 year of life. After this&#xD;
      time, follow-up appointments will be made each year for the first 5 years of life and imaging&#xD;
      will be obtained on the basis of symptoms. Any further follow-up will be as needed for&#xD;
      symptoms. Oxygen requirements, findings at follow-up and future hospitalization will be&#xD;
      recorded, particularly looking at the presence or absence of hernia recurrence. The study&#xD;
      will mature and effectively close when all subjects have reached 5 year follow-up.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with a diagnosis of congenital&#xD;
             diaphragmatic hernia as proven by chest x-ray showing enteric contents in the thoracic&#xD;
             cavity will be considered. Those who have birth weight equal to or over 2.2 kilograms&#xD;
             and who are at or beyond 34 weeks gestation at the time of birth who survive until an&#xD;
             operation can be performed will be considered. At operation, the patients with&#xD;
             posterolateral diaphragmatic defects (Bockdalek Hernia) large enough to require&#xD;
             placement of a patch to recreate the diaphragm will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children diagnosed outside of the neonatal period will not be considered. Patients&#xD;
             with the less common anteromedial or substernal defect (Morgagni Hernia) will not be&#xD;
             included in the study as their physiology and rate of recurrence are incomparable to&#xD;
             common posterolateral, Bockdalek Hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Those patients under 2.2 kilograms and less than 34 weeks gestation have poor lung maturity&#xD;
        to compound their inherent difficulty with pulmonary parenchymal hypoplasia and pulmonary&#xD;
        vasculature hypertension making their chances of survival extremely low. Further&#xD;
        compounding their dismal circumstance, they are not candidates for salvage extracorporeal&#xD;
        membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Therefore, they will not be candidates for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The rare case requiring repair of the hernia while on ECMO support will not be included due&#xD;
        to the fact that this population has a very poor survival secondary to irreversible&#xD;
        pulmonary hypertension. Further, the operation is performed while the patient is&#xD;
        anticoagulated with heparin which is fraught with operative and post-operative bleeding.&#xD;
