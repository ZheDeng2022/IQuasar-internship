  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) very commonly&#xD;
      experience difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep. Studies have shown that daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness resulting from insufficient sleep can affect attention and learning. Therefore,&#xD;
      treating insomnia in children with ADHD may not only improve sleep, but it could potentially&#xD;
      improve ADHD symptoms as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to examine the effects of atomoxetine on ADHD-related&#xD;
      insomnia. Atomoxetine (StratteraÂ®) is a non-stimulant drug used to treat ADHD symptoms in&#xD;
      both children and adults, and there is evidence that it may also have a positive effect on&#xD;
      sleep in children with ADHD. During the study, participants will receive either atomoxetine&#xD;
      or placebo for a period of four weeks. We expect that the effects of atomoxetine on sleep&#xD;
      will differ from those of placebo, with atomoxetine having a greater effect on improving&#xD;
      sleep difficulties.&#xD;
