      Investigators at the University of Alabama in Birmingham in collaboration with investigators&#xD;
      from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta are evaluating the performance of three&#xD;
      commercial nucleic acid amplification tests for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and&#xD;
      Neisseria gonorrhoeae in pharyngeal and rectal swab specimens. Cultures for C. trachomatis&#xD;
      and N. gonorrhoeae are performed as additional reference tests. Study subjects are men and&#xD;
      women attending sexually transmitted disease (STD) and HIV care clinics in Birmingham,&#xD;
      Alabama, who report sexual behaviors that place them at risk for pharyngeal or rectal&#xD;
      sexually transmitted infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the latter part of the 1990's, testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae&#xD;
      infections was revolutionized by the introduction of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)&#xD;
      which achieve greater sensitivity than traditional culture methods by exponentially&#xD;
      replicating the nucleic acid of these organisms. The specimens collected for NAATs are easier&#xD;
      to transport and NAATs permit collection of less invasive specimens for testing (i.e. voided&#xD;
      urine or patient-collected vaginal swabs for women rather than urethral or endocervical&#xD;
      swabs). Despite their somewhat higher costs, these tests have been found to be preferred by&#xD;
      patients (because specimens can be collected less invasively), by clinicians (because of both&#xD;
      their ease of collection and increased sensitivity), and to permit expanded screening both in&#xD;
      traditional clinical settings and at outreach sites where testing has not typically been done&#xD;
      in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAATs have been cleared by FDA for testing of genital specimens (cervical and male urethral&#xD;
      swabs and urine), but the performance of NAATs has not been adequately evaluated for&#xD;
      diagnosis of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections occurring at rectal or pharyngeal&#xD;
      sites of sexual exposure. Increasing numbers of heterosexual individuals might be engaging in&#xD;
      orogenital or rectal sexual activity, especially adolescents and young adults who might view&#xD;
      such exposures as less risky with respect to pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases&#xD;
      (STD) than penile-vaginal intercourse. Pharyngeal and rectal exposures, often without use of&#xD;
      condoms, are relatively common among MSM. Recent demonstration of resurgent sexually&#xD;
      transmitted diseases and unsafe sexual practices among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM),&#xD;
      including those who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), provides an&#xD;
      especially strong public health imperative to the need for careful evaluation of NAATs with&#xD;
      pharyngeal and rectal specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to compare the performance of the three NAATs that are&#xD;
      available commercially to test pharyngeal and rectal specimens for C. trachomatis and N.&#xD;
      gonorrhoeae infections with culture, the current method of choice, and with each other. In&#xD;
      order to enroll adequate numbers of individuals with such infections, the study will be&#xD;
      conducted during a 3-year period in a STD clinic and two HIV care clinics located in&#xD;
      Birmingham, AL. Enrollment will be confined to individuals who are at high risk for genital&#xD;
      C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae infection, or who give a history of orogenital or rectal&#xD;
      sexual exposures. An effort will be made to balance enrollment of heterosexual individuals&#xD;
      and MSM, but resource limitations require that sample sizes be based on combining these&#xD;
      subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No adequate criterion-standard for pharyngeal or rectal infections exists due to the&#xD;
      probable, but poorly defined, low sensitivity of the current standard, culture. Fortunately,&#xD;
      the 3 NAATs employ different C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae molecular targets and methods&#xD;
      of nucleic acid amplification. By including all 3 NAATs plus culture in the study,&#xD;
      combinations of the results of culture and a NAAT or of two NAATs can be utilized to take&#xD;
      advantage of the likely independence of testing errors among truly uninfected subjects to&#xD;
      construct more satisfactory criterion standards for infection for the purpose of estimating&#xD;
      and comparing their sensitivities and specificities. A secondary aim of the study will be to&#xD;
      compare this methodological approach, utilizing a traditional statistical and clinical&#xD;
      epidemiological approach, with alternative methods that have been more widely used but&#xD;
      strongly criticized by statisticians and clinical epidemiologists and with newer methods&#xD;
      designed to meet these criticisms and to be more efficient than the traditional statistical&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
