  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outcome of brain injury (physical or stroke) may be related to a brain electrical&#xD;
      phenomenon known as Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD). This is a brief cessation of&#xD;
      function in a local region of brain tissue. It has been hypothesized that CSD may occur after&#xD;
      brain injury and may expand the damage to adjacent brain areas. Our aim is to detect CSD by&#xD;
      means of intracranial electrodes in patients with brain injuries and asses how these events&#xD;
      alter the outcome of the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of mass neuronal firing and neuronal and glial&#xD;
      depolarisation which propagates through grey matter in the central nervous system in response&#xD;
      to a pathologic stimulus, at a rate of between 1 and 5 mm per minute. First described by Le√£o&#xD;
      in 1944 as a sudden depression of ECoG amplitude spreading across the cortex of the rabbit&#xD;
      (Leao, A. A. P. 1944), CSD can be elicited in experimental animals by chemical, electrical,&#xD;
      and mechanical stimuli, with varying degrees of ease. CSD provoked in healthy, normally&#xD;
      perfused neural tissue does not induce persistent metabolic stress or cellular damage, and&#xD;
      indeed such induction of CSD in animal experiments may confer protection against the adverse&#xD;
      effects of a subsequent ischaemic insult (Kobayashi, S. et al. 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal models of focal cerebral ischaemia, usually induced by occlusion of the middle&#xD;
      cerebral artery, a spontaneous phenomenon occurs around the periphery of the core territory,&#xD;
      with electrophysiological features essentially identical with CSD, and similar capacity to&#xD;
      propagate across cerebral cortex. Designated &quot;peri-infarct depolarisation&quot; (PID), this event&#xD;
      is associated with infarct expansion, or recruitment of at-risk cortical territory into the&#xD;
      expanding core, and has been shown capable of causing this expansion, in the absence of&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention. Indeed it has been hypothesized that glutamate release may be&#xD;
      involved in PID generation, and that excitotoxicity may accomplish detrimental effects via&#xD;
      this route (Hossmann, K. A. 1994), (Obrenovitch, T. P. and Urenjak, J. 1997). Some&#xD;
      experimental neuroprotection treatments for stroke act to decrease the incidence of PID&#xD;
      (Iijima, T. et al. 1992;Chen, Q. et al. 1993;Busch, E. et al. 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In traumatic and ischaemic (especially in middle cerebral artery occlusion and aneurysmal&#xD;
      subarachnoid haemorrhage) brain injury in humans, a phase of delayed deterioration often&#xD;
      associated with severe and refractory brain swelling develops between 2 and 5 days after the&#xD;
      initial ictus, and is associated with poor or fatal outcome. The cause and mechanism of this&#xD;
      deterioration remain poorly understood, and the possibility exists that CSD/PID events might&#xD;
      contribute to deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, CSD or PID have been reported in only ten human subjects in two papers (Mayevsky, A.&#xD;
      et al. 1996; Strong, A. J. et al. 2002). Strong et al. reported that transient ECoG&#xD;
      suppressions suggestive of depolarisations are common - but by no means universal - after&#xD;
      brain injury in humans. Sub-dural ECoG electrode strips were placed in 14 patients who had&#xD;
      undergone craniotomy for trauma or intracranial hemorrhage; monitoring was for up to 60 h&#xD;
      following the injury. Five of these patients (36%) showed patterns of ECoG depression&#xD;
      consistent with PID/CSD in brain regions adjacent to the primary injury.&#xD;
