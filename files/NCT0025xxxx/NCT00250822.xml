      To determine the primary end point response rate of the combinations of Gemcitabine and&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin (Gem-Ox) in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with&#xD;
      platelet counts greater 100,000 per microliter in a single arme Phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the toxicity profile of this regimen To determine the effect of this treatment&#xD;
      on patient survival, time to treatment failure, time ot progression, time to response.&#xD;

      The treatment plan is a two-step design. Day 1 the pt will receive Gemcitabine IV and Day 2&#xD;
      the pt will receive Oxaliplatin IV. This treatment cycle is repeated approximately every 28&#xD;
      days. Subsequent treatment cycle dosages are based on toxicity diaries and lab work results.&#xD;
      CT scans are repeated every 2 treatment cycles. Continuation in the study is dependent upon&#xD;
      tumor response.&#xD;
