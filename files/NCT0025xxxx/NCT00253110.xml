      The purpose of the study is to compare the time to relapse in patients with schizophrenia and&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorders receiving risperidone or haloperidol (antipsychotic medications)&#xD;
      for at least 1 year.&#xD;

      Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that causes changes in a person's perception,&#xD;
      thoughts, and behaviour. In schizophrenics, the most common symptoms are positive symptoms&#xD;
      (delusions and hallucinations), negative symptoms (avoiding social situations, lack of&#xD;
      feeling or expression), and disorganized symptoms (confusion in thinking and speech).&#xD;
      Schizoaffective disorder is different from schizophrenia, although it may be misdiagnosed as&#xD;
      this illness. Schizoaffective disorder is a mental illness distinguished by a combination of&#xD;
      a thought disorder (abnormal thinking or psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or&#xD;
      delusions) and a mood disorder (clinical depression or manic component). Manic symptoms&#xD;
      include, but are not limited to an overinflated self esteem, increased physical agitation,&#xD;
      excessively poor judgment, being easily distracted, and an increased irritability and energy&#xD;
      level. This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled study comparing the&#xD;
      time to relapse and the incidence of relapse in patients with schizophrenia and&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder being treated with risperidone or haloperidol. The long-term safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of risperidone and haloperidol are also compared. The study is composed of&#xD;
      two phases: a 1-week baseline period and a double-blind treatment period. During the baseline&#xD;
      period, the doses of risperidone and haloperidol are gradually increased to 4 mg/day for&#xD;
      risperidone and 10 mg/day for haloperidol. During the first 4 weeks of double-blind&#xD;
      treatment, dosage adjustments can be made in the range of 2 - 8 mg/day for risperidone and 5&#xD;
      - 20 mg/day for haloperidol, based on clinical evaluations of the patient. The double-blind&#xD;
      treatment continues at that dose until the last patient entering the study completes 1 year&#xD;
      of treatment or for a maximum of 112 weeks. The primary measure of effectiveness is the time&#xD;
      to relapse, which is defined using six criteria that indicate the patient's illness is no&#xD;
      longer under control (for example, psychiatric hospitalization). Additional efficacy testing&#xD;
      conducted includes the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS), a&#xD;
      rating scale that measures the symptoms of schizophrenia; the Clinical Global Impressions&#xD;
      (CGI), a rating system used to evaluate the overall and severity of clinical change in a&#xD;
      patient with various diseases affecting the brain; and the Quality of Life Interview (QOLI),&#xD;
      a global measure of satisfaction with life. Safety evaluations include the incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events, results of clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis),&#xD;
      measurements of vital signs and body weight, physical examination and electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
      findings, and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale used to measure&#xD;
      effects of antipsychotic medications on motor functions of the patient. The study hypothesis&#xD;
      is that risperidone will be more effective in delaying relapse than haloperidol in patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Risperidone tablets, taken orally, starting&#xD;
      at 1 mg/day; increasing to 4 mg/day (Week 1). Haloperidol tablets, taken orally, starting at&#xD;
      2 mg/day; increasing to 10 mg/day (Week 1). After Week 1, dosage may be adjusted (2 - 8&#xD;
      mg/day risperidone; 5 - 20 mg/day haloperidol). Treatment duration &gt;=52 weeks.&#xD;
