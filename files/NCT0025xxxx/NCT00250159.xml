    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate and gather information in patients with genetic causes of too much&#xD;
      androgen (male-like hormone) in order to better understand the effects of too much androgen&#xD;
      and describe problems associated with it. Too much androgen in childhood, if untreated,&#xD;
      results in rapid growth and early puberty with early cessation of growth and short stature in&#xD;
      adulthood. Too much androgen in adulthood may result in infertility, and women may have&#xD;
      excess facial hair, acne and a more male-like appearance. Excess androgen may also affect&#xD;
      mood and behavior and possibly the secretion of other hormones, such as insulin. Two genetic&#xD;
      diseases that result in early childhood androgen excess are congenital adrenal hyperplasia&#xD;
      (CAH) and familial male-limited precocious puberty (FMPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with known or suspected CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, 11- hydroxylase&#xD;
      deficiency, or 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency and males with known or&#xD;
      suspected FMPP may be eligible for this study. Patients with both classic and non-classic CAH&#xD;
      are eligible, and patients with androgen excess of unknown cause may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood tests for analysis of hormones, blood chemistries including blood sugar&#xD;
           and cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test for patients with elevated insulin levels. For this test, a&#xD;
           catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the patient's arm. The patient drinks a&#xD;
           sugar-containing fluid and blood samples are collected through the catheter at intervals&#xD;
           starting with drinking the solution, and then 30, 60 and 120 minutes after drinking the&#xD;
           solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour urine collection to measure hormone levels in the urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DNA testing for patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency to help identify the type of&#xD;
           genetic mutation responsible for the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-ray of the left hand to measure bone age in growing children. The x-ray is used to&#xD;
           determine how far into puberty the child is and how much growth potential is left in the&#xD;
           bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pelvic ultrasound in females and testicular ultrasound in males to evaluate the size&#xD;
           and development of the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive and psychological tests, including an IQ test and evaluation of memory,&#xD;
           achievement and behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other tests and evaluations based on medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The schedule for these procedures varies. In a part of the study involving only patients with&#xD;
      CAH, growing children are evaluated twice (once in childhood and once after reaching adult&#xD;
      height), and adults are evaluated once. In another part of the study involving patients with&#xD;
      CAH and FMPP, growing children are seen twice a year, and adults and children who have&#xD;
      reached adult height may be seen annually. Additional visits may be scheduled if medically&#xD;
      indicated. In this part of the study, females are asked to keep a record of their periods&#xD;
      after their first menstrual cycle.&#xD;

      Androgen excess in childhood results in pseudoprecocious puberty, accelerated childhood&#xD;
      growth with premature epiphyseal fusion, adult short stature, and unknown metabolic and&#xD;
      psychological perturbations. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and familial male-limited&#xD;
      precocious puberty (FMPP) are two genetic diseases that result in early childhood androgen&#xD;
      excess, and CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of hyperandrogenism&#xD;
      in childhood. This protocol will elucidate a comprehensive phenotypic profile for patients&#xD;
      with CAH and FMPP. Data will be collected in a large cohort of patients regarding growth and&#xD;
      development, hormonal and metabolic factors and psychological characteristics. This protocol&#xD;
      will allow investigators to compare patients with androgen excess of different etiologies,&#xD;
      elucidate androgen-mediated and disease-specific phenotypic characterizations, and allow the&#xD;
      investigators to acquire further knowledge for use in the design of future therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
