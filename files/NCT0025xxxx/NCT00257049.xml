    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of levofloxacin, an&#xD;
      antibiotic, compared with ceftriaxone sodium or cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of adults&#xD;
      with pneumonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group, multicenter study to determine the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of levofloxacin (488 mg once daily by mouth or 500 mg administered&#xD;
      intravenously once daily for 7 - 14 days) compared with ceftriaxone sodium (1 - 2 grams&#xD;
      administered into a vein or muscle once daily or in divided doses twice daily for 7 - 14&#xD;
      days) or cefuroxime axetil (500 mg by mouth twice daily for 7 - 14 days) in adults with&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia. The study consists of 4 visits: one visit for screening and&#xD;
      enrollment, and 3 visits for assessment of safety and effectiveness (one visit on Day 2 - 4&#xD;
      [on-therapy], one visit [post-therapy] 5 - 7 days after the last dose of the study drug, and&#xD;
      one visit [post-study] 21 - 28 days after the last dose of the study drug). The total&#xD;
      duration of patient participation in the study is approximately 6 weeks. Levofloxacin is an&#xD;
      antibacterial agent used for the treatment of many types of infections in adults. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of levofloxacin with other&#xD;
      frequently used antibiotics (ceftriaxone sodium or cefuroxime axetil) in the treatment of&#xD;
      adults with pneumonia acquired in the community. The primary efficacy assessment is the&#xD;
      clinical response 5 - 7 days after the last dose of study drug, (categorized as cured,&#xD;
      improved, or failed) based upon changes in signs and symptoms, and changes in x-ray findings,&#xD;
      Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, physical examination, and laboratory tests)&#xD;
      are performed throughout the study. Cost-effectiveness is also assessed for the study drugs.&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that treatment with levofloxacin will be at least as effective as&#xD;
      ceftriaxone sodium or cefuroxime axetil in treating patients with pneumonia acquired in the&#xD;
      community, and that it will be well tolerated. Levofloxacin 488 mg by mouth once daily or 500&#xD;
      mg intravenously once daily; ceftriaxone sodium (1 - 2 grams administered into a vein or&#xD;
      muscle once daily or in divided doses twice daily); or cefuroxime axetil (500 mg by mouth&#xD;
      twice daily). Treatment duration is 7 - 14 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of pneumonia based upon clinical signs and symptoms of a lower respiratory&#xD;
             tract infection including at least 2 of the following: fever, cough, greenish-yellow&#xD;
             mucus produced on coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, or evidence of decreased&#xD;

          -  has chest x-ray findings consistent with acute pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  previously received antibiotics for pneumonia if the duration of therapy was &lt;= 24&#xD;
             hours, or if greater than 24 hours, but without improvement or stabilization with that&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
