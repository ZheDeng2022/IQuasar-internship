    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, open-label, parallel-group study is to determine how the body&#xD;
      absorbs and eliminates mesalamine following administration of either 30 mg/kg/day, 60&#xD;
      mg/kg/day or 90 mg/kg/day as 400 mg delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours of 28 days&#xD;
      to children and adolescents with active ulcerative colitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by diffuse,&#xD;
      continuous inflammation of the colon. Recent estimates suggest that approximately 17,000&#xD;
      children between 5 and 17 years of age in the U.S. are diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
      Estimates of average age at onset in children vary, although 80-90% of patients are 9 years&#xD;
      of age or older when symptoms develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asacol is a delayed-release tablet formulation designed to deliver mesalamine (also known as&#xD;
      mesalazine) at a pH â‰¥ 7.0. This property results in release of the drug in the terminal ileum&#xD;
      and beyond. Physiologic factors such as the pH of the surrounding medium, transit times in&#xD;
      the intestinal regions of interest, and the rate and extent of absorption and metabolism&#xD;
      govern Asacol drug release and delivery, which in turn influence the pharmacokinetic profile&#xD;
      of the delivered drug. These physiologic factors and their effect on Asacol pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      have been studied in adults, but corresponding studies in children have not been performed.&#xD;
      However, relevant studies describing the gastrointestinal pH; transit times; and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic aspects of drug absorption, metabolism, and excretion in pediatric patients&#xD;
      (relative to adults) provide reasons to expect that the performance characteristics of Asacol&#xD;
      in the pediatric population will be similar to those measured in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a compassionate-use study that included 66 children between the ages of 3 and 16 years,&#xD;
      the safety profile of long-term mesalamine therapy (10 to 93 mg/kg/day) was similar to that&#xD;
      observed among adult patients enrolled in the study. In addition, in a retrospective study of&#xD;
      732 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (153 of whom were treated with&#xD;
      mesalamine), D'Agata, et al. concluded that mesalamine was safe and well tolerated when used&#xD;
      long term at doses ranging from 13 to 111 mg/kg/day. Although few clinical studies of&#xD;
      mesalamine have been performed in children, pediatric gastroenterologists use mesalamine to&#xD;
      treat children with inflammatory bowel disease, and doses higher than those proposed for this&#xD;
      study (up to 100 mg/kg/day) have been recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide information about the pharmacokinetics of mesalamine and its major&#xD;
      metabolite in children being treated with Asacol for mildly to moderately active ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis. It was designed to meet the expectations outlined in a Written Request issued by the&#xD;
      FDA, as well as regulatory requirements to study the weight-based equivalent of 4.8 g/day.&#xD;
      The age-appropriate dose formulation, the 400 mg tablet, will be used, and patients will be&#xD;
      dosed every 12 hours, since this regimen is considered more convenient for pediatric patients&#xD;
      and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this open-label, randomized, 4-week parallel-group study in pediatric patients,&#xD;
      patients will be stratified by age (5-8 years and 9-17 years), and randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of 3 dose levels (30 mg/kg/day, 60 mg/kg/day, and 90 mg/kg/day) in the manner described in&#xD;
      Section 3.5.1. Patients weighing less than 20 kg will not be assigned to the 30 mg/kg group,&#xD;
      and patients weighing more than 60 kg will not be assigned to the 90 mg/kg group, due to&#xD;
      dosing concerns. A total of 48 patients will be enrolled (8/treatment group/age stratum),&#xD;
      with the expectation that 36 (6/treatment group/age stratum) will complete.&#xD;
