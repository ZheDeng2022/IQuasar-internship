    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the nature and degree of the toxicity of weekly dosing&#xD;
      of topotecan in escalating dose levels by cohorts of 3-6 patients in combination with a fixed&#xD;
      dose of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to determine the activity of weekly topotecan and pegylated&#xD;
      liposomal doxorubicin in advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topotecan is a semisynthetic analogue of camptothecin. Like its parent compound camptothecin,&#xD;
      topotecan is a specific inhibitor of topoisomerase-I. Topoisomerase-I facilitates DNA&#xD;
      replication by inducing reversible single strand breaks thereby relieving the torsional&#xD;
      strain which occurs ahead of the moving replication fork during DNA replication. Topotecan&#xD;
      binds to the topoisomerase-I DNA complex and prevents relegation of the single strand breaks&#xD;
      resulting in double strand DNA breaks. The cytotoxic action of topotecan is proportional to&#xD;
      the cellular level of topoisomerase-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic which has a wide range of clinical activities. The&#xD;
      mechanism of cytotoxicity and the exact intracellular target remains controversial. The bulk&#xD;
      of intracellular drug is intranuclear much of which is intercalated in the DNA. Although DNA&#xD;
      intercalation has been felt to be the principle cytotoxic mechanism, more recent evidence&#xD;
      suggests inhibition of topoisomerase-II may play a more important role. Additionally, other&#xD;
      cytotoxic actions including helicase inhibition have recently been noted. Pegylated liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin (Doxil) is a polyethylene glycol pegylated liposomal encapsulation of&#xD;
      doxorubicin. This results in an alteration of the pharmacokinetics in comparison to the&#xD;
      parent compound. Specifically there is a prolonged circulation time, reduced clearance, a&#xD;
      smaller volume of distribution, and limited uptake by the reticuloendothelial system. In&#xD;
      animals using ovarian xenografts in nude mice, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin has resulted&#xD;
      in a greater tumor to normal tissue drug uptake and an improved therapeutic index. Following&#xD;
      phase I studies, Doxil has recently been studied in a phase II study of heavily pre-treated&#xD;
      ovarian carcinoma patients with a response rate of 25.7%. This level of activity meets or&#xD;
      exceeds other second-line agents currently available. In the recent phase II study, a dose of&#xD;
      50 mg/m2 every 3 weeks was utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan given as 5 daily infusions is associated with significant myelosuppression and poor&#xD;
      patient acceptance. Non hematologic toxicities are usually mild and not dose-limiting.&#xD;
      Although the 5 day schedule can be inconvenient, the relative lack of acute toxicity still&#xD;
      makes topotecan a good candidate for out-patient chemotherapy in selected patients. Although&#xD;
      the impact of bone marrow suppression can be minimized by the use of cytokines, these 5 day&#xD;
      regimens have required substantial dose reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the bone marrow toxicity seen with topotecan and the poor patient acceptance of a&#xD;
      five day schedule, there has been interest in the development of an effective alternate&#xD;
      treatment regimen using topotecan. Results from preclinical studies suggest that repeated&#xD;
      administration of topotecan is necessary for its activity. A phase I study evaluating the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of weekly bolus topotecan as a second line agent in relapsed ovarian&#xD;
      cancer resulted in a maximum tolerated dose of 5 mg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase II study in relapsed ovarian cancer supports the use of weekly topotecan at a dose of&#xD;
      3 - 4.0 mg/m2/week. Toxicities on this weekly regime have included, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia,&#xD;
      anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue and GI toxicity, each occurred following less than 1% of&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of topoisomerase-I and topoisomerase-II inhibitors is an attractive strategy&#xD;
      for cancer chemotherapy. A phase II study evaluated the combination of pegylated liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin 30mg/m2/week with topotecan 1 mg/m2 IV for 5 consecutive days given every 28&#xD;
      days. Twelve patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer were treated. Partial response&#xD;
      was observed in three patients and four patients had stable disease of the ten patients&#xD;
      evaluated for response. Toxicities included a higher percentage of bone marrow toxicity&#xD;
      (grade III/IV neutropenia, grade III/IV thrombocytopenia) other toxicities included alopecia&#xD;
      and diarrhea grade II/III. The authors concluded that the combination of topotecan and&#xD;
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is active in the treatment of platinum resistant ovarian&#xD;
      cancer. However, myelosuppression required dose reductions in nearly half the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned earlier, a weekly regimen of topotecan has allowed for more convenient&#xD;
      administration over more prolonged and more complex administration schedules. The current&#xD;
      study will evaluate the tolerability of a weekly intravenous schedule of topotecan in&#xD;
      combination with a standard dose of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
      Due to the addition of the pegylated liposomal doxorubicin to a weekly schedule of topotecan,&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics data will also be obtained.&#xD;
