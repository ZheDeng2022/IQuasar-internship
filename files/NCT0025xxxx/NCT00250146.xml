  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of minute doses of gluten in the&#xD;
      treatment of celiac disease, a disorder characterized by permanent intolerance to dietary&#xD;
      gluten.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of celiac disease (CD) is based on the complete avoidance of gluten-containing&#xD;
      products in the diet. However it is not known whether tiny amounts of gluten are harmful for&#xD;
      patients on long-term treatment. This is an important issue, as even a strict gluten-free&#xD;
      diet (GFD) is usually contaminated by traces of gluten, e.g. in wheat starch and processed&#xD;
      food. The aim of this study is to investigate the toxicity of the prolonged ingestion of&#xD;
      gluten traces in treated CD patients. This is a prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind&#xD;
      study. Patients are adults with biopsy-proven CD on treatment with the GFD for at least 2&#xD;
      years. During the study period their background daily gluten intake is kept lower than 5 mg.&#xD;
      After baseline evaluation, patients continue their GFD and are assigned to ingest 0 mg, 10 mg&#xD;
      or 50 mg of daily gluten (incorporated in a capsule) for 90 days. The following evaluations&#xD;
      are performed both at baseline and after the micro-challenge: clinical, serological&#xD;
      (anti-transglutaminase and antigliadin antibodies), and small intestine histology.&#xD;
