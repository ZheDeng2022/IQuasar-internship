  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of the drugs&#xD;
      capecitabine and docetaxel in the treatment of cervical cancer. Capecitabine is approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for the treatment of breast and colon cancer. Docetaxel is approved in the treatment&#xD;
      of breast and lung cancer. The use of capecitabine and docetaxel in this study for the&#xD;
      treatment of cervical cancer is considered investigational. Eligible subjects will take the&#xD;
      drug capecitabine (Xeloda) by mouth twice a day every 12 hours, for fourteen consecutive days&#xD;
      followed by a 7 day rest period. Subjects will also receive the drug docetaxel (Taxotere)&#xD;
      intravenously (in the vein) every three weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no evidence of new lesions documented by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart. Normalization of CA125, if elevated at baseline, is required for ovarian carcinoma studies. Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest dimensions (LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD. There can be no unequivocal progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions. Documentation by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart is required.</description>

    <description>Progression free survival-will be calculated from the date of first treatment to the date of disease progression or the date of death or the cut-off date using Kaplan Meier methods.&#xD;
Overall survival-will be calculated from the date of first treatment until death or the cut-off date using Kaplan Meier methods.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically proven stage IVB, recurrent or persistent squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix which is not&#xD;
             amenable to curative treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age greater than or equal to 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as at least&#xD;
             one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest&#xD;
             dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must be greater than or equal to 20 mm when&#xD;
             measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain x-ray, CT, and MRI, or&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 10 mm when measured by spiral CT. Biopsy confirmation is&#xD;
             required if the lesion measures &lt; 30 mm or if the treating physician determines it is&#xD;
             clinically indicated. Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to&#xD;
             assess response on this protocol as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
             Tumors (RECIST). This lesion should be the one that was biopsied if one was performed.&#xD;
             Patients with tumors within and outside a previously irradiated field should have the&#xD;
             lesion outside of the irradiated area preferentially designated as the &quot;target&quot;&#xD;
             lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have adequate:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hematologic function: ANC greater than or equal to 1500/mm3; Platelets greater&#xD;
                  than or equal to 100,000/mm3; Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8.0 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal function: Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.2 mg/dl. Patients with a&#xD;
                  serum creatinine greater than 1.2 mg/dl but less than 1.5 mg/dl must have a&#xD;
                  24-hour creatinine clearance determination of &gt; 50 cc/min to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic function: Total Bilirubin must be within normal limits. Transaminases&#xD;
                  (SGOT and/or SGPT) may be up to 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
                  if alkaline phosphatase is less than or equal to ULN, or alkaline phosphatase may&#xD;
                  be up to 4 x ULN if transaminases are less than or equal to ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have a GOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have recovered from the effects of surgery, radiation therapy, or&#xD;
             chemoradiotherapy. At least six weeks must have elapsed from the last administration&#xD;
             of chemoradiotherapy, and at least three weeks must have elapsed from the last&#xD;
             administration of radiation therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have signed an approved informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must be free of clinically active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective contraception&#xD;
             while on treatment until they reach menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with bilateral hydronephrosis which cannot be alleviated by ureteral stents&#xD;
             or percutaneous drainage. Patients with a serum creatinine greater than 1.2 mg/dl but&#xD;
             less than 1.5 mg/dl with a 24-hour creatinine clearance determination of &lt; 50 cc/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients previously treated with chemotherapy except when used concurrently with&#xD;
             radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, drugs&#xD;
             formulated with polysorbate 80, fluoropyrimidine therapy or 5-FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who are pregnant or lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with craniospinal metastases or history of craniospinal metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a concomitant malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with a prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanoma skin cancer) who have&#xD;
             had any evidence of disease within the last 5 years or whose prior malignancy&#xD;
