  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The success of kidney transplantation is hampered by the shortage of organs. One attractive&#xD;
      strategy is the use of kidneys from living donors. During the donor operation the kidney&#xD;
      artery, kidney vein and ureter have to be interrupted as far as possible from the kidney to&#xD;
      have sufficient length for the reconnection of these structures in the transplant operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adrenal gland is situated at the upper pole of each kidney. While the arterial supply is&#xD;
      accomplished by many small vessels, the venous drainage is only through one vein. On the&#xD;
      right side the adrenal vein empties directly into the inferior vena cava (the large vessel&#xD;
      transporting blood from the lower body to the heart). In contrast, on the left side the&#xD;
      adrenal vein empties into the kidney vein, which in turn drains to the inferior vana cava.&#xD;
      Due to these anatomical differences a left-sided removal of a kidney always necessitates an&#xD;
      interruption of the left adrenal vein, while a right-sided kidney removal does not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the venous drainage of the left adrenal gland is closed during living kidney donation, the&#xD;
      gland is most likely functionally impaired. This can be compared to a right-sided kidney&#xD;
      donation, where the adrenal vein is left intact. These comparisons are performed by adrenal&#xD;
      function tests before, one week after and one month after kidney donation. These function&#xD;
      tests consist of blood values drawn after stimulation with a hormone drug.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Due the lack of suitable donor organs a large proportion of kidney transplantations is now&#xD;
      performed from living donors. In the year 2002 the number of living donors surpassed the&#xD;
      number of cadaveric donors in Switzerland (Swisstransplant, Swiss Transplant Society 2005).&#xD;
      Kidney grafts from living donors have superior long-term outcome (Hariharan S, N Engl J Med&#xD;
      2000). At the University Hospital Zurich 28 of the 84 kidney transplantations performed in&#xD;
      the year 2004 were from living donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During living donor nephrectomy the renal artery and renal vein are transected as far away&#xD;
      from the kidney as possible, to ensure an adequate vessel length for the subsequent&#xD;
      transplantation procedure. The arterial supply of the adrenal glands is accomplished by&#xD;
      several small vessels (ca. 5-15), while the venous drainage is usually dependent on a single&#xD;
      vein. While the right-sided adrenal vein drains directly into the inferior vena cava (IVC),&#xD;
      the left-sided adrenal vein drains into the renal vein. Variants are relatively rare and&#xD;
      occur in 5% of cases (Sebe P, Surg Radiol Anat 2002). Therefore, during donor nephrectomy of&#xD;
      the left kidney the adrenal vein is transected, while this is not necessary on the right&#xD;
      side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question addressed in this clinical trial is whether left-sided donor nephrectomy affects&#xD;
      the left adrenal gland. This might be compensated immediately by the contralateral gland or&#xD;
      it might lead to a measurable functional adrenal deficit. Such an adrenal insufficiency could&#xD;
      be detrimental to the immediate postoperative course. The intermediate-term outcome of the&#xD;
      adrenal glands is also of interest, as an impairment of the left adrenal gland will lead to a&#xD;
      hypertrophy of the contralateral gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few scientific publications have addressed these questions. There are case reports of acute&#xD;
      intra- and postoperative adrenal insufficiency in patients undergoing nephrectomy with&#xD;
      adrenalectomy (Cassinello Ogea C, Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim 2002, Henrich WL, Urology 1976,&#xD;
      Messiant F, Ann Fr Anesth Reanim 1993, Safir MH, Geriatr Nephrol Urol 1998). A small&#xD;
      prospective study in patients undergoing radical nephrectomy (including adrenalectomy) did&#xD;
      not find signs of adrenal insufficiency (Bischoff P, Anaesthesist 1997). However a subgroup&#xD;
      analysis of a newer study demonstrated adrenal insufficiency in radical versus&#xD;
      adrenal-sparing nephrectomy (Yokoyama H, BJU Int 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that left-sided donor nephrectomy (i.e. with transaction of the&#xD;
      adrenal vein) is deleterious to the left adrenal gland and causes a measurable transient&#xD;
      adrenal insufficiency after the operation. The primary study endpoint is the assessment of&#xD;
      adrenal function after donor nephrectomy. This is done by an ACTH stimulation test, performed&#xD;
      at baseline, in the first week after the operation and 4 weeks after the operation.&#xD;
      Comparisons are performed between baseline and postoperative values, as well as between&#xD;
      left-sided kidney donors (n=20) and right-sided kidney donors (n=10). A secondary study&#xD;
      endpoint is to assess the morphological response of both adrenal glands after donor&#xD;
      nephrectomy. To this end MRI and volumetry of the adrenal glands is performed at the same&#xD;
      time points, with the hypothesis that left-sided nephrectomy will lead to an involution of&#xD;
      the left adrenal followed by hypertrophy of the right adrenal.&#xD;
