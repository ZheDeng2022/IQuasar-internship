  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose escalating open-label study designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and biologic activity of an in vivo AAV2 mediated delivery of the gene encoding&#xD;
      NTN (CERE-120).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve (up to 18) subjects will receive one of two open-label doses of CERE-120 via bilateral&#xD;
      stereotactic injections targeting the putaminal region of the brain. Subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in one of two cohorts, a low-dose cohort of six subjects followed by a high dose&#xD;
      cohort of six subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of this study is such that the primary objective, the evaluation of safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, will be assessed by frequent observations for adverse events, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory test results, imaging (MRI), neuropsychometric testing, and evaluations of disease&#xD;
      status.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of bilateral idiopathic Parkinson's Disease of at least 5 years duration&#xD;
             since diagnosis with motor fluctuations, despite adequate oral antiparkinsonian&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of moderate to severe Parkinson's Disease based on clinical rating scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males or nonpregnant females 35-75 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable medication requirements, and clear response to antiparkinsonian medications&#xD;
             during the 60-day eligibility evaluation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No conditions that would render the subject unsuitable for surgery, or that would&#xD;
             interfere with any of the assessments of safety or efficacy in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's informed consent prior to the performance of any study-specific procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of any clinically significant medical, psychiatric, or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality for which participation in the study would pose a safety risk to the&#xD;
             subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of treatment of Parkinson's disease by any procedure involving intracranial&#xD;
             surgery or implantation of a device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI of the brain within 12 months before the anticipated dosing procedure that&#xD;
             indicates the presence of an abnormality that may interfere with the assessments of&#xD;
             safety or efficacy or would, in the judgment of the investigator, present a surgical&#xD;
             risk to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any disorder that precludes a surgical procedure or alters wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A score of less than or equal to 25 on the Folstein Mini-Mental examination performed&#xD;
             during the eligibility evaluation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy, cytotoxic therapy, or immunotherapy within 6 weeks prior to CERE-120&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vaccinations within 30 days prior to CERE-120 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History, within two years before the anticipated dosing procedure, of drug or alcohol&#xD;
             abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with nonantiparkinsonian agents that may affect symptoms of Parkinson's&#xD;
             disease within 60 days before the anticipated dosing procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical disability that would interfere with the assessment of safety and efficacy&#xD;
             in this trial or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo study&#xD;
             procedures (e.g. MRI, PET) or to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior gene transfer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with an investigational agent within 60 days before the anticipated dosing&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
