      The purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of a long-acting&#xD;
      injectable formulation of risperidone (an antipsychotic medication) versus placebo for the&#xD;
      treatment of the symptoms of schizophrenia over a 12-week period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that causes changes in a person's perception,&#xD;
      thoughts, and behaviour. In schizophrenics, the most common symptoms are positive symptoms&#xD;
      (delusions and hallucinations), negative symptoms (avoiding social situations, lack of&#xD;
      feeling or expression), and disorganized symptoms (confusion in thinking and speech). Because&#xD;
      of the serious nature of these diseases, it is important that patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      take their antipsychotic medication regularly. Long-acting injectable forms of antipsychotic&#xD;
      drugs may eliminate the need for daily oral medication and increase a patient's compliance in&#xD;
      taking their medication as prescribed by their physician. This is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      parallel-group, placebo-controlled study comparing the effectiveness and safety of an&#xD;
      injectable formulation of risperidone (coated microspheres) to placebo in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The study is composed of two periods: a 1-week run-in period (patients&#xD;
      discontinue other antipsychotic drugs and receive oral risperidone, up to 4 mg/day) and a 12&#xD;
      week double-blind period during which subjects are randomized to receive bi-weekly injections&#xD;
      of placebo or risperidone long-acting injectable formulation (25, 50, or 75 mg). During the&#xD;
      first 3 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients will receive supplemental daily oral doses&#xD;
      of placebo or risperidone tablets. The primary measure of effectiveness is the change from&#xD;
      baseline in the total score for the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia&#xD;
      (PANSS). The PANSS is a rating scale that measures the symptoms of schizophrenia. Safety&#xD;
      evaluations include the incidence of adverse events, results of clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
      (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis), measurements of vital signs and body weight, physical&#xD;
      examination and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, clinical examination of the injection area&#xD;
      (buttocks), and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale used to measure&#xD;
      effects of antipsychotic medications on motor functions of the patient. Additional testing&#xD;
      conducted includes the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), a rating system used to evaluate&#xD;
      the overall and severity of clinical change in a patient with various diseases affecting the&#xD;
      brain, and the SF-36 Health Survey, a questionnaire the patient fills out that is extensively&#xD;
      used to rate a patient's quality of life. The study hypothesis is that the injectable form of&#xD;
      risperidone will be more effective than placebo, as measured by the change from baseline in&#xD;
      the total PANSS score, in patients with schizophrenia. 1-week run-in period: risperidone oral&#xD;
      tablets, up to 4 mg/day. During the first 3 weeks of double-blind period: risperidone oral&#xD;
      tablets, 2, 4, or 6 mg/day or placebo tablets. Day 1 of double-blind period and every 2 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter: risperidone intramuscular injection (25, 50, or 75 mg) or placebo injection for&#xD;
      12 weeks.&#xD;
