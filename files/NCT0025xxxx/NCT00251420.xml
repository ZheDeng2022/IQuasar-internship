  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic writing about one's emotions has been described previously (J Pennebaker:&#xD;
      Emotions, disclosure and health. Am Psychol. Assoc 1995). The present project will compare&#xD;
      the effects (if any) of writing about the emotional versus the physical consequences of lung&#xD;
      disease on anxiety, perceived quality of life, and perceived health status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (age 35-70) and asthma patients (age&#xD;
      20-60) referred to a 4 weeks inpatient rehabilitation program - who agree to participate in&#xD;
      the project - are randomly assigned to one of three conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Writing about emotional consequences of their disease before the program starts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Writing about physical consequences of their disease before the program starts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not writing&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are measured (completing questionnaires at home) on: perceived quality of life,&#xD;
      perceived health status and trait anxiety - 2 weeks before the program, 2 weeks after the&#xD;
      program and 6 months after the program. FEV1 and 6 min walking distance are measured at the&#xD;
      beginning and by the end of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to questionnaires, all patients are asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Write in their own words ( 2 weeks after) to evaluate their stay at the rehabilitation&#xD;
           clinic; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Write in their own words (6 months after) about how the disease affects their life at&#xD;
           that point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both quantitative and qualitative data will be used for analysis purposes.&#xD;
