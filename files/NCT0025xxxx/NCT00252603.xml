  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that affects up to 16 in 10,000 individuals.&#xD;
      It is a pervasive developmental disorder affecting social, communicative, and&#xD;
      compulsive/repetitive behaviors characterized by stereotypic complex hand and body movements,&#xD;
      craving for sameness, and narrow repetitive interests. Autism severely impacts both the&#xD;
      affected individual and family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is designed to assess the efficacy of treatment with Galantamine vs.&#xD;
      placebo in childhood/adolescent autism fulfilling DSM-IV and Autism Diagnostic Interview&#xD;
      (ADI) criteria. We therefore hypothesize:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Galantamine will be superior to placebo in the acute treatment of global autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Galantamine will be superior to placebo in improving functional ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Galantamine will be superior to placebo in improving language function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Galantamine will be superior to placebo improving irritable and hyperactive behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Galantamine will be superior to placebo in improving social deficits.&#xD;

      Once enrolled in the study, subjects will receive evaluations and testing to determine if&#xD;
      they meet the necessary criteria for admission into study treatment. Subjects will not be&#xD;
      responsible for the costs of any evaluations or tests conducted as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, subjects will receive a psychiatric and medical evaluation by the study psychiatrist&#xD;
      to see if she/he has any psychiatric or medical illnesses that would interfere with their&#xD;
      ability to participate in this study. These evaluations may take up to an hour to complete.&#xD;
      In addition, subjects will be asked to participate in a psychiatric interview designed to&#xD;
      determine the child's diagnosis and current problem areas. The subject's parent will also be&#xD;
      asked to fill out psychiatric questionnaires. The interview and questionnaires may take up to&#xD;
      4 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, urine and blood samples will be needed for routine tests two times during this study&#xD;
      (before any study related tests are done, and at the end of the study). Two teaspoons of&#xD;
      blood will be drawn each time. The urine sample will be analyzed in order to assess kidney&#xD;
      function and to screen for the presence of drugs (such as cocaine, marijuana, heroin, etc.).&#xD;
      A positive drug screen would result in the inability of the child to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Drug screen results will be kept confidential. In addition, an electrocardiogram will&#xD;
      be performed to determine heartbeat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, a pregnancy test will be conducted on the urine sample if the child is female and has&#xD;
      reached puberty. The child should not be in this study if she is pregnant or a nursing&#xD;
      mother. A positive urine pregnancy test would cause the child to be removed from the study.&#xD;
      If the child is sexually active, she must be using an effective method of birth control&#xD;
      during her participation in this study. Acceptable methods of birth control are oral&#xD;
      contraceptive medications (the administration of which must be parentally supervised), IUD,&#xD;
      depot medication and tubal ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned by chance to receive either the active medication (Galantamine) or&#xD;
      placebo (sugar pill) for 12 weeks, much like the flip of a coin. Neither the parent/child nor&#xD;
      the investigator will know which of the two treatments the child is receiving. The child has&#xD;
      a 50% chance of being assigned to receive placebo during the study or the active medication,&#xD;
      Galantamine, during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child will need to be seen weekly by the study psychiatrist for the first 4 weeks of the&#xD;
      twelve-week study, and every other week for the remaining weeks of the study. During these&#xD;
      visits the study psychiatrist will ask the parent for feedback on his/her child's condition&#xD;
      and any changes that may be related to the medication, including possible side effects, such&#xD;
      as nausea and headaches, and will check the child's condition. The psychiatrist will also&#xD;
      record his/her weight. These study visits will generally last approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
