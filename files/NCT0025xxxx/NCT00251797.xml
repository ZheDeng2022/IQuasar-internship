      The study will try to answer these questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the highest dose of thalidomide brain cancer patients can receive safely in&#xD;
           combination with irinotecan?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How well does this combination work to shrink brain tumors, and how long do responses to&#xD;
           treatment last?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What side effects does the combination of drugs cause?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How does treatment affect patients' quality of life (how they feel and what activities&#xD;
           they are able to do)?&#xD;

      This is a Phase I study, which means these trials are generally comparatively small and are&#xD;
      used to determine toxicity and maximum dose. Currently, there are no &quot;standard&quot; treatments&#xD;
      for Recurrent CNS Tumors. In this study, approximately 14 patients with Recurrent CNS Tumors&#xD;
      will receive treatment with irinotecan, an intravenous drug, and thalidomide, a drug taken by&#xD;
      mouth. Both have been approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration as treatments for&#xD;
      cancer, but they have not been tested together for brain cancer.&#xD;
