      This study will test the safety and how well the body's immune system responds to a live, but&#xD;
      weakened varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, known as Varivax, given with and without ProQuad,&#xD;
      another measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella virus vaccine (MMR-II). One hundred five&#xD;
      healthy children will be enrolled in the study when they are 12 months old. All subjects will&#xD;
      be vaccinated at 12 months of age and some subjects will receive a second vaccination at 18&#xD;
      months of age. All subjects will participate for 1 year. This study is a single-site,&#xD;
      two-year trial with post-licensure vaccines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a phase I/II exploratory immunogenicity and safety study of live&#xD;
      attenuated Varicella (Varivax), Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR-II), or combination&#xD;
      Varicella/Measles, Mumps/Rubella (Pro-Quad) vaccines administered to healthy children at 12&#xD;
      and 18 months of age. A total of 105 healthy children, 12 months old at the time of study&#xD;
      entry, will be recruited from the Palo Alto Medical Foundation clinics in Palo Alto, Fremont&#xD;
      and Los Altos, California. The study is designed to focus on time of primary Varivax&#xD;
      immunization and immunologic benefits of a two-dose vaccine regimen compared to a single&#xD;
      Varivax dose. In addition, the investigators will evaluate the use of Varivax with and&#xD;
      without concomitant administration of the MMR-II, further measuring immunologic responses to&#xD;
      a two-dose MMR-II regimen. The first study objective is to determine the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      one dose of Varivax administered at 12 versus 18 months of age. Participants will receive&#xD;
      either MMR vaccine and Varivax, or ProQuad depending on availability of the vaccines.&#xD;
      Immunogenicity to be measured as humoral responses utilizing plaque reduction neutralization&#xD;
      (PRN) assay for measles and gpELISA for varicella antibodies, and T cell immunity determined&#xD;
      by flow cytometric T cell assays. The second study objective is to determine the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of administering two doses of Varivax and MMR-II to children at 12 and 18&#xD;
      months of age compared with children receiving one dose of MMR-II at 12 months and one dose&#xD;
      of Varivax at 12 or 18 months of age. Participants will receive either MMR vaccine and&#xD;
      Varivax, or ProQuad depending on availability of the vaccines. The third study objective is&#xD;
      to determine the safety of administering two doses of Varivax and MMR-II to children at 12&#xD;
      and 18 months of age. Participants will receive either MMR vaccine and Varivax, or ProQuad&#xD;
      depending on availability of the vaccine. Study personnel with documentation of all adverse&#xD;
      events and serious adverse events will monitor safety using parental memory aids and&#xD;
      telephone follow-up. The investigators hypothesize that infants receiving Varivax or ProQuad&#xD;
      at 12 months of age will have comparable humoral immune responses to infants receiving the&#xD;
      vaccine at 18 months of age, but that T cell immunity will be higher in those vaccinated at&#xD;
      18 months of age. In addition, infants receiving 2 doses of Varivax or ProQuad will have&#xD;
      higher humoral and cell mediated immune responses compared with children receiving only one&#xD;
      dose of Varivax or ProQuad. This hypothesis would explain the post-licensure observations&#xD;
      that breakthrough disease is higher in those vaccinated at 12 versus 15 months of age and in&#xD;
      children who received one vaccination compared with two. The investigators predict that there&#xD;
      will be no differences in the humoral immune responses when measles is given concomitantly&#xD;
      with Varivax compared to Varivax alone, but the immunosuppressive effects of the measles&#xD;
      virus can influence effects on T cell immunity. It is expected that two doses of Varivax or&#xD;
      Proquad will be well tolerated and that there will be fewer systemic adverse reactions after&#xD;
      the second dose. The Varivax package insert reports that the incidence of injection site&#xD;
      redness and swelling was slightly higher post dose 2, but the incidence of systemic clinical&#xD;
      complaints was lower post dose 2. The incidence of adverse experiences both locally and&#xD;
      systemically following a second dose of ProQuad was equal to or less than those reactions&#xD;
      seen after the first dose. The investigators will evaluate the incidence of injection site&#xD;
      reactogenicity to confirm these findings.&#xD;
