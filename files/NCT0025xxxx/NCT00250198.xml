  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether a new experimental drug called STA-5326 mesylate will decrease&#xD;
      inflammatory chemicals called cytokines in patients with Crohn's disease. The drug has&#xD;
      prevented gut inflammation in mice and rats and has improved symptoms in humans with active&#xD;
      Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Crohn's Disease between 18 and 75 years of age and who have active disease&#xD;
      symptoms may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a review of their&#xD;
      medical records, a medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, blood and&#xD;
      urine tests, chest x-ray and tuberculin skin test. They fill out diary cards for 7 days&#xD;
      (measuring their symptoms on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index, or CDAI) and complete a&#xD;
      32-item Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) that surveys how their disease&#xD;
      affects their live and activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have a colonoscopy (an examination of the colon using a lighted tube) before&#xD;
      starting the study medication. Colon tissue samples are biopsied during the procedure.&#xD;
      Following the colonoscopy, patients are randomly assigned to receive either STA-5326 mesylate&#xD;
      or placebo (sugar or dummy pill). They take four tablets a day and are seen in the clinic&#xD;
      once a week (days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29) for the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination - Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests - Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacodynamic study (blood collected before the first dose of medicine and again after&#xD;
           1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours to measure levels of the drug in the blood) - Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CDAI and IBDQ - Days 1, 15, 29&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medications and symptoms - Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EKG - Days 8, 29&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential - Days 15, 29&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine test - Day 29&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients complete the above treatment and tests, they undergo a second colonoscopy&#xD;
      within 48 hours of their last dose of study medication and may be offered another 1-week&#xD;
      supply of medication. Those for whom additional treatment is deemed potentially beneficial&#xD;
      are offered another 4-week course of drug or placebo (continuing whichever they took the&#xD;
      first 4 weeks). They come to the clinic for two visits 2 weeks apart (days 43 and 57) for a&#xD;
      physical examination, blood tests, EKG, pregnancy test for women, CDAI, IBDQ and review of&#xD;
      medications and symptoms. A urine sample is collected only on day 57. A third colonoscopy is&#xD;
      done after all the tests are completed on day 57, within 48 hours after the last dose of&#xD;
      study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients return to the clinic about 1 week after their final dose of study medication (day 36&#xD;
      for patients who complete only 1 month of treatment and day 64 for those who complete a&#xD;
      second month of treatment) for a limited physical examination, blood tests, pregnancy test&#xD;
      for women, CDAI and IBDQ, and a review of their medications and symptoms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the mucosal immunological effects and peripheral&#xD;
      blood effects of the oral IL-12/23 inhibitor, STA-5326 mesylate, in subjects with active&#xD;
      Crohn's disease (CD). Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition of the&#xD;
      small and large bowel associated with excessive Th1 cytokine production. Since IL-12 is a key&#xD;
      cytokine driving the Th1 response, novel therapies targeting IL-12 have been successful in&#xD;
      treating CD in animal models and in humans. Data from humans and from animal models further&#xD;
      suggest that both IL-12 and IL-23 may have a role in this active gut inflammation. STA-5326&#xD;
      mesylate is an oral drug that suppresses IL-12p40 production (a subunit shared by IL-12 and&#xD;
      IL-23) in vitro and has apparent safety and clinical activity in a recent open-label trial of&#xD;
      treatment for CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will enroll and randomize 12 subjects with moderate to severe active CD (CD&#xD;
      Activity Index [CDAI] 220 to 450, inclusive) for 4 weeks of daily study drug treatment (9&#xD;
      subjects will receive 100 mg STA-5326 mesylate and 3 will receive placebo). Subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated for safety that will include monitoring of adverse events and concomitant&#xD;
      medications, clinical laboratory testing, electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings, and physical&#xD;
      examinations including vital signs. Efficacy assessments will include the CDAI, the Simple&#xD;
      Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD), results from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire&#xD;
      (IBDQ), and changes from Baseline for plasma C reactive protein (CRP) (measured by high&#xD;
      sensitivity assay). In addition, immunologic effects (lymphocyte phenotyping cytokine&#xD;
      secretion from peripheral blood and lamina propria mononuclear cells [LPMCs]) will be&#xD;
      assessed. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum&#xD;
      range) will be used to summarize data for each treatment group.&#xD;
