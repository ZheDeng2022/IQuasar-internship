      Potential participants in the Lung Cancer Case Registry will be all patients diagnosed or&#xD;
      evaluated for possible treatment of lung cancer at the Cancer Research and Treatment Center&#xD;
      (CRTC) and New Mexico Veterans Health Care System (NMVHCS).&#xD;

      Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the US in both men and women. This&#xD;
      research study will enroll lung cancer patients into a registry to study changes in DNA (or&#xD;
      genetic material) that may be associated with development of lung cancer or other lung&#xD;
      diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We will also study the role of&#xD;
      eating habits on lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, as well as the effects of the disease&#xD;
      and treatment on quality of patient's lives.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential participants in the Lung Cancer Case Registry will be all patients diagnosed&#xD;
             or evaluated for possible treatment of lung cancer at the CRTC and NMVHCS. Recruiting&#xD;
             will primarily be performed through the Multidisciplinary Chest Clinics held weekly at&#xD;
             each hospital. These clinics are staffed by the Principal Investigator (PI) and Reza&#xD;
             Mehran, MD, a thoracic surgeon at both hospitals and a co-investigator on this&#xD;
             submission. Approximately 90% of all lung cancer cases diagnosed at the NMVHCS, and a&#xD;
             somewhat smaller proportion of cases treated in the Cancer Center, are seen in these&#xD;
             clinics. Additional cases will be identified through review of new patient visits to&#xD;
             each hospital with a diagnosis of lung cancer; Drs. Crowell and Mehran also maintain&#xD;
             weekly contact with pathology and oncology services at both facilities, which will&#xD;
             facilitate case identification at NMVHCS and University Hospital. Finally, patient&#xD;
             contact records will be correlated with tumor registry records at both hospitals,&#xD;
             which will identify any cases not captured through the above mechanisms. Although&#xD;
             these cases may be identified several weeks after initial diagnosis, all attempts will&#xD;
             still be made to contact the patient and family for enrollment into the registry. Most&#xD;
             Spanish-speaking patients served by the CRTC and the NMVHCS are bilingual, and a&#xD;
             language barrier has not been a problem in other similar studies conducted by the PI.&#xD;
             However, Spanish-speaking personnel are available to obtain consent and answer any&#xD;
             questions if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if they cannot provide written informed consent.&#xD;
