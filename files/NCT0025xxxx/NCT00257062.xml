  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of levofloxacin, an&#xD;
      antibiotic, compared with another antibiotic, ciprofloxacin, in the treatment of adults with&#xD;
      uncomplicated infections of the skin and the supportive layers beneath the skin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Levofloxacin is an antibacterial agent used for the treatment of many types of infections in&#xD;
      adults. This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study to determine&#xD;
      the safety and effectiveness of levofloxacin (500 mg once daily for 7 days) compared with&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin (500 mg once every 12 hours for 10 days) in adults with uncomplicated&#xD;
      infections of the skin and the supportive layers beneath the skin. The study consists of 3&#xD;
      visits: one visit for screening and enrollment, and 2 visits for assessment of safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness (one visit on Days 3 - 5 of the study and one visit [post-therapy] 2 - 7 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of the study drug). The total duration of patient participation in the&#xD;
      study is approximately 2 weeks. The primary assessments of effectiveness include the clinical&#xD;
      response to treatment (categorized at post-therapy as cured, improved, or failed) and the&#xD;
      microbiological response at post-therapy (the elimination of the disease-causing bacteria,&#xD;
      categorized as eradicated, partially eradication, or persisted, determined by patient and by&#xD;
      type of bacteria). Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, physical examination, and&#xD;
      laboratory tests) are performed throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that treatment&#xD;
      with levofloxacin is at least as effective and as well tolerated as treatment with&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin in patients with uncomplicated infections of the skin and the supportive layers&#xD;
      beneath the skin. One levofloxacin 500 mg tablet by mouth, once daily (and a placebo tablet&#xD;
      once daily, 12 hours later) for 7 days, followed by one placebo tablet every 12 hours for 3&#xD;
      days; or one ciprofloxacin 500 mg tablet by mouth once every 12 hours for 10 days.&#xD;
