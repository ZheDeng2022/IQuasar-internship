      To test the effectiveness of a stepped-care intervention involving 2 stages: (1)&#xD;
      Self-Telemonitoring (STM) of blood pressure (BP) which uses a telephone transmission system&#xD;
      (2) Telephone-Based Nurse Case Management (NCM), provided by a commercially available&#xD;
      service.&#xD;

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medication Adherence and Blood Pressure Control Trial (ABC Trial) is a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in a multicultural population of uncontrolled, hypertensive patients to test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a stepped-care intervention involving 2 stages: (1) Self-Telemonitoring&#xD;
      (STM) of blood pressure (BP) which uses a telephone transmission system by which an&#xD;
      easy-to-use modem, contained in the BP monitor, sends the BP measurements to a commercial&#xD;
      service (Lifelink Monitoring) who then sends the measurements to the patient's health care&#xD;
      provider; and (2) Telephone-Based Nurse Case Management (NCM), provided by a commercially&#xD;
      available service (U-Med). The nurse case managers will call patients once/month, and provide&#xD;
      counseling regarding BP control, and adherence to medication regimens. All patients in the&#xD;
      intervention condition will begin with STM; after 3 months, patients whose BP has come under&#xD;
      control remain in the STM condition; patients whose BP remain uncontrolled are then&#xD;
      randomized, half to NCM + Self-Telemonitoring; the other half to continue in STM only (the&#xD;
      design allows us to evaluate the effects of each arm of the intervention separately, and the&#xD;
      combination; in addition, there will be a Usual Care condition). The focus is on an&#xD;
      intervention strategy which readily transfers to a variety of usual health care situations.&#xD;
      Both interventions are commercially available, and therefore are accessible to a wide range&#xD;
      of health care providers, including smaller community-based clinics. An innovative aspect of&#xD;
      the intervention is that the 2 commercial services will work together; the nurse case&#xD;
      managers will receive BP reports from Lifelink, which the nurse will then use as a basis for&#xD;
      counseling. The effectiveness of the interventions will be tested in 12 community-based&#xD;
      clinics, which serve an economically disadvantaged, largely African American and Hispanic&#xD;
      population, in New York City. The main outcome measures are medication adherence, determined&#xD;
      by electronic drug event monitoring (MEMS), and pharmacy refill records, as well as BP&#xD;
      control. Study duration is 1 year. The multilevel focus of the interventions is on provider&#xD;
      as well as patient behavior. Reviews will be conducted for each patient at study discharge,&#xD;
      recording data on clinic BP measurements during the previous 12 months, if any, doctor&#xD;
      appointments, ER visits, medication changes, and evidence that the physician has responded to&#xD;
      the interventions. The long-term goals of the research are to assess the medical and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of the interventions separately, and combined.&#xD;
