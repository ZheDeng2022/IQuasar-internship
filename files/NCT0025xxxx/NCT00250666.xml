  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to validate the diagnostic use of PCT assessing its capability to&#xD;
      individualize and shorten the duration of antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients with&#xD;
      suspected or confirmed sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, no well-designed intervention study has properly examined the following&#xD;
      hypothesis: A PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation strategy enables to reduce antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment duration in critically ill patients with suspected or documented sepsis, without&#xD;
      harming patient safety.&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of repeated PCT measurements in critically ill patients with clinically&#xD;
      suspected or microbiologically documented sepsis on duration of antimicrobial use and to&#xD;
      compare this strategy to standard clinical practice, by using an improved PCT assay with a&#xD;
      sensitivity of 0.06 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the impact of repeated PCT measurements on patient outcome (morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality, emergence of antibiotic resistance and nosocomial super-infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exposure to systemic antimicrobial treatment (in duration of antibiotic treatment and&#xD;
           total antibiotic exposure)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cure and failure rate of infection (in N recurrent infections per 100 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 28-day case-fatality rate (in N deaths per 100 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Length of hospital stay (in days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Costs of antimicrobial therapy (in CHF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Rate of nosocomial super-infection (in N super-infections per 100 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Isolation of multi-resistant microorganisms (in clinical isolates per 100 patient-days)&#xD;

    <description>Peripheral blood samples were collected in the morning, using vacuum tubes (BD Vacutainer SST II Plus plastic tubes; Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Allschwil, Switzerland). Circulating plasma PCT levels were measured with a time-resolved amplified cryptate emission technology assay (Kryptor PCT; Brahms AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany), with an assay sensitivity of 0.06 mg/L, approximately fourfold above mean normal levels. Measurements were performed 7 days a week.</description>
