      The purpose is to evaluate safety and feasibility of the use of Rituximab as an adjunct to&#xD;
      standard therapy (plasmapheresis + steroids) for patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic&#xD;
      purpura (TTP). This includes evaluating the rate and type of treatment failure.&#xD;

    <description>Rituximab will be administered immediately after pheresis to minimize the amount of Rituximab that is removed by the subsequent days pheresis. The guidelines will be that 12 hours must elapse between the end of the first infusion of study drug and the next pheresis. Subsequent infusions would be weekly (plus or minus 2 days) with an attempt made to give study drug infusions after a pheresis that might be the last in a series, i.e. when no pheresis would be scheduled for at least the next day.</description>
