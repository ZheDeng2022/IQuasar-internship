  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, effectiveness, and plasma concentration of&#xD;
      paliperidone (an antipsychotic medication) given once daily in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Paliperidone is an extended-release tablet. Paliperidone is an active metabolite of&#xD;
      risperidone, not approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in Japan. This is a multicenter,&#xD;
      open-label, parallel-group, fixed dose study to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and&#xD;
      plasma concentration of paliperidone taken once daily in patients with schizophrenia. The&#xD;
      patients will receive a fixed dose of paliperidone (3, 9, and 15 mg) for 6 weeks and its&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety will be observed for an additional 2 weeks.. Efficacy will be&#xD;
      measured by determining changes throughout the study in the Positive and Negative Syndrome&#xD;
      Scale (PANSS) score, a scale for the measurement of symptoms of schizophrenia, and the&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score. In addition, the study also assesses the relationship&#xD;
      between dose/plasma drug concentration and dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in patients who&#xD;
      consent to receive positron emission tomography (PET). Safety evaluations (symptoms, physical&#xD;
      exams, electrocardiograms, laboratory tests, Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale&#xD;
      [DIESS] results, and adverse event monitoring) will be conducted throughout the study. The&#xD;
      study hypothesis is that paliperidone will be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia,&#xD;
      and that it will be well-tolerated. The patients will receive either 3, 9, or 15 mg of&#xD;
      paliperidone, taken once daily by mouth for 6 weeks.&#xD;
