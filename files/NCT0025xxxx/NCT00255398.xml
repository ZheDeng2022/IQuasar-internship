      Kidney Disease Biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary: This study will identify biomarkers (proteins and other molecules in the blood or&#xD;
      urine) that may help scientists predict what kidney disease a patient has and whether a given&#xD;
      patient would respond to particular therapies. The study will look for biomarkers in the&#xD;
      blood and urine of patients with various kidney diseases and study of the effects of&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers&#xD;
      (ARB) on biomarkers. Blood and urine from healthy volunteers will be studied for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people and the following patients may be eligible for this study: adults with&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy 18 years of age and older; children with newly diagnosed clinical&#xD;
      idiopathic nephrotic syndrome between 2 and 18 year of age; children and adults with&#xD;
      glomerular disease (minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or collapsing&#xD;
      glomerulopathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo tests and procedures as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glomerular Disease: Adults with glomerular disease provide about four to six blood and urine&#xD;
      samples over the course of 6 to 12 months. The samples are collected at the time of regularly&#xD;
      scheduled visits for the NIH treatment protocol in which they are participating. Children&#xD;
      provide only blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Kidney Disease: Patients with chronic kidney disease provide a blood and urine sample&#xD;
      every 6 months for 3 years or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiotensin Antagonism: Patients with chronic kidney disease who are taking ACE inhibitors or&#xD;
      ARBs stop their medicines for 4 weeks, while those who are not taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs&#xD;
      begin one of the medicines. In general, patients just starting on the medications continue&#xD;
      them after the study is completed, since they are beneficial for chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication withdrawal group: Patients come to NIH for 2 successive days at the beginning&#xD;
           of the study for blood and urine tests (including one 24-hour urine collection) and to&#xD;
           receive iothalamate (a chemical used to measure kidney function). Iothalamate is&#xD;
           delivered over 24 hours through a needle placed in the abdomen (or elsewhere) via a pump&#xD;
           similar to pumps that some diabetics use to deliver insulin. Patients then stop taking&#xD;
           their ACE inhibitor or ARB medication. They monitor their blood pressure every day and&#xD;
           return to NIH after 1, 2 and 4 weeks for blood tests. During week 4, the iothalamate&#xD;
           infusion is repeated, and blood and urine samples are collected as at the beginning of&#xD;
           the study. Patients then resume taking their ACE inhibitor or ARB once a day with the&#xD;
           dose being increased at 2-week intervals. They come to NIH weekly after 1 week and then&#xD;
           every other week for blood tests. Four weeks after reaching the highest FDA-recommended&#xD;
           dose of medication tolerated, the iothalamate infusion and blood and urine collections&#xD;
           are repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication induction group: At the beginning of the study, patients have the iothalamate&#xD;
           infusion and blood and urine collections described above and then begin to take either&#xD;
           an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The dose is increased after 2 weeks. Patients monitor their&#xD;
           blood pressure every day. After being on the highest dose for 4 weeks, patients repeat&#xD;
           the iothalamate infusion and blood and urine collections. The study is then complete and&#xD;
           they are provided a 2-month supply of medicine to take home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information is gathered on symptoms, treatments, and results of past laboratory tests of all&#xD;
      patients. Healthy volunteers provide blood and urine sample collections every month or every&#xD;
      other month for up to four collections to be used for biomarker studies and the screen for&#xD;
      common chronic diseases.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need to develop biomarkers for renal disease, which might assist in&#xD;
      diagnosis and prognosis and might provide endpoints for clinical trials of drugs designed to&#xD;
      slow progression of renal insufficiency. We propose to study potential biomarkers in five&#xD;
      populations. First, we will study remittive therapy for glomerular disease (sample size up to&#xD;
      40), enrolling children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (N=20) and adults with minimal&#xD;
      change, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and collapsing glomerulopathy (N=20). We will&#xD;
      collect periodic urine samples as these patients receive remittive therapy with&#xD;
      glucocorticoids or other agents. We will also study up to 10 healthy adult volunteers. We&#xD;
      will carry out targeted urine proteomic studies, measuring levels of glomerular cell markers&#xD;
      and cytokines, and we will profile urine proteins using mass spectrometry. Our goals are to&#xD;
      identify markers of particular disease entities and of steroid responsiveness and to explore&#xD;
      whether biomarkers contribute to the histologic sub-classification of these diseases. Second,&#xD;
      we will study up to 40 adults with progressive chronic kidney disease of various etiologies&#xD;
      and glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2. We will study blood and urine samples,&#xD;
      using both targeted and profiling approaches. Our goal is to identify biomarkers that&#xD;
      correlate with progressive loss of glomerular filtration function, which is a functional&#xD;
      correlate of progressive renal fibrosis. Third, we will study up to 40 adults, primarily with&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy, who start or stop angiotensin antagonist therapy (angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) and compare urine proteomic&#xD;
      profiles on therapy and off therapy (4 week interval). Our goal is to identify potential&#xD;
      biomarkers that correlate with the beneficial anti-fibrotic effects of these agents. Fourth,&#xD;
      we wish to define possible sex differences in urine exosome proteins, obtained from healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, who are hospitalized for six days for administration of a standard diet and&#xD;
      collection of research urine samples. Fifth, we wish to determine whether salt intake&#xD;
      influences urine exosome proteins, obtained from healthy volunteers. These subjects will be&#xD;
      hospitalized for 12 days during which time they will be placed sequentially on a high salt&#xD;
      diet and a low salt diet, with collection of research urine samples and blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring. Proteomic analysis in these studies will take several approaches, including mass&#xD;
      spectrometry of urinary peptides, analysis of urinary exosomes, and immunologic detection and&#xD;
      quantification of candidate proteins in urine and blood.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Children with newly diagnosed clinical idiopathic nephrotic syndrome between the&#xD;
                  ages of 2-18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Children with previously diagnosed clinical idiopathic nephrotic syndrome between&#xD;
                  the age of 2-18 years at the time of diagnosis who sustain a relapse of nephrotic&#xD;
                  syndrome while off steroid therapy. A relapse is defined as a urine protein level&#xD;
                  of 2+ (100mg/dl) or greater on a first morning urine sample for 3 consecutive&#xD;
                  days. While a quantitative urine protein/creatinine ratio is more precise, this&#xD;
                  semi-quantitative definition accords with pediatric practice. Relapses will be&#xD;
                  treated according to standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Children and adults who participate in NIH trials of remittive therapy for&#xD;
                  MCD/FSGS/CG (e.g. Podocyte dexamethasone or Retinoids for podocyte disease) will&#xD;
                  be eligible.&#xD;

               1. Age less than 2 years. The rationale for excluding children under the age of 2 yr&#xD;
                  is that nephrotic syndrome is unusual in this age group and may have etiologies&#xD;
                  other than MCD and FSGS&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Uncontrolled hypertension (a systolic or diastolic which is greater than 95%&#xD;
                  population mean for child s age and sex, while receiving therapy), azotemia&#xD;
                  (serum creatinine greater than 1.5mg/dL), gross hematuria at the time of&#xD;
                  presentation (clinical markers of primary or secondary GN).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hypocomplementemia, positive ANA, anti-DS DNA, ASO, anti-DNase B, MPO, PR-3,&#xD;
                  Hepatitis B and C and HIV serologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In children or adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Clinical contra-indications to steroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The presence of medical conditions that might interfere with the interpretation&#xD;
                  of results, such as cancer, diabetes, or a long history of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Healthy adult volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. age greater than 18 yrs; no history of hypertension, diabetes, or other chronic&#xD;
                  illness that might complicate interpretation of the results; not taking&#xD;
                  prescription medication.&#xD;
&#xD;

                       ml/min/1.73m(2) but greater than 30 ml/min/1.73m(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1) The presence of medical conditions that might interfere with the&#xD;
                  interpretation of results, such as cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  ANGIOTENSIN ANTAGONISM STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Adults greater than 18 years old. Few children have diabetic nephropathy and&#xD;
                       the frequent blood draws would be problematic for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Later studies will be expanded to other&#xD;
                       glomerular diseases.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    4. The presence of medical conditions which would make interpretation of&#xD;
                       results difficult such as cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    5. History of iodine allergy or severe asthma (history of emergency department&#xD;
                       visit or hospitalization).&#xD;
