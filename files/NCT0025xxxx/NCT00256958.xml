      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal complaints worldwide,&#xD;
      affecting 30-40% of the population by the age of 65 yr.Individuals with knee OA suffer&#xD;
      progressive loss of function.Balance is an integral component of these and many other&#xD;
      activities of daily living. Individuals with knee OA display impairment in postural control,&#xD;
      mostly under dynamic testing condition. Total knee replacement (TKR) has an established place&#xD;
      in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis and is considered to be an effective intervention.It&#xD;
      remains unknown whether TKR impact significantly at balance state of the patients with OA and&#xD;
      whether improving in functional abilities after TKR correlates with balance control ability&#xD;
      in this population.The purpose of this study is to determine whether TKR have any effects on&#xD;
      relatively new postural control measures using force platform system - Balance master, in&#xD;
      correlation with functional balance assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants During a year of prospective study we plan to recruit 150 participants with&#xD;
      symptomatic OA of the knee, hospitalizing in orthopedic department of Hadassah Hospital for&#xD;
      primary TKR. Participants will undergo evaluation just before a surgery and a year after.They&#xD;
      will be asked to perform Balance Master measurements, ambulation and balance tests.&#xD;
      Additional information will be collected through a questionnaire and physical examination.&#xD;

      Balance Master Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pro Balance Master system with software version 8 will be used in the study. The Pro&#xD;
      Balance Master system is comprised of two 23cm × 46cm dual force plates connected at the&#xD;
      midline of the anterioposterior axis by a pin joint. Each force plate is mounted on a pair of&#xD;
      symmetrically positioned force transducers. The four transducers measure vertical ground&#xD;
      reaction forces, which form the basis of subsequent calculations of center of pressure (COP)&#xD;
      and center of gravity (COG) sway angels. All test data are acquired and then stored on a PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are instructed to remove their shoes and step onto the forceplates, which have to be&#xD;
      covered with tracing paper. Their feet are positioned by aligning the lateral border of the&#xD;
      foot with the appropriate height line marked on the forceplates (ie, short, 76 to 140 cm;&#xD;
      medium, 141 to 165cm; or tail, 166 to 203cm). The medial maileoli are aligned with the&#xD;
      transverse forceplate line and subjects adopted a comfortable amount of forefoot splay. The&#xD;
      outline of their feet is traced onto paper to ensure the same placement in subsequent testing&#xD;
      sessions. The visual display monitor is adjusted to the subject's eye level. Subjects are&#xD;
      instructed not to move their feet and are asked to stand with their arms at their sides&#xD;
      throughout the testing procedure. The standard test suite protocol will be administered,&#xD;
      consisting of 6 tests, 3 of which are static and 3 dynamic. The static tests require the&#xD;
      subject to look straight ahead while standing as still as possible, initially with eyes open,&#xD;
      then with eyes closed, and finally focusing on the display monitor using visual feedback to&#xD;
      maintain the position of a cursor (representing the subject's COG) within a centrally&#xD;
      positioned target box. For each test, data relating to postural sway is recorded for a period&#xD;
      of 20 seconds and the area of the sway is calculated and expressed as a percentage of the&#xD;
      subject's theoretical limits of stability (LOS). Assuming that movement about the ankle (with&#xD;
      a fixed foot position) resembles an inverted pendulum, these limits are defined as extending&#xD;
      6.25 ° anteriorly, 4.45 ° posteriorly, and 8.00 ° to each side, ~2 and delimit the area over&#xD;
      which the COG can safely move without changing the base of support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three dynamic tests require subjects to shift their COG. The first dynamic test involves&#xD;
      rhythmic weight shifting side to side to 50% of the LOS at 3-second then 2-second pacing.&#xD;
      Subjects are instructed to match the timing and movement of a bail on the screen by shifting&#xD;
      their body weight side to side to target lines denoted on the screen. The second test is&#xD;
      similar to the first except movement was now in an anterioposterior direction. Data&#xD;
      reflecting the average magnitude of the movement path (expressed as a percentage of the LOS)&#xD;
      are produced from six trials at each pace for each movement direction. The absolute error&#xD;
      relative to the targets (set at 50% of the LOS) is calculated by subtracting 50 from the&#xD;
      score obtained (50% indicating perfect execution) and recording it in absolute terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final dynamic test involved weight shifting to 8 targets positioned in an ellipse, the&#xD;
      perimeter of which corresponded to 75% of the LOS. The subjects are required to follow a ball&#xD;
      to each target as it is highlighted, and remain at that target for 3 seconds before returning&#xD;
      to the central target (neutral).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targets are highlighted in random order, but each target is selected only once. The maximum&#xD;
      allowable movement time to reach a target is 8 seconds. The average movement time and path&#xD;
      sway (in terms of percentage of the LOS) is determined across targets. A score of 100%&#xD;
      indicated that no path deviation had occurred, ie, perfect execution. (It should be noted&#xD;
      that the processing of the data to produce the outcome measures described above is hard coded&#xD;
      by NeuroCom.ª)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxford Knee Score (OKS). The OKS is a self-completed patient based outcome score . It is a 12&#xD;
      item self-completed patient based outcome score. The questionnaire was developed from patient&#xD;
      interview and validated against two generic health scales, the SF-36 and Health Assessment&#xD;
      Questionnaire (HAQ) [44]. It was originally intended for use in large randomised controlled&#xD;
      trials for patients undergoing total knee replacement, to assess levels of, and changes in,&#xD;
      pain and function of the knee solely from the patient's viewpoint. Data collection can be via&#xD;
      a postal questionnaire or by directed interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS).The severity of knee pain is evaluated by the VAS [45] after&#xD;
      patients remain in a weight-bearing position (walking or standing) for 5 minutes in the&#xD;
      parallel bars. The VAS instrument consisted of horizontal lines 10cm long, with anchor points&#xD;
      of 0 (no pain) and 10 (maximum pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four Square Step Test (FSST). FSST is a clinical measure of rapid stepping and obstacle&#xD;
      avoidance . The equipment required for the FSST includes a stopwatch and 4 canes. The square&#xD;
      is formed by using 4 canes resting flat on the floor. Canes are 90cm long, and the direction&#xD;
      and type of handle used is not important. The subject stands in square number 1 facing square&#xD;
      number 2. The aim is to step as fast as possible into each square in the following sequence.&#xD;
      Square number 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 3, 2, and 1. This sequence requires the subject to step forward,&#xD;
      backward, and sideway to the right and left. The score is recorded as the time taken to&#xD;
      complete the sequence. The stopwatch starts when the first foot contacts the floor in square&#xD;
      2 and finishes when the last foot comes back to touch the floor in square 1. The following&#xD;
      instructions are given to the subject, &quot;Try to complete the sequence as fast as possible&#xD;
      without touching the sticks. Both feet must make contact with the floor in each square. If&#xD;
      possible, face forward during the entire sequence.&quot; The sequence is then shown to the&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One practice trial is completed to ensure the subject knows the sequence. Two FSST are&#xD;
      completed with the best time taken as the score. A trial is repeated if the subject fails to&#xD;
      complete the sequence successfully, loses balance, or makes contact with a cane during the&#xD;
      sequence. Subjects who were unable to face forward during the entire sequence and needed to&#xD;
      turn before stepping into the next square were still given a score. All subjects wore their&#xD;
      preferred shoes. The examiner stood in a position to see all steps taken by the subject, and&#xD;
      an assistant provided the subject with close supervision. The entire test, including giving&#xD;
      instructions and a practice trial, took less than 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Up and Go test (TUG). Subjects are required to stand up from a chair with armrests, walk&#xD;
      3m, turn around, return to the chair, and sit down. The time taken to complete this task is&#xD;
      measured in seconds with a stopwatch [47]. The TUG test showed a high degree of test-retest&#xD;
      reliability in TUG scores in elderly subjects .&#xD;
&#xD;
      SF-36. This is a 36-item questionnaire which measures health functioning on eight scales,&#xD;
      including a physical functioning scale, and is among the most widely used measures of quality&#xD;
      of life in studies of patients and populations .Missing data and scoring procedures followed&#xD;
      the SF-36 user guidelines .&#xD;
