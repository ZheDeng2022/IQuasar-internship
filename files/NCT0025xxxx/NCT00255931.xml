      The long-term aim of this program of research is to improve physical and psychological health&#xD;
      outcomes of adults with heart failure (HF). The specific aims of the randomized, controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial are to test the effects of biofeedback-relaxation therapy in HF patients on&#xD;
      rehospitalizations, cardiac mortality and quality of life, and on the secondary end-points of&#xD;
      perceived control, anxiety, depression, skin temperature, plasma norepinephrine levels, and&#xD;
      heart rate variability (HRV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1990s, HF emerged as a significant public health threat and reached epidemic&#xD;
      proportions. Heart failure incidence and prevalence are expected to increase worldwide, and&#xD;
      its impact to worsen dramatically. Individuals with HF suffer incapacitating physical&#xD;
      symptoms, emotional distress, impaired quality of life, repeated rehospitalizations, and&#xD;
      premature death. To combat the rising HF epidemic, it is crucial that researchers study new&#xD;
      strategies to improve outcomes. Despite its potential as an effective partner to drug&#xD;
      therapy, the role of nonpharmacologic intervention in HF management has received relatively&#xD;
      little attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One may argue that drug therapy is effective enough that resources need not be expended on&#xD;
      research of nonpharmacologic therapies. However, three points argue against this stance.&#xD;
      First, despite substantial advances made in HF treatment with drug therapy, morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality remain unacceptably high. As Kannel states, &quot;innovations in treatment of...HF have&#xD;
      thus far made a disappointingly small improvement in itsâ€¦outlook&quot;. Second, although drug&#xD;
      therapy frequently provides significant improvement in symptoms and functional ability,&#xD;
      quality of life may not improve. This outcome is important for patients with HF because&#xD;
      poorer quality of life independently predicts morbidity and mortality. Third,&#xD;
      nonpharmacologic strategies can have effect sizes for important HF outcomes (e.g.,&#xD;
      rehospitalization rates/mortality and quality of life) that are similar to those seen with&#xD;
      drug therapy. Recent studies demonstrated these therapies substantially improve outcomes&#xD;
      beyond the level seen in the same patients with pharmacologic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biofeedback-relaxation therapy is an innovative and promising nonpharmacologic strategy. An&#xD;
      optimally effective treatment should have a beneficial effect on both pathophysiological and&#xD;
      psychological manifestations of the target condition. This goal is especially important for a&#xD;
      condition like HF, which has a profoundly negative impact on physical and psychological&#xD;
      function. Hallmark pathophysiology in HF includes intense neurohumoral activation, initiated&#xD;
      and sustained by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), with marked vasoconstriction. Adverse&#xD;
      psychological manifestations of chronic HF include feelings of loss of control, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. Both neurohumoral activation and the psychological consequences of HF contribute&#xD;
      to poor quality of life, frequent HF hospitalizations, and increased mortality. As shown in&#xD;
      the model in Figure 1, biofeedback-relaxation therapy takes three complementary, but separate&#xD;
      pathways to improve outcomes. This biobehavioral therapy decreases SNS activation (as&#xD;
      reflected by HRV and plasma norepinephrine), produces stress reduction (as reflected by&#xD;
      changes in perceived control, anxiety and depression), and results in vasodilation (as&#xD;
      reflected by skin temperature). Biofeedback-relaxation therapy can have a powerful influence&#xD;
      because of these separate, yet complementary effects. For example, SNS activation is directly&#xD;
      decreased by biofeedback-relaxation therapy, but also indirectly as a result of stress&#xD;
      reduction with increased control, and decreased anxiety and depression. As a result of its&#xD;
      physical and psychological effects, biofeedback-relaxation could have a clinically meaningful&#xD;
      impact on rehospitalizations, survival and quality of life. For these reasons,&#xD;
      biofeedback-relaxation may be an effective adjunct to pharmacologic therapy in the management&#xD;
      of HF. Thus, the purpose of the proposed research is to examine the impact of&#xD;
      biofeedback-relaxation training on HF patient outcomes.&#xD;
