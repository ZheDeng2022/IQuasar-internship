  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of risperidone (an&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication) versus placebo during 3 weeks of treatment of mania in patients&#xD;
      with Bipolar I Disorder who are suffering a manic episode.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antipsychotic agents have, for a long time, been used to alleviate the severe behavioral&#xD;
      problems associated with manic episodes. Risperidone, widely used in the treatment of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of manic and mixed episodes&#xD;
      associated with bipolar disorders. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of risperidone compared with placebo in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with bipolar disorder who are experiencing a manic episode. Patients&#xD;
      receive study medication (risperidone or placebo tablets) to be taken orally once a day at&#xD;
      gradually increasing doses during the first week to achieve optimal effectiveness, while&#xD;
      minimizing any intolerance to the drug. By Day 4, the dose of risperidone is in the range of&#xD;
      1 to 6 mg/day, and treatment with risperidone or placebo tablets continues for 3 weeks. The&#xD;
      primary measure of effectiveness is the change in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total&#xD;
      score from baseline to the end of treatment. Additional assessments of effectiveness include&#xD;
      the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale; the Global Assessment Scale&#xD;
      (GAS), which assesses the patient's level of functioning; and the Positive and Negative&#xD;
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS), a scale for measuring psychotic symptoms. Safety assessments include&#xD;
      the incidence of adverse events throughout the study; measurement of vital signs&#xD;
      (temperature, pulse, blood pressure) and evaluation of the presence and severity of&#xD;
      extrapyramidal symptoms by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) at specified&#xD;
      intervals; and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) at the start&#xD;
      and end of the study. The study hypothesis is that daily treatment with risperidone is more&#xD;
      effective than placebo, as measured by Young Mania Rating Scale scores, in the treatment of&#xD;
      the manic phase of Bipolar I Disorder. Risperidone tablets,1 mg (or placebo tablets) taken&#xD;
      orally once daily in the evening; dose of 3 mg on Day 1; dose range of 2 - 4 mg on Day 2;&#xD;
      dose range 1 - 5 mg on Day 3; dose range 1 - 6 mg on Days 4 - 21. Doses may be increased or&#xD;
      decreased at investigator's discretion.&#xD;
