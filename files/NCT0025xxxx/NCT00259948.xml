      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of Aerobic Physical Activity on the&#xD;
      function of the Autonomic System in patients after Myocardial Infarction or Stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to examine whether it is possible to predict which of the patients&#xD;
      will most benefit from physical activity (exercise training), taking into account, genetic&#xD;
      factors such as Polymorphism of ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme)&#xD;

      Imbalance in autonomic cardiovascular function has been shown to increase the risk of&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD),&#xD;
      after myocardial infarction and after stroke. Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the&#xD;
      autonomic tone of the heart. Under these conditions there is an increased sympathetic&#xD;
      adrenergic tone and reduced parasympathetic activity. The effect of aerobic rehabilitation on&#xD;
      the Sympathetic-parasympathetic control has been examined. exercise training alters&#xD;
      sympatho-vagal control of heart rate variability (HRV) towards parasympathetic dominance in&#xD;
      patients after acute myocardial infarction (MI) and in diabetic patients. To our knowledge,&#xD;
      in post-stroke patients this issue hasn't been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that different people react differently to physical training. There is a&#xD;
      difference of opinion in literature concerning the function of Genetic parameters, such as&#xD;
      the Polymorphism of ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme), in hemodynamic Reactions following&#xD;
      Physical Activity and whether there is a connection between Polymorphism and physical&#xD;
      performance..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To examine the effect of Aerobic Physical Activity on the function of the&#xD;
      Autonomic System in patients after Myocardial Infarction or Stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to examine whether it is possible to predict which of the patients&#xD;
      will most benefit from physical activity (exercise training), taking into account, genetic&#xD;
      factors such as Polymorphism of ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Population The research subjects include a) patients after Myocardial Infarction&#xD;
      between the ages 20 - 80 , who underwent percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), and b)&#xD;
      patients after a first Stroke between ages 20 - 80, up to two months after the stroke, with a&#xD;
      NIH Stroke Score of 6 - 20 and who are able to cooperate and follow instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Part A This research will examine the effect of Aerobic Physical Activity on the&#xD;
      function of the Autonomic Nervous System and on various physiological and clinical factors&#xD;
      such as B.P., blood sugar level, tryglycerides, HDL, LDL, CRP and aerobic physical fitness,&#xD;
      in 70 cardiac patients who participate in the Heart Rehabilitation Program at the Hadassah&#xD;
      Hospital on Mt. Scopus and in 30 post Stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group I Includes about 70 cardiac patients and about 30 post Stroke patients, thate&#xD;
      will NOT include in the Exercise Training Program and ARE suitable with regards to age, sex,&#xD;
      and clinical background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II Includes about 30 healthy individuals, suitable for the research groups with regard&#xD;
      to age and sex, and have no known cardio-vascular disease and who will participate in Aerobic&#xD;
      Exercise Training Program for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the commencement and end of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the research and control groups will undergo the following tests:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stress Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement of Heart Rate Variability by means of a &quot;Holter&quot; monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. General Blood tests (Triglycerides, HDL, LDL, sugar and HB.A1C.CRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of life according to SF questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. B.P and Pulse at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. NIH Stroke Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. MAS (Motor Assessment Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. FIM (Functional Independence Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Walking Speed Test; (the distance covered in two minutes) at a comfortable speed. During&#xD;
           the test the patient is connected to a Polar Watch (heart rate monitor) to check the&#xD;
           Heart Rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical (Exercise)Training&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each patient will receive a personal training program and his optimal heart rate is&#xD;
           determined by the results the stress test according to a Borg scale - a scale for&#xD;
           assessing, subjectively, the training intensity level. RPE (Rating of perceived exertion&#xD;
           scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of program: 3 months, 2 sessions a week, each session lasting 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Session includes about 15 minutes of warm-up, the main part - aerobic workout on&#xD;
           exercise machines for 35 minutes, and relaxation for 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The main part includes work on the following fitness machines; treadmill, bicycle and&#xD;
           arm ergometria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The heart rate is monitored constantly during the training, by means of a Polar Watch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. At the start and end of each session, blood pressure is measured, and if necessary also&#xD;
           during the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The intensity of effort will be examined by means of the Borg Scale (RPE) for a&#xD;
           subjective assessment of level of difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B Blood tests at the end of the training program will include a test of ACE&#xD;
      Insertion/Deletion Polymorphism.&#xD;
