    <textblock>
      Critically ill babies less than 1 month of age have deficient amounts of the antioxidant&#xD;
      glutathione and a high incidence of disease associated with oxidative injury compared to&#xD;
      healthy babies. These diseases include but are not limited to damage to the eyes, lungs, and&#xD;
      intestines. Frequently becoming chronic and potentially life threatening, these diseases&#xD;
      result in a significantly decreased quality of life to the infant along with increased costs&#xD;
      to the infant's family and society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amino acid cysteine comprises a third of the tripeptide glutathione and directly&#xD;
      influences glutathione production. Older children ill with infection and stable, premature&#xD;
      neonates administered cysteine supplementation to their diet have been previously shown to&#xD;
      increase their glutathione production and concentrations. Furthermore, cysteine&#xD;
      supplementation in the ill children resulted in a quicker resolution of their illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although most critically ill babies require IV nutrition (i.e., TPN) before and during their&#xD;
      illness, commercially available TPN does not include cysteine as a significant nutrient.&#xD;
      Cysteine has effectively become a safe and standard supplement to routine TPN in a few major&#xD;
      hospitals in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of cysteine supplementation to increase&#xD;
      glutathione production and concentrations in critically ill babies. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators want to evaluate whether cysteine supplementation results in less oxidative&#xD;
      tissue injury and ultimately less severe illnesses. The study will enroll babies admitted to&#xD;
      the UCLA Medical Center Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and they will be chosen at random&#xD;
      and in a blinded fashion to receive either cysteine or non-cysteine supplementation to their&#xD;
      routine TPN. Small blood samples along with a single 6 hour infusion of a non-radioactive,&#xD;
      stable isotope labeled amino acid will be used to measure the production of glutathione as&#xD;
      well as other compounds in the blood to give a quantitative assessment to the severity of&#xD;
      illness. Clinical information relevant to the babies' illness and subsequent recovery will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be compared between cysteine vs. non-cysteine groups and before vs. after&#xD;
      individual supplementation. By demonstrating the effect of cysteine supplementation on&#xD;
      glutathione production, the incidence and/or severity of disease from oxidative injury in&#xD;
      critically ill babies may be decreased if glutathione production is improved.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill neonates have demonstrated low concentrations of the antioxidant glutathione&#xD;
      and a high incidence of disease associated with oxidative injury compared to healthy&#xD;
      neonates. Cysteine is considered to be a conditionally essential amino acid for neonates and&#xD;
      is the rate limiting substrate for the synthesis of glutathione. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      parenterally-fed, critically ill neonates administered cysteine supplementation will have&#xD;
      higher concentrations of total glutathione, lower ratios of oxidized to reduced glutathione,&#xD;
      higher glutathione synthetic rates, lower levels of inflammatory cytokine production and&#xD;
      lipid peroxidation, and decreased severity of disease associated with oxidative injury&#xD;
      compared to similarly ill parenterally fed neonates without cysteine supplementation. To test&#xD;
      this hypothesis, critically ill, parenterally fed neonates assigned randomly to receive a&#xD;
      cysteine or an isonitrogenous cysteine-free supplement to their TPN (total parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition) regimen will be prospectively studied in a double-blind fashion according to the&#xD;
      following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to measure total concentrations of erythrocyte glutathione, oxidized to reduced&#xD;
           (GSSG:GSH) erythrocyte glutathione ratios, and the in vivo fractional and absolute&#xD;
           synthetic rates of erythrocyte glutathione utilizing a [13C]-glycine tracer,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to measure plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a), and&#xD;
           malondialdehyde concentrations as determinants of illness severity and degree of&#xD;
           oxidative injury reflected by lipid peroxidation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. and, to measure duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen, and&#xD;
           duration of hospitalization as the primary clinical outcomes of disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By demonstrating whether cysteine supplementation increases the synthesis and concentration&#xD;
      of glutathione along with the subsequent decrease in oxidative injury and associated disease,&#xD;
      the widespread morbidity and mortality for vulnerable, critically ill neonates may be&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill neonates treated in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), whether premature&#xD;
      or full term, experience a high incidence of diseases that may be secondary to or exacerbated&#xD;
      by oxidative injury. These include a variety of multi-factorial disease processes such as&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN), chronic lung&#xD;
      disease (CLD), sepsis, meconium aspiration, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocolitis (NEC). Within NICUs across the U.S. per year, Neonatologists and Pediatric&#xD;
      Surgeons care for an estimated 100,000 critically ill neonates, of which approximately 35%&#xD;
      are full-term and up to 20% will ultimately expire of their illnesses despite major advances&#xD;
      in neonatal care. Some neonatal diseases are well known to have a varying prevalence&#xD;
      according to neonatal maturity. Premature neonates more commonly suffer from RDS, CLD, ROP&#xD;
      and NEC, with the most susceptible being the extremely premature. However, 10-15% of neonates&#xD;
      who develop NEC are full-term and have a resultant mortality rate of up to 35%. Furthermore,&#xD;
      other disease processes causing significant respiratory distress (e.g., PPHN, pneumonia, and&#xD;
      meconium aspiration) more commonly occur in full-term neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high morbidity of these diseases has a significant impact for the neonate, their parents,&#xD;
      and society in general. Neonatal survivors of critical illness who are without obvious&#xD;
      neurologic injury have been found later to have lower IQ's, increased behavioral problems,&#xD;
      decreased ability to perform normal activities of daily living, decreased scholastic&#xD;
      abilities, and decreased health-related quality of life compared to healthy children. The&#xD;
      economic burden to the parents and society from the care of these neonatal illnesses can be&#xD;
      astounding. For example, the economic costs of neonatal healthcare alone can increase 32-71%&#xD;
      when a critically ill neonate has NEC compared to appropriately matched controls without NEC.&#xD;
      Adjusted for inflation to the year 2005, an additional expense of approximately $281,666 is&#xD;
      expected for every NEC survivor prior to discharge from the NICU (equivalent to $8.45 million&#xD;
      per year for a single large healthcare center). Similarly, the continued healthcare costs of&#xD;
      critically ill neonates even after discharge can be insurmountable. Children who were&#xD;
      survivors of a critical illness as a premature neonate have been shown to require increased&#xD;
      utilization of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) resources (e.g., mechanical ventilation),&#xD;
      increased length of ICU care, and more frequent readmission to the PICU compared to other&#xD;
      PICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although cysteine is a non-essential amino acid made from methionine via cystathionine in&#xD;
      children and adults, most premature and term neonates have a decreased capacity to synthesize&#xD;
      cysteine due to their low expression of the rate limiting enzyme cystathionase. As a result,&#xD;
      plasma cysteine and cystine concentrations in critically ill neonates are low compared to&#xD;
      healthy infants. Unfortunately, plasma cysteine concentrations of neonates receiving&#xD;
      cysteine-free TPN remain low despite generous methionine intakes and relatively high plasma&#xD;
      methionine concentrations in TPN fed neonates. This is particularly relevant since cysteine&#xD;
      is the limiting substrate for the synthesis of the principal intracellular antioxidant in the&#xD;
      body - glutathione.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracellular glutathione serves many roles in the cell including protection against&#xD;
      oxidative damage caused by free radicals through glutathione peroxidase and detoxification of&#xD;
      electrophilic metabolites through multiple glutathione transferases. Thereby, the level of&#xD;
      glutathione in a specific organ or tissue is thought to be a major determinant of the&#xD;
      vulnerability of that organ or tissue to oxidative stress. Although the majority of whole&#xD;
      body glutathione is produced in hepatocytes, most cells, including the erythrocyte, have the&#xD;
      equivalent capacity to synthesize glutathione de novo from the 3 amino acids cysteine,&#xD;
      glutamate, and glycine utilizing (-glutamylcysteine and glutathione synthetases. The active&#xD;
      form of glutathione (reduced or GSH) is also regenerated from recycling of oxidized&#xD;
      glutathione (glutathione disulfide or GSSG) through glutathione reductase. However, when the&#xD;
      use of reduced glutathione exceeds the capacity of regeneration, the GSSG is expelled from&#xD;
      the cell and intracellular glutathione stores are depleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the degree of stress or neonatal weight, critically ill neonates have activity&#xD;
      levels of these glutathione synthetic enzymes comparable to those of adults. Furthermore,&#xD;
      these neonates demonstrate unimpeded ability to transport amino acids, including cysteine&#xD;
      derivatives, across cellular membranes. Hence, neonates demonstrate the capacity to&#xD;
      synthesize glutathione given the appropriate substrates are available. Despite the potential&#xD;
      ability to synthesize glutathione, low glutathione concentrations and high ratios of GSSG:GSH&#xD;
      have been demonstrated from the blood, lung, and intestine of critically ill neonates in&#xD;
      multiple studies. Consequently, a likely limiting factor in the production of glutathione for&#xD;
      critically ill neonates is the availability of cysteine in their diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most critically ill neonates receive their nutrition solely through the parenteral route&#xD;
      during the acute duration of their illness, from a few days to weeks of post-natal life.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there is no parenteral amino acid formulation commercially available in the&#xD;
      U.S. which includes cysteine as a significant nutrient. This is because cysteine is&#xD;
      relatively unstable and cystine (i.e., cysteine dimer) is insoluble in aqueous solution.&#xD;
      However, cysteine supplementation to TPN is possible in the form of cysteine-HCl if given&#xD;
      within 24 hours prior to infusion. Subsequent provision of cysteine in this manner results in&#xD;
      higher plasma cysteine concentrations in critically ill neonates. Although cysteine-HCl&#xD;
      supplementation to TPN has been shown to be possible and safe, it is not routine practice in&#xD;
      current neonatal care. Nevertheless, cysteine-HCl supplementation is standard practice in&#xD;
      some major neonatal centers in the U.S. in order to augment the calcium and phosphorus&#xD;
      solubility in TPN, which further benefits growing infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several in vitro and animal studies demonstrate cysteine supplementation increases&#xD;
      glutathione concentrations in the blood, liver, and intestines. Cysteine supplementation to&#xD;
      premature neonatal erythrocytes in cell cultures have demonstrated increased glutathione&#xD;
      concentrations compared to non-cysteine supplemented controls. Malloy et. al. have shown&#xD;
      cysteine-HCl supplemented TPN-fed beagle pups have higher concentrations of plasma cysteine&#xD;
      and hepatic glutathione than unsupplemented TPN-fed pups. Similarly, Pollack et. al. have&#xD;
      demonstrated intestinal glutathione concentrations significantly increase in premature&#xD;
      newborn rabbits administered cysteine-HCl supplementation compared to non-supplemented&#xD;
      controls. Moreover, the colonic glutathione concentrations were found to be similar to those&#xD;
      of maternally reared, term newborn rabbits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a clinical corollary, human studies in stressed adults with acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome have demonstrated elevated concentrations of glutathione and improvements in&#xD;
      recovery after cysteine supplementation. Septic and malnourished children supplemented with&#xD;
      enteral cysteine have demonstrated increased glutathione concentrations and in vivo&#xD;
      glutathione synthetic rates measured utilizing a novel non-radioactive, stable isotope&#xD;
      methodology. Furthermore, the septic children supplemented with cysteine resolved their&#xD;
      illnesses quicker than their unsupplemented counterparts. These studies suggest that&#xD;
      cysteine-HCl supplementation may improve glutathione production and decrease oxidative stress&#xD;
      in critically ill neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has yet to be an investigation confirming that improved glutathione concentrations and&#xD;
      in vivo glutathione synthetic rates occur in critically ill neonates supplemented with&#xD;
      cysteine-HCl and that these perturbations lead to a decrease in the amount of oxidative&#xD;
      tissue injury that these patients endure. This gap in studies serves as a perfect setting for&#xD;
      our proposed randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial that is adequately powered to&#xD;
      detect a pre-determined difference between the two groups.&#xD;
