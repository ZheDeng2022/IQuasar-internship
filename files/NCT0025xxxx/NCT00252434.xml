      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a specially developed group counseling&#xD;
      approach is better able to help HIV-positive gay and bisexual men (GBM) who use crystal meth&#xD;
      to stop using methamphetamines, reduce sexual risk behaviors, and stay on their HIV&#xD;
      medications than a standard drug treatment program. Another purpose is to determine whether&#xD;
      having a drug abuse treatment program in an HIV medical clinic makes it easier to attend&#xD;
      treatment than going to a separate location for drug abuse treatment.&#xD;

      The study features activities that include development and refinement of a&#xD;
      culturally-specific cognitive behavioral therapy that integrates aspects of drug abuse&#xD;
      treatment with HIV medication adherence interventions and cultural elements of being a gay or&#xD;
      bisexual man receiving medical care for HIV/AIDS. To estimate the size of the signal of this&#xD;
      intervention, the study proposes a two parallel group design in which 50 treatment-seeking&#xD;
      HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual men who meet criteria for methamphetamine abuse and who&#xD;
      receive HIV medical care at the UCLA Center for Clinical AIDS Research and Education (CARE)&#xD;
      clinic are randomized to the study condition or a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the experimental condition receive 12 weeks of twice-weekly GCBT,&#xD;
      with a 6-months post-randomization follow-up visit. Participants assigned to the TAU&#xD;
      condition are referred to the UCLA Addiction Medicine Clinic (AMC), where they receive the&#xD;
      clinic's standard of care treatment for methamphetamine dependence for 12 weeks, and return&#xD;
      for a 6-month follow-up visit. Analyses are conducted on all participants who meet&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, express desire for treatment, and receive at least one &quot;dose&quot;&#xD;
      of the cognitive-behavioral treatment or make one visit to the AMC. Participants in both&#xD;
      conditions agree to weekly and monthly data collection visits, including the provision of&#xD;
      urine samples. Primary outcome variables are methamphetamine use, sexual risk behaviors, and&#xD;
      HIV medication compliance. The proposed design maintains the focus on intervention&#xD;
      development and feasibility, while recognizing that the second phase of this development will&#xD;
      be informed by having accurate estimates of effect sizes for the intervention and adequate&#xD;
      resources to conduct the full-scale trial.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HIV-seropositive, GBM receiving medical treatment for HIV for at least 30 days prior&#xD;
             to signing informed consent at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Center&#xD;
             for Clinical AIDS Research and Education (CARE) clinic, aged 18-65&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing to give informed consent and comply with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willing to provide consent to contact treating physicians and pharmacies to assess&#xD;
             adherence to HIV medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diagnosed with current methamphetamine abuse as determined by Mini-International&#xD;
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Interested in seeking treatment for methamphetamine abuse and in participating in this&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unwilling to give, or withdrawal of, informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. A psychiatric condition that, in the principal investigator's judgment, warrants&#xD;
             additional intervention to ensure participant safety (e.g., meets Diagnostic and&#xD;
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision [DSM-IV-TR]&#xD;
             criteria for current bipolar disorder or a psychotic disorder)&#xD;
