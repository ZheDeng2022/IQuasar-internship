             defined by any of the following (lesion is eligible if it meets any one of the&#xD;
             following criteria): ≥ 5 letters (or ≥ 1 Snellen line) of BCVA lost within 6 months&#xD;
             preceding Day 0\; ≥ 10% increase in lesion area, as determined by comparing a FA&#xD;
             performed within 1 month preceding Day 0 to a FA performed within 6 months preceding&#xD;
             Day 0; Subretinal hemorrhage associated with CNV within 1 month preceding Day 0;&#xD;
             Classic CNV comprising &gt; 50% of CNV lesion area&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BCVA, using ETDRS charts for Cohort 1 and Snellen charts for Cohort 2, of 20/40 to&#xD;
             20/320 (Snellen equivalent) in the study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with verteporfin PDT, pegaptanib sodium, or other AMD therapy in the study&#xD;
             eye &lt; 30 days preceding Day 0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of submacular surgery or other surgical intervention for AMD in the study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous participation in any studies of investigational drugs within 30 days&#xD;
             preceding Day 0 (excluding vitamins and minerals)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Treatment with intravitreally administered (in either eye) Avastin(R) (bevacizumab)&#xD;
             within 30 days preceding Day 0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of systemic anti-VEGF agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fibrosis or atrophy involving the center of the fovea in the study eye, in the absence&#xD;
             of a new lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CNV in either eye due to other causes, such as ocular histoplasmosis, trauma, or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye (e.g., cataract or diabetic&#xD;
             retinopathy) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could either require medical or&#xD;
             surgical intervention during the 12-month study period to prevent or treat visual loss&#xD;
             that might result from that condition, or, if allowed to progress untreated, could&#xD;
             likely contribute to loss of at least 2 Snellen equivalent lines of BCVA over the&#xD;
             12-month study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Aphakia or pseudophakia with absence of the posterior capsule (unless it occurred as a&#xD;
             result of a yttrium aluminum garnet [YAG] posterior capsulotomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Spherical equivalent of the refractive error in the study eye demonstrating more than&#xD;
             -8 diopters of myopia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intraocular surgery (including cataract surgery) in the study eye within 2 months&#xD;
             preceding Day 0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure ≥ 25 mmHg&#xD;
             despite treatment with antiglaucoma medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of more than one therapy for glaucoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of glaucoma filtering surgery in the study eye&#xD;

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or&#xD;
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of&#xD;
             the results of the study or render the subject at high risk for treatment&#xD;
             complications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current treatment for a significant active systemic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases such as cardiovascular&#xD;
