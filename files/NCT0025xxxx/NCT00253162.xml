      The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of risperidone (an&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication) compared with placebo after 3 weeks of treatment in patients with&#xD;
      bipolar disorder who are experiencing manic episodes. A secondary purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      assess the maintenance of risperidone effectiveness versus haloperidol (an antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication) after 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Antipsychotic agents have, for a long time, been used to alleviate the severe behavioral&#xD;
      problems associated with manic episodes. Risperidone, widely used in the treatment of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of manic and mixed episodes&#xD;
      associated with bipolar disorders. This is a randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of risperidone compared with placebo after 3 weeks of treatment in&#xD;
      patients with bipolar disorder who are experiencing manic episodes. A secondary objective is&#xD;
      to estimate the difference between the anti-manic efficacy of risperidone and haloperidol&#xD;
      (active comparator) after 12 weeks of treatment. Haloperidol also serves as an internal&#xD;
      control for the 3-week treatment period. The study has two 2 phases: an acute period&#xD;
      consisting of 3 weeks of double-blind treatment (risperidone, haloperidol, or placebo)&#xD;
      followed by a maintenance period consisting of 9 weeks of double-blind treatment (risperidone&#xD;
      or haloperidol) or 9 weeks of open-label treatment (risperidone). Patients receive study&#xD;
      medication to be taken orally once a day at gradually increasing doses during the first week&#xD;
      (risperidone, a range of 1 - 6 mg/day or haloperidol, a range of 2 - 12 mg/day) to achieve&#xD;
      optimal effectiveness, while minimizing any intolerance to the drug. Daily treatment&#xD;
      continues at the optimal dose through Week 3 of the first phase. After completing the 3-week&#xD;
      double-blind period, patients can continue double-blind treatment for an additional 9 weeks&#xD;
      at the optimal dose (with placebo patients crossed over to risperidone), or enter the 9-week&#xD;
      open-label period of risperidone treatment. Adjustment to achieve an optimal dosage is made&#xD;
      for those patients whose medication is changed upon entering the second phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary measure of effectiveness (acute efficacy) is the change in Young Mania Rating&#xD;
      Scale (YMRS) total score from baseline to the endpoint at 3 weeks of the acute treatment&#xD;
      period. Additional efficacy measures for the study assess maintenance efficacy. These&#xD;
      measures include the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale; Global&#xD;
      Assessment Scale (GAS), which assesses the patient's level of functioning; Brief Psychiatric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (BPRS), a scale for measuring psychotic symptoms; and the Montgomery Asberg&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), which evaluates symptoms of depression. Safety assessments&#xD;
      include the incidence of adverse events and measurement of vital signs (temperature, pulse,&#xD;
      blood pressure) throughout the study; evaluation of the presence and severity of&#xD;
      extrapyramidal symptoms by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) at specified&#xD;
      intervals; and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) at the start&#xD;
      and end of both phases of the study. The study hypothesis is that 3 weeks of daily treatment&#xD;
      with risperidone is more effective than placebo, as measured by Young Mania Rating Scale&#xD;
      scores, in the treatment of the manic phase of Bipolar I Disorder. Acute phase: Risperidone&#xD;
      orally, once-daily: 2 mg on Day 1, 1 - 3 mg on Days 2 to 4, and 1 - 6 mg on Days 5 to 21; or&#xD;
      haloperidol orally, once-daily: 4 mg on Days 1 to 4 and 2 - 12 mg on Days 5 to 21; or placebo&#xD;
      orally, once-daily Days 1 to 21. Maintenance phase: optimal dose of risperidone or&#xD;
      haloperidol for 9 weeks (placebo patients cross over to risperidone) or Open-label phase:&#xD;
      risperidone for 9 weeks.&#xD;
