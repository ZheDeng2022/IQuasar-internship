    <textblock>
      The principal aim of this project is to conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      examine whether adding a twelve-session Multi-Component Yoga Intervention (MCYI) to the&#xD;
      treatment regimen of Australian Vietnam Veterans suffering chronic Posttraumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder (PTSD) leads to a significantly greater clinical improvement than conventional&#xD;
      psychiatric treatment alone. Include 12 sessions with each session 3 hours duration- 4 days&#xD;
      per week for 3 weeks i.e. total of 36 hours. The Multi-Component Yoga Intervention (MCYI)&#xD;
      consisting of specific poses, breathing techniques, information about yoga techniques and&#xD;
      practices, group processes, psychoeducation, relaxation procedures and meditation techniques&#xD;
      in Vietnam War Veterans with chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) resistant to&#xD;
      treatment has been developed. This project aims to evaluate MCYI through RCT method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that Yoga augmentation will lead to: (1) reduced symptoms of PTSD and&#xD;
      Depression; and (2) reduced alcohol intake. A secondary aim of the proposed RCT is to&#xD;
      evaluate putative mediating variables. Benefits include that it is low cost and easy to&#xD;
      apply. Done at home, non threatening and additional to standard psychiatric treatment for&#xD;
      PTSD.&#xD;

&#xD;
      A comparable method with a different emphasis is currently the subject of a United States&#xD;
      grant application by another group to formally test American War Veterans from Afghanistan&#xD;
      and Iraq. The chief investigators (Assistant Professor Gerbarg and Associate Professor Brown)&#xD;
      are collaborating with The Bay Pines Veterans Administration Medical Center in Florida to&#xD;
      develop a study utilising a specific Yoga breathing technique called Sudarshan Kriya Yoga&#xD;
      (SKY) for treatment of American veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. Elements of&#xD;
      this method have been widely tested on individuals suffering with Acute Stress Disorder and&#xD;
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (Gerbarg and Brown 2005 Direct communication) and have been&#xD;
      reported to have relieved posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in large groups of people&#xD;
      affected by mass disasters such as: war (Kosovo, Bosnia, Iraq and Sudan) (Biswas 2004; Joseph&#xD;
      2004; Luedemann 2004); terrorism (New York City 9/11) (Anonymous 2001b), (Kashmir, India,&#xD;
      Israel); and natural disasters (Gujurat earthquake, Iran flood and the Asian Tsunami)&#xD;
      (Gujurat earthquake, 2000) (Anonymous 2001a). Pilot studies conducted by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator using similar techniques showed positive health results for Vietnam Veterans&#xD;
      with PTSD in Australia (Carter and Byrne 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Kessler, Sonnega et al. 1995) studied the disabling effect of PTSD in their NCS study and&#xD;
      conclude that PTSD and Major Depression are the two most substantial causes of burden of&#xD;
      disease by psychological disorder. The Australian national epidemiology study (Creamer,&#xD;
      Burgess et al. 2001) support this in analysis of work days lost per month (2.8 days per&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, evidence from a well-designed Random Controlled Trial (RCT) is accepted as having&#xD;
      a high level of strength for efficacy. From the literature review, none of the outcome&#xD;
      studies investigating the efficacy of yoga treatment for PTSD have been conducted by using&#xD;
      RCT design. Most of the studies lack treatment control subjects and rely on data from only&#xD;
      one program. Thus, it is expected the Multi-Component Yoga Intervention (MCYI) will be the&#xD;
      first RCT study conducted internationally and will contribute significantly to the field of&#xD;
      mental health and psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, although a randomized clinical trial has been performed for depression with good&#xD;
      effect (Janakiramaiah, Gangadhar et al. 2000), there are as yet no randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      testing the efficacy of a yoga intervention for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Vietnam&#xD;
      Veterans. Accordingly, it is proposed to apply a Multi-Component Yoga Intervention (MCYI) for&#xD;
      a group of Australian Veterans.&#xD;
