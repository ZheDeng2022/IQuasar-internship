      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of oral risperidone (an&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication) in the treatment of conduct disorder and other disruptive behavior&#xD;
      disorders in children ages 5 to 12 with mild, moderate, or borderline mental retardation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conduct and psychiatric disorders are found among a higher proportion of people with mental&#xD;
      retardation than among people who are not mentally retarded. Among many different treatment&#xD;
      approaches to conduct disorder are drug therapy, behavioral treatment, psychotherapy,&#xD;
      cognitive and social learning. Studies have suggested that neuroleptic drugs, such as&#xD;
      risperidone, may be beneficial in treating conduct disorder in mental retardation. This is a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the effectiveness of risperidone compared with&#xD;
      placebo in the treatment of children 5 to 12 years of age with mild, moderate, or borderline&#xD;
      mental retardation who display destructive behaviors. The study has 2 phases: a run-in phase&#xD;
      of 1 week and a treatment phase of 6 weeks. Patients receive placebo to be taken orally once&#xD;
      a day during the first week (run-in). On the basis of scores on the Nisonger Child Behavior&#xD;
      Rating Form (N-CBRF) after the first week, patients either continue in the double-blind&#xD;
      treatment phase or discontinue the study. During the treatment phase patients receive&#xD;
      risperidone oral solution once daily at a starting dose of 0.01 mg/kg body weight, increasing&#xD;
      gradually at the investigator's discretion up to 0.06 mg/kg (maximum), or placebo for 6&#xD;
      weeks. A parent or caregiver evaluates the child's behavior and symptoms at scheduled office&#xD;
      visits during the course of treatment. The primary measure of efficacy is the change from&#xD;
      baseline to the end of treatment in the Conduct Problem subscale of the N-CBRF. Other&#xD;
      efficacy assessments include the changes in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Behavioral&#xD;
      Problems Inventory (BPI), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), a rating system used to&#xD;
      evaluate the overall and severity of clinical change. Safety assessments include the&#xD;
      incidence of adverse events throughout the study; weekly measurement of vital signs (pulse,&#xD;
      temperature, blood pressure) and evaluation of the presence and severity of extrapyramidal&#xD;
      symptoms by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS); and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
      (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) before study initiation and at end of treatment. The&#xD;
      study hypothesis is that risperidone will be well tolerated and effective for the treatment&#xD;
      of conduct disorder in children aged 5 to 12 years with mild, moderate, or borderline mental&#xD;
      retardation. Risperidone oral solution 1.0 mg/mL once daily. Days 1 and 2 at a dose of 0.01&#xD;
      mg/kg body weight, Day 3 at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg, and increasing gradually up to 0.06 mg/kg&#xD;
      (maximum) daily through 6 weeks. Dose may be increased or decreased at investigator's&#xD;
      discretion&#xD;
