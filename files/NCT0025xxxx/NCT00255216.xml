      Policosanol, a compound derived from sugar cane wax and available in health food stores&#xD;
      across the United States, is a popular non-prescription product for treating&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia. Virtually all of the published medical literature on policosanol has&#xD;
      been authored by research groups in Cuba.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the short-term safety and efficacy of policosanol in healthy adults&#xD;
      who have a baseline LDL-C of 130-200. The recruitment population will be derived from primary&#xD;
      care clinics consisting primarily of Caucasian and African-American patients. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measurements will be the percentage change in LDL-C. Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      changes in total cholesterol, HDL-C, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, and lipoprotein&#xD;
      sub-particles. This will be the first known randomized clinical trial of policosanol in North&#xD;
      America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data derived from this pilot study regarding the lipid lowering effects of policosanol&#xD;
      will be used to support applications for further funding through institutions outside the&#xD;
      Carolinas Healthcare System including the National Institute of Health (NIH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: To independently corroborate the lipid lowering effects of policosanol in a&#xD;
      small pilot study.&#xD;

      Policosanol, a compound derived from sugar cane wax and available in health food stores&#xD;
      across the United States, is a popular non-prescription product for treating&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia. Policosanol has been used in Cuba since 1991 to treat high cholesterol.&#xD;
      Virtually all of the published medical literature on policosanol has been authored by&#xD;
      research groups in Cuba. According to the Cuban data, policosanol can lower total&#xD;
      cholesterol, lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and raise high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Based on post-marketing surveys, this drug appears to be&#xD;
      devoid of any biochemical, hematological, or clinical adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmation of this data on policosanol by scientifically rigorous experiments and trials in&#xD;
      this country would provide a safe and effective therapeutic option for the treatment of&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia. Consequently, policosanol has the potential to become a valuable tool&#xD;
      in the fight against coronary heart disease - a major cause of mortality in the United&#xD;
      States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will assess the short-term safety and efficacy of policosanol in healthy&#xD;
      adults who have a baseline LDL-C of 130-200. The recruitment population will be derived from&#xD;
      primary care clinics consisting primarily of Caucasian and African-American patients. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measurements will be the percentage change in LDL-C. Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      include changes in total cholesterol, HDL-C, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, and&#xD;
      lipoprotein sub-particles. This will be the first known randomized clinical trial of&#xD;
      policosanol in North America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data derived from this pilot study regarding the lipid lowering effects of policosanol&#xD;
      will be used to support applications for further funding through institutions outside the&#xD;
      Carolinas Healthcare System including the National Institute of Health (NIH). Future studies&#xD;
      could include an assessment of the effects of policosanol on other markers for coronary heart&#xD;
      disease and potential use in combination with current lipid medications. The overall goal is&#xD;
      to perform a large multi-center clinical outcome trial to establish the precise clinical&#xD;
      benefits of policosanol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary: Demonstration of the lipid-lowering ability of policosanol is an initial step in&#xD;
      providing a safe, cost-effective therapy for hypercholesterolemia, thereby advancing the&#xD;
      treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease in this country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: To independently corroborate the lipid lowering effects of policosanol in a&#xD;
      small pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: After 8 weeks of therapy policosanol 40 mg/day will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Produce a statistically significant reduction in LDL-C compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provide a statistically significant reduction in LDL particle number and C-reactive&#xD;
           protein.&#xD;
