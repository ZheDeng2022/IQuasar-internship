      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing,&#xD;
      or coming back. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using&#xD;
      arzoxifene or tamoxifen may prevent breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body&#xD;
      makes. The use of arzoxifene or tamoxifen may keep breast cancer from forming in women at&#xD;
      high risk for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying arzoxifene to see how well it works&#xD;
      compared to tamoxifen or a placebo in preventing breast cancer in premenopausal women at high&#xD;
      risk for breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the effect of arzoxifene vs tamoxifen vs placebo on surrogate endpoints&#xD;
           biomarkers, especially systemic insulin-like growth factor levels, in women at high risk&#xD;
           for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the toxic effects, biologic effects, clinical pharmacology, and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
           of these drugs in these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of these drugs on surrogate endpoint biomarkers in participants&#xD;
           with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility of a chemoprevention study in participants with a strong&#xD;
           family history of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Participants are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Participants receive oral tamoxifen once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Participants receive oral arzoxifene once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III: Participants receive an oral placebo once daily. In all arms, treatment&#xD;
           continues for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
           After the completion of 6 months of treatment, participants are offered the opportunity&#xD;
           to continue treatment with their assigned study drug for an additional 6 months.&#xD;
           Participants randomized to receive placebo are offered treatment with arzoxifene for an&#xD;
           additional 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 participants will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
