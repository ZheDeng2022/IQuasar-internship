  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares outcomes and metal ion levels between patients who receive the Conserve®&#xD;
      Plus Hip System compared to those who have received a standard hip replacement in a recent&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is currently the standard of care for end-stage degenerative&#xD;
      joint disease of the hip. In this surgery, the entire joint is replaced by inserting an&#xD;
      acetabular component into the pelvis, a femoral stem down the thigh bone (which has a ball on&#xD;
      it to articulate in the acetabulum). However for the younger patient, long-term fixation and&#xD;
      the prospect of multiple revisions remain a notable concern. Long-term results of THA in this&#xD;
      patient population have been disappointing. Studies cite failure rates of 21% to 33% at less&#xD;
      than 10 years follow up. The Conserve Plus Hip System differs from total hip arthroplasty as&#xD;
      it uses less bone stock from the femoral bone. The prosthesis is designed so that the head of&#xD;
      the femoral bone is resurfaced rather than replaced. Consequently, bone stock of the femur is&#xD;
      conserved. The bone conserving nature of this implant allows the surgeon to convert to a&#xD;
      total hip arthroplasty with ease should a time arise when the patient requires revision&#xD;
      arthroplasty. The Conserve Plus Hip System is also different from the THA as the bearing&#xD;
      surface is metal on metal, rather than the conventional metal on polyethylene. This metal on&#xD;
      metal bearing surface provides lower wear. Theoretically, this type of hip replacement may be&#xD;
      a viable alternative to THA for the younger patient.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Patients who are undergoing primary hip surgery for noninflammatory degenerative joint&#xD;
        disease (NIDJD). Composite diagnoses for NIDJD include osteo/degenerative arthritis,&#xD;
        traumatic arthritis, congenital hip dysplasia, and avascular necrosis.2. Patients who are&#xD;
        skeletally mature or at least 18 years of age.3. Patients for whom there is a reasonable&#xD;
        expectation that they will be available for each examination scheduled over a two year&#xD;
        post-operative follow up period and for annual exams until the last patient entered into&#xD;
        the study has achieved two years of follow-up.4. Patients who agree to participate and sign&#xD;
        the informed consent form.5. Patients who do not meet any of the exclusion criteria.6.&#xD;
        Patients who are already enrolled in the study and present with a need for revision of the&#xD;
        metal femoral or acetabular resurfacing components. These patients may have the failed&#xD;
        component(s) revised with an investigational component.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  . Patients who are less than 18 years of age or are skeletally immature at the time of&#xD;
             surgery.2. Patients who present with inflammatory degenerative joint disease or&#xD;
             revision surgery other than that specified in the inclusion criteria.3. Patients with&#xD;

             undergone an ipsilateral hemi resurfacing, total resurfacing, total bipolar, unipolar,&#xD;
             or total hip replacement device.8. Patients with active hepatitis or HIV infection.9.&#xD;
             Patients who otherwise meet the study criteria, but refuse to consent in writing to&#xD;
             participate in the study. 10. Patients who are obese where obesity is defined as a&#xD;
             Body Mass Index (BMI) &amp;gt;35.11. Patients with neuropathic joints.12. Patients with&#xD;
             severe documented psychiatric disease.13. Patients requiring structural bone&#xD;
             grafts.14. Patients with a documented allergy to cobalt chromium molybdenum.15.&#xD;
