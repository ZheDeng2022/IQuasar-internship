  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, dose rising study in&#xD;
      Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) non-responder HCV infected patients or HCV patients who have&#xD;
      relapsed following IFN-alpha therapy. Eligible subjects must have compensated liver disease&#xD;
      and serum HCV RNA concentrations above 100,000 IU/mL at screening. The study will include&#xD;
      both a single dose period for the evaluation of acute toxicity and single dose&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and a consecutive multi-dose period for the determination of longer-term&#xD;
      safety, multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity. The objectives of this study&#xD;
      are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of escalating single and&#xD;
      multiple doses of XTL 2125 in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection and to assess&#xD;
      the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of XTL 2125&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be of a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter design with&#xD;
      sequential ascending doses of XTL 2125 in HCV-infected patients with compensated liver&#xD;
      disease who did not respond to IFN-alpha therapy or relapsed following this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include both a single dose session and a multiple dose session. In the single&#xD;
      dose session, patients will be randomized to receive a single oral dose of either XTL 2125 or&#xD;
      placebo on Day 1, in a dose-escalating design, followed by a multiple dose session that will&#xD;
      start on day 8 and will continue for 14 days. The same patients will receive XTL 2125 three&#xD;
      times daily at the same dose administered in the single dose session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following doses will be administered to groups of 8 patients each: 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg,&#xD;
      150 mg, 300 mg and 450 mg. Within each group, 6 subjects will receive XTL 2125 and 2 subjects&#xD;
      will receive placebo. No patient will be enrolled in more than one dose level. Doses should&#xD;
      be administered one hour before meals with 240 cc water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional patients may be enrolled at previous or intermediate doses to obtain additional&#xD;
      safety or pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data and to more accurately define the Maximum&#xD;
      Tolerated Dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTD will be defined as the last dose level that is successfully administered with a&#xD;
      decision to escalate to the next level. If the decision not to escalate to the next level is&#xD;
      made then a cohort that receives XTL 2125 at a dose half-way between the last tolerated dose&#xD;
      and the non-tolerated dose may be enrolled at the discretion of the Sponsor. If this dose is&#xD;
      successfully administered without violating the dose escalation rules, then this interim dose&#xD;
      will be considered the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six dose cohorts will be prospectively indicated, although additional cohorts may be&#xD;
      scheduled at intermediate doses if warranted by the data.&#xD;
