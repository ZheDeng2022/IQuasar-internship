      This pilot study tests the feasibility of using GSH redox state and high resolution proton&#xD;
      NMR spectroscopy (1H-NMR) to detect metabolic changes due to acetominophen and sulfur amino&#xD;
      acid deficiency. Our central hypothesis is that the a 2-day sulfur amino acid deficiency will&#xD;
      alter acetominophen metabolism, acetominophen will affect sulfur amino acid homeostasis, and&#xD;
      the treatments together will alter the global metabolic profile, as measured by 1H-NMR&#xD;
      spectroscopy.&#xD;

      Most occupational exposures to toxic chemicals occur in the context of complex mixtures,&#xD;
      often in combination with varied diet, prescription drug use and disease. In principle,&#xD;
      information-rich metabolic analyses provide an approach to study toxicologic consequences of&#xD;
      such complex chemical interactions by revealing metabolic perturbations before irreversible&#xD;
      injury occurs. This pilot study tests the feasibility of using GSH redox state and high&#xD;
      resolution proton NMR spectroscopy (1H-NMR) to detect metabolic changes due to chemical&#xD;
      interactions. The proposed model involves interaction of chemical exposure (2 doses of&#xD;
      acetaminophen, APAP, 15 mg/kg) and 2 days of sulfur amino acid- (SAA-) free diet. 30% of APAP&#xD;
      metabolism occurs through pathways dependent upon SAA metabolites and up to 50% of the RDA&#xD;
      for SAA is needed to metabolize 2 doses of APAP. Both treatments are without toxicity in&#xD;
      humans and both affect GSH homeostasis, which will be assessed in vivo by plasma&#xD;
      measurements. Inter-individual variation will be minimized with each individual being his/her&#xD;
      own control. Environmental and dietary influences will be controlled in a clinical research&#xD;
      unit. Aim 1 is to determine whether SAA-free diet and APAP independently perturb GSH redox&#xD;
      homeostasis. Aim 2 is to determine whether APAP intake interacts with SAA-free diet in&#xD;
      affecting GSH redox state. Aim 3 is to use 1H-NMR spectroscopy to determine whether exposure&#xD;
      to APAP and SAA-free diet interact in their effects on metabolic profile. The results will&#xD;
      provide key data on the suitability and sensitivity of redox measurements and 1H-NMR&#xD;
      spectroscopy for study of chemical interactions. This could provide a foundation for the use&#xD;
      of perturbation of metabolic profile as a means to identify risks and consequences of complex&#xD;
      chemical mixtures which would be especially relevant to occupational exposures in combination&#xD;
      with therapeutic drugs and other health risk factors.&#xD;
