    <textblock>
      Postoperative organ failures commonly occur after major abdominal surgery and substantially&#xD;
      increase the utilization of resources and the costs of care, and are favored by tissue&#xD;
      hypoxia. A therapeutic strategy designed to detect and reverse tissue hypoxia, as diagnosed&#xD;
      by an increase of oxygen extraction over a pre-defined threshold could decrease the incidence&#xD;
      of organ failures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The development of postoperative organ failures severely affects the prognosis of surgical&#xD;
      patients, and substantially increases the utilization of resources and the costs of care. The&#xD;
      presence of tissue hypoxia is particularly common and likely results from an impairment of&#xD;
      the adaptive mechanisms of myocardial function, leading to an inappropriately low cardiac&#xD;
      output and from the effects of inflammatory mediators. Importantly, tissue hypoxia can be&#xD;
      detected early. Indeed, hypoxic tissues will compensate the hypoperfusion by increasing&#xD;
      oxygen extraction (O2ER) over a threshold value, a change that will also be reflected by a&#xD;
      decreased venous oxygen saturation, and if uncompensated by lactic acidosis. Hence, the use&#xD;
      of oxygen extraction calculated from arterial and central venous oxygen saturation as a&#xD;
      therapeutic goal is appropriate to monitor goal-directed hemodynamic strategies, as it&#xD;
      reflects the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption. In place of O2ER or its&#xD;
      surrogate, mixed venous oxygen saturation, the use of oxygen-derived values measured in&#xD;
      central blood drawn from the routinely placed central line, in place of pulmonary artery&#xD;
      catheter, may represent a valuable alternative. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that a&#xD;
      multifaceted goal-directed strategy, including fluid challenge, blood transfusion and&#xD;
      inotropes titrated to keep central venous oxygen saturation higher than a predetermined&#xD;
      threshold of 70% was associated with decreased mortality and rate of organ failures when&#xD;
      applied from the early phase of septic shock or severe sepsis. The aim of the present&#xD;
      multicentre prospective randomized study was to compare the outcomes of patients randomized&#xD;
      to a conventional management or to a therapeutic strategy guided by O2ER estimate (O2ERe)&#xD;
      calculated from the arterial oxygen saturation and the central venous saturation ScvO2.&#xD;
      Specifically, we hypothesized that the use of a goal-directed protocol aimed at maintaining&#xD;
      the O2ERe below a previously defined &quot;critical&quot; (able to discriminate survivors from&#xD;
      non-survivors) value of 26.7% during surgical interventions in high-risk patients will reduce&#xD;
      the rate of postoperative organ failures, hospital length of stay and mortality, as compared&#xD;
      with the standard management based on the monitoring of mean arterial pressure, central&#xD;
      venous pressure and urine output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High Risk surgical patients scheduled for elective abdominal extensive surgery were eligible.&#xD;
      After enrollment, the patients were randomized to one of the two groups of treatment (A or B)&#xD;
      by a phone system on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week basis. Randomization was based on a&#xD;
      permuted-block algorithm, allowing stratification for each center. The exclusion criteria&#xD;
      from the study were : age below 16 years, preexistent neurologic, or malignant haematologic&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for surgery, the patients were equipped with central and peripheral venous and&#xD;
      arterial catheters. Standard monitoring included continuous recording of electrocardiography;&#xD;
      body temperature, heart rate, pulse oxymetry and arterial blood pressure. Central venous&#xD;
      pressure, ScvO2 , arterial blood gases, lactate concentration, body temperature, and urine&#xD;
      output were recorded hourly. Hemoglobin concentration was measured when deemed necessary by&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist. For the purpose of the study, blood gases measured on arterial and&#xD;
      central venous samples, arterial lactate and O2ERe (SaO2-ScvO2/SaO2 [SaO2 : arterial oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, ScvO2 : central venous saturation]) were recorded after induction of anesthesia&#xD;
      (T0), hourly after cutaneous incision (T1a-f), throughout surgery, during the first 6 hours&#xD;
      of the postoperative period (T2a-f) and on postoperative day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, the patients were managed to achieve predefined standard goals, i.e. a meen&#xD;
      arterial pressure (MAP) &gt;80 mmHg and an urine output &gt; 0.5ml/kg/h. The patients of the&#xD;
      &quot;protocol group&quot; (Group A) were managed to keep O2ER below 26.7%, following algorithms&#xD;
      detailed in figure 1. In brief, a fluid challenge (colloids 250-1000 ml infused over 30 min&#xD;
      to restore central venous pressure to at least 10 mmHg), dobutamine (incremental doses of 3&#xD;
      µg/kg/min up to 15 µg/kg/min) and/or packed red cells (in cases of hemoglobin below 10 g/dl&#xD;
      or intraoperative hemorrhage &gt; 1000 ml) could be administered. There was no specific&#xD;
      requirement regarding the type of anesthesia in any of the groups.&#xD;
