      To evaluate the trough and peak effect of once daily MICARDIS PLUS (Telmisartan 80&#xD;
      mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) by 24 ABPM in patients with mild to moderate essential&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as an open label study. After a 2-week placebo run-in phase, qualified&#xD;
      patients will be administered with telmisartan 80mg for 2 weeks, then forcefully titrated to&#xD;
      telmisartan 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg fixed dose combination for 6 weeks. 24 hour&#xD;
      ABPM will be performed at the end of placebo run-in period (baseline) and after 8 weeks of&#xD;
      active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analyses will be the calculation of trough to peak ratios (T/P ratios) for DBP&#xD;
      and SBP. The T/P ratio will be calculated on the basis of changes in hourly means (related to&#xD;
      dosing time) from baseline (DeltaHM). Trough is defined as the mean of the last three hours&#xD;
      of the 24-hour dosing interval. Peak is the greatest reduction in hourly means in hours 2 to&#xD;
      8 after dosing. Thus, T/P is calculated as T/P = mean(DeltaHM22 - DeltaHM24)/min (DeltaHM2 -&#xD;
      DeltaHM8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess trough/peak ratio of once daily Micardis plus by 24 ABPM in patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate essential hypertension.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension defined by a mean seated DBP &gt;= 95&#xD;
             and &lt;= 109 mmHg, and SBP &lt; 180mmHg measured by manual cuff sphygmomanometer at visit&#xD;
             2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: The manual cuff value is calculated as the mean of three seated measurements&#xD;
             collected 2 minutes apart, after the patient has been seated quietly for 5 minutes.&#xD;
             For calculation of mean values by the investigator, decimal places should be rounded&#xD;
             to integers as usual (e.g., a DBP of 94.7 would be rounded to 95 mmHg and a DBP of&#xD;
             109.3 would be rounded to 109 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants between 18 and 80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ability to provide written informed consent. 4.24 hour mean DBP &gt;= 85 mmHg at visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5.Ability to stop any current antihypertensive therapy without risk to the patient&#xD;
        (investigators discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients taking more than three anti-hypertensive medications at the screening visit.&#xD;

                  birth control include IUD, oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives.&#xD;
