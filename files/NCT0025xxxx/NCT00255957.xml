  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of HES has been found clinically to improve patients with stroke if administered&#xD;
      within a window period by means of hemodilution to improve rehology. We propose to see the&#xD;
      effects of long term administraion of HES in the amounts required for treating stroke&#xD;
      patients and study the effects on the kinetics of HES, its effects on coagulation and&#xD;
      hemorheology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stroke benefit with hemodilution when administered HES in a window period and&#xD;
      continued for a period of 10 days. Hemodilution improves the hemorheology and thus possibly&#xD;
      preserves the cerebral tissues in the penumbra regions of affected vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to see the effects of prolonged administration of HES from different makes and&#xD;
      study the kinetics, hemorehology and coagulation parameters by TEG as there is no literature&#xD;
      on kinetics and coagulation follwing prolonged use in stroke patients and also study their&#xD;
      neurological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting to the Emergency department or outpatient department within 24 hrs of&#xD;
      manifestation of symptoms will be recruited to the study after taking informed consent in a&#xD;
      language the patients/ family understand by the study personnel identified and authorized to&#xD;
      do the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will then be randomly allocated to receive HES of either make for 10 day with 10&#xD;
      patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization is by random number generation by computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product is blinded to the patient and observer by black cover with only the label A OR B&#xD;
      of each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples will be drawn at time of randomization, after 3, 5 and 10 days for rehological,&#xD;
      coagulation effects and kinetics of HES, stored as per requirements and analyzed. Routine&#xD;
      biochemical tests as prescribed by the physician will be undertaken as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satistical analysis of data will be done by SPSS.&#xD;
