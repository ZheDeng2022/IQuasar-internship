      The purpose of this study is to develop a modular treatment program for cannabis use&#xD;
      disorders and the evaluation of the effectiveness in a controlled clinical study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in the whole Western world and&#xD;
      rates are further rising. Almost 240.000 adult Germans fulfill DSM-IV criteria for cannabis&#xD;
      dependence and 140.000 the criteria for cannabis abuse (past 12-month), respectively. Several&#xD;
      studies have revealed a considerable degree of unmet needs for intervention and treatment for&#xD;
      cannabis disorders, for example in terms of associated physical, mental health, social and&#xD;
      legal problems. The epidemiological significance of the problem is contrasted sharply with&#xD;
      (1) strongly increasing treatment demand due to cannabis-related problems, (2) the lack of&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions (motivational and early treatment) (3) the lack of specific&#xD;
      services, and (4) the lack of treatment programs and components with established efficacy.&#xD;
      With regard to treatment research there is a marked deficit with only a handful of studies up&#xD;
      to date. Only in the US and Australia, some recent effort was undertaken to develop and&#xD;
      evaluate cannabis-specific dependence treatment programs in controlled trials with highly&#xD;
      selective samples. However, there are currently no 'state of the art' benchmark programs&#xD;
      neither in Germany nor in other European countries that are suitable for routine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims. (1) To develop a modular treatment program (ST/TST) for cannabis use disorders based on&#xD;
      treatment packages and components that have been shown to be effective in previous US and&#xD;
      Australian trials, and to adapt these material to the needs of our target population. (2) To&#xD;
      demonstrate that this modular treatment package, implying motivational enhancement,&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral and psychosocial problem solving components is efficacious in comparison&#xD;
      to a delayed treatment control (DTC) group. (3) Additionally, we test whether the targeted&#xD;
      standardized treatment (TST) component tailored to address more specifically core problem&#xD;
      areas results in superior short term (3-months) outcomes in these core domains as compared to&#xD;
      the ST-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. A randomized controlled intervention study is proposed. A total of 210 participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to two, respectively three study conditions: 1. ST (n=70) including&#xD;
      motivational enhancement, cognitive-behavioral, and psychosocial problem solving treatment&#xD;
      components, 2. TST (n=70), including the same components as the ST but partly individually&#xD;
      matched to the specific problem profile of the patient, and (c) a delayed treatment control&#xD;
      group (DTC, n=70). Core outcome variables are total quit rates, number of cannabis use in the&#xD;
      past 4 weeks, decrease in ASI scores and retention rate. The core hypothesis will be tested&#xD;
      in the combined ST/TST group (n=140). The ASI serves for the allocation algorithms in the TST&#xD;
      group and serves as outcome measure for the 3rd hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is innovative and will result in a considerable advancement of our&#xD;
      knowledge about effective treatments in cannabis disorders and will inform about the value of&#xD;
      targeted individualized allocation.&#xD;
