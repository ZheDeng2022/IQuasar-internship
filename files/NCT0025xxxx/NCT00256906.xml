  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isolated mild fetal ventriculomegaly is a common finding in fetal ultrasound examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the ventricular diameter is more than 15 mm it is usually considered as severe and&#xD;
      connected to other malformations. Most of these children will be severely affected later in&#xD;
      life. Less than 10 mm ventricular width considered as normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current medical knowledge can not answer questions regarding future development of&#xD;
      children who were diagnosed to suffer from mild (10-14.9 mm) brain ventriculomegaly during&#xD;
      the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to assess the development and neurological status of all children who were&#xD;
      diagnosed as &quot;mild ventriculomegaly&quot; during the pregnancy in the last 6 years and to&#xD;
      prospectively follow up all the children who will be diagnosed from the beginning of the&#xD;
      study on for 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that the course of their development is different than of other children.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All children who are currently 5-6 year-old who suffered from isolated fetal mild brain&#xD;
           ventriculomegaly during the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All children who will be diagnosed with isolated fetal mild brain ventriculomegaly&#xD;
           during the pregnancy from the beginning of the study for 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All children will be examined by a pediatric neurologist who will perform a&#xD;
           neuro-developmental assessment appropriate for age. The neurologist will decide&#xD;
           individually whether there is a need for more medical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All children will be assessed by a psychologist who will perform WIPPSI or BAYLEY tests&#xD;
           according to age.&#xD;
