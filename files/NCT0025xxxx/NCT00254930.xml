      The purpose of this study is to assess whether risperidone (an antipsychotic medication) is&#xD;
      safe and effective in treating behaviour disorder in learning disabled children, which does&#xD;
      not improve with psychological therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is a high incidence of behaviour disorder in people who are learning disabled. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to assess whether risperidone is safe and effective in the treatment&#xD;
      of learning disabled children diagnosed with behaviour disorder, which does not improve with&#xD;
      psychological therapy. If the learning disability is very severe, or the behaviour disorder&#xD;
      is very severe, such therapy is not appropriate and thus is not attempted; these patients are&#xD;
      nevertheless eligible to participate in the study. At the beginning of treatment, the dose of&#xD;
      risperidone is titrated, by gradual increase from 0.25 mg/day up to a maximum of 4 mg/day,&#xD;
      based on therapeutic response, with decreases allowed in case of adverse reactions. Patients&#xD;
      will be assessed over six months. The primary measure of effectiveness is the change compared&#xD;
      to baseline in the total score on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC). The EPSS is used to&#xD;
      monitor the appearance of extrapyramidal symptoms. Based on results from other studies and&#xD;
      the differences observed as a result of treatment, the investigator and his team expect to be&#xD;
      able to detect a statistically and clinically significant result if data are available for 15&#xD;
      evaluable patients. Twenty patients will be recruited, taking account of possible drop outs.&#xD;
      0.25 mg of risperidone per day, taken orally, up to a maximum daily dose of 4 mg/day, for a&#xD;
      treatment period of 6 months.&#xD;
