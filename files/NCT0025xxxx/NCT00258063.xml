  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to estimate exposure to the hormones norelgestromin,&#xD;
      norgestrel, and ethinyl estradiol in healthy female volunteers across multiple commercial&#xD;
      lots of EVRAÂ® (a transdermal contraceptive patch manufactured by LOHMANN Therapie-Systeme),&#xD;
      to compare these data to exposure data from one clinical lot, and to compare these data to&#xD;
      exposure data from a commercially available oral contraceptive.&#xD;

      This single-center, open-label, randomized, partially-balanced, incomplete block design study&#xD;
      will consist of a pre-treatment phase (a screening period lasting up to 21 days), an&#xD;
      open-label treatment phase (three 7-day treatment periods separated by 21-day washouts), and&#xD;
      a post-treatment phase (a follow-up or early withdrawal visit). Total participation in the&#xD;
      study is approximately 67 days. Approximately 54 subjects will be enrolled. The study&#xD;
      population comprises healthy women, ages 18 to 45 years inclusive, who weigh at least 110&#xD;
      pounds, have a body mass index (BMI) between 16 and 29.9 kg per meter squared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will wear an EVRA® patch or take CILEST® during each of the three 7-day treatment&#xD;
      periods; treatment periods will be separated by a 21-day washout period. When a subject is to&#xD;
      wear EVRA®, a patch from 1 of the 6 selected commercial lots will be applied on the buttock&#xD;
      and worn for 7 days. Patches will be applied by the investigator or designated study unit&#xD;
      personnel. All patches will be worn on the upper outer quadrant of the same buttock, but not&#xD;
      necessarily in the exact same position. The investigator or designated study unit personnel&#xD;
      will remove the patches and will evaluate the adhesion of the patches before removal. When a&#xD;
      subject is to receive CILEST®, tablets from 1 of the 3 selected commercial lots will be&#xD;
      administered daily for 7 consecutive days. A minimum of 21 days after removal of the patch or&#xD;
      the seventh dose of CILEST®, the subject will begin another treatment period, until she&#xD;
      completes 3 open-label treatment periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be confined to the study unit for blood sample collections for determination of&#xD;
      NGMN, NG, and EE plasma concentrations. Blood samples will be collected (via venipuncture)&#xD;
      immediately before each dose and at specified time points after each dose is administered.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters of NGMN, NG, and EE, including Cmax, tmax, and AUC, after each&#xD;
      treatment will be estimated by standard methods. Safety will be assessed throughout the&#xD;
      study, and will be based on adverse events and changes in physical and gynecologic&#xD;
      examinations (including breast examinations), vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and&#xD;
      clinical laboratory test results. Three 7-day treatment periods; treatments separated by&#xD;
      21-day washout. Based on the randomization schedule, some subjects will wear an EVRA® patch&#xD;
      in all 3 periods (on the upper outer quadrant of the buttock for 7 days), some will wear a&#xD;
      patch in 2 periods and take CILEST® oral tablets once daily in 1 period, and some will wear a&#xD;
      patch in 1 period and take CILEST® oral tablets once daily in 2 periods.&#xD;
