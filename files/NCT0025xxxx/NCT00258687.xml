  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if a vaccine made from the patient's own tumor cells,&#xD;
      then genetically modified to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor&#xD;
      (GM-CSF), will delay or stop the growth of the tumor. It will also look at the vaccine's&#xD;
      effects on the immune system and the side effects of giving a vaccine made from a subject's&#xD;
      own cancer cells.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient will have surgery to remove a portion of the tumor. This tumor is then brought to&#xD;
      a special, certified laboratory where it is broken up into single cells and then washed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specially trained laboratory technicians then use a method known as adenoviral mediated gene&#xD;
      transfer, which adds a new gene to the cancer calls. This gene causes the cells to make&#xD;
      GM-CSF, a powerful hormone that stimulates the immune system. The cells are then given enough&#xD;
      radiation so that they will never grow, but not enough to completely destroy them, developing&#xD;
      a vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is then injected with the vaccine on days 0, 7, 14, 28, and then every two weeks&#xD;
      until the supply of vaccine has run out. The amount of vaccine that can be made depends upon&#xD;
      the total amount of cells taken from the tumor. The actual injections are like childhood&#xD;
      vaccinations that go under the skin or into muscle and a different place will be used for&#xD;
      each injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that the cancer cells that have been made to secrete the hormone GM-CSF will&#xD;
      cause the patient's immune system to attack the cancer in other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the tumor yields enough cells, the patient will also be given an injection of&#xD;
      non-transduced irradiated tumor cells. Non-transduced means that the gene for GM-CSF has not&#xD;
      been added to these cells as it has for the vaccines. This is done to measure the amount of&#xD;
      reaction of the immune system caused by the vaccine. This injection is measuring delayed type&#xD;
      hypersensitivity, or DTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be asked to undergo optional skin biopsies of the vaccine and DTH sites to&#xD;
      see if an immune reaction is occuring at the injection sites 2 days after vaccine 1 and&#xD;
      vaccine 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be performed through out the study: physical exam,&#xD;
      blood samples, immune studies, vital signs and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 10 in the patient's treatment, or earlier if the doctor feels it is necessary, the&#xD;
      patient will undergo a chest, abdomen and pelvic XT scan. A brain MRI will be performed if&#xD;
      there were any abnormalities on the first brain MRI or if any new central nervous system&#xD;
      symptoms have developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient's disease has not disappeared or if new lesions have been found after the&#xD;
      patient receives at least six vaccines, they may have the opportunity to undergo a second&#xD;
      course of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may participate in this study until one of the following happens: All vaccine&#xD;
      created from the tumor has been given to the patient; the patient's disease worsens; the&#xD;
      patient experiences an unacceptable and/or harmful side effect; the patient becomes pregnant;&#xD;
      the patient is unable to follow the study plan; or the patient's doctor feels it is no longer&#xD;
      in the best interest of the patient to continue.&#xD;
