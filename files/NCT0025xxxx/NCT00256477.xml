      The main aim of this project is to evaluate the use of a specific Yoga technique of&#xD;
      controlled breathing in Vietnam War Veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder. This&#xD;
      method is currently the subject of a United States grant application to formally test&#xD;
      American War Veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq. Drs Gerbarg and Brown are collaborating with&#xD;
      The Bay Pines Veterans Administration Medical Center in Florida to develop a study of this&#xD;
      course for treatment of American veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. Elements of&#xD;
      this method have been used on a variety of populations. Whilst this is a multi-component&#xD;
      intervention, it is postulated that the most active ingredient in the program is a specific&#xD;
      Yoga breathing technique called Sudarshan Kriya (SK).&#xD;

&#xD;
      This program has been developed by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, chief yoga teacher and Head of The&#xD;
      Art of Living Foundation (Ravishankar 2002). Further, this method has been applied widely for&#xD;
      the treatment of Acute Stress Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in individual cases&#xD;
      (Gerbarg and Brown 2005Direct communication). For example, this controlled breathing program&#xD;
      has been reported to have relieved posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in large groups of&#xD;
      people affected by mass disasters such as war (Kosovo, Bosnia, Iraq and Sudan) (Biswas 2004;&#xD;
      Joseph 2004; Luedemann 2004), terrorism (New York City 9/11) (Anonymous 2001b), (Kashmir,&#xD;
      India, Israel) and natural disasters (Gujurat earthquake, 2000) (Anonymous 2001a) Iran flood,&#xD;
      Asian Tsunami. This controlled breathing program is reported to have also helped police&#xD;
      (Slovenia, India, Washington, DC) and military personnel (Iraq) (cited in Gerbarg and Brown&#xD;
      2004), (Gerbarg 2005Personal communication). Pilot studies conducted by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator using similar techniques showed positive health results for Vietnam Veterans&#xD;
      with PTSD in Australia (Carter and Byrne 2004). However, although randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      have been performed for depression with good effect&#xD;
