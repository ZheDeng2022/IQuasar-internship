      This study will evaluate the contraceptive effectiveness of cellulose sulfate vaginal gel in&#xD;
      preventing pregnancy when used for 6 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cellulose sulfate has been shown in preclinical studies to have both contraceptive and&#xD;
      antimicrobial properties. Clinical safety studies have shown it to be safe for use up to six&#xD;
      days in women and 7 days in men, and ongoing studies are assessing its safety for twice daily&#xD;
      use for 14 days in women. This study will evaluate its contraceptive effectiveness in women&#xD;
      who use it for 6 months.&#xD;
