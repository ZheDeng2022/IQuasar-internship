    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized study in patients with advanced non-squamous&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle will be 21 days. Patients will be evaluated every 2 cycles (~6 weeks) for response&#xD;
      using RECIST criteria. Those patients achieving stable disease or better will continue&#xD;
      therapy. Those patients experiencing progressive disease will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 6 cycles of Eloxatin, Alimta, and Bevacizumab. After the 6 cycles,&#xD;
      patients will receive Bevacizumab alone every 21 days until evidence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Once patient has completed the 6 cycles of Eloxatin, Alimta, and Bevacizumab and is&#xD;
      receiving single-agent Bevacizumab, assessment of response will be performed every 3 cycles&#xD;
      (~every 9 weeks) using RECIST criteria.&#xD;
