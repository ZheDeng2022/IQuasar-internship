  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunological differences between three&#xD;
      RagweedMATAMPL treatment arms compared to placebo with respect to immunoglobulin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study will assess the reduced allergenicity of modified Ragweed Pollen&#xD;
