  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to compare different treatment options for lateral&#xD;
      epicondylitis. Lateral epicondylitis is a pain condition involving extensor muscles fo the&#xD;
      forearm originating from the lateral epicondyle. Controversy exists regarding the method of&#xD;
      delivering pain relief so that conditioning and strengthening can be initiated and progress&#xD;
      appropriately. Our hypothesis is that the steady even delivery via iontophoresis (compared to&#xD;
      injection will provide better pain control and allow physical therapy to progress more&#xD;
      effectively.&#xD;

      Therapy is standardized so treatment can begin before enrollment in the study. Patients who&#xD;
      decide not to participate will get standard therapy. Therapy is based on the published&#xD;
      Indiana Hand Center protocol. Phase 1 is rest, phase 2 is mobility and phase 3 is&#xD;
      strengthening. Patients who agree to participate will be randomized to either the injection&#xD;
      or iontopatch group after informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1 (injection) Patients seen by physician. Based upon history and physical examination,&#xD;
      injection wil be offered. Injection is 10 mg dexamethasone intramuscular. Therapy then is&#xD;
      continued per standard protocol. Patient monitored for worsening of symptoms. If the patient&#xD;
      worsens, the patient will be placed back into phase 1 and 2 for another 3 weeks then advanced&#xD;
      again. Repeat injection will be at discretion of the treating physician. Patients with more&#xD;
      than 2 injections wil be disqualified from the study and considered a treatment failure.&#xD;
      Patients that injections wil be disqualified from the study and considered a treatment&#xD;
      failure. Patients that completed phase 3 will be released from therapy with home management&#xD;
      program instructions. Restrictions will be at the discretion of the physician. After 2&#xD;
      failures to progress to phase 3, the patient will be considered a failure of treatment. In&#xD;
      the event of relapse after successful completion of therapy, the protocol will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2 (iontopatch) One volt patch with dexamethasone phosphate will be used.Patient will be&#xD;
      treated with one patch every 2 days for a total of 3 patches. Application will be per the&#xD;
      Birchpoint Medical Group Iontopatch 80 protocol. The patches will correlate with physical&#xD;
      therapy phases 1 and 2. Phase 3 will not begin until the Iontopatch has been off for more&#xD;
      than 24 hours. Therapy will progress based on the above protocol. If there is worsening of&#xD;
      symptoms, the patient will be placed back to phase 1 and 2 for another 3 weeks and then&#xD;
      advanced again. Iontopatches can be repeated if there has been a substantial worsening of&#xD;
      symptoms. Patients are eligible for up to 6 patches for the duration of the study. Once the 6&#xD;
      patches have been used, therapy can continue per protocol but without iontopatch and/or&#xD;
      injection. Patients that completed phase 3 will be released from therapy. After 2 failures to&#xD;
      progress to phase 3, the patient will be considered a failure of treatment. Long term&#xD;
      restrictions will be at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete a Forearm Pain Questionnaire at the time of enrollment, at completion&#xD;
      of therapy and monthly after that for 3 months. This is a standardized published&#xD;
      questionnaire specifically designed to identify and track lateral epicondylitis patients.&#xD;
