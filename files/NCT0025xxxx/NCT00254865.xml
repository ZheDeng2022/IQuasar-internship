  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the levels of the hormones norelgestromin,&#xD;
      norgestrel, and ethinyl estradiol in the bloodstream of healthy female volunteers&#xD;
      administered ORTHO EVRAÂ® (a transdermal contraceptive patch) and CILESTÂ® (an oral&#xD;
      contraceptive). The open-label treatment phase of the study consists of two 28-day cycles of&#xD;
      one treatment, a washout period of 28 days, and crossover to two 28-day cycles of the other&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ORTHO EVRA® is a combination, monophasic transdermal contraceptive patch containing 6 mg of&#xD;
      norelgestromin (NGMN) and 0.75 mg of ethinyl estradiol (EE), and delivering to the systemic&#xD;
      circulation an average of 150 µg/day of NGMN and 20 µg/day of EE. CILEST® is an oral&#xD;
      contraceptive tablet containing 250 µg of norgestimate (NGM) and 35 µg of ethinyl estradiol&#xD;
      (EE). Although the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of the active serum progestin and estrogen&#xD;
      analytes following administration of the ORTHO EVRA® formulation and OrthoCyclen (same as&#xD;
      CILEST®) has been evaluated previously in separate studies, the multiple dose&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated in a comparative manner in a single study. The&#xD;
      present study is designed to directly compare the total exposure and pharmacokinetics, over&#xD;
      comparable time intervals (Week 1 of Cycle 1 and Week 3 of Cycle 2), of NGMN, NG, and EE from&#xD;
      ORTHO EVRA® and CILEST® in a single study, designed as a randomized, crossover study. Since&#xD;
      EVRA® is worn for 7 days and CILEST® is a once-daily tablet, pharmacokinetics will be&#xD;
      estimated over different time periods ORTHO EVRA® (7 days) and CILEST® (Days 1 and/or 7 of a&#xD;
      7 day period) during each cycle. Pharmacodynamic parameters of estrogenicity are determined&#xD;
      and compared to assist in the interpretation of the pharmacokinetic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, randomized, open-label, two-way crossover, pharmacokinetic study of&#xD;
      ORTHO EVRA® and CILEST®. The subject population is to be comprised of 32 healthy female&#xD;
      volunteers between the ages of 18 and 48 years and having a body mass index (BMI) between&#xD;
      18.0 and 29.9 kg per meter squared. The study consists of a pretreatment phase (a screening&#xD;
      period up to 21 days), an open-label treatment phase (two 28-day cycles of 1 treatment, a&#xD;
      washout period of 28 days, and cross-over to two 28-day cycles of the other treatment), and a&#xD;
      post-treatment phase (a follow-up or early withdrawal visit). Treatment Day 1 is the first&#xD;
      day of menses, or within 5 days after the first day of menses. In one treatment period,&#xD;
      subjects wear an ORTHO EVRA® patch on their abdomen or buttock (based on the randomization&#xD;
      schedule) applied once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks during each of two 28-day cycles. ORTHO&#xD;
      EVRA® will be applied and removed by the investigator (or designated study personnel), on&#xD;
      Days 1 (application only), 8, 15, and 22 (removal only) of each cycle. In the other treatment&#xD;
      period, subjects take CILEST® tablets once daily for the first 21 days of each cycle for two&#xD;
      28-day cycles. CILEST tablets will be administered to the subject with 225 mL (7.5 oz) of&#xD;
      water by the investigator or designated personnel on Days 1 through 8 of Cycle 1 and Days 18&#xD;
      through 21 of Cycle 2. On days when the subject is not required to be at the study unit, the&#xD;
      subject will self-dose at home (on Days 9 through 21 of Cycle 1 and Days 1 through 17 of&#xD;
      Cycle 2). Neither the ORTHO EVRA® patch nor CILEST® tablets are used on Days 22 to 28 (the&#xD;
      4th week) of any cycle, during which subjects may experience withdrawal bleeding. The total&#xD;
      duration of the open-label treatment phase is approximately 5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is a comparison of the total exposure and pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      based on comparable intervals, of NGMN, NG, and EE. Blood samples will be drawn during Week 1&#xD;
      of Cycle 1 and Week 3 of Cycle 2 for analysis of plasma NGMN (total and anti and syn&#xD;
      isomers), NG, and EE concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters, such as Cmax, tmax, and AUC&#xD;
      will be estimated by non-compartmental methods. Safety is assessed by monitoring for the&#xD;
      incidence and severity of adverse event reports, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs,&#xD;
      physical and gynecological examination and an electrocardiogram (ECG). The expectation is&#xD;
      that the ratios of exposure between these products and of the ratios of NG/NGMN between these&#xD;
      products will be similar. However, the confidence intervals around these ratios are not&#xD;
      required to fall within 80-125%. Treatment 1: ORTHO EVRA® transdermal patch, applied once&#xD;
      weekly for 3 consecutive weeks of each cycle for two 28-day cycles. Treatment 2: CILEST®&#xD;
      tablets, taken once daily by mouth for 21 consecutive days of each cycle, for two 28-day&#xD;
      cycles. There is a 28-day washout between treatments.&#xD;
