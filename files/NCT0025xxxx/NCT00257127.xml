  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine immune system function following vaccination in&#xD;
      HIV-infected children currently taking anti-HIV drugs. To test the effectiveness of prior&#xD;
      vaccination, patients in this study will receive booster shots of one of two pneumococcal&#xD;
      vaccines, a hepatitis B vaccine, and a measles vaccine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With their immunocompromised status, HIV-infected children are at especially high risk for&#xD;
      opportunistic infections, including infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae, hepatitis B, and&#xD;
      measles. In PACTG P1024, HIV-infected children taking highly active antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (HAART) received 2 doses of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), 1 dose of the&#xD;
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV), and booster shots of the hepatitis B vaccine (HBV)&#xD;
      and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). Early responses to these vaccinations were&#xD;
      favorable, but with declining antibody responses within the 18 months after vaccination. It&#xD;
      is unknown if additional booster vaccinations in these children will result in a protective&#xD;
      immunologic memory upon re-exposure to these pathogens. This study will determine whether&#xD;
      HIV-infected children on HAART have evidence of specific immunologic memory 3 to 4 years&#xD;
      after vaccination in PACTG P1024.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive PCV or PPV at study entry. All eligible&#xD;
      patients will also receive HBV and MMR at study entry. Patients will be monitored in the&#xD;
      clinic for 1 hour after vaccination for any adverse effects. Study staff will contact&#xD;
      patients by phone around Day 3 after study entry to ask patients if they have experienced any&#xD;
      adverse effects to the vaccinations; patients who received MMR at study entry will be&#xD;
      contacted again around Day 21. Some patients may be asked to return to the clinic for further&#xD;
      evaluation if they experience side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be study visits at study entry and Days 7 and 28. Medical history, a physical&#xD;
      exam, blood collection, and an assessment of HIV-related symptoms will occur at all visits.&#xD;
      HAART will not be provided by this study.&#xD;
