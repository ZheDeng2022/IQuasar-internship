  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate epidermal nerve fiber (ENF) regeneration and&#xD;
      normalization of peripheral sensory nerve function over time in normal healthy volunteers&#xD;
      following a 60 minute application of Capsaicin Dermal Patch (NGX 4010; capsaicin 640 mcg/cm2)&#xD;
      as compared to comparable untreated skin areas (control).The objectives of this study are: 1)&#xD;
      To assess the difference between patch-treated and comparable untreated skin areas (control)&#xD;
      in ENFD as quantified by PGP 9.5 immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy samples obtained&#xD;
      at 1, 12 and 24 weeks following a 60 minute application; 2) To assess the difference between&#xD;
      patch-treated and comparable untreated skin areas (control) for thermal detection thresholds&#xD;
      as assessed by QST at 1, 12 and 24 weeks following a 60 minute application; and, 3) To assess&#xD;
      the difference between patch-treated and comparable untreated skin areas (control) in&#xD;
      mechanical (sharp pain) sensation and tactile threshold at 1, 12 and 24 weeks following a 60&#xD;
      minute application.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, single center, phase 1 study in normal healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Each subject will have a 60 minute exposure to two 5.0 × 5.5 cm NGX-4010 patches.&#xD;
      In addition, two 5.0 × 5.5 cm comparable untreated control skin areas will be identified and&#xD;
      evaluated. At baseline and prior to skin punch biopsy at Weeks 1 (± 1 day), 12 (± 3 days) and&#xD;
      24 (± 7 days), QST of patch-treated and untreated control skin areas will be performed and&#xD;
      evaluated. QST for cooling detection threshold and heat-pain threshold, and assessment of&#xD;
      mechanical (sharp pain) sensation and tactile threshold will be performed at each of the two&#xD;
      patch-treated and two untreated control skin areas. Serial skin punch biopsies of&#xD;
      patch-treated and untreated control skin areas will be obtained and evaluated at Weeks 1 (± 1&#xD;
      day), 12 (± 3 days), and 24 (± 7 days). Skin at the patch-treated and untreated control skin&#xD;
      areas will be anesthetized with subcutaneous 1% lidocaine, and then three millimeter (mm)&#xD;
      skin biopsies will be obtained with a sterile punch tool from each of the designated areas.&#xD;
      Biopsy specimens will be fixed overnight, then cryoprotected in a phosphate buffered solution&#xD;
      until processed. Thick sections will be cut and immunostained for localization and&#xD;
      quantification of nerve fibers in the epidermis and visualization of the subepidermal plexus&#xD;
      using antibodies to PGP 9.5. Antibodies to type IV collagen will be used to identify the&#xD;
      basement membrane and superficial blood vessels in the biopsy microsections. Vital signs and&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) will be collected at each visit. Clinical laboratory tests will be&#xD;
      performed at the Screening Visit and at the Termination Visit (Week 24).&#xD;
