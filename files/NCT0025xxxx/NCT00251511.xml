    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized study in patients with low, intermediate-1,&#xD;
      intermediate-2, or high-risk MDS (defined by IPSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle of treatment will be 6 weeks in length. Patients will be evaluated every 6 weeks&#xD;
      for response. Patients will be treated for a minimum of 12 weeks even in the absence of&#xD;
      response. Following 12 weeks of treatment, patients will continue to receive study treatment&#xD;
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To be eligible for the study, patients must fulfill all of the following criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Patients with low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high-risk MDS (defined by&#xD;
                  IPSS) with documented diagnosis of MDS (refractory anemia, refractory anemia with&#xD;
                  excess blasts, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with&#xD;
                  mixed lineage dysplasia, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients must have a documented history of all transfusions (pRBC and/or&#xD;
                  platelets) received in the 60-day period prior to their initial Trisenox&#xD;
                  treatment on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients with ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 (see Appendix I).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Absolute QT interval below 460 msec in the presence of serum potassium and&#xD;
                  magnesium values within the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Patients must be &gt;/= 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Patients must either be not of child bearing potential or have a negative serum&#xD;
                  pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to registration. Patients are considered not&#xD;
                  of child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a&#xD;

                  postmenopausal for at least 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  forms of contraception simultaneously for at least 1 month before beginning&#xD;
                  Thalomid therapy, during Thalomid therapy, and for 1 month following&#xD;
                  discontinuation of Thalomid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Renal function: creatinine &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN),&#xD;
                  CTCAE Grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Hepatic function: bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN, CTCAE Grade 1. AST &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN,&#xD;

&#xD;
              11. Serum potassium &gt;4.0mEq/dL and serum magnesium &gt;1.8 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following criteria will make the patient ineligible to participate in this&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Patients with a significant history of cardiac disease (i.e., uncontrolled&#xD;
                  hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction&#xD;
                  in the last 6 months).&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. Patients planning to receive any concurrent therapy to treat MDS during the study&#xD;
                  treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Patients with a serious uncontrolled intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness,&#xD;
                  including serious infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Patients with a history of other malignancy within the last 5 years, which could&#xD;
                  affect the diagnosis or assessment of these study drugs for MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Any patient who is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
