      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability and to find the maximum tolerated dose of the&#xD;
           combination administration of RAD001 plus docetaxel when given to patients with&#xD;
           metastatic breast cancer who are being considered for standard docetaxel treatment&#xD;
           (phase I).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of RAD001 and docetaxel when co-administered (phase&#xD;
           I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the phosphorylation status of the components of the mTOR signaling pathway&#xD;
           and the expression of modifiers of apoptosis in the primary breast tumors, in order to&#xD;
           determine whether these markers can be used as predictors of sensitivity to the&#xD;
           combination of RAD001 and docetaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect of the combination of RAD001 and docetaxel on the expression and&#xD;
           phosphorylation of mTOR's targets in the accessible tumor tissue, in order to identify&#xD;
           potential pharmacodynamics markers of response to this drug combination&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel is a drug approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who&#xD;
      are either newly diagnosed or have failed earlier chemotherapy. RAD001 is an investigational&#xD;
      drug that has shown to have anticancer properties. It also works by weakening the immune&#xD;
      system. RAD001 works by blocking some of the steps required for cancer growth. The researcher&#xD;
      hopes that RAD001 may increase the anticancer activity of docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests&quot;. These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the&#xD;
      study. You will have a complete medical history and physical exam. Blood (between 1-2&#xD;
      teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. You will have scans (MRI or CT) to check on&#xD;
      the status of your cancer as ordered by your primary physician. Women who are able to have&#xD;
      children must have a negative blood pregnancy test. As part of the study researchers will&#xD;
      also look at the tissue of your original cancer. Special stains will be done that will help&#xD;
      find ways in which researchers can predict the response of your cancer to RAD001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive docetaxel by&#xD;
      vein on Day 1 over one hour. RAD001 will be given by mouth on Days 1 and 8. RAD 001 will be&#xD;
      given on an empty stomach or after a light meal. You will repeat this treatment every 21&#xD;
      days. Three (3 ) weeks equals 1 cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who participate on the first part of this study will be enrolled in groups of 3 at a&#xD;
      time. The dose of RAD001 will be increased with each new group of patients. The dose of&#xD;
      docetaxel will remain the same. The second part of the study will be using the highest dose&#xD;
      of RAD001 and docetaxel that was found to be safe and effective during the first part of the&#xD;
      study. (***Study did not progress to second part.***)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone will be given by mouth twice a day for 3 days, starting the day before you&#xD;
      receive docetaxel. Dexamethasone helps decrease the risk of and control nausea, vomiting, and&#xD;
      fluid retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (between 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests at each visit. X-rays and scans&#xD;
      (CT or MRI) will be done every 6 weeks to see if the tumor is responding to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 cycles of the combination, docetaxel will be stopped and you will continue to take&#xD;
      RAD001 alone. However, you may be able to take more than 6 cycles of the combination if you&#xD;
      are not having any side effects and is found to be of benefit by your primary doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you go off treatment, you will have a physical exam, including routine blood tests (1-2&#xD;
      teaspoons).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Docetaxel is approved by the FDA and commercially available&#xD;
      for the treatment of breast cancer. RAD001 is authorized for use in research only. About 65&#xD;
      patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
