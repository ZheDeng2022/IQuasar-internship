  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality particularly among children &lt; 5&#xD;
      years in Uganda. Due to inaccessibility many children die before they reach the health&#xD;
      facility. The Home Based Management of Fever (HBMF) strategy was adopted in Uganda as a mean&#xD;
      to improve access to early and appropriate treatment of fever at community level. Pre-packed&#xD;
      chloroquine with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (HOMAPAK) is provided through Community Drug&#xD;
      Distributors(CDDs). Initial evaluation showed underutilization of the CDDs (15%). This cast&#xD;
      doubt on community acceptability, accessibility as well as its feasibility and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness. This 3-year project intends to compare community acceptability and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of two HOMAPAK distribution methods. The current CDD-based HOMAPAK distribution&#xD;
      versus home-based HOMAPAK distribution. The study hypothesis is that &quot;home-based HOMAPAK&#xD;
      distribution is more acceptable to the community and more cost effective than the CDD based&#xD;
      HOMAPAK A non randomised community study will be conducted in two sub-counties of Mukono&#xD;
      district. In the control arm, HOMAPAKs will be distributed through the CDDs while in the&#xD;
      intervention arm, HOMAPAKs will be directly distributed to the caretakers in the homes. The&#xD;
      study population are caretakers and their children &lt; 5 years. At baseline a survey (Phase 1)&#xD;
      with a sample size 657 in each study area will assess the common drugs stocked at home to&#xD;
      treat malaria and the health seeking behaviour for malaria for children &lt; 5 years and to&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia and anaemia among children &lt; 5 years. Phase&#xD;
      2 includes the intervention. The villages will be assigned to either the control or&#xD;
      intervention arm. Anaemia and malaria parasitaemia among children with fever will be assessed&#xD;
      through active case finding. The impact of either distribution system on accessibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, sustainability, compliance, cost effectiveness and malaria morbidity will be&#xD;
      assessed during the evaluation phase. Health education messages on malaria prevention and&#xD;
      treatment will be given to both communities. Drug misuse will be limited by distributing&#xD;
      HOMAPAKs according to the number of children &lt;5years in each household. HOMAPAK will only be&#xD;
      replenished after the caretaker returns a used packet to the CDD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that distributing HOMAPAK directly to caretakers is more acceptable to the&#xD;
      community, cost effective and results in reduced malaria morbidity among children &lt; 5 years&#xD;
      than distribution through CDDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the communities malaria seeking behaviour in the two drug distribution methods of&#xD;
      HOMAPAK in order to provide information that can be used to enhance the HBMF strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess trends in the types and numbers of antimalarials stocked for use among&#xD;
           children &lt; 5 years in the two study areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the patterns of health seeking behaviour in the community for fever among&#xD;
           children under five years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the incidence of malaria, and the associated morbidity (anaemia) in the two&#xD;
           study areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare community acceptability of the two drug distribution methods of HOMAPAK in&#xD;
           the aspects of, utilisation of the services, drug compliance, coverage and&#xD;
           accessibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the cost and compare cost effectiveness of the two drug distribution methods&#xD;
           of the HOMAPAK on malaria morbidity in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study area and population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted in Kayunga district, located 80 km northeast of Kampala with&#xD;
           a total population of 800000 (Uganda Housing and Population Census, 2002) of which 20 %&#xD;
           is &lt; 5 years. It is hyperendemic for malaria. The study population will consist of the&#xD;
           children &lt; 5 years and their caretakers. The study areas will be those without HOMAPAK&#xD;
           being distributed at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Household based intervention study. Two drug distribution methods of HOMAPAK will be&#xD;
           compared. In the Control arm, HOMAPAKs will be distributed through the conventional&#xD;
           HOMAPAK distribution method (i.e through the CDDs) while in the Intervention arm,&#xD;
           HOMAPAKs will be distributed directly to the caretakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A Baseline survey will assess the patterns of health seeking behaviour for the &lt; 5&#xD;
           children with fever. Types of antimalarials stocked in homes will be established. The&#xD;
           prevalence of malaria and anaemia among children &lt; 5 years will be established. In the&#xD;
           intervention phase the two different HOMAPAK distribution methods will be implemented&#xD;
           and monitored. Active case finding of malaria cases will be combined with passive&#xD;
           surveillance. A structured questionnaire will be administered to the caretakers and a&#xD;
           finger prick blood sample for Hb and malaria parasitaemia will be drawn from the&#xD;
           children. Malaria records at the health facility will be reviewed for number of malaria&#xD;
           cases seen and their clinical outcome. In the evaluation phase the impact of the drug&#xD;
           distribution methods on antimalarials stocked in the homes,health seeking behaviour and&#xD;
           other outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline and evaluation phase The sample size (n) has been estimated according to&#xD;
           Kirkwood and Sterne (2003) for comparing of two means. The required sample size is 597&#xD;
           per group. To cater for loss of follow up, 10 % of the sample size will be added thus&#xD;
           giving a total of 657 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods The Intervention Phase The study populations will consist of the caretakers and&#xD;
           children under five years of age in the Control and the Intervention arms. Two CDDs in&#xD;
           each village will be trained and given HOMAPAKs. In the Control Arm the CDDs will keep&#xD;
           the HOMAPAKs and will only be distributed when the caretakers seek care for their&#xD;
           children. In contrast in the intervention area, the CDDs will distribute the drugs to&#xD;
           all homes with children &lt; 5 years of age. The CDDs will only act as RELAY POINTS for the&#xD;
           HOMAPAKs. All villages of the study parishes in either arm will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Community sensitisation/selection of the CDDs Through village meetings the community&#xD;
           will be informed about the project and be requested to select two people for training as&#xD;
           CDDs. Two district trainers will conduct a training workshop. Item included: the roles&#xD;
           of the CDD, issues about malaria (its importance, cause, clinical presentation, case&#xD;
           management &amp; prevention), HOMAPAK dosage, counselling (preventive, compliance), referral&#xD;
           of cases, record keeping (HMIS, drug stocks), recognition of a child with fever and what&#xD;
           to do for her/him, determining what pre-pack to give, recording the treatment and drug&#xD;
           storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procurement and distribution of HOMAPAK HOMAPAKs will be procured through the MoH and&#xD;
           supplied to all CDDs in both study communities. The CDDs in the control arm will only&#xD;
           give the drugs when the caretakers seek care, while those in intervention arm will&#xD;
           distribute the appropriate HOMAPAKs to all HH with children &lt; 5 years. In order to&#xD;
           prevent drug misuse, the CDDs in the intervention group will be instructed to only&#xD;
           replenish the stocks in the household after the caretaker produces the used packet of&#xD;
           HOMAPAK.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Monitoring cases of malaria Three field assistants (FAs) will be stationed in the&#xD;
           community and will do weekly surveys in households with children with either malaria or&#xD;
           history of fever in the previous 7 days. A case of malaria will be any child, who either&#xD;
           currently has a fever (axillary temperature &gt;37.5 C) and any parasitaemia) or has a&#xD;
           history of fever in 48 hours prior to the survey plus any parasitaemia. Information&#xD;
           regarding health-seeking behaviour by the caretaker for the child with fever and related&#xD;
           costs will be obtained by use of a questionnaire. Finger prick blood samples for Hb and&#xD;
           malaria parasitaemia will be taken from the child. The Hb will be obtained by use of a&#xD;
           portable haemoglobin photometer (HemoCue) while a thick malaria slide will be examined&#xD;
           under a microscope. The FAs will give appropriate information regarding malaria control&#xD;
           and treatment to the caretakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Monitoring and Supervision of project activities Project activities will be monitored&#xD;
           and supervised by the project staff , the district health team, and the community&#xD;
           themselves. The project staff will join the district team during their quarterly support&#xD;
           supervision visits. The PI and the district supervisor will do fortnightly supervision&#xD;
           in the study area. During the supervisory visits, meetings with the CDDs and community&#xD;
           leaders will be held to discuss the progress of the project activities. Meetings will&#xD;
           also be held with the FAs and Field Supervisors. Patient records and drug stock cards at&#xD;
           both the health facility and CDDs will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Evaluation Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To assess the impact of the distribution methods on patterns of health seeking behaviour&#xD;
           of the caretakers for fever among children &lt; 5 years, acceptability and related costs&#xD;
           for the household and government, antimalarials stocked in the homes, malaria morbidity&#xD;
           among children &lt; 5 years, a second KAP Survey will be conducted 2 years after the&#xD;
           implementation of the project, in the same villages, on a comparable sample of 657&#xD;
           caretakers and children &lt; 5 years in each study area using the same structured&#xD;
           questionnaire and FGD guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two sub counties (SC) in the district with similar demographic and socio-economic&#xD;
           characteristics will be purposely selected. 50% of the parishes in each SC will then be&#xD;
           randomly selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline and Evaluation phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to have at least 30 households (HH) in a village, a total of 17 villages will&#xD;
           be selected from the sampled parishes in each sub county using probability proportionate&#xD;
           to size sampling. At village level the list of all the HH in the village will be&#xD;
           obtained from the chairman of the village. The 30HH will be selected randomly.&#xD;
           Appointments will be made with the caretakers to agree on the time for the interview. In&#xD;
           case the caretakers refuse to participate, she will not be replaced. In case the&#xD;
           selected HH does not have a child &lt; 5 years, it will be replaced by one in the&#xD;
           neighbourhood with such a child. In case there is more than one eligible caretaker in&#xD;
           the selected HH like in polygamous homes, then one respondent will be selected by use of&#xD;
           the ballot method. A similar procedure will be applied in case there is more than one&#xD;
           eligible child in the HH. After seeking an informed consent from the respondent, an&#xD;
           interview will be conducted.Participants for the FGDs will be purposely selected from&#xD;
           the parishes HH that will not be part of the structured questionnaire. Two FGDs for men&#xD;
           and Two for women will be conducted separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All households with children &lt; 5 years in the study villages in both the control and&#xD;
