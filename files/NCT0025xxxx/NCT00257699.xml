  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the&#xD;
      digestive system. Symptoms of this chronic illness include abdominal pain, bloating, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, and diarrhea. CD also causes bowel wall ulcers, strictures (narrowings of a hollow&#xD;
      structure due to scar tissue and swelling), and fistulae (abnormal passages from the&#xD;
      intestines to another organ or to the skin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD is thought to arise from a combination of inherited (genetic) factors and some undefined&#xD;
      environmental factor(s). One environmental factor that has been shown to be intimately&#xD;
      involved with the development of CD is the presence of bacteria that normally inhabit the&#xD;
      intestines. As a result, some physicians have tried to alter the normal bacterial population&#xD;
      as a means of controlling the inflammation (swelling) in the intestines of individuals with&#xD;
      CD. Among such strategies is the use of a combination of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin.&#xD;
      These broad-spectrum antibiotics control CD symptoms by acting on the intestinal bacteria&#xD;
      that can contribute to chronic inflammation. More investigation is needed to firmly establish&#xD;
      the usefulness of this therapy because previous clinical trials have given mixed results,&#xD;
      although they have suggested that antibiotics can be particularly useful in cases of Crohn's&#xD;
      colitis (CD that primarily affects the large intestine). Because these earlier studies have&#xD;
      lacked a large enough patient population with colonic involvement, a trial focusing on this&#xD;
      CD subgroup with a sufficient number of subjects will help to clarify the value of combining&#xD;
      metronidazole and ciprofloxacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will test the hypothesis that combination antibiotic therapy is effective&#xD;
      in the treatment of CD involving the colon. The study will compare the use of combination&#xD;
      therapy consisting of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin with placebo (dummy tablets) and will&#xD;
      examine the results of treatment at the end of 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of bacteria and microbial agents in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease has been&#xD;
      suggested and is supported by animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in which the&#xD;
      presence of normal gut flora is required for the initiation and full expression of the&#xD;
      inflammatory reaction. In human Crohn's disease, antibiotics are commonly used even though&#xD;
      the evidence to support this practice is not strong. Several studies have indicated that&#xD;
      antibiotics have some biological activity in Crohn's disease and that this activity may be&#xD;
      most pronounced in the subset of patients with colonic involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to better justify the use of antibiotics in the treatment of Crohn's disease, the&#xD;
      Antibiotics for Colonic Crohn's Disease trial has been designed to determine if ciprofloxacin&#xD;
      and metronidazole combination therapy is effective in the treatment of active Crohn's disease&#xD;
      of the colon. This two arm, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study will involve 136 patients with mild to moderate active Crohn's&#xD;
      disease of the colon (with or without ileal involvement), as defined by a Crohn's Disease&#xD;
      Activity Index (CDAI) score between 220 and 450.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of two treatment regimens: (1)&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin (500 mg po bid; provided as&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 x 500 mg tablets) and metronidazole (&lt;50 kg, 250 mg po bid; 50-75 kg, 250 mg po tid; &gt;75&#xD;
      kg, 500 mg po bid; all doses provided as 1 x 250 mg tablets) or (2) placebo. Treatment will&#xD;
      be continued for a period of 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment success will be defined as a complete response to therapy at the end of eight&#xD;
      weeks. Complete response (remission) will be defined as a reduction of the CDAI score to&#xD;
      below 150 points with a reduction of at least 70 points from baseline. Partial response&#xD;
      (improvement) will be analyzed as a secondary outcome measure and will be defined as a&#xD;
      reduction of the CDAI score by 70 points or more but with a final value of 150 points or&#xD;
      greater. Patients who experience a persistent rise in their CDAI scores of 100 points or more&#xD;
      on two consecutive visits or a rise in their CDAI score to 400 points or more at any visit&#xD;
      will be considered to be treatment failures and will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be an intent-to-treat comparison of the proportion of patients&#xD;
      achieving remission by 8 weeks in the ciprofloxacin/metronidazole and placebo groups.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will evaluate partial response and adverse event rates.&#xD;
