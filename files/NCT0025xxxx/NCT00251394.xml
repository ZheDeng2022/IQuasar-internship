  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the effects (good and bad) and the safety of&#xD;
      Dynavax's immunostimulatory phosphorothiolate oligodeoxyribonucleotide (1018 ISS) given in&#xD;
      combination with Rituxan on patients with B-cell follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This&#xD;
      research is being done because recurrent follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not curable&#xD;
      with standard chemotherapy or antibody treatments. 1018 ISS is an experimental compound that&#xD;
      consists of short pieces of DNA that stimulate the immune system. It is hoped that 1018 ISS&#xD;
      may improve the ability of Rituxan to kill cancer cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Patients will receive four weekly infusions of Rituxan which is standard treatment for&#xD;
           B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Approximately 30 to 60 minutes after the second, third&#xD;
           and fourth infusions of Rituxan, the patient will receive up to 3 injections of 1018 ISS&#xD;
           under the skin. The number of injections will depend upon the patients weight. One week&#xD;
           after the last Rituxan infusion the patient will receive a fourth and final injection of&#xD;
           1018 ISS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After completion of the 5-week treatment period, a physical examination and blood work&#xD;
           will be performed. The patient will also be examined to see if the tumor has gotten&#xD;
           smaller, bigger, or stayed the same size and in the same places by either CT scan or&#xD;
           MRI. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be done to examine any changes in bone&#xD;
           marrow cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following tests will be performed to determine whether or not a patient is eligible&#xD;
           to participate in this clinical study: Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy; lymph node&#xD;
           biopsy; skin biopsy; standard x-ray tests (x-rays, CT scans, MRI, ultrasounds, and/or&#xD;
           radioactive drug scans); and blood work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While receiving treatment patients will have the following procedures done; Physical&#xD;
           examination once a week for 4 weeks, blood testing for any changes in the blood, blood&#xD;
           chemistry and other blood components. Patients will also be requested to keep a diary&#xD;
           between each study visit to record any health changes or any over-the-counter medication&#xD;
           or herbal preparation they may have taken.&#xD;
