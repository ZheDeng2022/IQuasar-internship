  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to find out whether an exercise program during dialysis or a drug called&#xD;
      nandrolone decanoate can increase muscle size and strenght in patients on dialysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis patients have limited physical functioning as measured by self-reported functioning,&#xD;
      peak oxygen consumption, physical performance tests, and tests of muscle strength. A recent&#xD;
      study highlighted the severity of debility, reporting that more than one third of&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients were unable to perform the normal activities of daily living without&#xD;
      assistance. In addition, physical functioning has been shown to be a major determinant of&#xD;
      patients' assessment of their global quality of life. Taken together, available evidence&#xD;
      suggests that impaired physical functioning is widespread among dialysis patients and&#xD;
      profoundly affects their lives. Therefore, interventions to improve functioning in this&#xD;
      population have the potential to significantly improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle wasting and weakness are particularly attractive targets for intervention because they&#xD;
      are related to loss of function and can be objectively measured and targeted for improvement.&#xD;
      Small studies support the possible benefits of two strategies to increase muscle size and&#xD;
      strength among patients on dialysis. Anabolic steroids were frequently used to ameliorate the&#xD;
      anemia associated with end-stage renal disease prior to the introduction of recombinant&#xD;
      erythropoietin, and these agents were noted to cause an increase in serum creatinine along&#xD;
      with increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. More recently, nandrolone decanoate has been&#xD;
      shown to increase lean body mass and improve physical performance, and resistance exercise&#xD;
      training has been shown to increase strength and improve physical performance. Neither of&#xD;
      these preliminary results has been confirmed, nor have the relative benefits of these&#xD;
      strategies or their potential additive or synergistic effects been examined. Therefore, we&#xD;
      designed a study to compare changes in lean body mass, muscle size and strength, physical&#xD;
      performance, and self-reported functioning over a12 week period among hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) nandrolone decanoate, a synthetic testosterone&#xD;
      derivative, by weekly intramuscular injection (ND); 2) weekly placebo injections (PL); 3)&#xD;
      lower extremity resistance exercise training during dialysis sessions three times per week&#xD;
      plus weekly placebo injections (EX); and 4) resistance exercise plus nandrolone injections&#xD;
      weekly (EX+ND).&#xD;
