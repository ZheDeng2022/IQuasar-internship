  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The US is in the midst of an obesity epidemic, affecting young children. The pediatric&#xD;
      primary care setting is an ideal place to address this problem since most families have&#xD;
      frequent contact with their pediatrician and a child's health status is regularly assessed in&#xD;
      this setting. Recommendations for treating children with a body mass index (BMI) over the&#xD;
      85th percentile in the primary care setting have been developed by an Expert Committee on&#xD;
      childhood. Programs are needed that meet the recommendations from the Committee, which&#xD;
      include: 1) beginning treatment as young as possible; 2) focusing on the family, with the&#xD;
      parent being the primary change agent for treatment; 3) using behavior modification&#xD;
      techniques to change eating and activity behaviors; and 4) making 2 or 3 very specific&#xD;
      changes in diet and activity at one time. Thus, the aim of this R21 application is to&#xD;
      develop, implement, and evaluate a 6-month behavioral childhood obesity intervention that&#xD;
      meets the Committee's recommendations and can be implemented in a primary care setting. A&#xD;
      second aim of this project is to determine which eating and activity behaviors should be&#xD;
      targeted in the intervention. One hundred thirty-five children, aged 4 to 9 years with a BMI&#xD;
      &gt; 85th percentile, assessed and referred by their pediatricians, will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      three conditions: 1) a newsletter condition; 2) a Behavioral Parenting Program that increases&#xD;
      physical activity (60 min/day) and decreases sweetened drink consumption (&lt; 3 servings/week)&#xD;
      (Traditional); or 3) a Behavioral Parenting Program that reduces TV watching (&lt; 2 hours/day)&#xD;
      and increases low-fat milk consumption (2 servings/day) (Substitutes). Follow-up assessments&#xD;
      on weight, height, and standardized BMI (z-BMI), the primary dependent variable, will be&#xD;
      conducted at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Pediatricians will provide follow-up letters to&#xD;
      families, regarding weight and height status, following the assessments. This pilot study&#xD;
      allows us to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a pediatric obesity intervention that&#xD;
      optimizes the role of the pediatrician and meets the Committee's recommendations for&#xD;
      treatment in a primary care setting. Moreover, by comparing the effects of targeting the&#xD;
      traditional or substitute behaviors, data will be obtained for a power analysis for a&#xD;
      full-scale trial of the effects of these two approaches on long-term weight loss.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1) Age between 4 and 9 years. We propose to use this age group since parents are in&#xD;
             control of the eating and exercise choices of such children, and thus a program that&#xD;
             focuses on parenting behaviors (i.e., positive reinforcement, stimulus control,&#xD;
             parental modeling) should be developmentally appropriate. This age group also meets&#xD;
             the Expert Committee's goal of intervening early5; moreover children aged 4 to 8 years&#xD;
             have similar nutritional needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2) Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 85th percentile BMI. Based upon the Expert Committee&#xD;
             recommendations,5 children &gt; 2 years of age who are identified as being at risk for&#xD;
             overweight (85th to 94th percentile BMI) or overweight (&gt; 95th percentile BMI) should&#xD;
             focus on weight maintenance as height continues to increase. These recommendations are&#xD;
             aimed at reducing z-BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3) Tanner stage 1 (prepubertal) sexual maturation status. 4) Self-report at least one&#xD;
             of the following problematic behaviors:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Consume &gt; 1 serving of sweetened drink per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Consume &lt; 2 servings of low-fat milk per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Watch &gt; 2 hours of TV per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Engage in physical activity that makes them sweat or breath hard &lt; 5 days per&#xD;
                  week.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  These behaviors have been selected because each has been associated with&#xD;
                  childhood obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5) A parent willing to attend treatment meetings. 6) Parent and child speak&#xD;
                  English.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Participants will be excluded if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Report a family member participating in another weight loss program.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Report that the child or parent planning to attend the treatment meetings&#xD;
                       has a major psychiatric disease or organic brain syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Report that the child or parent planning to attend the treatment meetings&#xD;
                       has dietary or physical activity restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. Intend to move outside of the metropolitan area within the time frame of the&#xD;
                       investigation.&#xD;
