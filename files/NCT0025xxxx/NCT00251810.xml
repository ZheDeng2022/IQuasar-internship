      This study aims to test whether two depth-of-anaesthesia-monitors can perform equally well in&#xD;
      monitoring anaesthetic sleep, both at induction and emergence from anaesthesia and during&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a considerable variation in the need of anaesthetics for the individual patient. For&#xD;
      measuring the hypnotic component (i.e. sleep) during anaesthesia, no reliable monitoring&#xD;
      system was available before Bispectral Index, BIS (Aspect Medical) was commercially launched&#xD;
      about ten years ago. BIS is based on complex mathematical and statistical processing of the&#xD;
      electroencephalogram, EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A widespread use of BIS has been limited in part by high costs. Last year a considerably&#xD;
      cheaper EEG monitor, Cerebral State Monitor, CSM (Danmeter), was launched into the marked.&#xD;
      The validation of CSM is so far limited to very few cases comparing BIS and CSM offline. No&#xD;
      large scaled clinical study has been performed to test whether CSM also reflects depth of&#xD;
      hypnosis in a reliable way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We set up a study on 60 relatively healthy patients, undergoing various kind of surgery in&#xD;
      general anaesthesia. The study is approved by the Regional Committee of Ethics in Medicine,&#xD;
      Health Region East, and all patients give written informed consent. Both monitors (BIS and&#xD;
      CSM) are applied to the patients, but only information from BIS is available for the&#xD;
      anaesthetist throughout surgery. Information from the two monitors and from the routine&#xD;
      monitoring equipment as well as from the actual delivery of anaesthetics is sampled online&#xD;
      into a designed data program (Rugloop, Demed, Belgium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The output from BIS and CSM will afterwards be analyzed together with statistical experts, to&#xD;
      see if CSM can predict the time for falling asleep and time for awakening just as good as&#xD;
      BIS. The curves for the two monitors will also be compared, qualitatively and quantitatively,&#xD;
      to see if they perform equally well.&#xD;
