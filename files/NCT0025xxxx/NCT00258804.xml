      Primary Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the number of hypoglycaemic events (severe, symptomatic, asymptomatic,&#xD;
           nocturnal) in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin glargine (Lantus®) and&#xD;
           glimepiride (Amaryl®), before, during and after the period of fasting in Ramadan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess glycaemic control before, during and after Ramadan in terms of HbA1c, FBG, and&#xD;
           8-point blood glucose profile (FBG and 8-point blood glucose profile will be collected&#xD;
           with a blood glucose monitor through a monthly patient diary).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relationship between hypoglycaemia events during Ramadan and blood glucose&#xD;
           control prior and during Ramadan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess patient satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document adverse events (all serious adverse events, non serious adverse events)&#xD;
           throughout the study (all events will be collected through the monthly patient diary).&#xD;
