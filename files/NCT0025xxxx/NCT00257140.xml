  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of levofloxacin, an&#xD;
      antibiotic, compared with cefaclor, another antibiotic, in the treatment of adults with&#xD;
      chronic bronchitis experiencing rapid onset of worsening of symptoms caused by bacteria.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group, multicenter study to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of 488 mg of levofloxacin (once daily by mouth for 5 - 7 days)&#xD;
      compared with 250 mg of cefaclor (every 8 hours for 7 - 10 days) in adults with chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis experiencing rapid onset of worsening of symptoms caused by bacterial infection.&#xD;
      The study consists of 3 visits: one visit for screening and enrollment, and 2 visits for&#xD;
      assessment of safety and effectiveness (one visit on Days 3 - 5 of the study and one visit&#xD;
      [post-therapy] 5 - 7 days after the last dose of the study drug). The total duration of&#xD;
      patient participation in the study is approximately 2 weeks. Levofloxacin and cefaclor are&#xD;
      antibacterial agents used for the treatment of many types of infections, including infections&#xD;
      with a rapid onset and brief duration caused by bacteria. The primary assessment of&#xD;
      effectiveness in this study is the microbiologic response to treatment (the rate of&#xD;
      elimination of disease-causing bacteria, by patient, and by type of bacteria), 5 - 7 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of study drug. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, physical&#xD;
      examination, laboratory tests) are performed throughout the study. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that treatment with levofloxacin is at least as effective and as well tolerated as treatment&#xD;
      with cefaclor in adult patients with chronic bronchitis experiencing sudden worsening of&#xD;
      symptoms caused by bacterial infection. Levofloxacin 488 mg by mouth once daily for 5 - 7&#xD;
      days, or cefaclor 250 mg by mouth every 8 hours for 7 - 10 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of chronic bronchitis with a rapid onset of worsening of symptoms caused by&#xD;
             bacteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history of chronic obstructive lung disease (chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  recent increase in cough&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  change in type of sputum (the mucus produced on coughing) and/or an increase in the&#xD;
             production of sputum&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  received previous antibiotic treatment if the previous treatment lasted for 24 hours&#xD;
             or less, or if the previous treatment lasted longer than 24 hours but there was no&#xD;
             improvement or stabilization of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Illness requiring antibiotic treatment by injection into a vein, beneath the skin, or&#xD;
             into a muscle, or has a requirement of an antibiotic medication taken orally in&#xD;
             addition to the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  infection due to bacteria known (prior to the start of the study) to be resistant to&#xD;
             the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  previous allergic or serious adverse reaction to similar antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  diagnosis of pneumonia, determined by a chest x-ray at the start of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has cystic fibrosis, seizure disorders, kidney disease, or an unstable psychiatric&#xD;
             condition.&#xD;
