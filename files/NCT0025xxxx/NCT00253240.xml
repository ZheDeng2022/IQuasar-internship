  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family physicians are the primary health care providers for complex patients such as persons&#xD;
      with serious mental illness. The psychiatric needs of these patients could take attention&#xD;
      away from management of health problems and from usual health promotion services. For&#xD;
      example, Schizophrenia is associated with a higher than normal incidence of diabetes, and&#xD;
      first line treatments of Schizophrenia have also been found to increase risk for diabetes. As&#xD;
      such, this high-risk group requires targeted diabetes strategies. In London Ontario, services&#xD;
      are provided to this high risk mental health population primarily by two community agencies:&#xD;
      The Western Ontario Therapeutic Community Hostel (WOTCH) and the Canadian Mental Health&#xD;
      Association (CMHA). Accordingly, the goal of this project is to assess how these patients are&#xD;
      currently being managed by their family physicians and to pilot a community-based,&#xD;
      multidisciplinary diabetes clinic model within this population. If this delivery model proves&#xD;
      feasible and effective, family physicians could be assisted by existing community agencies in&#xD;
      the management of their patients' diabetes and patients will receive improved access to this&#xD;
      vital multidisciplinary team.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In London Ontario, community based services are provided to the high-risk mental health&#xD;
      population by primarily two community agencies: The Western Ontario Therapeutic Community&#xD;
      Hostel (WOTCH) and the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA). WOTCH provides treatment,&#xD;
      support, rehabilitation and recovery services to individuals with serious mental illness&#xD;
      including case management, social recreational activities, and vocational and housing&#xD;
      options. Each client is linked to a Community Support Worker who meets with the clients in&#xD;
      their homes or in other community locations to develop rehabilitation plans, monitor the&#xD;
      success of these plans, coordinate services and advocate on the client's behalf. Similarly,&#xD;
      CMHA provides a range of education and support services in the London Middlesex area. CMHA&#xD;
      provides centralized Intake and Assessment for WOTCH, London East Community Mental Health&#xD;
      Services and for their own Community Support Case Management program. The qualifying criteria&#xD;
      for access to the programs are based on assessment of three key elements: Disability,&#xD;
      Duration and Dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collectively WOTCH, CMHA and the London Mental Health Crisis Service maintain a common client&#xD;
      record for clients. Individuals generate crisis plans and information is attained which&#xD;
      includes primary diagnosis, co-morbid health conditions, medication, demographics and family&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Population -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the project were drawn from the active WOTCH and CMHA database. Participants&#xD;
      that were identified in the database as having a diagnosis of Schizophrenia (or Psychotic&#xD;
      Disorder) and/or treatment with a Novel Antipsychotic medication were approached for&#xD;
      participation in the project. Any participants identified in the database with a pre-existing&#xD;
      diagnosis of diabetes were not included in the initial selection of participants. A total of&#xD;
      60 participants meeting the above criteria were selected for the initial screening phase of&#xD;
      the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase One&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of the proposed project aims to determine how these complex patients were&#xD;
      being managed in primary care. Consent was sought from family physicians that were determined&#xD;
      to be the primary care providers for the participants who met criteria for involvement in the&#xD;
      project. A chart review was conducted on site at each family practice location in a space&#xD;
      provided by the physician. The review includes demographic information, diagnoses, medication&#xD;
      use (past and current), lab results (blood glucose and lipid profile), and a medication side&#xD;
      effects profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Two&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of the proposed project aims to quantify the prevalence and risk profile of&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, as well as mental illness symptomology and disability, in this identified&#xD;
      high-risk population. All participants identified in the chart review as not having received&#xD;
      an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) in the past year, in accordance with current&#xD;
      guidelines, were followed in phase two of the proposed project. In addition, caseworker&#xD;
      feedback was used as a source of information regarding prior screening in cases where&#xD;
      physicians did not consent to participate in the chart audit but the client did consent to&#xD;
      participate. Participants identified as being in need of an OGTT for screening of DM were&#xD;
      invited to attend a screening event held at CMHA or WOTCH facilities. Caseworkers played an&#xD;
      active role in facilitating participants' attendance at the screening events. A phlebotomy&#xD;
      certified staff member conducted the OGTT's. If a lipid profile had not been completed within&#xD;
      the past year, the current sample will also be analyzed for lipids. Diabetes risk profile,&#xD;
      the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the World Health Organization Disability Scale (WHO-DAS&#xD;
      II) were also completed at this time. The OGTT was sent by the phlebotomist to a major&#xD;
      central lab, contracted by the project, to ensure internal consistency of the analyses.&#xD;
      Copies of the lab results were sent to the family physician, for placement in the&#xD;
      participants' file, and to the data manager, for analyses related to the proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Three&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third phase of the proposed project aims to evaluate the implementation of a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary model of care, consistent with current guidelines for diabetes management,&#xD;
      within this high-risk population. Participants identified in either of the previous two&#xD;
      phases as having diabetes or pre-diabetes were invited to participate in a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      program for diabetes management. The program runs monthly at identified usual point of WOTCH&#xD;
      and CMHA service locations. Identified WOTCH and CMHA staff are encouraged to attend the&#xD;
      program to serve as a consistent source of progress monitoring and to increase their&#xD;
      knowledge and familiarity with the goals of diabetes management and diabetes complications.&#xD;
      The program is based on the London Intercommunity Health Centre's (LIHC) diabetes risk and&#xD;
      disease management program previously piloted within a Community Health Centre. During the&#xD;
      clinic, participants meet individually with the Nurse Practitioner (NP) who works through a&#xD;
      Diabetes Care Flow Sheet. At each monthly visit, the NP assesses glycemic control,&#xD;
      hypertension, medications, weight, and foot care. Lifestyle counseling is also provided with&#xD;
      respect to smoking, activity, diet and stress. At each participant's initial visit, he or she&#xD;
      is provided with a pedometer and instructed on its use. This aids the NP in assessing&#xD;
      physical activity and provides a motivational tool for the participant. The NP is responsible&#xD;
      for highlighting any variables that fall outside the expected range. If it is decided that&#xD;
      there are issues that need further clinical consultation, the NP then refers the participant&#xD;
      to the appropriate team member. The DHC team includes a foot care specialist, dietician,&#xD;
      Diabetes Education Nurse, and a family physician. The family physician team leader refers any&#xD;
      clinical issues that fall beyond the scope of the DHC for specialist follow up. Each&#xD;
      participant receives appropriate instructions regarding return to the multidisciplinary&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NP also monitors each participant's need for periodic lab testing of glucose and lipids.&#xD;
      Annual screening for neuropathy, nephropathy, and eye exams are indicated on the Diabetes&#xD;
      Care Flow Sheet. The DHC team sends participants' family physicians' reminder notices of&#xD;
      these regularly needed referrals as well as any relevant clinical data.&#xD;
