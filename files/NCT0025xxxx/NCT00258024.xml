  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is one of the major causes of illness and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Ghana,&#xD;
      malaria is the most important cause of morbidity and accounts for about 40% of outpatient&#xD;
      contacts. Chemoprophylaxis and insecticide-impregnated bed nets are used for malaria control&#xD;
      in pregnancy.Chloroquine is administered within the ANC package at health facilities in&#xD;
      Ghana. However, many pregnant women in rural,low-income communities do not report for ANC or&#xD;
      report late thereby increasing their risk of morbidity and mortality. Reasons for this&#xD;
      include inaccessibility and high cost. As the gap between urban and rural health care and&#xD;
      socioeconomic circumstances increase, malaria control remains the major challenge of the&#xD;
      health sector. A facility-based intervention alone is not sufficient to have a significant or&#xD;
      sustained impact on malaria control in pregnancy. Alternative strategies are needed for the&#xD;
      delivery of malaria interventions to pregnant women in rural areas in Ghana. The overall&#xD;
      objective of this study is to develop alternative strategies for community involvement for&#xD;
      delivery of malaria interventions to pregnant women in rural Ghana. The project will be&#xD;
      conducted in the Afigya Sekyere district in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Interviews and focus&#xD;
      group discussions will be conducted with pregnant women and community members focusing on&#xD;
      local knowledge on control of malaria in pregnancy and factors influencing utilization of&#xD;
      antenatal services. Women in their first and second pregnancies who are permanently resident&#xD;
      in the study area will be included in the study using IPT with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine&#xD;
      (SP). The study population will be randomized to:Group 1 will receive clinic-supervised&#xD;
      IPT-SP and daily folate/iron supplementation and Group 2 will access IPT-SP with daily&#xD;
      folate/iron supplementation from trained traditional birth attendants (TBA). Midwives and&#xD;
      TBAs will be trained in preparing thick blood smears and placenta biopsies for&#xD;
      parasitological examination. Parasitaemia and Hb will be measured at entry and at delivery&#xD;
      and fever episodes during pregnancy will be recorded. Study participants will be followed for&#xD;
      adverse reactions within a week after drug administration. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      community-based IPT for the control of malaria in pregnancy will be determined. The endpoints&#xD;
      of the study will be birth weight, maternal anaemia, fever episodes and prevalence of&#xD;
      peripheral and placental parasitaemia in the groups.&#xD;

      General Objective To evaluate an alternative strategy of community involvement in the control&#xD;
      of pregnancy associated malaria and anaemia in an area of intense malaria transmission in&#xD;
      Ghana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives To explore local knowledge and health-care practices of control of&#xD;
      malaria in pregnancy and determine factors influencing utilization of antenatal services by&#xD;
      pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the prevalence of malaria and anaemia in pregnancy in the Afigya Sekyere&#xD;
      district To determine the effect of intermittent preventive treatment on pregnancy outcome in&#xD;
      primigravidae and secundigravidae To evaluate the effectiveness of a health facility and a&#xD;
      community-based malaria intervention in first and second pregnancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Study area and population The study will be conducted in the Afigya Sekyere&#xD;
      district of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The district lies within the forest belt where&#xD;
      malaria prevalence is highest (AHMED, 1989). Mean temperature is 270C with annual rainfall&#xD;
      between 1500 and 2000mm. The major rainfall season is between March-July and the minor in&#xD;
      September - November. There is little seasonal variation in malaria parasite transmission and&#xD;
      rates are just slightly higher after the rains. Most of the inhabitants are peasant&#xD;
      farmers.The district is divided into six sub districts with 91 communities.It has 15 health&#xD;
      facilities (2 hospitals, 6 health centres, 2 clinics and 5 maternity homes). The district has&#xD;
      about 42 trained (TTBAs) and a number of untrained TBAs who conduct almost 30% of deliveries&#xD;
      in the district (DHA, 2002).Considering the inadequate number of health professionals coupled&#xD;
      with their exodus to developed countries, the capabilities of TBAs can be enhanced and used&#xD;
      in control of malaria in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Pre-intervention phase A baseline Survey on birth weights will be carried out to&#xD;
      determine the mean birth weight and birth weight distribution in the study area&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data collection Focus group discussions (FGDs) and interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      at health facilities and in communities to explore local knowledge on control of malaria in&#xD;
      pregnancy and social, cultural and economic factors influencing utilization of antenatal and&#xD;
      delivery services by pregnant women. This will involve pregnant women of all parities,&#xD;
      village health committee members, TBAs and opinion leaders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional Survey (determination of prevalence of parasitaemia and anaemia) A&#xD;
      cross-sectional survey will be conducted to determine the prevalence of parasitaemia and&#xD;
      anaemia among pregnant women in the district. Pregnant women will be randomly selected from&#xD;
      health institutions and six communities. The sample at the health facility will be women used&#xD;
      for the exit interview. Twenty percent of pregnant women from six communities will be used.&#xD;
      Their blood samples will be taken for parasitaemia rate and density and their haemoglobin&#xD;
      levels will be measured using a Haemocue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase will involve Community-based and Health Facility-based administration of&#xD;
      single-dose SP (1500/75mg) to pregnant women and assess its effect on the following outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Birth weight Anaemia Parasitaemia Fever episodes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:420 women of first and second pregnancy. Selection of field sites and training of&#xD;
      staff Using random sampling, 20 TTBAs will be selected from communities without health&#xD;
      facilities. Six health facilities will also be purposively selected as field sites. Two field&#xD;
      supervisors (FS) will be employed to help with the study. They will be trained in data&#xD;
      collection, interviewing, monitoring drug administration, preparing blood smears, checking&#xD;
      haemoglobin and weighing of babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-week training session will be organized for the selected TTBAs. They will be trained&#xD;
      in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug storage and administration Interviewing Recognizing imminent complications in pregnancy&#xD;
      Taking placenta biopsy and making thick blood smears Weighing of babies Record keeping&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-day meeting will also be held with the heads of the health institutions and all the&#xD;
      midwives in the district to brief them on the study and solicit their support. Midwives from&#xD;
      the 10 selected health facilities will later be trained in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking placental biopsy and making thick blood smears Haemoglobin measurements Interviewing&#xD;
      Record keeping&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Enrolment of Study Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for this phase are women who are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      primigravidae or secundigravidae have Hb &gt;7g/dl (Those with Hb below 7g/dl will be treated&#xD;
      and later enrolled) permanently resident in the district no reaction to sulpha drugs no&#xD;
      multiple pregnancy no chronic diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midwives and TTBAs will recruit women at ANCs and in communities, confirm non-palpable&#xD;
      pregnancies by testing their urine and interview them for reaction to sulpha drugs. The&#xD;
      researcher, laboratory technician and FS will visit field sites, gather background&#xD;
      information from the women and check their gestation, haemoglobin and parasitaemia levels to&#xD;
      obtain baseline data for each woman. Eligible women who give their consent by signing or&#xD;
      thumb-printing a consent form will be enrolled into the study and given identification cards.&#xD;
      They will be advised to present this card to the midwives anytime they visit an antenatal&#xD;
      clinic so that no antimalarial will be given them as prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Drug administration Group 1 - Health Facility Intervention (HFI) Midwife supervised IPT&#xD;
      with daily iron and folate supplementation. Women in this group will receive single-dose&#xD;
      treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (1500/75mg) twice in the second trimester at least&#xD;
      one month apart and once in the third trimester when they visit the antenatal clinic. This&#xD;
      will begin from 16 weeks gestation. They will also receive daily iron and folate&#xD;
      supplementation. They will be informed to immediately report to the health facility with any&#xD;
      adverse effects they might experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2- Community-Based Intervention (CBI) TTBA supervised IPT with daily iron and folate&#xD;
      supplementation. Women in this category will receive sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (1500/75mg)&#xD;
      and daily iron and folate supplementation from 16 weeks gestation. Two doses of this&#xD;
      anti-malarial will be taken during the second trimester at least one month apart and a third&#xD;
      dose early in the third trimester under the supervision of the TTBA. The women will be&#xD;
      instructed to immediately report any adverse reactions to the health facility and the TTBA,&#xD;
      which will be recorded. The TTBAs will be encouraged to promptly refer women with imminent&#xD;
      complications to health facilities for appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Laboratory investigations The midwives, TTBAs and FS will have regular supply of slides,&#xD;
      slide boxes, gloves, cotton wool and methanol to prepare and store blood smears and placenta&#xD;
      biopsies. All blood samples from midwives and TTBAs will be collected weekly by FS and&#xD;
      transported to Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology for processing and&#xD;
      microscopic examination by a laboratory technician. Haemoglobin and parasitaemia values will&#xD;
      be compared for the groups. Ten (10%) percent of the slides will be read at Komfo Anokye&#xD;
      Teaching Hospital in Kumasi for quality control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) Delivery Scales will be provided for TTBAs and health facilities without reliable scales&#xD;
      to weigh babies and record their birth weight. There will be regular monitoring visits by the&#xD;
      researcher and FS to ensure accurate recording of birth weights. Providers will be supplied&#xD;
      with forms and notebooks for record keeping. The birth weights in the two groups will be&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) Referrals A follow-up will be made for records on women who develop pregnancy-related&#xD;
      complications and are referred to health facilities outside the district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ethical clearance for the study will be sought from the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Committee on Human Research Publications and Ethics of the School of Medical&#xD;
