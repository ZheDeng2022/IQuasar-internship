      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saredutant (or SR48968C)&#xD;
      in patients with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a 100 mg dose of saredutant compared to&#xD;
      placebo in patients with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety of saredutant, to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of saredutant on disability and quality of life in patients with depression, and to evaluate&#xD;
      blood levels of saredutant.&#xD;

      The study is a multicenter, US, randomized, parallel-group, double blind, placebo and&#xD;
      paroxetine-controlled study consisting of three segments (A, B, and C). Segment A is a&#xD;
      1-week, placebo, single-blind period and Segment B is an 8-week, double blind period.&#xD;
      Patients completing Segment B may be eligible for enrollment into Segment C, a 44-week,&#xD;
      double blind extension. All randomized patients must complete a post-study telephone visit&#xD;
      and a post-study office visit 3 days and 1 week, respectively, after intake of the last dose&#xD;
      of study medication.&#xD;
