  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) is a prophylactic measure aimed at&#xD;
      reducing Gram negative flora in the gut with an aim to reduce nosocomial infections such as&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia. A recent large randomized trial in the Netherlands showed&#xD;
      that SDD use was associated with reduced mortality in the ICU. Theoretically, SDD may select&#xD;
      for Gram positive organisms such as MRSA or VRE. This was not observed in the Dutch study,&#xD;
      but the rates of MRSA and VRE are very low in hospitals in the Netherlands. Fears of&#xD;
      selection of MRSA and VRE have limited application of SDD in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, 40 patients in the transplant intensive care unit (where SDD has been&#xD;
      used intermittently for at least 10 years), will be randomized to SDD or no SDD. These&#xD;
      patients will be known to be VRE positive at baseline. The effects of SDD on the density of&#xD;
      VRE in the stool on day 7 compared to pre-SDD will be the primary endpoint. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be detection of MRSA and colistin resistant Pseudomonas in the stool.&#xD;

      Study Design We will enroll 40 consecutive patients with VRE colonization who are admitted to&#xD;
      Transplant ICU of Montefiore Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 patients will be randomized to SDD or no SDD by the Investigational Drugs&#xD;
      Service of the Pharmacy. No placebo will be used for those assigned not to receive SDD.&#xD;
      Patients will either receive standard of care or standard of care + SDD. No treatment of any&#xD;
      kind is being withheld from the participants. Enrolled patients will be those known to be&#xD;
      colonized with VRE (after obtaining informed consent from patients or patients' proxy). SDD&#xD;
      will be given enterally through the nasogastric tube which will then be clamped for 1 hour.&#xD;
      SDD will be stopped when patients are extubated. Otherwise SDD will be given for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 is when patients are started on SDD which consists of colistin 100 mg, gentamicin 80mg,&#xD;
      and nystatin 2 million/U in 23mL. It is given every 6 hour via a nasogastric tube with the&#xD;
      nasogastric tube then clamped for 1 hour. Stool will be collected once a day at baseline (pre&#xD;
      administration of SDD), and then days 4, 7 and 14 for quantitative culture of resistant&#xD;
      pathogens in the stool. VRE, MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be sought. An endotracheal&#xD;
      aspirate once a day will also be collected on these days (baseline, 1, 4, 7, and 14) for&#xD;
      qualitative culture for the presence of MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If there are no&#xD;
      bowel movements on the days that stool is to be collected, no samples will be obtained. In&#xD;
      addition, if the endotracheal tube is pulled, no further endotracheal aspirates will be&#xD;
      obtained. Samples will only be obtained if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, for women of child bearing potential (any female who is biologically capable of&#xD;
      becoming pregnant), a small sample (about 1 teaspoonful) of blood will be taken from a vein&#xD;
      in the subject's arm for a pregnancy test, prior to study drug administration. Pregnant&#xD;
      women, or women who are currently breast-feeding an infant, will not be allowed to take part&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary microbiologic endpoint will be measurement of fecal density of VRE on day 7, in&#xD;
      comparison to measurements on day 1. Secondary endpoints are changes in VRE fecal density&#xD;
      from baseline to day 14, changes in MRSA fecal density from baseline to day 14, and presence&#xD;
      of colistin resistant Pseudomonas in stool or endotracheal aspirates at day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will also be collected: Demographic data (address, date of birth,&#xD;
      etc.) which includes age, sex, height, weight, and state of birth, previous reports&#xD;
      associated with the participant's condition, laboratory results, current medication use, and&#xD;
      any other prior medical problems/history. This information will be obtain from the medical&#xD;
      record and/or the subject and become part of the research record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample storage of the organism&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biologic samples (organism) will be under the control of the principal investigator of&#xD;
      this research project. To protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name,&#xD;
      social security number, and birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a&#xD;
      specific code number. The information linking these code numbers to the corresponding&#xD;
      subjects' identities will be kept in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this&#xD;
      study will keep the samples indefinitely. The biologic samples will be provided to Dr. Curtis&#xD;
      Donskey, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio. Dr Donskey will perform colony&#xD;
      counts on the samples in order to determine the density of organisms in the sample, using&#xD;
      methods he described in work he published in the New England Journal of Medicine (11). All&#xD;
      samples will be provided de-identified. Dr Paterson will perform pulsed field gel&#xD;
      electrophoresis on the isolates to determine if isolates are genotypically identical between&#xD;
      baseline and post-SDD. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples&#xD;
      collected and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in Dr&#xD;
      Paterson's laboratory in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street or in Donskey's&#xD;
      laboratory at the Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, East Avenue, Cleveland OH.&#xD;
