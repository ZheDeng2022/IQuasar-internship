  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease Type II) is caused by a deficiency of a&#xD;
      critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the&#xD;
      body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized structures&#xD;
      called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount of glycogen accumulates&#xD;
      and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which prevents their&#xD;
      normal function. The overall objective is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      efficacy of Myozyme treatment.&#xD;
