  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a 52-week, multicenter, open-label study to determine the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate) extended-release tablets (metoprolol&#xD;
      CR/XL) in hypertensive pediatric subjects. The study population included school age children&#xD;
      (age 6 to 12 years &lt; Tanner Stage 3) and adolescents (&gt; 12 years old or &gt; Tanner Stage 3 to&#xD;
      16 years old) of both genders. Because response to some therapies in adult hypertension&#xD;
      appears to be different in black and non-black populations, the recruitment will have a&#xD;
      mixture of black and non-black subjects. Pharmacokinetic measurements were performed on a&#xD;
      subset of patients. Thirty subjects (15 subjects each in the 6 to 12 year age group and the&#xD;
      13 to 16 year age group) had a series of blood samples drawn. All subjects had a trough&#xD;
      plasma level taken 24 hours after the last dose of open-label metoprolol CR/XL (Visit 18)&#xD;
      with the exception of those subjects who completed Protocol 307B (16 week open-label&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;
