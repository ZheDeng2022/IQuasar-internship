      This is a research study to determine whether omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, when taken&#xD;
      with the antidepressant medication escitalopram (Lexapro), helps to improve depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in individuals who have major depressive disorder (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omega-3 fatty acids are found in foods including walnuts, some fruits and vegetables, and&#xD;
      coldwater fish such as herring, mackerel, sturgeon, and anchovies.&#xD;

      Primary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine whether measures of essential fatty acid (EFA) membrane composition&#xD;
      predict symptom improvement during selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment of&#xD;
      major depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine whether augmentation with the EFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is likely&#xD;
      to benefit patients who have had an inadequate improvement following four weeks of SSRI&#xD;
      monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine the degree to which improvement following omega-3 supplementation in SSRI&#xD;
      partial responders reflects changes in the erythrocyte concentrations of EPA and DHA and in&#xD;
      the ratio of EPA to arachidonic acid (AA) erythrocyte concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether relationships between changes in tissue EFA concentrations and changes&#xD;
      in depressive symptoms following omega-3 supplementation are mediated by changes in cytokine&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: After four weeks of treatment with the SSRI escitalopram Montgomery-Asberg&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores will correlate positively with baseline RBC&#xD;
      concentrations of EPA and DHA and negatively with baseline erythrocyte ratios of AA to EPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Among patients who continue to meet criteria for MDD after four weeks of&#xD;
      treatment, both those randomized to .7 grams and those randomized to 1.5 grams daily of EPA&#xD;
      supplementation will show a greater mean improvement in MADRS scores after an additional six&#xD;
      weeks than will those assigned to placebo supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: After patients who have had inadequate antidepressant responses to SSRI&#xD;
      treatment complete six weeks of augmentation with placebo, or with .7 grams or 1.5 grams per&#xD;
      day of EPA, a relationships will exist between final MADRS scores and both the final RBC&#xD;
      concentrations of DHA and EPA and the final RBC ratio of AA to EPA. These relationships will&#xD;
      resemble those between baseline RBC concentrations and subsequent responses to escitalopram&#xD;
      and will suggest therapeutic ranges for these concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among patients with erythrocyte EPA concentrations less than 0.82% at the beginning of the&#xD;
      augmentation trial, the association between subsequent changes in depressive symptoms and EPA&#xD;
      tissue concentrations will be markedly reduced by the introduction of changes in IL-1 beta,&#xD;
      IL-10 and PGE2 into the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase one is a four-week open trial and is designed to test specific response predictors. A&#xD;
      subset of subjects who complete phase one will enter phase two, a six-week, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial designed to show whether eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an effective&#xD;
      augmentation agent in patients who have had an inadequate antidepressant response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot of thirty (30) subjects, aged 18-55 years, with current major depressive disorder who&#xD;
      have taken not regularly taken antidepressants in the previous month. Cognitively impaired&#xD;
      subjects will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study designed to demonstrate the feasibility for an NIMH application. It is&#xD;
      not currently powered to statistically test the listed hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes for both phases will be the final MADRS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited through advertisement and through the University of Iowa Hospitals&#xD;
      and Clinics (UIHC) adult clinic. Advertisements will also be placed in the newspapers of&#xD;
      cities within a 100-mile radius of UIHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's research associate will screen calls, contact respondents, and administer the&#xD;
      screening to determine eligibility. Those who appear to satisfy entry criteria will be given&#xD;
      appointments to meet with the PI and Co-PI. If the in-person evaluation confirms the&#xD;
      subject's eligibility, he or she will be given a consent form and be invited to ask any&#xD;
      remaining questions he or she might have. The protocol could begin at that visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active study agents: Escitalopram and eicosupentaenoic acid (EPA). A variety of&#xD;
      antidepressants are available for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). A number&#xD;
      of psychotherapeutic approaches also have demonstrated effectiveness. Potential subjects&#xD;
      could receive both escitalopram and EPA without participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo study agents: Placebo capsules will match the EPA capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug will be locked and maintained in the medical education building. Data forms and&#xD;
      computerized data will be stored in the University of Iowa Medical Education Building.&#xD;
      Offices and cabinets will be locked, computer files will be password protected. The lab of&#xD;
      Arthur Spector, M.D. will analyze the blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase one, subject will be given a 4 week supply of 10 mg escitalopram (Lexapro) and&#xD;
      instructed to take one pill a day for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible for phase 2 of the study, subject will continue to take 10 mg of escitalopram but&#xD;
      will also be randomly assigned to take, in addition, either 0.7 grams or 1.5grams of the EPA&#xD;
      or a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ** If depression symptoms have improved by greater than 50% at the end of week 4, subject&#xD;
      will be given a 1 month supply of escitalopram and will be assisted in obtaining psychiatric&#xD;
      care in their area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If depression symptoms have not improved by greater than 50% at the end of week 4 subject&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in Phase 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will begin with the administration of a structured diagnostic interview, the&#xD;
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV Diagnosis (SCID), and two depression rating scales,&#xD;
      the Montgomery Asburg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Rating Scale (HRS).&#xD;
      Two tubes of blood will be drawn, one for erythrocyte EFA concentration determination and the&#xD;
      other for quantification of inflammatory markers (c-reactive protein). Subjects will then be&#xD;
      supplied with a one-month supply of escitalopram (Lexapro) with instructions to take one 10mg&#xD;
      capsule each morning. Return visits at two weeks and four weeks will be scheduled and&#xD;
      subjects will be instructed to return with any remaining medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted at weekly intervals. During a brief telephone conversation he or&#xD;
      she will ask whether the subject has any questions or has experienced any troublesome side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who meet the criteria for inadequate escitalopram response described above will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in a six-week trial of supplemental omega-3. Subjects will continue&#xD;
      taking escitalopram at the previous dose of 10mg daily but will be randomly assigned to take,&#xD;
      in addition, either 0.7 grams or 1.5 grams of the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits for phase 2 will be scheduled at weeks 6, 8, and 10. At week 4 and 10 blood samples&#xD;
      for erythrocyte EFA concentrations and cytokine determinations will be drawn. MADRS will be&#xD;
      rated on these visits.&#xD;
