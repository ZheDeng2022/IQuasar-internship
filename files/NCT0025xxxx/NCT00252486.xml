    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that flax oil, as an omega-3 fatty acid,&#xD;
      will be superior to placebo in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder in children and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective was to determine if flax oil is efficacious in the pediatric bipolar&#xD;
      population for reducing symptoms of mania and depression. A secondary objective was to&#xD;
      examine fatty acid levels as predictors of treatment response and symptom severity. This&#xD;
      clinical trial evaluated whether supplementation with flax oil, containing the omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acid alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LNA), safely reduced symptom severity in youth with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pediatric bipolar disorder is a difficult-to-treat recurrent mental illness characterized by&#xD;
      a predominant mood state of irritability, and often mixed, rapid-cycling, and psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms. Results of randomized controlled trials of lithium, valproic acid, and&#xD;
      antipsychotics for early onset bipolar disorder offer hope of improvement for many, yet also&#xD;
      demonstrate need for additional treatment options for those children who do not respond&#xD;
      adequately to, or cannot tolerate, a first-line mood stabilizer alone or in combination with&#xD;
      an atypical antipsychotic. As popular over-the-counter dietary supplements, omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids represent an appealing option for treatment in the younger bipolar population as they&#xD;
      are likely to be better tolerated and cost less compared with conventional mood stabilizing&#xD;
      agents. In addition, they have appeal to parents and adolescents due to their perception as a&#xD;
      'natural' substance and relative lack of systemic side effects. To our knowledge, there are&#xD;
      no prospective, randomized, controlled trials of flax oil for the treatment of bipolar&#xD;
      disorder or selectively evaluating omega-3 fatty acids in the child and adolescent bipolar&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adolescents aged 6-17 years with symptomatic Bipolar I or II disorder (n=51),&#xD;
      manic, hypomanic, mixed, or depressed, were randomized to either flax oil capsules containing&#xD;
      550 mg alpha-linolenic acid per 1 gram or an olive oil placebo adjunctively or as&#xD;
      monotherapy. Doses were titrated to 12 capsules per day as tolerated over 16 weeks. Primary&#xD;
      outcomes included changes in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Child Depression Rating&#xD;
      Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), and Clinical Global Impressions- Bipolar (CGI-BP) ratings using&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Baseline and end-of-study free fatty acids were measured and&#xD;
      examined for change and relevance to effect.&#xD;

    <description>Flax oil and olive oil placebo were analyzed for quality and purity; sufficient bioactivity was confirmed for the flax oil independently at the University of Massachusetts mid-way through the study. Each capsule of omega -3 fatty acid concentrate contained 550 mg of α-linolenic acid (α-LNA) from flax seed oil.A stepped but flexible dose-titration schedule was carried out with doses increased by 1-2 grams at each visit as tolerated, to an attempted total dose of 6 capsules twice per day, as requested by the FDA (up to 6.6 grams of daily α-linolenic acid).</description>
