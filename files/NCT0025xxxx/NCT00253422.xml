      RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using&#xD;
      fulvestrant, anastrozole, or exemestane may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of&#xD;
      estrogen by the tumor cells or by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. It is not&#xD;
      yet known whether giving fulvestrant together with anastrozole is more effective than giving&#xD;
      fulvestrant together with a placebo or exemestane alone in treating breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying fulvestrant and anastrozole to see how&#xD;
      well they work compared to fulvestrant and a placebo or exemestane alone in treating&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare progression-free survival of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor- and/or&#xD;
           progesterone receptor-positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that&#xD;
           relapsed or progressed during prior treatment with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors&#xD;
           treated with fulvestrant with vs without anastrozole vs exemestane alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the objective complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rate and duration&#xD;
           of response in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the clinical benefit (i.e., 6-month CR, PR, and stable disease) rate and&#xD;
           duration of clinical benefit in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare time to treatment failure in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the tolerability of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, partially double-blind and placebo-controlled, multicenter&#xD;
      study. Patients are stratified according to the setting in which prior nonsteroidal&#xD;
      aromatase-inhibitor therapy was given (adjuvant therapy vs first-line therapy) and&#xD;
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (fulvestrant and anastrozole): Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM)&#xD;
           on days 1, 15, and 29 and then once monthly. Patients receive oral anastrozole once&#xD;
           daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (fulvestrant and placebo): Patients receive fulvestrant as in arm I and oral&#xD;
           placebo once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III (exemestane alone): Patients receive oral exemestane once daily. In all arms,&#xD;
           treatment repeats every month in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 750 patients (250 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
