  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate safety and efficacy of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for treatment&#xD;
      of previously irradiated recurrent head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: Identify acute and late toxicities, response rates, locoregional control,&#xD;
      disease free survival, and overall survival with IMRT. Also, tumor response, the amount of&#xD;
      tumor shrinkage or reduction, will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Recurrent head and neck cancer is regarded as having limited treatment modalities&#xD;
      since salvage surgery can only be accomplished on limited subgroups of patients. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      has not shown clear clinical benefits and has significant toxicity. Re-irradiation has been&#xD;
      used as a treatment modality. However, the re-irradiation dose is limited by significant&#xD;
      toxicity that occurs with the cumulative dose of radiation. The use of IMRT can give a high&#xD;
      dose to the recurrent tumor while limiting the dose to critical structures in the vicinity of&#xD;
      the reirradiated volume thereby limiting toxicity and treating the recurrence to an adequate&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects was determined from 2 stage design with a historical control group as&#xD;
      comparison, and these numbers of subjects were found to be 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed that this treatment regimen will not be of further interest if the true&#xD;
      response rate is less than 32.6% (Po0.326). It is also assumed that a true response rate of&#xD;
      53% or more (P10.53) would be of considerable interest in the treatment of recurrent head and&#xD;
      neck cancer. The type I error (the probability of rejecting the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      proportion responding to the treatment is less than or equal to Po when this hypothesis is&#xD;
      actually true) is 0.05.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have pathologically confirmed recurrence (reappearance of previously&#xD;
             cleared) of a squamous cell cancer primary located in the upper aerodigestive tract or&#xD;
             a second squamous cell primary. Patients may have experienced more than one recurrence&#xD;
             as long as the first recurrence occurred greater than 6 months following the end of&#xD;
             the prior RT. Pathology slides from primary as well as recurrence must to be obtained&#xD;
             for review by UCI Department of Pathology to confirm histology and patient&#xD;
             eligibility. Previous radiation records including simulation and portal films must be&#xD;
             submitted to the UCI Department of Radiation Oncology for review of treated areas and&#xD;
             to assure that spinal cord tolerance is not exceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The recurrence or second primary must have defined bidimensional measurement as&#xD;
             follows: All tumor measurements must be recorded in centimeters and should consist of&#xD;
             the two longest perpendicular cross-diameters. Patients will be separately assessed&#xD;
             for response by physical exam and by CT scan with contrast (unless contraindicated) or&#xD;
             MRI scan with T1 contrast with gadolinium (unless contraindicated) and T2 sequences&#xD;
             prior to and two months following completion of therapy. Both the clinical (physical&#xD;
             exam) and radiographic (CT or MRI) response will be recorded on the study forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Recurrence or second primary must be confined to the head and neck above the clavicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient must not be a candidate for or refuses complete surgical (re)resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The majority (&gt;75%) of the tumor volume must have been in areas previously irradiated&#xD;
             to &gt;45 Gy. The previous irradiation must not exceed a maximum of 75 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Primary and recurrent cancer treatment cumulative radiation dose must limit total&#xD;
             spinal cord dose to 50 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be at least 1 month from prior chemotherapy and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Karnofsky status 60 or greater. (appendix)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. WBC &gt;4000/mm3, granulocytes &gt;2,000/mm3, platelets &gt;100,000/mm3, serum bilirubin &lt;1.5&#xD;
             mg/dl, creatinine &lt;1.8 mg/dl within one month from enrollment in protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. If liver chemistries are above normal limits, a liver ultrasound or CT will be&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient must not have a history of other invasive malignancies within the past five&#xD;
             years, excluding non-melanomatous skin cancer or cervical cancer in-situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of other invasive malignancies within the past five years excluding&#xD;
             non-melanomatous skin cancer or cervical cancer in-situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Medical condition, which would impede patient tolerance of therapy, completion of&#xD;
             therapy or limit survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women who are pregnant will be excluded from this trial. A pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             offered to women of child bearing age who are otherwise eligible for the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients under 18 years of age will be excluded since head and neck cancer is unlikely&#xD;
             and due to risk of long term toxicity from radiation including secondary malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients on any treatment currently for the recurrent head and neck cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients have any untreated infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients are candidate for complete surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients have the previous irradiation exceeded a maximum of 75 Gy&#xD;
