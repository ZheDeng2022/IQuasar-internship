      The purpose of this study is to determine if bone marrow progenitor cell (BMPC) autologous&#xD;
      transplantation in children after isolated traumatic brain injury is safe and will improve&#xD;
      functional outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to 50% of all trauma deaths. The mortality rate for&#xD;
      children following severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 9) ranges from 14-24%. There is currently&#xD;
      no therapy to reverse the primary injury associated with TBI. Bone marrow precursor cells&#xD;
      (BMPC) or bone marrow mononuclear cellular fractions of bone marrow contain mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells (MSC) and hematopoetic stem cells (HSC). These cells are a component of bone marrow&#xD;
      that preferentially migrate to the site of brain injury and differentiate into neurons and&#xD;
      cell supporting elements, improving functional outcome in animals. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine if BMPC harvest and autologous transplantation is safe in children&#xD;
      after TBI. The secondary objective is to determine if late functional outcome is improved&#xD;
      with BMPC autologous transplantation compared to age and severity matched concomitant&#xD;
      controls. Safety will be determined by monitoring cerebral and systemic hemodynamics during&#xD;
      harvest and transplantation, neurologic events (seizure, change in GCS, stroke), local site&#xD;
      inflammation/injury, and secondary organ injury. Late outcomes will be determined using&#xD;
      age-corrected Glasgow Outcome Scores, and a battery of functional outcome measures. In vitro,&#xD;
      an aliquot of cells harvested from patients will be studied for labeling with&#xD;
      magnetodendrimers as a feasibility study, and these cells will not be reinfused into the&#xD;
      patients. The primary endpoint is to assess the safety of autologous BMPC&#xD;
      harvest/transplantation in the acute injury phase (hospital stay) and the secondary endpoint&#xD;
      is to assess efficacy through 1 and 6 month post-injury follow-up. The rationale for the use&#xD;
      of autologous BMPC transplantation is based on a large volume of in vitro and in vivo animal&#xD;
      data (see background and significance section). The rationale for using children as the&#xD;
      primary population is that children have a greater neurologic plasticity with a unique injury&#xD;
      pattern when compared to adults. Children are more likely to have isolated TBI that is more&#xD;
      diffuse and less likely to be secondary to extra-axial fluid collections. Patients aged 5-14&#xD;
      years old with GCS of 5-8 will be considered for enrollment into the study. Within 24-36&#xD;
      hours of injury, enrolled patients will undergo bone marrow harvest/BMPC separation and&#xD;
      re-infusion. Daily monitoring of the safety outcomes measures and long term neurologic&#xD;
      outcomes will be performed. This study should determine if bone marrow harvest, BMPC&#xD;
      separation, and reinfusion is safe in children after severe TBI.&#xD;
