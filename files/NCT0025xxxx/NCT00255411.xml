    <textblock>
      This study will explore how the mind and the brain work to cause movement symptoms or&#xD;
      seizures in people who do not have a recognized neurological or medical disorder. The study&#xD;
      includes a check for psychiatric disorders, symptoms and their severity; psychiatric and&#xD;
      personality questionnaires; and neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal, healthy volunteers, people who have movement symptoms not due to a brain or medical&#xD;
      disorder and people who have seizures not due to epilepsy may be eligible for this study. All&#xD;
      candidates must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants have a medical history, physical examination and psychological evaluation,&#xD;
      including completion of questionnaires. People with movement symptoms or seizures have a&#xD;
      symptoms evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants also undergo neuropsychological testing, including questionnaires,&#xD;
      pen-and-paper or computerized tests, and motor tasks.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are (1) to investigate the relationship between childhood abuse&#xD;
      and dissociative experiences in both psychogenic movement disorders (PMD) and non-epileptic&#xD;
      seizures (NES) and (2) to investigate the relationship between childhood abuse and both PMD&#xD;
      and NES. The secondary objective of the study is to investigate if measures of response&#xD;
      inhibition differ between PMD subjects compared to normal controls. This study is part of a&#xD;
      larger study investigating the psychological and biological correlates of conversion&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study adult patients with diagnoses of PMD seen by the Human Motor Control&#xD;
      Section clinic or patients with diagnoses of NES seen by the Epilepsy clinic and normal&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A psychiatric assessment, measurement scales and neuropsychological testing will be&#xD;
      administered to the PMD and NES patients and normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first primary outcome measure will be the comparison of the different subtypes of&#xD;
      childhood abuse (as measured by the Childhood Trauma Interview) and the severity of&#xD;
      dissociation (as measured by the Dissociative Experiences Scale). The second primary outcome&#xD;
      measure will be the comparison of frequencies of different subtypes of childhood abuse (as&#xD;
      measured by the Childhood Trauma Interview) between PMD, NES and normal control groups. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome measure will be the comparison of stop-signal reaction time as measured&#xD;
      with the stop-signal task.&#xD;
