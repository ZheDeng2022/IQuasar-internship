  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerated dose of NC-4016&#xD;
      that can be given to patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. The safety of the drug&#xD;
      will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be enrolled in&#xD;
      either a dose escalation group or the dose expansion group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are in a dose escalation group, they will be assigned to a dose level based&#xD;
      on when they joined this study. Up to 6 dose levels of NC-4016 will be tested and at least 3&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive&#xD;
      the lowest dose level of NC-4016. Each new group will receive a higher dose of NC-4016 than&#xD;
      the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the&#xD;
      highest tolerable dose of NC-4016 is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are in the dose expansion group, they will receive NC-4016 at the highest&#xD;
      dose that was tolerated in the escalation groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive NC-4016 by vein over 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. They may&#xD;
      ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants have a severe side effect, their dose of study drug may be delayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and temperature) will be&#xD;
           monitored every 20 minutes during the infusion and 1 hour after the end of the infusion&#xD;
           during Cycle 1 and right before and at the end of the infusion for all other cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a neurological exam and electromyogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an EKG before the start of the infusion, at the end of the&#xD;
           infusion, and 1 hour after the end of the infusion (Cycle 1 and 2 only). After Cycle 1,&#xD;
           Participants will only have 1 EKG before dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 8 and 15 of each cycle, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2 of Cycle 1 participants will have an EKG corresponding to the 24 hour PK testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 cycles (every 9 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an x-ray, CT, MRI, or PET scan to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants have lymphoma, they will have a bone marrow biopsy to check the status&#xD;
           of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a nerve conduction evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for tumor&#xD;
           marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing&#xD;
      measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 3, blood will be drawn before, then at 0.5, 1, and 2 hours&#xD;
           during the infusion, and then 9 more times up to 12 hours after participants receive the&#xD;
           study drug (13 draws total each day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 and 3, blood will be drawn 1 time after&#xD;
           participants receive the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and Cycle 4, blood will be drawn 1 time before participants receive&#xD;
           the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine will be collected for PK testing at the following time points during Cycles 1 and 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before participants receive the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0-2 hours (during the infusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-4 hours after they received the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4-8 hours after they received the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8-12 hours after they received the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-24 hours after they received the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will collect their urine at home over 24 hours during the following times after&#xD;
      they received the study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 1-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 2-3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 7-8&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 14-15&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 21-22&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor will provide participants with urine collection bottles. Urine samples will&#xD;
      contain a very small amount of platinum from the study drug. This is not considered to be a&#xD;
      risk, but as a precaution, the urine collection containers should only be handled by&#xD;
      participants, and the containers will be labeled as a &quot;Bio-Hazard&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants have a severe side effect, they may have extra tests until the side effects&#xD;
      have gotten better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may continue taking the study drug for as long as they are benefitting.&#xD;
      Participants will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, intolerable side&#xD;
      effects occur, they develop new health problems, their doctor thinks that it is no longer in&#xD;
      their best interest to receive the study drug, or if they are unable to follow study&#xD;
      directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' participation on the study will be over after the end-of-dosing visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Dosing Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 28 days after the last dose of NC-4016 participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a neurological exam and an electromyogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have an x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, or PET scan, or a bone marrow biopsy if they have&#xD;
           lymphoma, to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have an EKG and an ECHO or MUGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for tumor&#xD;
           marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. NC-4016 is not commercially available or FDA approved. It&#xD;
      is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how NC-4016&#xD;
      is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>Dose Escalation Group: NC-4016 will be administered as 2-hour intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks. Initial dose level 15 mg/m2. The dose level of NC-4016 in subsequent cohorts determined by the toxicity profile of the previous cohort, and dose level increased to 25, 30, 40, 60, and 80 mg/m2 or higher at each subsequent cycle until the highest dose level is reached or DLT prohibits further dose-level escalation. Dose level 1 will be the starting dose level (DL). If 2 out of the first 3 patients enrolled at DL1 experience a DLT during Cycle 1 or Cycle 2,then the next cohort of patients will be enrolled at DL0 (10 mg/m2).&#xD;
