      The current study aims to investigate the efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy&#xD;
      (MBCT) for reducing fatigue in Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients in remission.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, i.e. Crohn's&#xD;
      disease and ulcerative colitis), and may negatively impact patients' illness management,&#xD;
      treatment adherence, and quality of life. Given this burden, effective treatment for reducing&#xD;
      fatigue in IBD patients is warranted. A promising psychological treatment is&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). MBCT is a standardized, highly structured&#xD;
      eight-week group program for reducing stress, depression, fatigue and/or pain. Several&#xD;
      meta-analyses have demonstrated the effectiveness of MBCT in reducing psychological&#xD;
      complaints and improving quality of life. Moreover, in patients with cancer or chronic&#xD;
      fatigue syndrome, there is preliminary evidence that MBCT can be effective in reducing&#xD;
      fatigue. Given this lack of evidence for the efficacy of MBCT in reducing fatigue in general&#xD;
      and the specific and strongly illness-related nature of fatigue in patients with IBD and&#xD;
      characteristics of the illness, including its lifelong and relapsing nature, there is a need&#xD;
      to verify whether MBCT is effective in reducing fatigue in IBD patients with severe fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to investigate the efficacy of Mindfulness-Based&#xD;
      Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in reducing fatigue in severely fatigued IBD patients. Additionally,&#xD;
      the effects of MBCT on clinically relevant secondary outcomes will be examined: fatigue&#xD;
      interference, mood, IBD-specific quality of life, sleep quality, labor participation. Also&#xD;
      patients' satisfaction will be assessed. Moreover, mediators and moderators will be examined&#xD;
      to increase the understanding of why and for whom MBCT is particularly effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial will be performed, including two conditions: MBCT and a&#xD;
      waitlist control group (who will receive MBCT after a waiting period of three months). The&#xD;
      study sample will consist of 128 adult patients with IBD in remission and experiencing severe&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;
