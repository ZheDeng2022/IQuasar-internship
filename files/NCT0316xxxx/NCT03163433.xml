  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine the potentials of involving patients with metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma in their own care planning through systematic use of patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      measures (PROM). Furthermore, to examine the outcome of health-related quality of life,&#xD;
      self-efficacy and impact on the patient-physician interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (N=282) will be included from three highly specialized hospitals in Denmark. At one&#xD;
      hospital patients will complete PROM before each consultation during a year (intervention&#xD;
      group). At the two other hospitals patients will not complete PROM (control group). In&#xD;
      addition to baseline, measurements will take place after three, six and 12 months. The&#xD;
      project is organized and executed with patient involvement in the research process.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, treatment of metastatic melanoma has changed significantly, which has led to&#xD;
      improved prognosis and greater expectations for the future. However, new concerns in relation&#xD;
      to health-related quality of life and coping with disease in everyday life have emerged.&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) is a promising tool to strengthen patient&#xD;
      involvement. By systematically reporting real time PROM to the physician prior to a&#xD;
      consultation, it may generate a continuous feedback loop, by which the patient physician&#xD;
      dialogue can focus on what is most important to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the potentials of using PROM as a dialogue-based tool.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that PROM as a dialogue-based tool can:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve patients' knowledge, skills, and confidence for managing their health and&#xD;
           healthcare&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce the perceived burden of physical symptoms and emotional dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve the quality of the patient-physician interaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study patients (N=282) will be included from three highly specialized&#xD;
      hospitals in Denmark. At Aarhus University Hospital, patients will complete electronic PROM&#xD;
      before the consultation and systematically participate in a dialogue about their&#xD;
      self-assessments for a duration of one year (intervention group). At Herlev Hospital and&#xD;
      Odense University Hospital, patients will not complete PROM (control group). In addition to&#xD;
      baseline, self-reported measurements will take place after three, six and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the patient perspective, patients with melanoma are involved in the project&#xD;
      management. A steering group with scientists and patient representatives has been&#xD;
      established. This group have chosen the relevant PROM, determined primary objectives and&#xD;
      given feedback on the written information material for the intervention by looking at&#xD;
      relevance and readability. Moreover the group will ensure optimal implementation if results&#xD;
      are promising. In addition, a patient focus group will be established to discuss how PROM&#xD;
      should be used in the consultation and how patient involvement is expressed in practice. The&#xD;
      recruitment of patients to these groups will be made in cooperation with the association for&#xD;
      patients with melanoma and clinical practice where the patients are treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives If results are positive, the intervention will be easy to apply to routine&#xD;
      settings and in a slightly adjusted form in other groups of cancer patients too.&#xD;
