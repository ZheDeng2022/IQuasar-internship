      The purpose of this study is to determine if TAR-302-5018, an investigational drug-delivery&#xD;
      system, is safe and tolerable in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO)&#xD;
      resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Safety will be assessed from the signing of the informed consent form through Study Day 49 (+ 7 days) for a total of up to 77 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed throughout the study based on reported AEs, investigational product events (IPEs), physical examinations (PEs), vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, scheduled cystoscopic examinations, bladder ultrasounds, bladder post-void residual volume (PVR), and the use of concomitant medications.</description>
