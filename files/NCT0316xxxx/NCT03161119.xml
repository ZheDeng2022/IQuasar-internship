    <textblock>
      Numerous published trials now document that the embryo transfer (ET) procedure has a huge&#xD;
      impact on pregnancy and delivery rates after IVF (In Vitro Fertilization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the ease of use (defined as the rate of successful atraumatic insertion) of&#xD;
      different types of embryo transfer (ET) catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized unblinded controlled clinical trial is performed to determine if&#xD;
      there is any difference in ease of use among 2 different catheters : Cook k-soft-5000, Cook&#xD;
      K-JETS-551910-S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: patients &lt; / = 38 years of age, body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 28,&#xD;
      at least one frozen-thawed blastocyst transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection)-TESE (Testicular Sperm&#xD;
      Extraction) IVF cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of 352 consecutive women undergoing embryo transfer will be selected for this&#xD;
      prospective, randomized controlled trial. Two protocols for endometrial preparation will be&#xD;
      used before frozen/thawed blastocyst transfer: the modified spontaneous protocol and the&#xD;
      oral/transdermal preparation protocol. ET will be done with patient in lithotomy position,&#xD;
      under ultrasound guidance. No anesthesia will be used for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      176 patients will be enrolled in this trial and randomized to enter one of the two catheter&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo transfer (ET) is the final and critical step in the long pathway of in vitro&#xD;
      fertilization (IVF) treatment. Implantation is a complex process and, as yet, one not fully&#xD;
      understood. Aside from the quality of the embryos replaced and the receptivity of the&#xD;
      endometrium, the embryo transfer procedure itself might impact the implantation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure has changed very little since the first descriptions. Numerous data suggest&#xD;
      that difficult transfers should be avoided, as they are likely to reduce the chances of&#xD;
      implantation and subsequent pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been proposed on the basis of small studies that traumatic embryo transfer can induce&#xD;
      uterine contractions capable of displacing the embryo or induce unwanted endometrial damage.&#xD;
      The evidence is unclear, however, as whilst several studies support this concept, others do&#xD;
      not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Free hand embryo transfer with soft catheters under ultrasound guidance is considered the&#xD;
      best option in transferring embryos. Many retrospective trials have reported higher Pregnancy&#xD;
      Rates (PR) with soft catheters compared with hard catheters. However in technically difficult&#xD;
      ET, where difficulties are met in negotiating the cervical os, the use of harder catheters is&#xD;
      needed. The change from soft to hard catheters in these transfers, along with the difficulty&#xD;
      of the transfer itself, may account for differences in pregnancy rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand it is likely that the experience of the clinicians and their confidence&#xD;
      with the catheter are the main variables involved in this 'artistic' skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of a large recent RCT, variations in the PR may depend on variations between&#xD;
      operators and their confidence with different type of catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators work in a large teaching hospital where many different operators with&#xD;
      different levels of experience perform ET. The rate of difficult ET varies considerably&#xD;
      between operators (between 15% and 42%, median 30%) although the overall PR does not vary&#xD;
      significantly. With this study the investigators would like to point out whether or not there&#xD;
      is a catheter that is able to significantly reduce the difficult transfer rate. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome is to assess if one of the catheters is able to sensibly minimize the differences in&#xD;
      difficult transfer rate between operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing differences in terms of difficult embryo-transfer rate among two different type of&#xD;
      catheter: Cook k-soft-5000 (or K-J-SP-681710 and K-J-SPPE-681710) and Cook K-JETS-551910-S.&#xD;
      In order to achieve a measurable difference in the ease of use of the two catheters we&#xD;
      decided to compare the median percentage of 'difficult transfer' for all the operators&#xD;
      performing the included ETs with the two different catheters. Moreover we aim to study the&#xD;
      percentage of difficult ET among operators with the two ET catheters in order to highlight if&#xD;
      different catheters may be associated to different interoperator variability in difficult ET&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods 352 consecutive women undergoing frozen/thawed blastocyst transfer will&#xD;
      be selected for this prospective, randomized controlled trial. The frozen blastocysts result&#xD;
      from supernumerary embryos or from 'freeze all policy' in patients at high risk of Severe&#xD;
      Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization of the single patient to one of the two study branches will be done by the&#xD;
      nurse or the embryologist just before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial preparation (modified spontaneous cycle and pharmacological endometrial&#xD;
      preparation) Modified Spontaneous cycle In patient with regular menses, the endometrial&#xD;
      thickness and dominant follicle diameter are monitored with transvaginal scan beginning on&#xD;
      day 8 since period onset. When preovulatory follicle reaches the mean diameter of at least 16&#xD;
      mm a vial of hCG (human Chorionic Gonadotropin) 5000 IU is administered subcutaneously,&#xD;
      intravaginal Progesterone is started 2 days later and the blastocyst transfer is scheduled 7&#xD;
      days after hCG injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological Endometrial preparation In patient with irregular menses, endometrial&#xD;
      preparation with oral or transdermal oestradiol is prescribed and started on day 2 of the&#xD;
      period. Endometrial thickness and ovarian quiescence are monitored via transvaginal scan&#xD;
      starting on day 10-12 since the period onset. When endometrial thickness reaches a minimum of&#xD;
      7,5 mm, intravaginal progesterone is started and blastocyst transfer is performed 5 days&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique of ET On the day of ET, patient will be asked to come with a full bladder. ET will&#xD;
      be done with patient in lithotomy position. No anesthesia will be used for the procedure.&#xD;
      Under sterile condition, speculum is inserted to expose cervix, cervix will be cleaned with&#xD;
      sterile physiologic solution and gently draped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Et procedure itself is standardized as far as possible amongst the participating&#xD;
      physicians to eliminate bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Transfer technique with the two different catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheter Cook K-Jets-551910-S consists of an outer firm and an inner ultrasoft catheter.&#xD;
           The outer guiding catheter (17 cm long) is slightly stiff, with a preshaped curve and a&#xD;
           rounded bulb tip to help negotiate the cervical canal. It has a depth marker at 4 cm&#xD;
           from the tip, which can be pulled back to a second marker at 5 cm. The inner catheter&#xD;
           (23 cm long) is made of a soft material with a rounded bullet tip. In general, the inner&#xD;
           catheter does not negotiate the cervical canal directly but rather is introduced into&#xD;
           the uterine cavity through the outer catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheter Cook k-soft-5000 (or K-J-SP-681710 and K-J-SPPE-681710): this catheter system&#xD;
           consists of an outer firm and inner soft catheter. The outer guiding catheter (15,4 cm&#xD;
           long) is straight and made of flexible material. The inner catheter (23 cm long) is made&#xD;
           of a very soft and flexible polyurethan. The inner catheter is introduced directly&#xD;
           through the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Easy transfers are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cook k-soft-5000 catheter: straight-forward advancing of the preloaded inner catheter&#xD;
           through the cervix, the internal os and the uterine cavity up to the site of embryo&#xD;
           release, chosen on the basis of an acceptable Ultrasound vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cook K-JETS-551910-S catheter: straight-forward advancement of the outer catheter&#xD;
           through the cervix up to the internal os followed by straight-forward advancement of the&#xD;
           inner loaded catheter from outer catheter tip to the site of embryo release, chosen on&#xD;
           the basis of acceptable Ultrasound vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficult transfers are defined as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cook k-soft-5000 catheter (or K-J-SP-681710 and K-J-SPPE-681710): advancement of the&#xD;
           outer sheath, multiple attempts, force, required manipulation, use of a stylet or&#xD;
           tenaculum, dilatation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cook K-JETS-551910-S catheter: required manipulation, multiple attempts, force, the use&#xD;
           of a stylet or tenaculum, dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy assessment Clinical pregnancy will be defined as follows: a pregnancy diagnosed by&#xD;
      ultrasonographic visualization of one or more gestational sacs or definitive clinical signs&#xD;
      of pregnancy. It includes ectopic pregnancy. Live birth was defined as delivery of a living&#xD;
      baby after at least 24 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerosity The sample size has been calculated on the basis of historical difficult Et rate&#xD;
      registered in years 2014 and 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the period 01/01/2014-31/12/2015 a total of 1014 ET were performed. We calculated a 28 %&#xD;
      of difficult ET with a 30% median of difficult transfer rate among all operators and the&#xD;
      number of operators performing the procedure was 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to detect a 50 % difference in difficult ET rate (90% power), 352 patients need to&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study (176 patients per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management The data collected on the ET will be registered in a specific database in&#xD;
      which each patient will be identified by an identification code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this trial will have consented in writing that their medical records&#xD;
      could be used for research purposes, as long as the patients' anonymity was protected and&#xD;
      confidentiality of the medical record was assured.&#xD;
