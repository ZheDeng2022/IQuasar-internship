  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children has high prevalence and severe&#xD;
      complications, and its first line of treatment (adenotonsillectomy) has risk of&#xD;
      complications. Even though the use of presurgical CPAP seems logical due to its effects in&#xD;
      adults, it must be studied in children due to the different physiopathology and adherence.&#xD;
      One non-invasive way of study the effect is via acoustic pharyngometry, which can measure the&#xD;
      anatomical site of obstruction. The post-surgical anatomical changes could correlate with a&#xD;
      persistent OSAS, which would be helpful in selecting those patients who require a post&#xD;
      surgical sleep study. The main goal of the study is to cuantify the changes in the&#xD;
      oropharyngeal volume via acoustic pahryngometry after CPAP use, and also the changes after&#xD;
      adentonsillectomy in children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is defined as recurrent events of obstruction of&#xD;
      the upper airway (with alteration of normal oxygenation, ventilation or sleep pattern). In&#xD;
      children originates complications such as cognitive, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders&#xD;
      and growth failure, which make its management imperative. It has a reported prevalence&#xD;
      between 1 and 5%, highest between 2 and 8 years old, due to tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy,&#xD;
      which causes obstruction of the upper airway, unlike the fat deposits of adults. This&#xD;
      physiopathological cause of obstruction makes adenotonsillectomy the first line of&#xD;
      management. This is a secure procedure, which still has an incidence of complications of 19%,&#xD;
      (9.5% respiratory and 2.4% secondary bleeding). Those with OSAS present complications more&#xD;
      frequently than those without7. Even though the surgery is considered succesful, up to 21.6%&#xD;
      of those treated present persistence of the disease. Based on these results the American&#xD;
      Academy of Pediatrics recommends considering polysomnography after surgery in those patients&#xD;
      with high risk of persistence, such as obese children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device provides a continuous pressure through&#xD;
      a mask, acting as a pneumatic ferule which keeps the upper airway permeable; with a lower&#xD;
      possibility of obstruction. The adherence of pediatric patients to CPAP has been reported&#xD;
      between 6 and 65% (which is one of the reasons it's not considered the first line treatment),&#xD;
      with an use of 2.1 to 8.2 hours per night, and an AIH (apnea-hypopnea index) between 2 and 6&#xD;
      per hour. In adult patients, a reduction in trans and post-surgical risk has been found, and&#xD;
      therefore its pre-surgical use is recommended. In children it is one of the strategies used&#xD;
      to reduce surgical risk in OSAS, even though its use is not recommended in any of the main&#xD;
      clinical guides of management of children with OSAS. Its use has been described in children&#xD;
      with severe illness, and in other studies it was used in 18% of patients, but its real effect&#xD;
      in the probable complications has not been prospectively studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adult subjects, inflammation of upper airway has been reported, and it could play a role&#xD;
      in the physiopathology of OSAS, with changes in the minimal sectional area and pharyngeal&#xD;
      volume measured by MRI after use for 4 to 6 weeks of CPAP use. Albeit the physiopathology is&#xD;
      not completely understood, it could be a consequence of the mechanical stress associated to&#xD;
      obstruction of airflow, with the repeated trauma related with snore, jointly with the upper&#xD;
      airway vibration and the suction from the collapse during the apneas the causes. CPAP&#xD;
      eliminates respiratory events, which could cause a reduction in edema and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acoustic pharyngometry is a non-invasive method which uses sound reflection to quickly&#xD;
      measure the sectional area of the upper airway in function of the distance from the oral&#xD;
      aperture. It can be adapted to its use in children, obtaining highly reproducible results,&#xD;
      even though it is limited to those who can follow instructions. In adults a difference was&#xD;
      found between the minimum oropharyngeal area and the mean area after 1 week of CPAP use, but&#xD;
      not between 1 week and 6 months of use, with a return to basal after a 1 week of nonuse. In&#xD;
      our center change in volume and transversal oropharyngeal area have been found with acoustic&#xD;
      pharyngometry since the second week of use of CPAP, of 5% at 2 weeks and 6% at 4 weeks. In&#xD;
      children changes after surgery have been found, with increase in the minimal sectional area&#xD;
      and oropharyngeal volume, even though its correlation with persistent OSAS has not been&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study the changes in the upper airway after CPAP, acoustic pharyngometry will be&#xD;
      performed before and after CPAP use, and 3 months after adenotonsillectomy to determinate the&#xD;
      relation to persistent OSAS. The presurgical CPAP will be randomized in those children with&#xD;
      diagnosis of mild to moderate OSAS.&#xD;
