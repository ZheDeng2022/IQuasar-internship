      Overview- In this study, overweight or obese, sedentary participants (age=35-55 years, n=20)&#xD;
      will be randomized to a 12-week control period or an aerobic exercise intervention. Those&#xD;
      randomized into the control group will then complete the exercise intervention subsequently.&#xD;
      The planned energy expenditure per week of exercise will be 10-12 kilocalories per kilogram&#xD;
      of body weight per week. Participants will complete three non-consecutive exercise sessions&#xD;
      per week. Body weight, resting metabolic rate via indirect calorimetry, peak oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (VO2peak) through graded exercise testing, fasting blood samples, CGM, sleep and&#xD;
      dietary habits via self-report, and physical activity monitoring will be completed at prior&#xD;
      to and following the aerobic exercise intervention.&#xD;

      Pre-screening- potential participants interested in participating in the proposed research&#xD;
      study will be required to perform a pre-screening to assess eligibility. Interested&#xD;
      participants will e-mail the research team at TheATEAMstudy@gmail.com and will be contacted&#xD;
      by one of the research team members via telephone to discuss the basics of the study and, if&#xD;
      the participant is interested, schedule them for an orientation session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orientation- following signature of the informed consent by both the participant and the&#xD;
      person who obtained the informed consent, a demographics questionnaire and medical history&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered to assess overall health. Following acquisition of the&#xD;
      participant's medical history questionnaire, height and weight, will be measured, and from&#xD;
      this BMI will be calculated. If the participant is eligible following testing and&#xD;
      measurements at orientation, they will be scheduled for a series of baseline visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visits- baseline visit testing will consist of three visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline visit 1, participants will come in and have the CGM device placed. For the CGM, a&#xD;
      Dexcom G4 Platinum Professional monitor (Dexcom Company, San Diego, CA) will be used. This&#xD;
      particular monitor has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use up to 7&#xD;
      consecutive days. This device has a small implantable catheter that will be placed ~2cm to&#xD;
      participant preferred side of the umbilicus, a transmitter, and a receiver. This device&#xD;
      collects interstitial fluid glucose concentrations every 5 minutes, 24-hours a day, for 7&#xD;
      days. Alongside the CGM for monitoring of blood glucose, each participant will be required to&#xD;
      handle a standard glucometer that employs lancets for finger sticks to gain a quick and&#xD;
      simple measurement 2 times/day to ensure that there is no drift in the CGM readings. During&#xD;
      this visit an actigraph monitor (wGT3X+, Actigraph, LLC, Pensacola, FL) will be placed on the&#xD;
      participant's non-dominant or preferred wrist. This Actigraph wGT3X+ monitor is a device that&#xD;
      measures activity patterns in an XYZ-directional pathway. It will be worn for 7 consecutive&#xD;
      days concurrently with the CGM to aid in the establishment of wake time. A sleep diary will&#xD;
      be utilized to aid in the determination of self-report sleep duration, which will include&#xD;
      time in bed, sleep time, wake time, and time out of bed. By utilizing a sleep diary in&#xD;
      combination with the actigraph monitor, it will allow for ease of interpretation when&#xD;
      analyzing the actigraph monitor raw data by providing an estimate as to what sleep/wake time&#xD;
      may be. Self-report food intake will be completed via MyFitnessPal (Under Armour™ Connected&#xD;
      Fitness, Baltimore, MD), or a standard food diary if necessary, for not only types of food&#xD;
      consumed to assess for the effects of meal content, but also time of consumption to assess&#xD;
      postprandial blood glucose concentrations for 7 consecutive days. Following this,&#xD;
      participants will be scheduled for baseline visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline visit 2, ~12-24-hours post-baseline visit 1, following a 12-hour fast a 30-minute&#xD;
      resting metabolic rate (RMR) test followed by a fasting blood draw and subsequent 120-minute&#xD;
      OGTT will be completed. A 30-minute RMR test will be performed to measure oxygen consumption&#xD;
      and energy expenditure at rest. For the RMR testing, a Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400 unit (Parvo&#xD;
      Medics TrueOne 2400, Salt Lake City, UT), which will be calibrated each time being used, will&#xD;
      be utilized. Each participant will have a clear, plastic hood placed over their head while&#xD;
      they lay flat on their back resting, without falling asleep for ~30 minutes in a quiet, dimly&#xD;
      lit room. After the 30-minute RMR, a fasting blood draw will take place and blood samples&#xD;
      will be aliquoted and frozen in a standard VWR -80oC freezer until all blood samples are&#xD;
      collected. Participants will then consume a standard 75 gram glucose drink and perform a&#xD;
      2-hour OGTT. Glucose concentration during OGTT will be collected by the CGM device and time&#xD;
      points pre-, and 30-,60-,90-, and 120-minutes post-consumption will be used for analysis.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to be as sedentary as possible during this time period as to not&#xD;
      disturb the natural uptake and/or clearance of blood glucose that occurs at rest. Upon&#xD;
      completion of these tests participants will be scheduled for their baseline visit day 3, ~5-6&#xD;
      days post-baseline visit day 2. During this time period participants will be informed to&#xD;
      maintain their normal daily life patterns and to continue to monitor their diet and sleep up&#xD;
      until baseline visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On baseline visit 3, a graded maximal exercise test will be completed. A ramped treadmill&#xD;
      test will be performed to assess peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) through breath-by-breath&#xD;
      analysis. The ramped treadmill test protocol will increase speed and incline every 30-seconds&#xD;
      until each participant has reached volitional fatigue while simultaneously achieving VO2peak.&#xD;
      The same Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400 unit that was utilized for RMR testing will be used for&#xD;
      maximal graded exercise testing; however, instead of a hood over the participant's head, a&#xD;
      fitted mouth piece will be employed. During the maximal graded exercise test, participants&#xD;
      will also be monitored by 12-lead ECG which will be recorded by a Quinton Q-Stress System&#xD;
      (Mortara Instrument, Milwaukee, WI) and analyzed primarily by the PI (Joshua R. Sparks) who&#xD;
      has been trained and worked in medical situations where this was his primary responsibility.&#xD;
      Graded maximal exercise tests will be performed on the Quinton Q-Stress TM65 treadmill. Other&#xD;
      trained personnel will be on-site to aid in monitoring each participants exercise blood&#xD;
      pressure and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and will be recorded every two minutes into&#xD;
      each stage to make sure no adverse events may be occurring. VO2peak was established through&#xD;
      observation of at least two of the following criteria: highest oxygen consumption achieved&#xD;
      prior to plateau in oxygen uptake and heart rate with increased work rate, a respiratory&#xD;
      exchange ratio ≥ 1.15, a rating of perceived exertion ≥ 17, or achievement of age predicted&#xD;
      maximal heart rate using the equation: 220-age. Upon completion of the graded maximal&#xD;
      exercise tests, participants will be instructed as to the next stage of the study. Half of&#xD;
      the 20 participants (n=10) will be randomized into a 12-week observational control period&#xD;
      which precedes the aerobic exercise intervention, while the remainder will immediately begin&#xD;
      their aerobic exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants that are randomized into the control period will be asked to maintain normal&#xD;
      daily activities and will be requested to attend a session once a week for weekly weigh-ins&#xD;
      as to observe any fluctuations in weight that may occur over the 12-week control period. Upon&#xD;
      completion of the 12-week control period, participants randomized into the control group will&#xD;
      undergo pre-intervention testing, which will be designed in the same fashion as baseline&#xD;
      testing. Upon completion of the pre-intervention testing, participants will begin their&#xD;
      12-week aerobic exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 12-week aerobic exercise intervention is designed to elicit physiological changes that&#xD;
      occur when currently sedentary, overweight or obese adult begins to become more physically&#xD;
      active. Participants will be scheduled to come to the CERC on 3 non-consecutive days per week&#xD;
      and exercise to elicit a 10-12 kcal per kilogram of body weight per week energy expenditure&#xD;
      while walking at 50-55% Heart Rate Reserve (HRR). Participants will be offered either a&#xD;
      morning or an afternoon training session. Which training sessions they choose&#xD;
      (morning/afternoon) will be recorded. At each exercise session, prior to beginning their&#xD;
      session, body weight, as well as resting heart rate and blood pressure will be recorded. Each&#xD;
      session will be supervised by trained personnel. During the exercise session, heart rate will&#xD;
      be recorded every five minutes and blood pressure at the mid-way point of the session.&#xD;
      Immediately post-exercise heart rate and blood pressure, as well as following a 2-minute rest&#xD;
      period will be recorded to verify each participant is recovering without any complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the 12-week aerobic exercise intervention, post-intervention testing will&#xD;
      take place in the same design as baseline and pre-intervention testing.&#xD;
