  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study evaluating the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of Atezolizumab when combined with immunogenic chemotherapy in subjects with&#xD;
      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Atezolizumab, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide are the Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is rarely curable after metastasis, and the therapeutic options for metastatic&#xD;
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are limited. The host immune response is strongly&#xD;
      predictive for the effect of chemotherapy in patients with TNBC. In the present trial, we&#xD;
      combine Atezolizumab, an inhibitory antibody against Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1), with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Thereby, we aim to release the brake on the chemo-induced immune response. The&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic regime is a combination of anthracycline and cyclophosphamide, applied in a&#xD;
      semi-metronomic fashion (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin every 2nd week and daily&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide for 2/4 weeks). The investigators hypothesize that the semi-metronomic&#xD;
      regime will induce immunological cell death and counter T regulatory cells, while maintaining&#xD;
      the leukocyte counts and the ability of the effector immune cells to respond. The use of&#xD;
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx) minimizes the adverse effects of anthracyclines on&#xD;
      the heart and allows for continued treatment beyond the otherwise mandatory anthracycline&#xD;
      limits.&#xD;

    <description>Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to target and bind to a protein called PD-L1 (programmed death ligand-1), which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 interacts with PD-1 and B7.1, both found on the surface of T cells, causing inhibition of T cells. By blocking this interaction, Atezolizumab may enable the activation of T cells, restoring their ability to effectively detect and attack tumour cells.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Metastatic or incurable locally advanced, histologically documented TNBC (negative for&#xD;
             HER2, ER and PR ). HER2 negativity is defined as either of the following by local&#xD;
             laboratory assessment: In situ hybridization (ISH) non-amplified (ratio of HER2 to&#xD;
             CEP17 &lt; 2.0 or single probe average HER2 gene copy number &lt; 4 signals/cell), or IHC 0&#xD;
             or IHC 1+ (if more than one test result is available and not all results meet the&#xD;
             inclusion criterion definition, all results should be discussed with the PI to&#xD;
             establish eligibility of the patient). ER and PR negativity are defined as &lt; 1% and&#xD;
             &lt;10%, respectively, of cells expressing hormonal receptors via IHC analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Adequate newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously&#xD;
             irradiated. No anti-tumor treatment is allowed between the time point for biopsy and&#xD;
             study entry. If a patient has undergone chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, a new&#xD;
             biopsy must be obtained after this therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Measurable disease according to iRECIST&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Signed Informed Consent Form&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women or men aged ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. In patients that have received (neo)adjuvant treatment with anthracyclines or&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide, a minimum of 12 months from treatment with anthracyclines or&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide until relapse of disease is required&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A maximum of one previous line with chemotherapy in the metastatic setting&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If&#xD;
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             will be required&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential should agree to remain abstinent (refrain&#xD;
             from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure&#xD;
             rate of &lt; 1% per year, during the treatment period and for at least 5 months after the&#xD;
             last dose of study therapy. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if&#xD;
             she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months&#xD;
             of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone&#xD;
             surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive&#xD;
             methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male&#xD;
             sterilization, proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation and&#xD;
             hormone-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,&#xD;
             ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
             methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with&#xD;
             the first dose of study therapy through 3 months after the last dose of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Able to swallow orally administrated medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Adequate organ function as defined in Table 1 in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Malignancies other than breast cancer within 5 years prior to randomization, with the&#xD;
             exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death and treated with&#xD;
             expected curative outcome (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;
             or basal or squamous cell skin cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with known PD-L1 positive TNBC, as assessed by the Ventana SP142 assay (IC&#xD;
             ≥1%), and no previous chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, should be offered&#xD;
             standard therapy with nab-paclitaxel/atezolizumab outside of the trial, if they had a&#xD;
             disease free interval of &gt;12 months after previous (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, unless&#xD;
             the patient for other reasons should not receive nab-paclitaxel, according to own&#xD;
             preferences, drug availability or recommendations by the treating physician. A history&#xD;
             of progression on taxanes in the neoadjuvant setting, or severe side effects from&#xD;
             taxane therapy, may represent sufficient reason to offer the patient inclusion into&#xD;
             the the ALICE-trial, if the physician considers that the patient should receive&#xD;
             antracyclines rather than taxanes as 1st line therapy for metastatic disease. If more&#xD;
             than one TNBC biopsy has been evaluated for PD-L1 by the SP142 assay, and the results&#xD;
             differ, the patient's PD-L1 status determination will be based on best clinical&#xD;
             judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation, or&#xD;
             previously diagnosed and treated spinal cord compression without evidence that disease&#xD;
             has been clinically stable for &gt; 2 weeks prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known CNS disease, except for asymptomatic CNS metastases, provided all of the&#xD;
             following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Measurable disease outside the CNS&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. No metastases to mesencephalon, pons, medulla oblongata, or spinal cord&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone as therapy for CNS disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. No radiation of brain lesions within 7 days prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. No leptomeningeal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases must receive radiation therapy and/or&#xD;
                  surgery for CNS metastases. Following treatment, these patients may be eligible,&#xD;
                  if all other criteria are met&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites. Patients with&#xD;
             indwelling catheters (e.g., PleurX®) are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled tumor-related pain. Patients requiring narcotic pain medication must be&#xD;
             on a stable regimen at study entry. Symptomatic lesions (e.g., bone metastases or&#xD;
             metastases causing nerve impingement) amenable to palliative radiotherapy should be&#xD;
             treated prior to randomization. Asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth&#xD;
             would likely cause functional deficits or intractable pain (e.g., epidural metastasis&#xD;
             that is not presently associated with spinal cord compression) should be considered&#xD;
             for loco-regional therapy if appropriate prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ionized calcium &gt; 1.2 x UNL. The use of bisphosphonates is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant disease that could affect compliance&#xD;
             with the protocol or interpretation of results, including significant liver disease&#xD;
             (such as cirrhosis, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, or superior vena cava&#xD;
             syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Significant cardiovascular disease, such as New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac&#xD;
             disease (Class II or greater), myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to&#xD;
             randomization, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina. Patients with a known left&#xD;
             ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% will be excluded. Patients with known&#xD;
             coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure not meeting the above criteria, or&#xD;
             LVEF &lt; 50% must be on a stable medical regimen that is optimized in the opinion of the&#xD;
             treating physician, in consultation with a cardiologist if appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Severe infection within 14 days prior to randomization, requiring hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Received oral or IV antibiotics within 1 week prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. Patients&#xD;
             receiving routine antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., to prevent chronic obstructive&#xD;
             pulmonary disease exacerbation or for dental extraction) are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Major surgical procedure within 14 days prior to randomization or anticipation of the&#xD;
             need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study other than for&#xD;
             diagnosis. Placement of central venous access catheter(s) is not considered a major&#xD;
             surgical procedure and is therefore permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. A history of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to&#xD;
             chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to biopharmaceuticals produced in Chinese hamster&#xD;
             ovary cells or any component of the atezolizumab formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Known hypersensitivity to doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide or any of their excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. A history of autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2&#xD;
             years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxin, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment. Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus&#xD;
             or vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., no psoriatic arthritis) are&#xD;
             permitted provided that they meet all of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Rash must cover less than 10% of body surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requiring low potency topical&#xD;
                  steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No acute exacerbations of underlying condition within the last 12 months (not&#xD;
                  requiring PUVA [psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation], methotrexate, retinoids,&#xD;
                  biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, high potency or oral steroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Undergone allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. A history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (including pneumonitis) drug-induced&#xD;
             pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic&#xD;
             organizing pneumonia), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan.&#xD;
             History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. A positive test for HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Active hepatitis B (defined as having a positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]&#xD;
             test at screening) or hepatitis C. Patients with past hepatitis B virus (HBV)&#xD;
             infection or resolved HBV infection (defined as having a negative HBsAg test and a&#xD;
             positive antibody to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] antibody test) are eligible.&#xD;

             the first dose of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Received treatment with immune checkpoint modulators, including anti-CTLA-4,&#xD;

&#xD;
         25. Received treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including but not limited&#xD;
             to interferons or IL-2) within 4 weeks or five half-lives of the drug (whichever is&#xD;
             shorter) prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Received treatment with systemic corticosteroids or other systemic immunosuppressive&#xD;
             medications (including but not limited to prednisone, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
             azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents)&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to randomization, or anticipated requirement for systemic&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients who have received acute, low-dose, systemic immunosuppressant&#xD;
                  medications (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled&#xD;
                  in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients with a history of allergic reaction to IV contrast requiring steroid&#xD;
                  pre-treatment should have baseline and subsequent tumor assessments performed&#xD;
                  using MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The use of inhaled corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
                  mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic&#xD;
                  hypotension, and low-dose supplemental corticosteroids for adrenocortical&#xD;
                  insufficiency are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Received anti-cancer therapy (medical agents or radiation) within 1 week prior to&#xD;
             study Cycle 1, Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. A history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation&#xD;
