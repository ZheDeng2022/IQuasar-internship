      Patients eligible for the study will receive 6 courses (q 28 days) of the DEVEC combination,&#xD;
      according to the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DE: Prednisone (Deltacortene) 25 mg /day will be orally administered from day 1 to day&#xD;
           28 only in cycle 1 From cycle 2 to 6 it is reduced to three times a week (after&#xD;
           breakfast, MON, WED, FRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V: Vinorelbine 30 mg/day will be orally administered three times a week, 3 week on and 1&#xD;
           week off (after breakfast, MON, WED, FRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  E: Etoposide 50 mg/day will be orally administered from day 1 to day 14 (before lunch).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C: Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day will be orally administered from day 1 to day 21 (after&#xD;
           dinner).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab: 375 mg/m2 will be administered by IV infusion up to four infusions on days 8,&#xD;
           15, 22, 29, only in patients suitable for infusion treatment and relapsed after &gt;6&#xD;
           months from last R-chemotherapy. Refractory patients who had received at least 5 doses&#xD;
           of Rituximab will not repeat it during the metronomic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Super-frail patients will not receive etoposide during cycles 1 and 2; etoposide will be&#xD;
      included in the treatment schedule starting from cycle 3 at reduced dose (50 mg/day, from day&#xD;
      1 to day 7) only in patients who in cycles 1 and 2 didn't experience hematological toxicity&#xD;
      &gt;G2 and/or non-hematological toxicity &gt;G1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Unfit and Frail patients with hemoglobin level at study entry &lt;11 gr/dL, will start&#xD;
      etoposide will be orally administered at reduced dose (50 mg/day from day 1 to day 7). If&#xD;
      hemoglobin will raise to ≥11 gr/dL, at subsequent induction cycles etoposide will be&#xD;
      administered at full dose (50 mg/day, from day 1 to day 14), As a preventive measure, to&#xD;
      avoid perforation, patients with gastrointestinal visceral involvement will receive a&#xD;
      pre-phase therapy with steroids (prednisolone 40mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      ) for 6-7 days before starting protocol treatment. Moreover, in these patients the four&#xD;
      Rituximab doses will be administered in cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in CR, CRu, PR and SD after 2 cycles will continue with additional 4 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the induction phase patients in CR, CRu and PR (and also in SD at discretion of&#xD;
      local investigator) will continue treatment with maintenance therapy including Vinorelbine,&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide, and Prednisone oral combination to be repeated every 28 days for up to 6&#xD;
      cycles, according to the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day will be orally administered from day 1 to day 14 (after&#xD;
           dinner).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vinorelbine 30 mg/day will be orally administered three times a week, 3 week on and 1&#xD;
           week off (after breakfast, MON, WED, FRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prednisone 25 mg/day will be orally administered twice a week (after breakfast, MON,&#xD;
           FRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in CR/CRu at the EOT can continue with a post-maintenance phase at discretion of the&#xD;
      local investigator up to 12 months, progression or inacceptable toxicity, according to&#xD;
      following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vinorelbine 30 mg/day will be orally administered three times a week, 3 week on and 1&#xD;
           week off (after breakfast, MON, WED, FRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prednisone 25 mg/day will be orally administered twice a week (after breakfast, MON,&#xD;
           FRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with evidence of Progressive Disease (PD) at any point will stop treatment.&#xD;
