  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of neurorobotic devices into gait rehabilitative programs, including Ekso, is&#xD;
      reported to increase the engagement and motivation of the patients while actively performing&#xD;
      a task, and to shape the sensory-motor plasticity (SMP) and its balance between the primary&#xD;
      motor areas (M1), and the fronto-parietal network (FPN) connectivity, thus contributing to&#xD;
      successful gait rehabilitation. Aim of our study was to assess whether Ekso would foster the&#xD;
      recovery of deteriorated FPN connectivity and SMP patterns involved in limb coordination&#xD;
      during walking in a sample of patients with hemiparesis due to stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty outpatients were consecutively included in this study according to the following&#xD;
      inclusion criteria: (i) age ≥55 years; (ii) a first-ever ischemic supra-tentorial stroke&#xD;
      (confirmed by MRI scan) at least 6 months before their enrollment; (iii) an unilateral&#xD;
      hemiparesis, with a Muscle Research Council -MCR- score ≤3; (iv) ability to follow verbal&#xD;
      instructions, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) &gt;24; (v) a Modified Ashworth Scale&#xD;
      (MAS) score ≤2; (vi) no severe bone or joint disease; and (vii) no history of concomitant&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases or brain surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to the experimental (Ekso gait training -EGT) of control&#xD;
      group (conventional overground gait training -OGT- at a velocity matched to the Ekso gait&#xD;
      training).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ekso (Ekso Bionics; Richmond -CA- USA) is a wearable robot consisting of an exoskeleton&#xD;
      framework for the lower limbs with (1) electric motors to power movement for the hip and knee&#xD;
      joints, (2) passive spring-loaded ankle joints, (3) foot plates on which the user stands, and&#xD;
      (4) a backpack that houses a computer, battery supply, and wired controller. A rigid backpack&#xD;
      is an integral structural component of the exoskeleton, which provides support from the&#xD;
      posterior pelvis to the upper back, besides carrying the computer and batteries. The&#xD;
      exoskeleton attaches to the user's body with straps over the dorsum of the foot, anterior&#xD;
      shin and thigh, abdomen, and anterior shoulders. The limb and pelvic segments are adjustable&#xD;
      to the user's leg and thigh length, and the segment across the pelvis is adjustable for hip&#xD;
      width and hip abduction angle. We preliminarily measured M1-leg excitability and SMI, which&#xD;
      were probed using TMS pulses with a monophasic pulse configuration and peripheral nerve&#xD;
      electric stimuli. Single magnetic pulses were given to the affected and unaffected leg-M1&#xD;
      using a standard figure-of-eight coil (diameter of each wing, 90 mm) connected with a&#xD;
      high-power Magstim200 stimulator (Magstim Co, Ltd; UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective connectivity (that measures the causal influence that one brain area exerts over&#xD;
      another under the assumption of a given mechanistic model) was assessed using a structural&#xD;
      equation modelling (SEM). An 8-channel wireless surface EMG (sEMG) device (BTS; Milan, Italy)&#xD;
      was used to record EMG activity from eight muscles (both tibialis anterior -TA-, soleus -S-,&#xD;
      rectus femoris -RF-, and biceps femoris -BF). The device was also equipped with an&#xD;
      accelerometer, put at lumbar level, to establish gait phases. Gait analysis was conducted on&#xD;
      a 10-meter walkway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We measured the following gait measures for both the affected and unaffected lower limb [20]:&#xD;
      (i) step cadence (number of steps per minute; normal values 1.9±0.1 Hz);. (ii) gait cycle&#xD;
      duration (time from one right heel strike -initial contact- to the next one -end of terminal&#xD;
      swing; normal values 1.1±0.1 sec); (iii) stance/swing ratio (ratio between stance from heel&#xD;
      strike to toe-off, and swing phase duration from toe-off to heel strike; normal values&#xD;
      1.5±0.1); .and (iv) an overall gait performance score (gait index, reflecting an approximate&#xD;
      60:40% distribution of stance:swing phases; normal values &gt;90).&#xD;

    <description>All patients underwent twenty-four Ekso sessions, scheduled 3 times a week. Each session lasted about 1h, and included transferring into the device arranged on an office chair; donning, standing, walking, sitting, doffing; and transferring out of the exoskeleton.The user can stand up, sit down, and walk with help of a front-wheeled walker and with the exoskeleton attached to a ceiling rail tether. A physical therapist initially provides assistance to maintain the user's center of mass over the base of support to prevent falling.</description>
