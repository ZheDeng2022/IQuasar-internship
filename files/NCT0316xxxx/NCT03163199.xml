      Primary objective: To document change in translesional pressure gradients (TLPGs) and ratios&#xD;
      (fractional flow reserve) using the NAVVUS RXi catheter following endovascular treatment for&#xD;
      symptomatic lower extremity peripheral arterial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of correlation of the ABI and TBI and TLPGs at baseline and following&#xD;
           endovascular therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the correlation between the change in WIQ, TCOMs, wound size and change in&#xD;
           TLPGS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of correlation between lesion severity by QVA (MLD, % diameter stenosis) and&#xD;
           TLPGs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of baseline MLA, MLD, plaque burden by intravascular ultrasound (optional)&#xD;
           and TLPGs&#xD;

      There are a lack of tools available for the intraprocedural assessment of endovascular&#xD;
      procedures for lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. The present study will use the&#xD;
      NAVVUS RXi catheter to document changes in translesional hemodynamics obtained with and&#xD;
      without hyperemia in patients undergoing directional atherectomy, angioplasty, and/or&#xD;
      stenting of femoropopliteal and infrapoplieal lesions.&#xD;

    <description>Observational: â€¢ During treatment of Lesion a catheter is inserted into the diseased portion of the artery to remove the plaque and improve the blood flow through the artery. This measurement, which may be repeated 5 times during the treatment, to measure the blood flow at a point before and after the section of the artery with the blockage</description>
