  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 50% of older persons with osteoarthritis (OA) experience disrupted sleep and&#xD;
      insomnia symptoms of difficulty falling asleep, awakening during the night, and awakening too&#xD;
      early and being unable to fall back to sleep. Because OA pain has been implicated in sleep&#xD;
      problems and because physical exercise interventions have been found to improve pain and&#xD;
      sleep quality, staying physically active during the daytime is likely advantageous in terms&#xD;
      of improving sleep. Physical exercise interventions with a duration between 10 and 16 weeks&#xD;
      have been shown to improve quality of sleep in older adults with self-reported disrupted&#xD;
      sleep. Unfortunately, recent reports show that older adults with OA are mainly sedentary and&#xD;
      few meet national guidelines for recommended amounts of daily physical activity. A&#xD;
      self-management intervention that integrates use of mobile technology to prompt older adults&#xD;
      to be physically active, provides ongoing monitoring of the amount of their physical activity&#xD;
      and includes self-efficacy enhancements is a novel non-pharmacological intervention both for&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of sleep deficiency in persons with OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will involve delivery of automatic physical activity-focused text&#xD;
      messages, a novel sleep self-management diary (SleepTight) and motivational interviewing in&#xD;
      participants with OA of the hip or knee (most commonly affected joints). The purpose of this&#xD;
      Project is to pilot test a new self-management program: MobMPATI, a multidimensional,&#xD;
      tailored intervention for sleep deficiency in for older adults with OA. The specific aims are&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the acceptability of MobMPATI for older adults with OA and poor sleep quality as a&#xD;
           manifestation of sleep deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the feasibility of implementing MobMPATI for older adults with OA, as well as&#xD;
           collecting electronic data from the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore pre/posttest changes in self-efficacy, motivation and sleep deficiency measures&#xD;
           [total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE)] with the MobMPATI intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide feasibility/acceptability and preliminary data necessary for a larger&#xD;
      clinical trial of MobMPATI intervention to encourage physical activity and reduce sedentary&#xD;
      behavior in older adults with OA as a way of reducing sleep deficiency. Preliminary testing&#xD;
      of the intervention will indicate what measures are more sensitive in promoting self-efficacy&#xD;
      and motivation so that a smaller number of outcomes could be monitored to reduce participant&#xD;
      burden. This study is the first step in this innovative program of research. The knowledge&#xD;
      gained will provide data on the benefit of a potentially cost-effective intervention that&#xD;
      could be implemented on a large scale to improve health of older adults with OA.&#xD;

        <title>Mixed Effect Model Inferential Estimates of Longitudinal Changes Across Three Time Points (Baseline, Week 14, Week 19) in Actigraphy Total Sleep Time (TST)</title>
        <description>Actigraphy Total Sleep Time (TST) in minutes was calculated using baseline, week 14, and week 19 data from a wrist-worn actigraph&#xD;
A single value for change in TST across three-time points was calculated using linear mixed effect modeling&#xD;
A negative change score indicates lower TST ( in min) over time</description>

        <population>Mixed effect models were utilized because of the time repeated structure of the data. Data collection occasions were also entered in the models to account for change over time. The adjusted for age and gender main effects for time for the TST was tested for significance and reported as estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI)</population>
