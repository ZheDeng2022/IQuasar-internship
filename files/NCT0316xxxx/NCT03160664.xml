  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial attempts to evaluate the treatment efficacy of magnetic seizure therapy (MST) and&#xD;
      its safety for bipolar mania. Half of the participants will receive MST, while the other half&#xD;
      will receive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is likely to be an alternative options to electroconvulsive&#xD;
      therapy (ECT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Widespread stimulation of cortical and subcortical regions is inevitable for ECT since the&#xD;
      substantial impedance of the scalp and skull shuts most of the electrical stimulus away from&#xD;
      the brain. Nevertheless, magnetic pulses are capable to focus the stimulus to a specific area&#xD;
      of the brain because they can pass the scalp and skull without resistance. In Addition,&#xD;
      electric current will penetrate into deeper structures, while magnetic stimulus are only&#xD;
      capable to reach a depth of a few centimeters. As a consequence, MST are able to generate&#xD;
      focus stimuli on superficial regions of the cortex while ECT can't, which may give MST the&#xD;
      capability to produce comparable therapeutic benefits with the absence of apparent cognitive&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
