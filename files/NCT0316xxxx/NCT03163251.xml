  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of peer facilitated monthly small group topic-based small&#xD;
      group discussions on various themes common to physician training that pertain to aspects of&#xD;
      humanism on rates of burnout. Attendance to these sessions and completion of the surveys is&#xD;
      voluntary.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is widely known that physicians have rates of suicide that are far higher than in other&#xD;
      professions: 70% higher for men and 250-400% higher for women. While the reasoning behind why&#xD;
      this occurs has not been well elucidated, physicians do face some unique challenges including&#xD;
      the responsibilities of the lives of others, a duty to always uphold the highest level of a&#xD;
      moral and ethical standard, as well as being faced with both physical and emotional&#xD;
      exhaustion. Trainees in particular seem at risk due to the rigors of the job in addition to&#xD;
      the stress of the rapid expansion of the physical and emotional expectations put upon them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigator's knowledge, there has yet to be any study that has shown any beneficial&#xD;
      outcomes regarding burnout using a small group curriculum among physician trainees that also&#xD;
      encompasses analysis of the effect of an intervention on the emotional development of&#xD;
      trainees. However, there has been a randomized trial on the effect of small groups for junior&#xD;
      attendings that showed decreased rates of depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and&#xD;
      physician burnout in the intervention group. The implications of such programs on the trainee&#xD;
      population could result in decreased levels of physician/ trainee burnout, depression, and&#xD;
      potentially even suicide, aside from providing trainees with a sense of increased job&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many people in the scientific community judge the success of a physician by their&#xD;
      medical achievements and diagnostic acumen, many patients judge the successes of their&#xD;
      doctors based on empathy, communication, and bedside manner. While many resources exist to&#xD;
      teach residents about the science of medicine, there does not exist to my knowledge a&#xD;
      standardized curriculum to teach residents about the humanistic side of medicine and the&#xD;
      importance of emotional development. Implementing such a curriculum could provide exactly&#xD;
      what is missing from formal residency training as it stands now. Such a program that could be&#xD;
      easily adapted to a large number of trainees would seem to be beneficial and also be in line&#xD;
      with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)'s core competencies&#xD;
      intended for residents to improve on patient care, professionalism, and interpersonal&#xD;
      communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer support and teamwork seem like logical coping mechanisms for a vulnerable population&#xD;
      that can feel isolated, such as physician trainees. The study aims to elucidate whether the&#xD;
      peer-facilitated READ-SG method is effective at reducing burnout, as assessed by the Maslach&#xD;
      Burnout Inventory, the gold standard in the field of assessing burnout, as well as to gauge&#xD;
      the perceived effect of each session on participants' professional development and symptoms&#xD;
      of burnout.&#xD;

    <description>In the Internal Medicine residency program at Columbia University Medical Center, PGY-1 trainees receive an hour of protected time to attend a monthly peer-facilitated small group session, outlined above. PGY-2 and 3 trainees have a similar combined session separate from the PGY-1s. Facilitators are chosen by the READ-SG Committee, which is comprised of Mark P. Abrams (Director, Co-Investigator), Evelyn Granieri (Faculty Advisor, PI), a Chief Resident from the program (Program Liaison), and the facilitators.</description>
