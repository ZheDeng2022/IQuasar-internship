      Diarrhea is one of the most common reasons for people to seek medical advice - but it can&#xD;
      range from being a mild, temporary condition, to be life threading condition. It is estimated&#xD;
      that there are 2 billion cases of diarrheal disease every year globally, and that 1.9 million&#xD;
      children below the age of 5 years, mostly in developing countries, die annually.&#xD;

      Secretory diarrhea has many causes as infection with bacteria, viruses or protozoa. It&#xD;
      results from increased chloride secretion, decreased sodium absorption, or increased mucosal&#xD;
      permeability . Parasitic pathogens induce Secretory diarrhea as they infect and damage the&#xD;
      absorptive villus tips, leaving Secretory crypts unbalanced, to cause net secretion and&#xD;
      diarrhea. Parasitic causes include Cryptosporidium parvum or hominis ,Capillaria&#xD;
      philippinensis and Giardia lamblia. Cryptosporidiosis is also recognized as a cause of&#xD;
      prolonged and persistent diarrhea in children and persons with impaired immunity. The disease&#xD;
      is transmitted via the fecal-oral route from infected hosts. It can be also transmitted&#xD;
      following animal contact, ingestion of water (mainly during swimming), or through food.&#xD;
      Cryptosporidium has emerged as the most frequently recognized cause of water-associated&#xD;
      outbreaks of gastroenteritis. This is because of the oocyst stage in its life cycle;&#xD;
      Cryptosporidium can resist disinfection, including chlorination, and can survive for a&#xD;
      prolonged period in the environment.&#xD;
