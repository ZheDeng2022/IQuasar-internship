      Head and neck cancer (HNC) continues to be a significant health care problem in Taiwan and&#xD;
      oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the common subtype. With the concern of organ&#xD;
      preservation in recent years, concurrent chemoradiation is the major treatment modality for&#xD;
      oropharyngeal SCC. Endoscopy with biopsy serve as the main diagnostic tools in patients with&#xD;
      oropharyngeal SCC. While computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are&#xD;
      commonly used to evaluate the tumor extent of HNC, MRI is more preferred in the oropharyngeal&#xD;
      area by virtue of its high contrast resolution. With the advance of MRI technology, whole&#xD;
      body MRI is now possible, and functional techniques become more feasible in the head and neck&#xD;
      region, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) which comprises of monoexponential DWI,&#xD;
      IVIM (intravoxel incoherent motion) model and Kurtosis (biexponential or non-Gaussian&#xD;
      fitting), and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) become feasible. Therefore, MRI can evaluate&#xD;
      distant site status of HNC in the single examination session and provide biologic information&#xD;
      of tumors, such as cellularity, angiogenesis and permeability, and so forth. Positron&#xD;
      emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) is another common imaging modality to evaluate HNC, because&#xD;
      of its ability to provide whole-body anatomic and metabolic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrated PET/MRI is a novel imaging technology that combines PET and MRI in one single&#xD;
      scanner. It can acquire both PET and MRI information simultaneously. Initial data convey that&#xD;
      PET/MRI performed favorably in diagnostic evaluation of HNC. However, the predictive value of&#xD;
      PET/MRI in treatment outcome of HNC has not been reported. A prospective study of integrated&#xD;
      PET/MRI in a large cohort of patients with specific tumor origin and uniform treatment&#xD;
      protocol is needed to fully validate the clinical usefulness of this novel integrated system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this 3-year prospective study, the investigators will take the advantages of integrated&#xD;
      PET/MRI scanner with diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion&#xD;
      weighted MRI (DCE-PWI) to evaluate our 160 patients with oropharyngeal SCC subjected to&#xD;
      chemoradiation. Non-contrast chest CT will also be performed on the same day. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to (1) determine whole-body staging/restaging accurately, (2) predict&#xD;
      treatment response and prognosis, and (3) to determine necessity of noncontrast chest CT. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that this project will offer the validation of usefulness of integrated&#xD;
      PET/MRI in tumor staging/restaging of oropharyngeal SCC and resultant clinical impact. The&#xD;
      role of noncontrast chest in the workup with our PET/MRI protocol can be defined. It will&#xD;
      also provide evidence about how and to what extent the various simultaneously acquired MRI&#xD;
      and PET functional parameters can help prediction of treatment response and prognosis, which&#xD;
      are important in timely modification of treatment regimen.&#xD;

      Introduction and aim of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head and neck cancer (HNC) continues to be a significant health care problem in Taiwan and&#xD;
      oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the common subtype. With the concern of organ&#xD;
      preservation in recent years, concurrent chemoradiation is the major treatment modality for&#xD;
      oropharyngeal SCC. Hence, accurate tumor anatomic and biologic evaluations are warranted for&#xD;
      pretreatment planning, posttreatment monitoring and prognosis determination. Endoscopy with&#xD;
      biopsy serve as the main diagnostic tools in patients with oropharyngeal SCC. While computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are commonly used to evaluate the tumor&#xD;
      extent of HNC, MRI is more preferred in the oropharyngeal area by virtue of its high contrast&#xD;
      resolution, particularly in detecting perineural invasion. Whole body MRI is now feasible and&#xD;
      thus distant site status of HNC can be evaluated in the single examination session. FDG-&#xD;
      positron emission tomography/CT (PET /CT) is another common imaging modality to evaluate HNC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the investigators' experience in patients with head and neck cancer, MRI and&#xD;
      PET/CT have different advantages over each other and may complement to each other. In&#xD;
      evaluating primary tumor status, the high spatial and contrast resolution of MRI can&#xD;
      delineate the tumor extent from surrounding normal tissue in the complex head and neck&#xD;
      anatomical region, while delineation of FDG-positive tissue by PET may help differentiation&#xD;
      tumor growth from surrounding noncancerous tissue, particularly in irradiated bed. In&#xD;
      evaluating regional nodal status, MRI is superior to PET/CT in detecting retropharyngeal or&#xD;
      cystic necrotic metastatic adenopathy, whereas PET/CT excels MRI in detecting metastasis in&#xD;
      sub-centimeter nodes. The combined use of MRI and PET can clearly demonstrate the patterns of&#xD;
      nodal spread.[7]. Regards to the evaluation of the distant sites, whole body MRI is better in&#xD;
      detecting metastatic lesion in high metabolic organs such as brain, liver or spleen, while&#xD;
      PET/CT is superior in detecting those metastatic lesions in the curved, flat bones, and&#xD;
      second primary bowel tumor such as esophagus cancer or colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion&#xD;
      weighted imaging (DCE-PWI) become clinically feasible to assess the functional aspects of&#xD;
      HNC. The quantified parameter of DWI sequence is apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) that&#xD;
      relates to cellularity. DCE-PWI provides the volume transfer rate constant (Ktrans), relative&#xD;
      extravascular extracellular space (Ve) and relative vascular plasma volume (Vp) as well as&#xD;
      the efflux rate constant (Kep). These functional MRI techniques may provide biologic&#xD;
      information, such as cellularity, angiogenesis and permeability. On the other hand, PET can&#xD;
      provide its metabolic quantified parameters: standardized uptake value (SUV) that reflects&#xD;
      glucose metabolism, metabolic tumor volume (MTV) that reflects tumor burden, and total lesion&#xD;
      glycolysis (TLG) that integrates both glucose metabolism and tumor burden. These MRI and PET&#xD;
      functional parameters appear promising for predicting chemoradiation response and prognosis&#xD;
      of HNC. In our previous studies of oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal SCC patients, Ktrans of&#xD;
      the primary tumor was the only imaging parameter associated with local control, while ADC and&#xD;
      Ve values of the neck metastatic nodes were independent prognostic factors for neck control.&#xD;
      The maximal SUV of the regional lymph nodes was significantly associated with the occurrence&#xD;
      of distant metastasis. TLG were significantly associated with overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrated PET/MRI is a novel imaging technology introduced into the clinical practice. The&#xD;
      combination of PET and MRI in one single, hybrid scanner is promising. Initial data convey&#xD;
      that PET/MRI performed favorably for HNC. It showed good diagnostic capability similar to&#xD;
      PET/CT and can serve as a legitimate alternative to PET/CT in the clinical workup of patients&#xD;
      with HNC. The metabolic ratios measured PET/MRI showed excellent agreement with those on&#xD;
      standard PET/CT. PET/MRI incorporating the Dixon sequence for attenuation correction purposes&#xD;
      yielded similar SUV values when compared to PET/CT.Nevertheless, most studies were limited in&#xD;
      number of cases or no particular tumor entity was specifically analyzed, which somewhat&#xD;
      weakened their power in terms of evidence-based medicine. In addition, the predictive value&#xD;
      of PET/MRI in treatment outcome of HNC has not been reported. A prospective study of PET/MRI&#xD;
      in a large cohort of patients with specific tumor origin and uniform treatment protocol would&#xD;
      complement these pioneering efforts to fully validate the clinical usefulness of the novel&#xD;
      integrated system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, integrated PET/MRI scanner (Biograph mMR, Siemens) has been installed in our&#xD;
      hospital. In this scanner, the PET detectors are fully integrated into the 3 Tesla MR system&#xD;
      with one single gantry, enabling simultaneous acquisition of both PET and MR data. Before its&#xD;
      wide practical use, its clinical usefulness should be explicitly defined. In this research&#xD;
      project, the investigators will investigate our 150 patients with oropharyngeal SCC subjected&#xD;
      to chemoradiation with FDG-PET/MRI. Non-contrast chest CT will also be performed on the same&#xD;
      day. The investigators have the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: to determine whole-body staging/restaging MRI and PET/CT have different advantages&#xD;
      over each other, and visual correlation of these separate imaging modalities can yield a&#xD;
      slightly higher diagnostic capability. However, some lesions may not be matched well for each&#xD;
      other because of different examination date and positioning. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      believe that tumor involvement should be made more accurately with simultaneously acquired&#xD;
      PET/MRI imaging, leading to more accurate tumor staging/restaging, and in turn, to more&#xD;
      precise treatment planning and better treatment outcome. However, the data of integrated&#xD;
      PET/MRI for whole whole-body staging/restaging on oropharyngeal SCC are still unavailable&#xD;
      currently. In this prospective project, the investigators aim to determine the feasibility&#xD;
      and clinical impact of integrated PET/MRI in tumor staging and restaging of oropharyngeal SCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. to predict treatment response and prognosis Functional MRI parameters and FDG-PET/CT&#xD;
      parameters can be quantified and have been used for predicting response to chemoradiation in&#xD;
      HNC. However, variable results had been obtained, mainly due to different tumor origins,&#xD;
      sample sizes, methodologies, and treatment protocols. Another important confounding factor is&#xD;
      that MRI and PET/CT were done at different time intervals. Because integrated PET/MRI can&#xD;
      provide simultaneous PET and MR functional data that allow for direct comparison in the&#xD;
      selected regions of interest, and thus should be more accurate and more reproducible.&#xD;
      However, the predictive values of simultaneous functional PET/MRI techniques in oropharyngeal&#xD;
      SCC have not been reported till now. On the other hand, DWI with intravoxel incoherent motion&#xD;
      (IVIM ) technique can quantify both molecular diffusion and microcirculation in the capillary&#xD;
      network that may be useful for predicting tumor chemoradiosensitivity, while DWI with&#xD;
      kurtosis (biexponential or non-Gaussian fitting) modeling has been documented to yield a&#xD;
      better fit of the in vivo water molecule diffusion than does that with monoexponential&#xD;
      modeling[32]. In this research project, the investigators added functional MRI sequences as&#xD;
      parts of PET/MRI procedures, including DCE-PWI as well as dedicated DWI that can yield&#xD;
      monoexponential DWI, IVIM and Kurtosis data. We aim to obtain MRI and PET functional results&#xD;
      on integrated PET/MRI system in the single imaging session in the patient cohort of&#xD;
      oropharyngeal SCC uniformly treated with chemoradiation. The investigators expected that the&#xD;
      predictive values of the various functional parameters of integrated PET/ MRI can be more&#xD;
      clearly elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. to determine necessity of noncontrast chest CT. One of the concerns of replacing the&#xD;
      CT portion of PET/CT with MRI is the ability of MRI to depict and differentiate lung nodules,&#xD;
      while the most common location for distant metastases of HNC is lung. According to the&#xD;
      investigators' previous study, the CT component of integrated PET/CT can improve not only the&#xD;
      specificity but also the sensitivity of FDG-PET data. In addition, CT also help to lessen PET&#xD;
      false-positive findings in calcified mediastinal nodal disease, such as anthracosis. However,&#xD;
      on the other hand, the investigators' previous studies showed the detection rates of&#xD;
      pulmonary metastases with 3.0-T MRI using half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo&#xD;
      spin-echo (HASTE), volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) and short τ&#xD;
      inversion recovery (STIR) sequences were similar to those of PET/CT. One recent study has&#xD;
      shown that radial VIBE free-breathing MRI with simultaneously acquired PET data has high&#xD;
      sensitivity in the detection of nodules with a diameter of at least 0.5 cm, but has limited&#xD;
      sensitivity in the detection of small or non-FDG-avid nodules. Considering the limited data&#xD;
      on PET/MR in detecting lung malignant lesion, the investigators aim to prospectively validate&#xD;
      the performance of our integrated PET/MRI protocol sequences for lung lesions by adding&#xD;
      noncontrast enhanced CT for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this three-year prospective project, a total of 160 patients with histologically proven&#xD;
      oropharyngeal SCC subjected to chemoradiation will be enrolled. Exclusion criteria include&#xD;
      previous head or neck malignant tumor, a second malignant tumor, distant metastasis,&#xD;
      contraindications to MRI (renal insufficiency, cochlear implant, cardiac pacemaker placement&#xD;
      or intracranial aneurysmal ferromagnetic clips), and serum glucose level &gt;200 mg/dl. Before&#xD;
      pretreatment, each enrolled patients will undergo PET/MRI and detail clinical examination,&#xD;
      including human papillomavirus test. The participants will also undergo low dose chest CT on&#xD;
      the same day before PET/MRI. In the posttreatment period, baseline whole body MRI will be&#xD;
      obtained 3 months after chemoradiation. Thereafter, the patients will then be followed up&#xD;
      also with alternative extend-field CT and whole body MRI by every 6 months. If tumor&#xD;
      recurrence is confirmed or highly suspected, PET/MRI will also be performed for tumor&#xD;
      re-staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three-years planning Adequate cases number and follow-up duration are essential for&#xD;
      statistical analysis and outcome determination of oropharyngeal SCC treated with&#xD;
      chemoradiation. The investigators plan to accomplish this study in 3 years. In the first&#xD;
      year, the works of the this project in the first year will: (1) design the data bank&#xD;
      categories; (2) set up the workflow and optimize the imaging protocols; (3) determine the&#xD;
      diagnostic capability of MRI component, PET component, integrated PET/MRI in tumor staging;&#xD;
      (4) determinate any added diagnostic value of noncontrast CT in integrated PET/MRI, and (5)&#xD;
      study the early treatment response and the patterns of residual tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second year, the investigators will continue to the first-year works, and further&#xD;
      include the following works: (1) to determinate incidence and predictors of treatment failure&#xD;
      of oropharyngeal SCC, and (2) to study the patterns of treatment response and early&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third year, the investigators will continue to do previous work and will also (1) get&#xD;
      sufficient sample size to perform statistical analysis of the relationship between the&#xD;
      imaging parameters and patient outcomes, (2) attain comprehensive imaging about patterns of&#xD;
      tumor recurrence and posttreatment changes/complications, (3) investigate to what extent&#xD;
      biologic imaging parameters may affect outcome and patient selection for chemoradiation, (4)&#xD;
      analysis the accuracy, pitfalls and cost effectiveness of the PET/MRI alone and PET/MRI with&#xD;
      noncontrast CT in evaluating in patients with oropharyngeal SCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/MRI protocol PET/MRI data will be acquired on the integrated PET/MRI scanner (Biograph&#xD;
      mMR, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) , which acquires simultaneous PET and MR data&#xD;
      with a 3.0-T magnet. The examination protocol will combined a whole-body scan with a&#xD;
      dedicated examination of the head and neck area (Table 1). All patients will fast for 6 h&#xD;
      before the scan. At 50-70 min post injection of 370 MBq of FDG, the patient will be placed on&#xD;
      the PET/MRI scanner bed. After fast-view T1-weighted MR localizer sequence for scout imaging&#xD;
      and Dixon VIBE sequence for attenuation correction, a whole-body PET scan will be performed&#xD;
      in 5 bed positions to cover from the head to the proximal thigh, with an acquisition time of&#xD;
      4 min per bed position. Simultaneously, whole body MR image acquisition will be performed for&#xD;
      the corresponding 5 bed positions with the axial HASTE sequence and coronal STIR sequence as&#xD;
      well as the sagittal T1-weighted Turbo spine echo(TSE) and STIR sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, regional PET and MRI images will be simultaneously performed. Regional PET will&#xD;
      be performed with an acquisition time of 10 min, while a dedicated MRI of the head and neck&#xD;
      region will be acquired in the axial and coronal projections with T1-weighted TSE sequence&#xD;
      and T2-weighted TSE sequence with fat saturation. Axial DWI will be performed using a single&#xD;
      shot spin-echo echo-planar technique with modified Stejskal-Tanner diffusion gradient pulsing&#xD;
      scheme. A total of 10 b values will be used for the reconstruction of IVIM and kurtosis&#xD;
      imaging, which are: 0, 20, 40, 80, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1200, 1500 sec/mm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCE-PWI at the head and neck region will be acquired by using a 3D T1-weighted spoiled&#xD;
      gradient-echo sequence. A spatial saturation slab will be implanted inferior to the acquired&#xD;
      region to minimize the inflow effect from the carotid arteries. Before the contrast agent&#xD;
      administration, baseline longitudinal relaxation time (T10) values will be calculated from&#xD;
      image acquired with different flip angles (4°, 8°, 15° and 25°). Then, the dynamic series&#xD;
      will be acquired using the same sequence with a 15° flip angle, after intravenous&#xD;
      administration of paramagnetic contrast agent at 3 ml/s. Thereafter, dedicated regional MRI&#xD;
      will be obtained with T1-weighted TSE sequence with fat saturation in the axial and coronal&#xD;
      projections. Finally, whole body axial VIBE with fat saturation will be performed. The total&#xD;
      acquisition time is about 42 min, and the mean in-room time for PET/MR will be approximately&#xD;
      60 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-enhanced low-dose CT Spiral low-dose CT without contrast material enhancement will be&#xD;
      performed before PET/MRI on the same examination day. Acquisition parameters include peak&#xD;
      voltage of 120 kVp, mAs of 50, collimation of 64x0.5 mm and reconstruction interval of 3-mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and outcome determination Readers are aware that patients have oropharyngeal&#xD;
      SCC, and they will be blinded to the results of other studies and to PET/MR data. The PET,&#xD;
      MRI and lung CT images will be first interpreted independently. All images will be then&#xD;
      reviewed together and compared. A checklist of various distributions of tumor extension,&#xD;
      nodal spread and distant metastasis will be recorded. The clinical and imaging findings will&#xD;
      be discussed jointly by the Head-and-Neck research team. Endoscopic biopsy, ultrasonographic&#xD;
      guided fine needle aspiration or CT-guided biopsy will be performed in any lesions suspicion&#xD;
      for malignancy if possible. If biopsy of the lesion of interest is not feasible, or yields a&#xD;
      negative result, close clinical and imaging follow-up will be pursued. All patients will be&#xD;
      followed up for at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical and functional imaging data will be collected and analyzed for predicting&#xD;
      treatment response and prognosis. For the diffusion MRI, regions of interest will be manually&#xD;
      placed on the lesions on ADC map to encompass as much of the solid tumor area as possible.&#xD;
      The signal intensities measured on the images acquired at different b-values S(b) will be&#xD;
      numerically fitted against the model, S(b)=S0 e-b*ADC, where S0 and Sb are signal intensities&#xD;
      at different b values, For IVIM imaging, the relationship between signal intensities and b&#xD;
      values can be expressed by the equation: Sb/S0 = (1-f )．exp(-bD) + f．exp[-b( D + D＊)] where f&#xD;
      is a microvascular volume fraction representing the fraction of the diffusion linked to&#xD;
      microcirculation, D represents pure diffusion coefficient, and D* is perfusion-related&#xD;
      incoherent microcirculation. For the DKI, the relationship between signal intensities and b&#xD;
      values can be expressed by the equation: ln[S(b)] = ln[S(0)] - b x Dapp + 1/6b2 x Dapp2 x&#xD;
      Kapp where S is the signal intensity (arbitrary units), b is the b-value (s/mm2), Dapp is the&#xD;
      apparent diffusion coefficient (10-3 mm2/s), and Kapp is the apparent kurtosis coefficient&#xD;
      denoting the deviation from a Gaussian distribution. The investigators will also perform&#xD;
      monoexponential fitting by using Kapp=0 in the equation, yielding ADCmono. For the DCE-PWI&#xD;
      MRI, the change in contrast agent concentration over time, Ct(t), will be determined in each&#xD;
      voxel in the tumor, and the compartmental tracer kinetic model will be applied to each voxel&#xD;
      by using an arterial input function, Cp(t), measured in each individual: Ct (t)=VpCp(t) +&#xD;
      Ktrans ∫0t Cp (t' ) exp(Ktrans(t-t') /Ve )dt' where t' is the time (in minutes) as an&#xD;
      integration variable, and Cp(t') is the concentration of contrast agent in the blood plasma&#xD;
      as a function of time. For PET imaging parameters, SUV and MTV of the target lesions will be&#xD;
      measured from attenuation-corrected 18F-FDG PET images by drawing the boundaries drawn large&#xD;
      enough to include the lesions. An SUV threshold of 2.5 will be used to delineate the MTV. The&#xD;
      TLG is calculated as the product of the mean SUV and the MTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using histological findings or follow-up data at 12 months as a standard of reference,&#xD;
      various imaging results will be classified as true-positive, true-negative, false-positive,&#xD;
      or false-negative. The diagnostic accuracies of MRI component, PET component, integrated&#xD;
      PET/MRI, chest CT alone, and PET/MRI plus chest CT will be calculated and compared with the&#xD;
      McNemar test. Their respective diagnostic performance will be determined with the areas under&#xD;
      the receiver-operating-characteristic curve. For treatment response evaluation and prognosis&#xD;
      prediction, logistic regression analyses will be used to identify the relationship between&#xD;
      clinical and imaging functional variables. The control and survival rates will be plotted&#xD;
      using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in positive and negative results will be&#xD;
      determined by log-rank test. All prognostic variables identified by univariate analysis will&#xD;
      be put into the multivariate model using the Cox proportional hazards model. The Spearman's&#xD;
      rank correlation coefficient will be used to investigate the correlations among the&#xD;
      variables. P values &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;

    <description>A total of 160 patients with histologically proven oropharyngeal SCC subjected to chemoradiation will be enrolled. Exclusion criteria include previous head or neck malignant tumor, a second malignant tumor, distant metastasis, contraindications to MRI (renal insufficiency, cochlear implant, cardiac pacemaker placement or intracranial aneurysmal ferromagnetic clips), and serum glucose level &gt;200 mg/dl. Before pretreatment, each enrolled patients will undergo PET/MRI and detail clinical examination, including human papillomavirus test.</description>

    <description>Before pretreatment, each enrolled patients will undergo PET/MRI and detail clinical examination, including human papillomavirus test. They will also undergo low dose chest CT on the same day before PET/MRI. In the posttreatment period, baseline whole body MRI will be obtained 3 months after chemoradiation. Thereafter, the patients will then be followed up also with alternative extend-field CT and whole body MRI by every 6 months. If tumor recurrence is confirmed or highly suspected, PET/MRI will also be performed for tumor re-staging.</description>
