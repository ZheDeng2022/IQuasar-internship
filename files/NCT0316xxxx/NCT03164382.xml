  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was designed to investigate whether the survival outcome, response rate and safety&#xD;
      of hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil/leucovorin regimens for patients&#xD;
      with Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)-C stage hepatocellular carcinoma was superior than&#xD;
      those of the standard treatment with sorafenib or not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide. Advanced-stage&#xD;
      disease is found in 25%-70% of HCC at diagnosis, with a median survival time of only 4.2-7.9&#xD;
      months due to limited treatment options. To date, sorafenib is the only standard treatment&#xD;
      shown to extend overall survival for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (Ad-HCC). However, low&#xD;
      response rates, modest survival advantages and high-level heterogeneity of individual&#xD;
      response, such limitations of sorafenib prohibit its widespread use in Ad-HCC and more&#xD;
      alternative therapies are highly required at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) can provide chemotherapeutic agents to liver at&#xD;
      higher concentration with lower toxicity and has been reported favorable results in advanced&#xD;
      HCC. However, HAIC provides good but variable outcomes, with a response rate of 7-81% and&#xD;
      median survival time of 6-15.9 months. The unstable response may attribute to complicate&#xD;
      combinations based on various drugs, including fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, doxorubicin,&#xD;
      mitomycin, leucovorin and interferon. FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, 5-FU/leucovorin) was a regimen&#xD;
      first used in colon cancer with liver metastasis and reported to be effective both by&#xD;
      systemic and HAIC in amounts of clinical trials. A recent phase II study has shown that HAI&#xD;
      of FOLFOX (HAIF) was well tolerated and effective in Ad-HCC. To the investigator's knowledge,&#xD;
      no clinical studies have been developed on comparing the survival benefit of HAIF with&#xD;
      sorafenib for patients with Ad-HCC. In this phase III trial, the investigators aimed to&#xD;
      compare survival outcome, response rate and safety of HAIF with sorafenib in patients with&#xD;
      Ad-HCC.&#xD;

    <description>Firstly, the femoral artery was percutaneously punctured using the Seldinger technique. Then, the catheter was inserted into the celiac trunk or superior mesenteric artery for arteriography. When more than one feeding artery of HCC was detected, the smaller arteries were embolized with gelatin sponge particles. A micro-catheter was inserted through the arterial catheter located at the common hepatic artery or proper hepatic arterial branch (feeding artery). When blood flows into the gastroduodenal artery was confirmed by micro-catheter angiography, the route was embolized with a coil or micro-coil to prevent reflux of chemotherapeutic drugs to the stomach and duodenum. The peripheral part of the catheter that was exposed to the outside of the body was covered with medical sterile gauze and fastened on the thigh's skin using medical rubberized fabric and bandage. Catheter insertion was repeatedly performed before every cycle of treatment.</description>

&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;

                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure&#xD;
                       rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone&#xD;
                       contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system&#xD;

                       suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a&#xD;
        minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age&#xD;
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
        (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of&#xD;
        oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by&#xD;
        follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while receiving&#xD;
             treatment and for 7 days after stopping study treatment and should not father a child&#xD;
             in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to&#xD;
             prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unable to suffer the discomfort of the HAI procedure (e.g. pain,&#xD;
             claustrophobia, noise).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any contraindication for sorafenib, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, or fluorouracil&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
