  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfed babies have significant health benefits extending beyond infancy, including lower&#xD;
      rates of childhood obesity and infection. Mothers who breastfeeding also have health&#xD;
      benefits, including increased rates of postpartum weight loss. Low-income women are less&#xD;
      likely to breastfeed comparatively; this disparity may be due to misconceptions about&#xD;
      breastfeeding benefits or poor social support. Based on survey results and focus groups of&#xD;
      low-income women, the investigators designed a novel smart-phone application to confront&#xD;
      barriers women perceived prevented them from breastfeeding and propose the first-ever&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial describing the impact a smart phone app has on postpartum weight&#xD;
      loss and breastfeeding rates among low-income women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breastfed babies have fewer childhood infections than formula-fed babies, and women who&#xD;
      breastfeed have a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and increased rates of postpartum&#xD;
      weight loss. Thus, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends&#xD;
      six months of exclusive breastfeeding after birth. Nationally, 75% of women initiate&#xD;
      breastfeeding, but only 59% of Black women, 53% of teenagers, and 66% of women in the Special&#xD;
      Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children breastfeed. Unpublished&#xD;
      internal data suggest that, while the breastfeeding initiation rate for women receiving&#xD;
      prenatal care at Barnes-Jewish Hospital's Medicaid clinic is higher than the national average&#xD;
      (89%), by postpartum day #2, only 34% exclusively breastfeed. Reasons for this precipitous&#xD;
      decline in breastfeeding are not fully understood but include misconceptions about&#xD;
      breastfeeding benefits and poor social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would be the first-ever randomized controlled trial describing the impact that a&#xD;
      smart phone application (app) has on breastfeeding rates and thus postpartum weight loss&#xD;
      among low-income women. In this study's first phase, a previously well-validated&#xD;
      questionnaire was used to identify barriers that low-income urban women perceived as&#xD;
      preventing breastfeeding initiation or continuation. In the second phase, these data-as well&#xD;
      as input from neonatologists, certified lactation consultants, and focus groups of low-income&#xD;
      pregnant women-were used to create a smart phone application (app) to promote breastfeeding&#xD;
      called Breastfeeding Friend (BFF). The investigators chose an app to provide breastfeeding&#xD;
      support for two reasons. First, nearly two-thirds of American adults, and 90% of those under&#xD;
      the age of 29, have smart phones. Second, more than two-thirds of Americans with smart phones&#xD;
      use them to obtain health information via new media (blogs, websites, and apps). Among&#xD;
      low-income women, physician-designed new media have improved intrauterine device uptake rates&#xD;
      and decreased rates of postpartum smoking. BFF will serve as a virtual lactation consultant,&#xD;
      increasing breastfeeding knowledge while providing interactive assistance and access to&#xD;
      in-person resources. By providing women with more breastfeeding support, this app could&#xD;
      increase postpartum weight loss by decreasing a significant health disparity.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will receive a complementary android phone with 3 months of complementary internet service upon enrollment at approximately 36 weeks gestation.

    <masking_description>The coding team has labeled BFF and the dummy app as &quot;BFF-1&quot; and BFF-2.&quot; The research team is blinded to which app is BFF-1 and which is BFF-2. Sprint Telecommunications will receive the .apks files for both apps and load one app to each research phone according to the randomization algorithm that researchers at Washington University will provide to them. This algorithm has been created to randomize participants in blocks of four. Sprint will then send the phones to the research team with labels on the box that state the research phone number and app number (ie, phone 18, BFF-2). Participants will be given the phones in a sequential manner. After the study is completed, the researchers will contact the coding team, and the study will be un-blinded.</masking_description>

    <description>BFF is a novel android app initially created in Microsoft PowerPoint with the results of a well-validated questionnaire administered to the target patient population, in which participants identified barriers preventing them from starting or continuing breastfeeding. The app was then modified by a multidisciplinary team of neonatologists, perinatologists, and certified lactation consultants. The finalized prototype was presented to three focus groups of test users sociodemographically similar to the target population. This approach allowed BFF to be adjusted to maximize the users' experience per their opinions. Once the focus groups' feedback was consistent, the app prototype was provided to a freelance coding team at Washington University of St. Louis, which built a native android app.</description>

            <description>BFF is a novel android app initially created in Microsoft PowerPoint with the results of a well-validated questionnaire administered to the target patient population, in which participants identified barriers preventing them from starting or continuing breastfeeding. The app was then modified by a multidisciplinary team of neonatologists, perinatologists, and certified lactation consultants. The finalized prototype was presented to three focus groups of test users sociodemographically similar to the target population. This approach allowed BFF to be adjusted to maximize the users' experience per their opinions. Once the focus groups' feedback was consistent, the app prototype was provided to a freelance coding team at Washington University of St. Louis, which built a native android app.&#xD;

            <title>BreastFeeding Friend (BFF)</title>
            <description>BFF is a novel android app initially created in Microsoft PowerPoint with the results of a well-validated questionnaire administered to the target patient population, in which participants identified barriers preventing them from starting or continuing breastfeeding. The app was then modified by a multidisciplinary team of neonatologists, perinatologists, and certified lactation consultants. The finalized prototype was presented to three focus groups of test users sociodemographically similar to the target population. This approach allowed BFF to be adjusted to maximize the users' experience per their opinions. Once the focus groups' feedback was consistent, the app prototype was provided to a freelance coding team at Washington University of St. Louis, which built a native android app.&#xD;
