  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failed intubation is currently one of the most important factors leading to morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of supraglottic airway devices (SGDs), such as the intubating laryngeal tube,&#xD;
      has revolutionized airway management, as these devices allow adequate ventilation and&#xD;
      oxygenation in situations where ventilation and/or intubation via conventional means pose a&#xD;
      challenge. Several publications describe the usefulness of such devices for salvaging&#xD;
      ventilation in patients that cannot be intubated with direct laryngoscopy or who cannot be&#xD;
      ventilated with a facemask. In these salvage situations, SGDs are highly effective in&#xD;
      achieving adequate patient oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achieving effective oxygenation with an SGD and completely isolating the airway by intubation&#xD;
      at the same time. This is now possible thanks to the so called supraglottic intubation&#xD;
      devices (SGIDs). For that reason, we believe it is necessary to conduct a study that allows&#xD;
      evaluation of the performance of this device in the context of daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its design characteristics, its capacity to be used in intubation applications, its soft and&#xD;
      atraumatic materials as well as its disposability augur this product a significant expansion&#xD;
      in the next few years. Nonetheless, no data are available on the success of intubation when&#xD;
      the intubating laryngeal tube suction device (ILTSD) is used. The idea behind this study is&#xD;
      to assess the possibilities to use the ITLSD device to intubate patients in regular&#xD;
      anesthetic practice.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The development of supraglottic airway devices (SGDs), such as the intubating laryngeal tube,&#xD;
      has revolutionized airway management, as these devices allow adequate ventilation and&#xD;
      oxygenation in situations where ventilation and/or intubation via conventional means pose a&#xD;
      challenge. It would seem ideal to be able to unify both techniques in one single device; in&#xD;
      other words, achieving effective oxygenation with an SGD and completely isolating the airway&#xD;
      by intubation at the same time. This is now possible thanks to the so-called supraglottic&#xD;
      intubation devices (SGIDs). For that reason, we believe it is necessary to conduct a study&#xD;
      that allows evaluation of the performance of this device in the context of daily clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOCATION: The study will be conducted at operating rooms serving inpatients at the Valencia&#xD;
      Clinical University Hospital. Investigators will be anesthesiologists with long experience in&#xD;
      fibroscopy and in the management of supraglottic devices used for intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY: Prospective observational study aimed at evaluating the success of intubation&#xD;
      through an I-LTSD device in regular clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research population: The study population will be made up of adult patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective surgery who require general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Patients will be&#xD;
      included in a consecutive manner provided that selection criteria are met. All patients will&#xD;
      be required to sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables: Information on the following variables will be gathered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic variables: age, gender, weight, height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical variables: American Society Anaesthesiology status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant conditions: presence of cardiovascular or respiratory conditions, liver or&#xD;
           renal failure, history of gastroesophagic reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of surgery to be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difficult airway parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mallampati score&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Thyromental distance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Degree of cervical mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Interdental distance (in mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anesthetic agents used, including dose administered: propofol, fentanyl, others&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of attempted laryngeal mask insertions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repositioning maneuvers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insertion time (in seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change for a different number&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expired tidal volume &gt; 6-7 ml.kg-1,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expired CO2 &lt; 45 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seal pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fiberoptic visualization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ease of passage of nasogastric tube&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and duration of intubation attempts through laryngeal mask&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of blood on removal of the device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Soreness of throat, painful swallowing /intensity (mild-moderate-severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total anesthesia time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline hemodynamic parameters (SpO2, E-T-CO2) and BIS value at pre-insertion&#xD;
           (following induction of anesthesia), at 3 minutes after insertion of I-LTSD device,&#xD;
           pre-intubation and immediately following tube removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT RECRUITMENT Once it has been ascertained that inclusion criteria are met, patients&#xD;
      will be informed about the study and they will be invited to participate. If they agree, they&#xD;
      will be asked to sign an informed consent form either in the pre-anesthesia unit or in the&#xD;
      ward. This must be done well before the patient is taken to the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPERATION ROOM PROCEDURE (OR) Once the patient is in the OR standard monitoring is performed&#xD;
      (3-lead ECG, non invasive blood pressure measurements every 5 minutes and peripheral O2&#xD;
      saturation). In addition, anesthetic depth will also be monitored using a bispectral index&#xD;
      (BIS) monitor (BIS-VISTA™ Monitoring System, Aspect Medical System Inc. USA). Pre-oxygenation&#xD;
      with 100% oxygen will be performed through a facemask with the patient breathing normally&#xD;
      (normal tidal volume).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently the anesthesiologist in charge will carry out induction of anesthesia following&#xD;
      the standard procedure, using neuromuscular blocking agents at standard doses (preferably&#xD;
      rocuronium at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg of ideal weight). A record will be kept of the dosage used&#xD;
      for each of the drugs administered during anesthesia induction. Once the patient has lost&#xD;
      consciousness, manual ventilation will be applied through a facemask until the device is&#xD;
      inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to airway management clinical guidelines,, anesthetic depth is considered adequate&#xD;
      for insertion of a supraglottic device when the following conditions are met: absence of&#xD;
      palpebral reflex, absence of response to jaw subluxation and BIS value below 40. If on&#xD;
      insertion of the I-LTSD device the patient reacts with avoidance movements, the dose of&#xD;
      propofol (or of the hypnotic agent the anesthetist in change has decided to use) should be&#xD;
      augmented in 50 mg-bolus increments until the anesthetic status of the patient is appropriate&#xD;
      for insertion of the device. A record will be kept of the total number of additional boluses&#xD;
      required (if any).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist will then insert the I-LTSD device in accordance with the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions to ensure optimal placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The size of the device is selected depending on the patient's ideal weight. Size 4-5 is&#xD;
           recommended for adult patients (both males and females). A smaller size should be used&#xD;
           in individuals whose weight or height is lower than the ideal value. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The anteroposterior and lateral surfaces of the I-LTSD device should be previously&#xD;
           lubricated. Integrity of the device is checked by using the fingers to compress its&#xD;
           distal portion (the area over the cuff). The device can be inserted with the head and&#xD;
           neck placed in different positions, although the sniffing position is the most&#xD;
           appropriate one.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The device must be grasped with the dominant hand, with the thumb, index and middle&#xD;
           fingers holding the base of the ventilation channel. Pressure is exerted posteriorly and&#xD;
           caudally on the tube. The tube is inserted into the mouth passing the hard palate first&#xD;
           and the soft palate later until it reaches its final position on the upper esophagic&#xD;
           sphincter. Proper positioning of the device is indicated by resistance to its further&#xD;
           advancement. Once the device is in place, soft manual ventilation must be performed to&#xD;
           confirm it is in the proper position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proper functioning of the I-LTSD device is confirmed by the absence of leakages, an&#xD;
           initial tidal volume of 6-7 ml.kg-1, correct ventilatory chest movements and a normal&#xD;
           expired CO2 curve. Should ventilation be ineffective, the anesthesiologist must&#xD;
           reposition the device with maneuvers of the head, neck and jaw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the I-LTSD device has been inserted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Airway quality is classified into: free, partially obstructed and fully obstructed. The&#xD;
           existence of partial leaks will also be investigated. A maximum of three attempts will&#xD;
           be allowed and, if necessary, recourse will be made to a different device or to standard&#xD;
           intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The anatomical position of the I-LTSD device will be evaluated by fiberoptic&#xD;
           visualization through the pneumatic cannel. Grade 1 corresponds to situations where the&#xD;
           anterior epiglottis blocks visualization of the glottis or where laryngeal structures&#xD;
           are absent. Grade 2 refers to cases where the anterior epiglottis and the vocal cords&#xD;
           are visible. Grade 3 includes cases where the posterior epiglottis and the vocal cords&#xD;
           can be seen. In grade 4 cases, full visualization of the vocal cords is possible. This&#xD;
           assessment will be conducted by a different anesthesiologist from the one performing the&#xD;
           intubation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seal pressure will be calculating in accordance with the methodology described above:&#xD;
           the expiratory valve of the circle system must be closed at a constant fresh gas flow of&#xD;
           3 L/min, adjusting the pressure limiting valve to 40 cm H2O. Pressure in the circuit&#xD;
           rises until equilibrium is reached and a leak is induced. That is the so-called seal&#xD;
           pressure. Seal pressure will be determined 3-5 minutes after insertion, when it is&#xD;
           functioning in a stable way. Audible leaks in the mouth, or reaching equilibrium, will&#xD;
           determine the degree of seal pressure of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A record will be made of ease of passage of a 16 french nasogastric tube through the&#xD;
           gastric channel (which will be previously lubricated and inserted only when the&#xD;
           laryngeal tube is already in its final position).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the laryngeal tube is in the ideal position, intubation can begin. An endotracheal&#xD;
           tube (ETT) of the size recommended by the manufacturer will be used (a nr 7.5 ETT for a&#xD;
           4-5 I-LTSD device; a 7 ETT for a 2.5-3 I-LTSD device). If blind insertion of the ETT&#xD;
           fails after two attempts and after correction maneuvers indicated by the&#xD;
           anesthesiologist (removal a few centimeters of the laryngeal tube, rotating the ETT,&#xD;
           anterior cervical movements,...), then intubation will be performed with a flexible&#xD;
           fibroscope/endoscope and the study will be finalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of the fibroscope to facilitate endotracheal intubation is based on previous experience&#xD;
      with these kinds of devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training of the investigators in the procedures of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out by physicians specializing in the fields of anesthesia and&#xD;
      resuscitation who are in the habit of applying general anesthesia to patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery, and who routinely perform airway control by means of endotracheal intubation. They&#xD;
      will also have used supraglottic devices for intubation in over 80 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESTIMATION SAMPLE SIZE&amp; DATA ANALYSIS: According to published data, the success rate for&#xD;
      other supraglottic devices ranges between 84 and 90% at the first attempt and between 95-100%&#xD;
      overall. Considering that the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval acceptable for&#xD;
      supraglottic devices should be lower than 2.5%, the required size of our sample should be of&#xD;
      30 patients. To compensate for potential losses to follow up, the total number of patients to&#xD;
      be included will be 34.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The descriptive analysis of the data collected will be made by drawing up frequency tables&#xD;
      for the nominal variables, and calculating measures of central tendency and dispersion for&#xD;
      continuous variables. 95% confidence intervals will be estimated (95% CI) for the latter. For&#xD;
      the clinical variables, Student's T test will be used for data related with quantitative&#xD;
      variables if parameters show a normal distribution. If the distribution of parameters is&#xD;
      abnormal the Mann-Whitney U test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION: The data recording period will be 5 months. Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      consecutively provided that they comply with the inclusion criteria, they do not meet the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria described above and they agree to participate in the study and sign the&#xD;
      required informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL: The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical requirements laid down in&#xD;
      the Helsinki Declaration, revised in Edinburgh, Scotland in October 2000, in terms of human&#xD;
      experimentation, as well as in accordance to Spanish Royal Decree 223 of 1 May 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY: The study will be carried out within the framework of the Spanish Data&#xD;
      Protection Law (Act 15 of 13 December 1999).&#xD;
