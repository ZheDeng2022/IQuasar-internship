  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis with high satisfaction rate. However, the traditional cutting jigs for&#xD;
      distal femur cutting inevitably violates the medullary canal of femoral bone. The process of&#xD;
      intramedullary reaming for the insertion of distal femur cutting jigs stimulated the&#xD;
      dissipation of marrow emboli that reported lead to increased risk of myocardial infarction or&#xD;
      cardiac stress perioperatively. There are emerging refinements aiming to reduce the insult to&#xD;
      the medullary canal of the distal femur as well as to improve the prosthetic alignment, such&#xD;
      as navigation assisted TKA or robotic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to better prosthetic alignment, computer-assisted navigation TKAs also mitigate&#xD;
      perioperative blood loss and systemic emboli. The publication previously published by the&#xD;
      investigators showed that navigation TKAs can lead to lesser extent of elevation of&#xD;
      endothelial injury markers than the traditional TKAs. However, the detrimental effects of&#xD;
      intramedullary reaming seem to be multi-dimensional and the whole picture has not been&#xD;
      elucidated clearly at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that operative trauma can trigger marked immune responses.&#xD;
      Operative procedures can simultaneously stimulate the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      response, with 80% of the leucocyte transcriptome being affected. Most studies of hip or knee&#xD;
      surgery found that operation-triggered immune reactions are associated with postoperative&#xD;
      recovery, infection, and even mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The navigation TKAs avoid the process of intra-medullary reaming, which is the mandatory part&#xD;
      of conventional TKA for the distal femur cutting. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      reaming process may exert substantial inflammatory response, which can be manifested by&#xD;
      higher level of inflammatory markers in the serum and hemovac drainage samples obtained from&#xD;
      the participants undergoing conventional TKAs.&#xD;

        Patients necessitating TKA surgery due to advanced degenerative osteoarthritis of the knee&#xD;
        visited the outpatient department initially and were then scheduled for admission for TKA&#xD;
        surgery. The patients were self-separated into two groups when they visited the outpatient&#xD;
        department. The patients visiting professor CJ Wang would undergo conventional TKA, and&#xD;
        those visiting Dr. JY Ko would undergo navigation TKA. Both senior authors had performed&#xD;
        more than 1,000 TKAs using the conventional and navigation method respectively before&#xD;
        recruiting the patients of our study.&#xD;
