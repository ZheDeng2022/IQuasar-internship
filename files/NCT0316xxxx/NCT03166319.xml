    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study to determine the utility of MRI and high resolution&#xD;
      intracranial vessel wall imaging for the diagnosis and disease activity assessment of&#xD;
      intracranial vasculitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients with suspected primary angiitis of the central nervous&#xD;
      system (PACNS), recruited during initial work-up by our multi-disciplinary team. Given the&#xD;
      low incidence of CNS vasculitis and the fact that some patients are routed to a quaternary&#xD;
      care center after initial work-up and diagnosis, evaluation of both groups will be useful to&#xD;
      maximize the number of participants evaluated and to provide a representative sample of&#xD;
      patients typically treated. During the study, participants will ultimately be deemed to have;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A specific clinical and pathologic subtype of PACNS,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PACNS not otherwise specified (NOS) without pathologic or clinical proof of a specific&#xD;
           subtype, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An alternative diagnosis other than PACNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a standardized imaging and clinical examination at presentation and at&#xD;
      pre-defined follow-up periods. Imaging examinations will include an MRI of the head, standard&#xD;
      magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of the head, and intracranial vessel wall imaging without&#xD;
      and with IV gadolinium. Patients will receive up to 4 imaging examinations at predefined&#xD;
      intervals as part of this study. MRI/MRA/Vessel wall features will be evaluated by 2&#xD;
      neuroradiologists. Imaging findings will be correlated to clinical and any available&#xD;
      laboratory or pathologic data. The target accrual is 10 patients for this pilot study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient is determined to have suspected PACNS upon evaluation by a neurologist or&#xD;
             rheumatologist or may have an established diagnosis of PACNS of any duration as&#xD;
             determined by a neurologist or rheumatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ability to undergo routine clinical testing, including lumbar puncture performed for&#xD;
             PACNS to exclude potential alternative diagnoses (for initial suspected cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Less than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any absolute contraindication to 3 Tesla MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any absolute contraindication to gadolinium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Contraindication to lumbar puncture such as severe coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. High risk carotid atherosclerotic plaque defined as either greater than 70% stenosis&#xD;
             or known high risk plaque features such as intra-plaque hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Medium or high risk factors for cardioembolic stroke based on the Trial of Org 10172&#xD;
             in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria.&#xD;
