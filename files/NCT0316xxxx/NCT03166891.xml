    <textblock>
      Chiauranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking Aurora kinase B（Aurora&#xD;
      B）、VEGFR/PDGFR/c-Kit、CSF-1R targets. This clinical trial is studying the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of chiauranib(50mg，QD，PO) works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, in the meantime, exploring the latent biomarkers accompany with chiauranib, as well&#xD;
      as the relevancy of which and clinical benefit.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety include adverse events, vital&#xD;
      signs, laboratory tests ,etc., of Chiauranib in ovarian cancer patients due to the outcomes&#xD;
      of the phase I study, and to explore the relevance between the latent biomarkers of&#xD;
      Chiauranib and clinical benefit.&#xD;
