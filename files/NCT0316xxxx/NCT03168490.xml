  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last two decades, a series of epidemiological studies have shown a particular increase&#xD;
      in Coeliac Disease (CD), a life-long intolerance to gluten proteins (the seed storage&#xD;
      proteins) present in most cereals (wheat, barley and rye) both in the United States and&#xD;
      Europe, and in developing countries. In these subjects, the consumption of cereals containing&#xD;
      gluten causes a chronic inflammatory process leading to lesions in the small intestine and a&#xD;
      dysfunction in nutrient absorption.The only current treatment for CD is a strict lifelong&#xD;
      gluten-free diet. In most cases (some people do not respond) this dietary regimen guarantees&#xD;
      the full recovery of small intestine architecture and functions, though for many patients the&#xD;
      gluten-free diet is highly restrictive, especially for social events and during travelling.&#xD;
      In addition, this dietary therapy has often low content of vitamins and ions, such as&#xD;
      vitamins B and calcium, iron, zinc and magnesium, as well as fibre. Furthermore, one of the&#xD;
      major risks is to develop obesity and diseases related to metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a new and innovative detoxification method has been developed with the purpose to&#xD;
      overcome the disadvantages of the prior methods. The method is based on the application of&#xD;
      microwave energy for few seconds to hydrated wheat kernels; the treatment induces&#xD;
      modifications to endosperm components which dramatically reduce the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      most common epitopes involved in coeliac disease, without compromising the technological&#xD;
      properties necessary to process flour into bread, pasta and other baked goods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method is based on the analysis of recent studies that have reported, when high&#xD;
      temperatures are applied to the caryopsis of wheat, the protein polymers present in the pasta&#xD;
      produced with these &quot;baked grain&quot; present a size distribution pattern that is not observed in&#xD;
      pasta during the drying cycles. The researchers Lamacchia and others explained this&#xD;
      phenomenon on the basis of the fact that in the caryopsis of wheat, gluten is not yet formed&#xD;
      and gluten proteins are deposited in different protein bodies.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of gluten friendly bread on the faecal&#xD;
      microbiota composition, metabolism and immunity in coeliac individuals aged 20-80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a 6-visit (screening visit + 5 visits) randomised intervention with the&#xD;
      Gluten Friendly bread at different doses and placebo (control bread).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly distributed into four groups: placebo (control bread in a dose of&#xD;
      1.5 g gluten/day), low gluten group taking the Gluten Friendly bread in a dose of 1.5 g&#xD;
      gluten/day, medium gluten group (3 g gluten/day) and high gluten group (6 g gluten/day). As&#xD;
      wheat generally contains 10% of gluten (i.e. 100 g of bread contain 10 g of gluten), bread&#xD;
      buns of 60 g, 30 g and 15 g will be elaborated for high, medium and low gluten groups,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control bread and also gluten free bread as 15g buns will be assessed as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a screening visit, baseline visit, visits at midpoint, endpoint of the&#xD;
      treatment periods and a final visit after 2 weeks of the treatment. Volunteers will provide a&#xD;
      blood sample at a pre- screening visit (~10ml; 1 dessert spoon), to check for anaemia&#xD;
      (defined as haemoglobin men &lt;14g/dl; women &lt;11.5g/dl). The design will include a 14-day&#xD;
      run-in period followed by 14 days of treatment and a final visit post-gluten challenge.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to consume a multi-sugar drink (7.5g lactulose and 2g D-mannitol&#xD;
      ≥98% in 100 ml of water) (a dosage used widely in oral clinical testing- LAMA testing) in the&#xD;
      evening before each study visit (visits: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) at 8 pm and be instructed to&#xD;
      collect all overnight and morning first spot pass urine sample. This non-invasive assessment&#xD;
      of intestinal permeability in humans has a 20-year history. LAMA evaluation has been reported&#xD;
      to be an accurate measure of small intestinal mucosal permeability though assessment of&#xD;
      differential absorption of lactulose and mannitol. They will also provide a faecal sample for&#xD;
      each study visit (visits: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each visit will take approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
