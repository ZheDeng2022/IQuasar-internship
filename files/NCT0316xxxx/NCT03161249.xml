    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an online intervention through a&#xD;
      mobile application, specifically designed for adolescents with a First Psychotic Episode&#xD;
      (FEP), as a complement to the pharmacological and therapeutic interventions they receive at&#xD;
      their referral center (Treatment as usual). To do this, a longitudinal study will be carried&#xD;
      out on patients with FEP and between the ages of 14 and 19, who come to the Child and&#xD;
      Adolescent Psychiatry Service of the General Universitarian Hospital &quot;Gregorio Marañón&quot; in&#xD;
      Madrid. Adolescents will be randomly assigned to an experimental group, where they will&#xD;
      receive standard treatment plus online intervention, or a control group, where they will&#xD;
      receive standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This online intervention, the continuation of the work of this same team researcher in the&#xD;
      &quot;PIENSA program&quot;, aims to address little of the more traditional treatments and treatments&#xD;
      such as community functioning, quality of life or affective symptoms. In addition, it will&#xD;
      increase disease awareness, which will lead to greater adherence to treatment and fewer&#xD;
      relapses and rehospitalizations.&#xD;

      Clinical assessment criteria Data on the major clinical and demographic variables are entered&#xD;
      in a data collection form. All patients are assessed at baseline and have been or will be&#xD;
      assessed at 3 months after inclusion in the study. All the instruments used in the study have&#xD;
      demonstrated appropriate psychometric properties, and were used in many studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data Data are collected on age, sex, level of education, living arrangements and&#xD;
      employment or educational status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of psychotic symptoms are assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.&#xD;
      The scale for the assessment of positive symptoms and negative symptoms. Trait and state&#xD;
      anxiety will be measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The mood is evaluated using&#xD;
      the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. We measure patient insight into their illness using&#xD;
      the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorders. We use the Strauss and Carpenter&#xD;
      Prognostic Scale. We also assess the overall function of patients using a Spanish version of&#xD;
      the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. The level of functioning was measured using the&#xD;
      Children's Global Assessment Scale. We measure this variable using the &quot;Morisky&quot; Medication&#xD;
      Adherence Scale. We measure patient functional status using the Functioning Assessment Short&#xD;
      Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consumption is measured using the ASI (Addition severity index) scale. The quality of&#xD;
      life is measured using the World Health Organization Quality of Life WHOQOL-BREF&#xD;
      Questionnaire .In addition, we assess quality of life using the EuroQoL questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile Application Android Mobile app with a web support and administration application,&#xD;
      along with a cloud based backend database, which will register fine-grain interactions&#xD;
      between the users and the app, in order to make possible the generation of relevant granular&#xD;
      data and key performance indicators to support a wide range of further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application will be designed and developed using Software Engineering-based Agile&#xD;
      Methodologies, under SCRUM principles (empiric control of the development process, using&#xD;
      continuous feedback processes). The whole mobile app functionality and its user interfaces&#xD;
      and interactions will be designed under the premises of maximizing the User experience, as a&#xD;
      factor contributing to the adherence of users to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the security side, all of the communications between the mobile app and the supporting&#xD;
      backend will be protected by means of a &quot;SSL&quot; digital certificate on the server, providing&#xD;
      end to end encrypted communications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management For security, all data introduce in database will have an internal code, and&#xD;
      will be checked by another data manager, in order to guarantee the data security.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention programme&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile phone App treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychoeducational app programme is composed of 5 modules:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychoeducative Module (12 sessions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Module of recognition of symptomatology and prevention of relapses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Module Troubleshooting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mindfulness Module&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Module of social skills&#xD;
