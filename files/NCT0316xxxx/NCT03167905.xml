  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postnatal depression affects about 10-15% of women after childbirth. Approximately 3-5% of&#xD;
      women experience a moderate-to-severe depression that requires medical attention. This study&#xD;
      aims to investigate the implication of pain relief choice in reducing the postnatal&#xD;
      depression of women who deliver their babies.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the patients have not decided on which pain relief method to be used, and would like to&#xD;
      take part in this study, they will be assigned to either epidural or non-epidural pain relief&#xD;
      for labour based on the study randomization result. Blood samples will be drawn to study the&#xD;
      presence of known functional polymorphisms in candidate genes associated with depression,&#xD;
      pain, stress and anxiety. Patients will be followed up with study questionnaires related to&#xD;
      pain and postnatal depression screening during the study. For some of the patients, a&#xD;
      discrete choice experiment (DCE) on pain relief choice will be conducted, and their&#xD;
      preferences on epidural analgesia will be asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During any time of the labour period, the patient is allowed to switch the pain relief option&#xD;
      upon request.&#xD;

    <description>Recruited patients will be administered a survey on Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) and other questions on their preferences for labor analgesia. For DCE, nine tasks will be included in which parturients will choose one of four hypothetical forms of labor analgesia: 1) epidural analgesia, 2) pethidine, 3) Entonox (nitrous oxide-oxygen mixture), and 4) no labor analgesia, which varies with regards to six attributes: 1) pain intensity following treatment, 2) duration of second stage of labor, 3) risk of instrumental delivery, 4) risk of back pain, 5) risk of permanent nerve injury, and 6) out-of-pocket cost.</description>

    <measure>Chinese version of Angle Labor Pain Questionnaire (A-LPQ)</measure>

    <description>Assessment via Angle Labor Pain Questionnaire (A-LPQ) during first stage of labor when the participants experience labor pain. The tool comprises 22 items divided into five subscales on the childbirth pain experience: the enormity of the pain, the fear and anxiety, uterine contraction pain, birthing pain, and the back pain/ long haul. Each item is scaled from 0 to 10, implying a range from non to worst possible or extremely (where applicable), and therefore has a total score ranged from 0 to 220. The higher the score, the greater the labor pain.</description>
