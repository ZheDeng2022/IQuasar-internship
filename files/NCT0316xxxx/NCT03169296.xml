    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of clonal haematopoietic stem cell disorders&#xD;
      characterized by ineffective haematopoiesis leading to cytopenia, with a significant risk of&#xD;
      progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Progression to AML and resistance to&#xD;
      hypomethylating agents (HMA) are important unmet clinical needs. The pathophysiology of MDS&#xD;
      and its progression to AML involve cytogenetic, genetic and epigenetic aberrations, and hence&#xD;
      better understanding of the molecular landscape of MDS has important clinical implications.&#xD;
      Also, future treatment strategies for MDS may involve exploitation of genetic information in&#xD;
      designing more effective therapy encompassing single agents or combinatorial approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed cohort study aims to establish a registry of clinical and genomic registry of&#xD;
      MDS and secondary AML in Asian patients, which allows the establishment of the mutational&#xD;
      profile of patients and prognostic model for survival, as well as exploration of treatment&#xD;
      strategies and prediction for treatment response.&#xD;

      Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of clonal haematopoietic stem cell disorders&#xD;
      characterized by ineffective haematopoiesis leading to cytopenia, with a significant risk of&#xD;
      progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Conventional prognostic scoring of MDS is based&#xD;
      on the degree of cytopenia, the percentage of bone marrow blast infiltration and karyotypic&#xD;
      abnormalities. Risk categories based on prognostic scoring determine the therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches. Treatment of high-risk MDS involves the use of hypomethylating agents (HMA), and&#xD;
      allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in younger patients. Clinical&#xD;
      studies with HMAs including azacitidine and decitabine have shown a response rate of about&#xD;
      40% in high-risk patients, and median duration of response of merely 9 to 15 months. HMA&#xD;
      failure is associated with a dismal outcome and a median survival of less than 5 months.&#xD;
      Therefore, progression to AML and resistance to HMA are important unmet clinical needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of MDS and its progression to AML involve cytogenetic, genetic and&#xD;
      epigenetic aberrations. Genome-wide and targeted analyses from next-generation sequencing&#xD;
      have identified mutations that may have prognostic and therapeutic significance. Recurrent&#xD;
      mutations in more than 45 genes are found in over 85% of cases. Theses mutations are found in&#xD;
      genes involved in DNA methylation (DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2), post-translational chromatin&#xD;
      modification (EZH2, ASXL1), transcription regulation (TP53, RUNX1, GATA2), the RNA&#xD;
      spliceosome machinery (SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2, ZRSR2), cohesion complexes (STAG2), and signal&#xD;
      transduction (JAK2, KRAS, CBL). Mutations in TP53, EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1, SRSF2 and ASXL1 portend&#xD;
      inferior survivals. Specific mutations, such as internal tandem duplications of FLT3&#xD;
      (FLT3-ITD), have been observed during disease progression and are potential therapeutic&#xD;
      targets. Data arising from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) have shown that the clonal evolution&#xD;
      of MDS to AML is dynamic and complex. The selection of clones during transformation is shaped&#xD;
      by acquisition of genetic alterations during clonal expansion, as well as exposure to&#xD;
      genotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better understanding of the molecular landscape of MDS has important clinical implications.&#xD;
      Firstly, prognosticating MDS based on molecular aberrations will supplement current models in&#xD;
      stratifying patients for treatment. Secondly, molecular markers may better predict response&#xD;
      and resistance to treatment with HMAs. Thirdly, detection of targetable molecular markers&#xD;
      during treatment resistance or leukaemic transformation may provide an opportunity for&#xD;
      specific therapy, as exemplified by the use of FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3-ITD positive secondary&#xD;
      AML. Hence, future treatment strategies for MDS may involve exploitation of genetic&#xD;
      information in designing more effective therapy encompassing single agents or combinatorial&#xD;
      approaches. There are important gaps in knowledge in the field of MDS. First, there is&#xD;
      currently no well-established model integrating molecular with clinicopathologic features in&#xD;
      prognostic stratification. There is lack of large registry clinicopathologic and molecular&#xD;
      information in Asian patients with MDS. To-date, there is paucity of data focusing on the&#xD;
      impact of molecular aberrations on prognosis and treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed cohort study aims to establish a registry of clinical and genomic registry of&#xD;
      MDS and secondary AML in Asian patients, which allows the establishment of the mutational&#xD;
      profile of patients and prognostic model for survival, as well as exploration of treatment&#xD;
      strategies and prediction for treatment response.&#xD;
