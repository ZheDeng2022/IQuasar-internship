      From this study, it is hoped to learn if and how the gut microbiome composition, gut&#xD;
      permeability and inflammation in patients with dementia are associated with each other.&#xD;
      Dysbiosis may lead to an increased gut permeability, bacterial translocation and inflammation&#xD;
      which may influence pathogenesis and progression of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel aspect of the study will be to understand the association between gut microbiome&#xD;
      composition, gut permeability and the presence of dementia. This will help to better&#xD;
      understand the pathogenesis of dementia and lead to the development of novel therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies. If this hypothesis holds true, the study will be the basis to develop new&#xD;
      treatment options for dementia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dementia is a disease that presents with deterioration in memory, thinking, behaviour and the&#xD;
      ability to perform everyday activities. Worldwide 47.5 million people are affected and&#xD;
      incidence of dementia is increasing. Dementia leads to disability and dependency among older&#xD;
      people worldwide and thereby has a huge physical, psychological, social and economic impact&#xD;
      on caregivers, families and society. Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of&#xD;
      dementia accounting for 60-70% of the cases; other forms include Lewy body dementia,&#xD;
      frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia and Parkinsons disease with dementia. In AD,&#xD;
      pathologic protein aggregates of amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated tangles of tau-protein&#xD;
      which deposit as neurofibrillary tangles are typical features. This leads to&#xD;
      neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by the innate immune system. The most important cells in&#xD;
      this process are microglia cells, which represent the resident macrophages of the brain.&#xD;
      Although microglia is able to remove extracellular amyloid beta, in later stages of the&#xD;
      disease cells remain in a dystrophic state and cannot exert their beneficial functions.&#xD;
      Microglia maturation and function is critically dependent on short-chain fatty acids produced&#xD;
      by the gut microbiome and therefore highlights the microbiome as a potential diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic target in dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of the commensal microbial population of the human body - especially the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiome - in various diseases is emerging due to the development of advanced analysis&#xD;
      techniques. Recently the concept of the gut brain-axis has been established. Several pathways&#xD;
      including the autonomic nervous system, the enteric nervous system, the neuroendocrine system&#xD;
      and the immune system allow a communication between gut and brain but may also be involved in&#xD;
      disease development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During ageing, the gut microbiome composition undergoes changes. A decrease in diversity, a&#xD;
      loss of beneficial taxa and an increase of facultative pathogens has been described. Diet and&#xD;
      the place of residence play an important role in the shaping of the microbiome. Aging is also&#xD;
      associated with inflammation - often termed as &quot;inflammaging&quot; associated with an increase in&#xD;
      gut permeability, mucosal inflammation and bacterial translocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the main risk factor for developing dementia, especially AD, is aging, it is very&#xD;
      likely that the gut-brain axis is critically involved in dementia development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies so far suggest that AD is associated with changes in the gut microbiome&#xD;
      composition with a decrease in beneficial, anti-inflammatory genera. Furthermore, genetic&#xD;
      alterations in amyloid genes can influence microbiome composition in mice, pointing towards a&#xD;
      vicious cycle in AD development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, so far no studies on the gut microbiome composition in patients with dementia have&#xD;
      been published. However, there is evidence that the composition of the microbiome in&#xD;
      subgingival plaques is altered in dementia and associated with cognitive function.&#xD;
