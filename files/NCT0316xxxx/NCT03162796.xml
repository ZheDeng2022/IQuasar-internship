  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of guselkumab in participants with active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) who had&#xD;
      inadequate response to standard therapies. It will evaluate the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      guselkumab in the reduction of signs and symptoms and the safety profile of guselkumab in the&#xD;
      treatment of PsA. The study will consists of 4 phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, a&#xD;
      blinded treatment phase of approximately 1 year (that is, 52 weeks), including a placebo&#xD;
      controlled period from Week 0 to Week 24 and double-blind active treatment period from Week&#xD;
      24 to Week 52, and a safety follow-up phase of 8 weeks after Week 52 (Week 52 to 60) and will&#xD;
      be 12 weeks from the last administration of study agent (at Week 48) to the final safety&#xD;
      follow-up visit. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, and biomarker evaluations&#xD;
      will be performed in the study at defined schedule.&#xD;

    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a questionnaire that assesses self-reported tiredness, weakness, and difficulty conducting usual activities due to fatigue. The subscale consists 13-item instrument to measure fatigue. Each of the 13 items has a set of five response categories: Not at all (=0), A little bit (=1), Somewhat (=2), Quite a bit (=3) and Very much (=4). A total FACIT-Fatigue subscale score was calculated as the sum of the 13 item scores (reserved scores [4 - score]) and ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue. Items were reverse scored when appropriate to provide a scale in which higher scores represent better functioning or less fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved &gt;= 20%, &gt;=50%, &gt;=70%, and &gt;=90% Improvement From Baseline in BASDAI Score at Weeks 24 and 52 Among Participants With Spondylitis and Peripheral Arthritis as Their Primary Arthritic Presentation of PsA</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) is a self-assessment tool that consists of 6 questions relating to the 5 major symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis: fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain, enthesitis, qualitative morning stiffness and quantitative morning stiffness. The first 5 items were scored on a 10 centimeter (cm) VAS ranging from 0=none to 10=very severe. Quantitative morning stiffness was scored on a 10cm VAS ranging from 0=0 hours to 10=2 or more hours. The 2 scores for qualitative and quantitative morning stiffness were averaged, and the total BASDAI score was the average of the 5 scores of each symptom, ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe). Higher scores indicate greater disease severity and an improvement of 50% from baseline is considered clinically meaningful. Only participants with spondylitis with peripheral arthritis as their primary arthritic presentation of PsA completed the BASDAI indicate the degree of their symptoms over the past week.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 24, 36, 44 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC). The SPARCC developed a measure for enthesitis in general spondyloarthritis which evaluates the presence or absence of pain by applying local pressure to the following entheses: supraspinatus insertion (left and right), medial epicondyle humerus (left and right), lateral epicondyle humerus (left and right), greater trochanter (left and right), quadriceps-to-patella (left and right), patellar-tibia (left and right), achilles tendon insertion (left and right), plantar fascia (left and right). Tenderness on examination was recorded as either present (1) or absent (0) for each of the 16 sites for an overall score range of 0-16. Higher scores indicate more severe enthesitis. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of enthesitis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 383 participants were enrolled. Among them, 381 participants received at least one dose of study drug (126 in placebo group, 127 in guselkumab 100 mg q8w group and 128 in guselkumab 100 mg q4w group). One participant was randomized to guselkumab 100 mg q8w but not treated.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>One participant was accidentally randomized before completion of screening assessments. Subsequently, this participant screen failed and was later re-screened and randomized using a new participant number.Therefore, this participant was counted twice in the number of participants enrolled, but only once in the number of participants randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI score assess functional status of participant. It is 20 question instrument that assess degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0=indicating no difficulty, to 3=indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Total HAQ score is average of the computed categories scores ranging from 0-3 where 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty. Lower scores are indicative of better functioning. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement of physical function.</description>

        <description>A psoriasis Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) response was defined as an IGA score of 0 (cleared) or 1 (minimal) and &gt;=2 grade reduction from baseline in the IGA psoriasis score. The IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the patient's psoriasis and lesions are graded for induration, erythema and scaling, each using a 5 point scale: 0 (no evidence), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), and 4 (severe). The IGA score of psoriasis was based upon the average of induration, erythema and scaling scores. The participant's psoriasis was assessed as cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4).</description>

        <description>The Disease Activity Index Score (DAS28) based on C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is an index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of arthritis.</description>

        <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The PCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. A positive change indicates improvement while a negative change indicates worsening of health status and quality of life.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Resolution of Enthesitis at Week 24 Among the Participants With Enthesitis at Baseline</title>
        <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI), a tool developed to assess enthesitis in participants with PsA and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of pain by applying local pressure to the following entheses: left and right lateral epicondyle humerus, left and right medial femoral condyle, and left and right achilles tendon insertion. The enthesitis index score is a total score of the 6 evaluated sites from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness). A LEI score of 0 at a post baseline visit indicates resolution of enthesitis when baseline LEI greater than (&gt;) 0.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Resolution of Enthesitis at Week 24 Among the Participants With Enthesitis at Baseline</title>
          <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI), a tool developed to assess enthesitis in participants with PsA and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of pain by applying local pressure to the following entheses: left and right lateral epicondyle humerus, left and right medial femoral condyle, and left and right achilles tendon insertion. The enthesitis index score is a total score of the 6 evaluated sites from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness). A LEI score of 0 at a post baseline visit indicates resolution of enthesitis when baseline LEI greater than (&gt;) 0.</description>

        <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The MCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. A positive change indicates improvement while a negative change indicates worsening of health status and quality of life.</description>

        <description>The presence and severity of dactylitis was assessed in both hands and feet using a scoring system from 0 to 3 (0-no dactylitis, 1-mild dactylitis, 2-moderate dactylitis, and 3-severe dactylitis) for each digit. The results were summed to produce a final score ranging from 0 to 60. Higher score indicates more severe dactylitis. Resolution of dactylitis was defined as a dactylitis score of 0 with the baseline dactylitis score &gt;0.</description>

          <description>The presence and severity of dactylitis was assessed in both hands and feet using a scoring system from 0 to 3 (0-no dactylitis, 1-mild dactylitis, 2-moderate dactylitis, and 3-severe dactylitis) for each digit. The results were summed to produce a final score ranging from 0 to 60. Higher score indicates more severe dactylitis. Resolution of dactylitis was defined as a dactylitis score of 0 with the baseline dactylitis score &gt;0.</description>
          <population>Analysis population is FAS1 among the participants with dactylitis at baseline. Participants who achieved resolution of dactylitis at Week 24 and did not meet any TF criteria before Week 24 were considered as responders. Participants who met 1 or more TF criteria or with missing data were considered as non-responders.</population>

        <title>ACR Component- Patient's Assessment of Physical Function as Assessed by HAQ-DI Scale Score at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</title>
        <description>Patient's assessment of physical function was measured by Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI). HAQ-DI score assess functional status of participant. It is 20 question instrument that assess degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0=indicating no difficulty, to 3=indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Total HAQ score is average of the computed categories scores ranging from 0-3 where 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty. Lower scores are indicative of better functioning. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement of physical function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI Score at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI score assess functional status of participant. It is 20 question instrument that assess degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0=indicating no difficulty, to 3=indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Total HAQ score is average of the computed categories scores ranging from 0-3 where 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty. Lower scores are indicative of better functioning. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement of physical function.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI Score at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</title>
          <description>HAQ-DI score assess functional status of participant. It is 20 question instrument that assess degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0=indicating no difficulty, to 3=indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Total HAQ score is average of the computed categories scores ranging from 0-3 where 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty. Lower scores are indicative of better functioning. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement of physical function.</description>
          <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Data after meeting one or more TF criteria were imputed as no change from baseline. Missing data were assumed to be MAR and imputed using MI.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a DAS28 (CRP) Response by Visit Over Time Through Week 24</title>
        <description>DAS28 based on CRP is an index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. DAS28 (CRP) response criteria was defined as follows: Good response: less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3.2 at visit and &gt;1.2 improvement; Moderate response: &gt;3.2 at visit and &gt;1.2 improvement or &lt;=5.1 at visit and &gt;0.6-1.2 improvement; No response: &lt;=0.6 improvement, or &gt;5.1 at visit and &lt;=1.2 improvement. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. A DAS28 (CRP) responder was defined as achieving a good or moderate DAS28 response at a specific visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a DAS28 (CRP) Remission by Visit Over Time Through Week 24</title>
        <description>DAS28 based on CRP is an index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. DAS 28 (CRP) remission was defined as DAS 28 (CRP) value &lt;2.6 at the analysis visit.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Participants who achieved DAS28 (CRP) remission at a specific timepoint and did not meet any TF criteria before, were considered as responders at that time point. Participants who met 1 or more TF criteria before or with missing data at that time point were considered as non-responders.</population>

        <description>The modified PsARC response was defined as improvement in at least 2 of the four criteria: &gt;=30% decrease in swollen joint count, &gt;=30% decrease in tender joint count, &gt;=20% improvement in patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (arthritis) using VAS (0-100 mm, 0=excellent and 100= poor), &gt;=20% improvement in physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity using VAS (VAS: 0-100 mm, 0=no arthritis activity and 100=extremely active arthritis), and at least one of the 2 joint criteria with no deterioration in the other criteria.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Participants who achieved a modified PsARC response at a specific time point and did not meet any TF criteria before, were considered as responders at that time point. Participants who met 1 or more TF criteria before or with missing data at that time point were considered as non-responders.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Resolution of Enthesitis at Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24 Among the Participants With Enthesitis at Baseline</title>
        <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the LEI, a tool developed to assess enthesitis in participants with PsA and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of pain by applying local pressure to the following entheses: left and right lateral epicondyle humerus, left and right medial femoral condyle, and left and right achilles tendon insertion. The enthesitis index score is a total score of the 6 evaluated sites from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness). A LEI score of 0 at a post baseline visit indicates resolution of enthesitis when baseline LEI&gt;0.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Resolution of Dactylitis by Visit Over Time Through Week 24 Among the Participants With Dactylitis at Baseline</title>
        <description>The presence and severity of dactylitis was assessed in both hands and feet using a scoring system from 0 to 3 (0-no dactylitis, 1-mild dactylitis, 2-moderate dactylitis, and 3-severe dactylitis) for each digit. The results were summed to produce a final score ranging from 0 to 60. Higher score indicates more severe dactylitis. Resolution of dactylitis was defined as a dactylitis score of 0 with the baseline dactylitis score &gt;0.</description>

Participants who achieved dactylitis resolution at a specific timepoint and did not meet any TF criteria before, were considered as responders at that time point. Participants who met 1 or more TF criteria before or with missing data at that time point were considered as non-responders.</population>

        <description>PASDAS (score range of 0 to 10, where higher score indicated more severe disease) is a compositive score of overall disease activity combining Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (arthritis and psoriasis, using VAS [0-100 mm, 0=excellent and 100= poor), Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (using VAS [0-100 mm, 0=no arthritis activity and 100=extremely active arthritis]), swollen joint count (0-66 joints), tender joint count (0-68 joints), CRP (mg/L), enthesitis based on LEI (0-6), tender dactylitis count (scoring each digit from 0-3 and recoding to 0-1, where any score &gt; 0 equaled 1), and the PCS score of the SF-36 health survey. The cutoffs for disease activity were 3.2 (low) to 5.4 (high). Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of overall disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) Score at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</title>
        <description>DAPSA assessed the joint domain of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and was derived from the sum of the following components: tender joint count (0-68), swollen joint count (0-66), CRP level (mg/dL, value &lt;lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] is considered equal to half of the value of LLOQ for numerical calculations), patient assessment of pain (0-10 centimeter [cm] VAS, 0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain), and patient's global assessment of disease activity on arthritis (0 to 10 cm VAS, 0=excellent and 10=poor). A higher score indicates more active disease activity. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of PsA disease activity. The assessment does not have a score range with an upper or lower bound.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved &gt;= 20%, &gt;=50%, &gt;=70%, and &gt;=90% Improvement From Baseline in BASDAI Score Through Week 24 Among the Participants With Spondylitis and Peripheral Arthritis and BASDAI Score &gt;0 at Baseline</title>
        <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) is a self-assessment tool that consists of 6 questions relating to the 5 major symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis: fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain, enthesitis, qualitative morning stiffness and quantitative morning stiffness. The first 5 items were scored on a 10 centimeter (cm) VAS ranging from 0=none to 10=very severe. Quantitative morning stiffness was scored on a 10cm VAS ranging from 0=0 hours to 10=2 or more hours. The 2 scores for qualitative and quantitative morning stiffness were averaged, and the total BASDAI score was the average of the 5 scores of each symptom, ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe). Higher scores indicate greater disease severity and an improvement of 50% from baseline is considered clinically meaningful. Only participants with spondylitis with peripheral arthritis as their primary arthritic presentation of PsA completed the BASDAI indicate the degree of their symptoms over the past week.</description>

        <description>PASDAS (score range of 0 to 10, where higher score indicated more severe disease) is a compositive score of overall disease activity combining Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (arthritis and psoriasis, using VAS [0-100 mm, 0=excellent and 100= poor), Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (using VAS [0-100 mm, 0=no arthritis activity and 100=extremely active arthritis]), swollen joint count (0-66 joints), tender joint count (0-68 joints), CRP (mg/L), enthesitis based on LEI (0-6), tender dactylitis count (scoring each digit from 0-3 and recoding to 0-1, where any score &gt; 0 equaled 1), and the PCS score of the SF-36 health survey. The cutoffs for disease activity were 3.2 (low) to 5.4 (high).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Very Low Disease Activity (VLDA) by Visit Over Time Through Week 24</title>
        <description>A measurement that defines a satisfactory state of disease activity that includes the 5 domains of PsA (joint symptoms, skin psoriasis, patient's perspective of pain and disease activity, physical function, and enthesitis). A participant was considered as having achieved VLDA at a visit if the participant fulfilled all 7 criteria (tender joint count &lt;=1; swollen joint count &lt;=1; PASI &lt;=1; patient pain VAS score of &lt;=15; patient global disease activity VAS [arthritis and psoriasis] score of &lt;=20; Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score &lt;=0.5; and tender entheseal points &lt;=1) at that visit.</description>

        <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Participants who achieved VLDA response at a specific timepoint and did not meet any TF criteria before, were considered as responders at that time point. Participants who met 1 or more TF criteria before or with missing data at that time point were considered as non-responders.</population>

        <description>PASI is a tool to assess and grade severity of psoriasis and response to therapy. In PASI, body is divided into 4 areas: head, trunk, upper extremities, lower extremities. Each area was assessed separately for percentage of area involved and translated to numeric score ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90 to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, each rated on scale of 0 to 4 that is none to maximum severtiy. PASI numeric score range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. A PASI 75 response: &gt;=75% improvement in PASI score from baseline.</description>

        <description>In PASI, each area (head, trunk, upper and lower extremities) was assessed for % of area involved and translated to numeric score from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90-100% involvement) and for erythema, induration, and scaling, each rated on scale of 0 to 4 that is none to maximum severtiy. PASI produces numeric score from 0 to 72. Higher scores=more severe disease. PASI 75: &gt;=75% improvement in PASI score from baseline. ACR 20: &gt;=20% improvement in swollen joint count (SJC) (66 joints) + tender joint count (TJC) (68 joints) and &gt;=20% improvement in 3 of 5: patient's assessment of pain (VAS; 0-100 mm, 0=no pain to 100=worst possible pain), PtGA of disease activity (VAS; 0-100 mm, 0=excellent to 100=poor), PGA of disease activity (VAS; 0-100 mm, 0=no arthritis to 100=extremely active arthritis), patient's assessment of physical function (HAQ-DI -20-question instrument; range- 0=no difficulty to 3=inability to perform task) and CRP.</description>

        <description>PASI is a tool to assess and grade severity of psoriasis and response to therapy. In PASI, body is divided into 4 areas: head, trunk, upper extremities, lower extremities. Each area was assessed separately for percentage of area involved and translated to numeric score ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90 to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, each rated on scale of 0 to 4 that is none to maximum severtiy. PASI numeric score range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement of psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) at Weeks 8, 16 and 24</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The PCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. A positive change indicates improvement while a negative change indicates worsening of health status and quality of life.</description>

        <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Data after meeting one or more TF criteria were imputed as no change from baseline. Missing data were assumed to be MAR and imputed using MI.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved &gt;=5-point Improvement From Baseline in SF-36 MCS Score by Visit Over Time Through Week 24</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores.

          <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The MCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Score at Weeks 8, 16, and 24</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a questionnaire that assesses self-reported tiredness, weakness, and difficulty conducting usual activities due to fatigue. The subscale consists 13-item instrument to measure fatigue. Each of the 13 items has a set of five response categories: Not at all (=0), A little bit (=1), Somewhat (=2), Quite a bit (=3) and Very much (=4). A total FACIT-Fatigue subscale score was calculated as the sum of the 13 item scores (reserved scores [4 - score]) and ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue. Positive changes from baseline indicate improvement of fatigue. Items were reverse scored when appropriate to provide a scale in which higher scores represent better functioning or less fatigue.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 Scores at Weeks 8, 16 and 24</title>
        <description>PROMIS-29 contains 4 items for each of seven PROMIS domains (Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Pain Interference, Physical Function, Sleep Disturbance, and Satisfaction-Social Role and Activity. PROMIS-29 also includes an additional pain intensity 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS). The raw score of each domain is converted into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10 for the general population in the US (T-Score).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 8, 16 and 24</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Data after meeting one or more TF criteria were imputed as no change from baseline. Missing data were assumed to be MAR. The LS mean is based on MMRM model that included data from all visits for all participants included in the model.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in FACIT-Fatigue Score at Week 24 by ACR 20 Response at Week 24</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a questionnaire that assesses self-reported tiredness, weakness, and difficulty conducting usual activities due to fatigue. The subscale consists 13-item instrument to measure fatigue. Each of the 13 items has a set of five response categories: Not at all (=0), A little bit (=1), Somewhat (=2), Quite a bit (=3) and Very much (=4). A total FACIT-Fatigue subscale score was calculated as the sum of the 13 item scores (reserved scores [4 - score]) and ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue. Positive changes from baseline indicate improvement of fatigue. Items were reverse scored when appropriate to provide a scale in which higher scores represent better functioning or less fatigue.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Improvement of &gt;=3 Points From Baseline in PROMIS-29 Domain Scores at Weeks 8, 16, and 24</title>
        <description>PROMIS-29 contains 4 items for each of seven PROMIS domains (Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Pain Interference, Physical Function, Sleep Disturbance, and Satisfaction-Social Role and Activity. PROMIS-29 also includes an additional pain intensity 0-10 NRS. The raw score of each domain is converted into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a SD of 10 for the general population in the US (T-Score).</description>

Participants who achieved &gt;=3-point improvement from baseline in PROMIS-29 domain scores at a specific timepoint and did not meet any TF criteria before, considered as responders at that time point. Participants who met 1 or more TF criteria before or with missing data at that time point, considered as non-responders.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Improvement of &gt;=5 Points From Baseline in PROMIS-29 Domain Scores at Weeks 8, 16, and 24</title>
        <description>PROMIS-29 contains 4 items for each of seven PROMIS domains (Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Pain Interference, Physical Function, Sleep Disturbance, and Satisfaction-Social Role and Activity. PROMIS-29 also includes an additional pain intensity 0-10 NRS. The raw score of each domain is converted into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a SD of 10 for the general population in the US (T-Score).</description>

        <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Participants who achieved &gt;=5-point improvement from baseline in PROMIS-29 domain scores at a specific timepoint and did not meet any TF criteria before, considered as responders at that time point. Participants who met 1 or more TF criteria before or with missing data at that time point, considered as non-responders.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI Score at Weeks 24, 28, 36, 44 and 52</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI score assess functional status of participant. It is 20 question instrument that assess degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0=indicating no difficulty, to 3=indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Total HAQ score is average of the computed categories scores ranging from 0-3 where 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty. Lower scores are indicative of better functioning. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement of physical function.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Clinically Meaningful Improvement (&gt;=0.35 Improvement From Baseline) in HAQ-DI Score at Weeks 24, 28, 36, 44 and 52 Among Participants With HAQ-DI Score &gt;=0.35 at Baseline</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI score assess functional status of participant. It is 20 question instrument that assess degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0=indicating no difficulty, to 3=indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Total HAQ score is average of the computed categories scores ranging from 0-3 where 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty. Lower scores are indicative of better functioning and a decrease of 0.35 from baseline in HAQ-DI score indicates a meaningful improvement.</description>

        <description>DAS28 based on CRP is an index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of arthritis.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a DAS28 (CRP) Response at Weeks 24, 28, 36, 44 and 52</title>
        <description>DAS28 based on CRP is an index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. DAS28 (CRP) response criteria was defined as follows: Good response: &lt;=3.2 at visit and &gt;1.2 improvement; Moderate response: &gt;3.2 at visit and &gt;1.2 improvement or &lt;=5.1 at visit and &gt;0.6-1.2 improvement; No response: &lt;=0.6 improvement, or &gt;5.1 at visit and &lt;=1.2 improvement. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. A DAS28 (CRP) responder was defined as achieving a good or moderate DAS28 response at a specific visit.</description>

          <description>DAS28 based on CRP is an index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. DAS28 (CRP) remission was defined as DAS28 (CRP) value &lt;2.6 at the analysis visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Maintained a HAQ-DI Response (&gt;=0.35 Improvement From Baseline in HAQ-DI Score) at Week 52 Among Participants Who Achieved a HAQ-DI Response at Week 24</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI score assess functional status of participant. It is 20 question instrument that assess degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0=indicating no difficulty, to 3=indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Total HAQ score is average of the computed categories scores ranging from 0-3 where 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty. Lower scores are indicative of better functioning and a decrease of 0.35 from baseline in HAQ-DI score indicates a meaningful improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) Score at Weeks 24, 28, 36, 44 and 52</title>
        <description>DAPSA assessed the joint domain of PsA and was derived from the sum of the following components: tender joint count (0-68), swollen joint count (0-66), CRP level (mg/dL), patient assessment of pain (0-10cm VAS, 0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain), and patient's global assessment of disease activity on arthritis (0 to 10cm VAS, 0=excellent and 10=poor). A higher score indicates more active disease activity. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of PsA disease activity. The assessment does not have a score range with an upper or lower bound.</description>

        <description>In PASI, each area (head, trunk, upper and lower extremities) was assessed separately for % of area involved and translated to numeric score ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, each rated on scale of 0 to 4. PASI produces numeric score range from 0 to 72. Higher scores=more severe disease. PASI75 response: &gt;=75% improvement in PASI score from baseline. Modified PsARC response: improvement in at least 2 of 4 criteria: &gt;=30% decrease in SJC and TJC, &gt;=20% improvement in PtGA of Disease Activity (arthritis) on VAS (0-100 mm, 0=excellent and 100=poor), &gt;=20% improvement in PGA of Disease Activity on VAS (VAS: 0-100 mm, 0=no arthritis and 100=extremely active arthritis), and at least 1 of 2 joint criteria with no deterioration in other criteria.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Both PASI 75 and ACR 20 Responses at Weeks 24 and 52 Among Participants With &gt;=3% BSA Psoriatic Involvement and an IGA Score of &gt;=2 at Baseline</title>
        <description>In PASI, each area (head, trunk, upper and lower extremities) was assessed for % of area involved and translated to numeric score from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90-100% involvement) and for erythema, induration, and scaling, each rated on scale of 0 to 4. PASI produces numeric score from 0 to 72. Higher scores=more severe disease. PASI 75: &gt;=75% improvement in PASI score from baseline. ACR 20: &gt;=20% improvement in SJC (66 joints)+TJC (68 joints) and &gt;=20% improvement in 3 of 5: patient's assessment of pain (VAS; 0-100 mm, 0=no pain to 100=worst possible pain), PtGA of disease activity (VAS; 0-100 mm, 0=excellent to 100=poor), PGA of disease activity (VAS; 0-100 mm, 0=no arthritis to 100=extremely active arthritis), patient's assessment of physical function (HAQ-DI -20-question instrument; range- 0=no difficulty to 3=inability to perform task) and CRP.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PASI Score at Weeks 24 and 52 Among Participants With &gt;=3% BSA Psoriatic Involvement and an IGA Score of &gt;=2 at Baseline</title>
        <description>PASI is a tool to assess and grade severity of psoriasis and response to therapy. In PASI, body is divided into 4 areas: head, trunk, upper extremities, lower extremities. Each area was assessed separately for percentage of area involved and translated to numeric score ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90 to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, each rated on scale of 0 to 4 that is none to maximum severity. PASI numeric score range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved PASI 90 Response at Weeks 24 and 52 Among Participants With &gt;=3% BSA Psoriatic Involvement and an IGA Score of &gt;=2 at Baseline</title>
        <description>PASI is a tool to assess and grade severity of psoriasis and response to therapy. In PASI, body is divided into 4 areas: head, trunk, upper extremities, lower extremities. Each area was assessed separately for percentage of area involved and translated to numeric score ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90 to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, each rated on scale of 0 to 4 that is none to maximum severity. PASI numeric score range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. PASI 90 response: &gt;=90% improvement in PASI score from baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved &gt;=5 Point Improvement From Baseline in SF-36 PCS Score at Weeks 24, 36 and 52</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The PCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. Higher score indicates better outcome, with an increase of 5 points considered to be clinically meaningful.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved &gt;=5 Point Improvement From Baseline in SF-36 MCS Score at Weeks 24, 36 and 52</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The MCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. Higher score indicates better outcome, with an increase of 5 points considered to be clinically meaningful.</description>

        <description>PASDAS (score range of 0 to 10, where higher score indicated more severe disease) is a compositive score of overall disease activity combining Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (arthritis and psoriasis, using VAS [0-100 mm, 0=excellent and 100= poor), Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (using VAS [0-100 mm, 0=no arthritis activity and 100=extremely active arthritis]), swollen joint count (0-66 joints), tender joint count (0-68 joints), CRP (mg/L), enthesitis based on LEI (0-6), tender dactylitis count (scoring each digit from 0-3 and recoding to 0-1, where any score &gt; 0 equaled 1), and the PCS score of the SF-36 health survey. The cutoffs for disease activity were 3.2 (low) to 5.4 (high). Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of overall disease activity.</description>

          <population>Analysis population is FAS2 among participants who achieved ACR 70 response at Week 24. The outcome measure was planned to assess the maintenance of guselkumab effect only through Week 52, hence the data in this outcome measure is reported for guselkumab 100 mg q8w and guselkumab 100 mg q4w arms only and not for placebo arm.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved &gt;= 20%, &gt;=50%, &gt;=70%, and &gt;=90% Improvement From Baseline in BASDAI Score at Weeks 24 and 52 Among Participants With Spondylitis and Peripheral Arthritis as Their Primary Arthritic Presentation of PsA</title>
        <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) is a self-assessment tool that consists of 6 questions relating to the 5 major symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis: fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain, enthesitis, qualitative morning stiffness and quantitative morning stiffness. The first 5 items were scored on a 10 centimeter (cm) VAS ranging from 0=none to 10=very severe. Quantitative morning stiffness was scored on a 10cm VAS ranging from 0=0 hours to 10=2 or more hours. The 2 scores for qualitative and quantitative morning stiffness were averaged, and the total BASDAI score was the average of the 5 scores of each symptom, ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe). Higher scores indicate greater disease severity and an improvement of 50% from baseline is considered clinically meaningful. Only participants with spondylitis with peripheral arthritis as their primary arthritic presentation of PsA completed the BASDAI indicate the degree of their symptoms over the past week.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Resolution of Enthesitis at Weeks 24, 36, 44 and 52 Among the Participants With Enthesitis at Baseline</title>
        <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the LEI, a tool developed to assess enthesitis in participants with PsA and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of pain by applying local pressure to the following entheses: left and right lateral epicondyle humerus, left and right medial femoral condyle, and left and right achilles tendon insertion. The enthesitis index score is a total score of the 6 evaluated sites from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness). A LEI score of 0 at a post baseline visit indicates resolution of enthesitis when baseline LEI&gt;0.</description>

          <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the LEI, a tool developed to assess enthesitis in participants with PsA and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of pain by applying local pressure to the following entheses: left and right lateral epicondyle humerus, left and right medial femoral condyle, and left and right achilles tendon insertion. The enthesitis index score is a total score of the 6 evaluated sites from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness). A LEI score of 0 at a post baseline visit indicates resolution of enthesitis when baseline LEI&gt;0.</description>
          <population>Analysis population is FAS2 among the participants with enthesitis (LEI) at baseline who achieved resolution of enthesitis at Week 24. Here, N (number of participants analyzed) signifies the number of participants analyzed for this outcome measure and n (number analyzed) signifies the number of participants analyzed at specified timepoints.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Enthesitis Score (Based on SPARCC) at Weeks 24, 36, 44 and 52 Among the Participants With Enthesitis at Baseline</title>
        <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC). The SPARCC developed a measure for enthesitis in general spondyloarthritis which evaluates the presence or absence of pain by applying local pressure to the following entheses: supraspinatus insertion (left and right), medial epicondyle humerus (left and right), lateral epicondyle humerus (left and right), greater trochanter (left and right), quadriceps-to-patella (left and right), patellar-tibia (left and right), achilles tendon insertion (left and right), plantar fascia (left and right). Tenderness on examination was recorded as either present (1) or absent (0) for each of the 16 sites for an overall score range of 0-16. Higher scores indicate more severe enthesitis. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of enthesitis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Enthesitis Score (Based on LEI) at Weeks 24, 36, 44 and 52 Among the Participants With Enthesitis at Baseline</title>
        <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the LEI, a tool developed to assess enthesitis in participants with PsA and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of pain by applying local pressure to the following entheses: left and right lateral epicondyle humerus, left and right medial femoral condyle, and left and right achilles tendon insertion. The enthesitis index score is a total score of the 6 evaluated sites from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness). Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of enthesitis.</description>

        <description>A psoriasis IGA response was defined as an IGA score of 0 (cleared) or 1 (minimal) and &gt;= 2 grade reduction from baseline in the IGA psoriasis score. The IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the patient's psoriasis and lesions are graded for induration, erythema and scaling, each using a 5 point scale: 0 (no evidence), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), and 4 (severe). The IGA score of psoriasis was based upon the average of induration, erythema and scaling scores. The participant's psoriasis was assessed as cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score at Weeks 24, 36 and 52</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The PCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. A positive change indicates improvement while a negative change indicates worsening of health status and quality of life.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) Score at Weeks 24, 36 and 52</title>
          <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The MCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. A positive change indicates improvement while a negative change indicates worsening of health status and quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Score at Weeks 24, 36 and 52</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a questionnaire that assesses self-reported tiredness, weakness, and difficulty conducting usual activities due to fatigue. The subscale consists 13-item instrument to measure fatigue. Each of the 13 items has a set of five response categories: Not at all (=0), A little bit (=1), Somewhat (=2), Quite a bit (=3) and Very much (=4). A total FACIT-Fatigue subscale score was calculated as the sum of the 13 item scores (reserved scores [4 - score]) and ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue. Positive changes from baseline indicate improvement of fatigue. Items were reverse scored when appropriate to provide a scale in which higher scores represent better functioning or less fatigue.</description>
