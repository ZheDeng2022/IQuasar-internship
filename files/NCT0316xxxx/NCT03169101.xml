      This study tests whether withdrawal-related cognitive deficits increase smoking relapse among&#xD;
      HIV-infected (HIV+) vs. HIV-uninfected smokers (HIV-). Adult smokers (N=300; 150 HIV+, 150&#xD;
      HIV-) will complete 2 sessions to assess cognition (24h abstinence vs. smoking-as-usual;&#xD;
      order counterbalanced; weeks 0-2). Subjects will then receive smoking cessation counseling&#xD;
      and open label transdermal nicotine (weeks 3-12). Outcomes are: 1) cognition; and 2)&#xD;
      abstinence rates at the end-of-treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical advances in the treatment of HIV/AIDS have improved the life expectancy of&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals. Unfortunately, HIV-infected individuals are three times more likely&#xD;
      to use tobacco than those in the general population, but little is known about the mechanisms&#xD;
      that underlie these high smoking rates. This will be the first study to test whether the&#xD;
      neurocognitive impairments associated with HIV-1 infection may be exacerbated during nicotine&#xD;
      withdrawal and increase the probability of smoking relapse among HIV-infected smokers (HIV+),&#xD;
      compared to HIV-uninfected smokers (HIV-). To this end, adult treatment-seeking smokers&#xD;
      (N=300; 150 HIV+ and 150 HIV-) will complete this 12-week study, which is divided into two&#xD;
      phases: a pre-quit laboratory phase (weeks 0-2) and a treatment phase (weeks 3-12). Subjects&#xD;
      will complete two laboratory sessions during the pre-quit phase: once following 24 hours of&#xD;
      mandatory smoking abstinence and once while smoking-as-usual (order counterbalanced). A&#xD;
      comprehensive cognitive task battery assessing memory, attention, and executive function will&#xD;
      be administered during each laboratory session. During the treatment phase, all subjects will&#xD;
      receive standard smoking cessation treatment, including counseling (weeks 3-8) and open-label&#xD;
      transdermal nicotine (TN) patches (weeks 4-12). The primary outcomes are: 1) cognitive&#xD;
      performance following 24-hours smoking abstinence (vs. smoking-as-usual) during the pre-quit&#xD;
      phase; and 2) 7-day point-prevalence, biochemically-confirmed abstinence rates at the&#xD;
      end-of-treatment (EOT) for the treatment phase.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Current untreated and unstable diagnosis of substance dependence (eligible if past use&#xD;
