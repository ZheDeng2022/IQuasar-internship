      This study will investigate the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program in improving sleep&#xD;
      quality, emotional distress, circadian rhythms, and quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      esophageal cancer in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The quality of life in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at&#xD;
           3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and 36th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The quality of sleep in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at&#xD;
           3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and 36th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The emotional distress in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group&#xD;
           at 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and 36th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The circadian rhythms in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group&#xD;
           at 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and 36th month.&#xD;

    <description>The rehabilitation program was composed of two parts: an exercise program and a diet-teaching program. The exercise program was a 12-week home-based program that comprised moderate-intensity brisk walking for 40 min per session, with 3 sessions per week; in addition, weekly exercise counseling was provided through telephone. The diet teaching program was provided to the patients by using a diet booklet at baseline (same timing as the exercise program), and its contents were used to instruct the patients regarding dietary principles to be followed.</description>

    <description>A 12-week regimen of home-based walking exercises, comprising walking at a moderate intensity for 40 min, three times a week, was administered along with weekly exercise counseling. After collecting pretrial measurements, we explained the participants how to perform the exercises, according to an instruction manual for the exercise regimen. The detailed instructions, provided at the hospital clinics, included the determination of activity intensity, demonstration of pulse measurement, criteria for scores of 6-20 on the Borg's rating of perceived exertion (RPE), prevention of exercise-related injuries, and conditions necessitating termination of an exercise session. Participants were instructed that the exercises would be effective only if they reached 60%-80% of the target heart rate, as determined by the Karvonen method, and 13-15 on the RPE.&#xD;

For instance, we discussed whether participants' exercise fulfilled the prescribed intensity, duration, or frequency and whether the participants experienced any adverse effects.</description>
