    <textblock>
      This phase IV clinical study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the&#xD;
      recombinant Hepatitis E vaccine (Hecolin®), manufactured by Xiamen Innovax Biotech CO., LTD.,&#xD;
      in healthy adults (over 18 years) with accelerated vaccination schedule. The study volunteers&#xD;
      will receive the 3 doses of Hecolin® administered intramuscularly according to a 0-7-21 days&#xD;
      schedule or a 0-1-6 month schedule.&#xD;
