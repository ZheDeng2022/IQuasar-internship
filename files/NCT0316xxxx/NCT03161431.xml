  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancers attract myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that prevent our own immune&#xD;
      responses from destroying the cancer. This study will be the first study to begin to&#xD;
      determine if the newly discovered drug SX-682 can block cancers from attracting MDSCs. This&#xD;
      first study will enroll participants with melanoma, as melanoma cancer has been shown to be&#xD;
      able to attract MDSCs. The study will begin to determine if SX-682 is a safe and effective&#xD;
      treatment of melanoma. It is thought that SX-682 will block MDSCs from going to the cancer,&#xD;
      and thus will allow a patient's own immune system to attack the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first participants enrolled in the study will receive for 21 days SX-682 as monotherapy.&#xD;
      After 21 days participants will receive pembrolizumab therapy (an approved immunotherapy for&#xD;
      melanoma) and will remain in the study for evaluations for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After these participants complete the monotherapy stage, the next participants will receive&#xD;
      SX-682 and pembrolizumab together as combination therapy. These participants will receive the&#xD;
      combination therapy and be evaluated in the study for approximately 2 years.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the safety profile of SX-682 alone and in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab in subjects with metastatic melanoma, including the maximum dose that can&#xD;
      be administered until adverse effects prevent further dose increases, and the dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of SX-682 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab on the basis of the objective response rate, the duration of response, and the&#xD;
      rate of progression; and 2) characterize the SX-682 single-dose and multidose PK profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives are to: 1) assess overall survival (OS); and 2) explore potential&#xD;
      biomarkers associated with pharmacodynamic and clinical response to SX-682 alone and combined&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab, where the biomarker measures include, but are not limited to, tumor&#xD;
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), Tregs and CD69/CD8 T cells, and in the circulation,&#xD;
      T- and B-cell subpopulations, neutrophils, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tregs,&#xD;
      the CD4:CD8 ratio, chemokines, cytokines, and LDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation with expansion study of&#xD;
      twice-daily SX-682 in subjects with metastatic melanoma treated concurrently with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (Combination Stage) following a 21 day dose-escalation safety evaluation of&#xD;
      SX-682 monotherapy (Monotherapy Stage). SX-682 is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of the&#xD;
      CXCR1/2 chemokine receptors that are believed involved in MDSC-recruitment to tumor and other&#xD;
      pro-tumoral mechanisms. Dosing of SX-682 in the Combination Stage is conditioned on ongoing&#xD;
      concurrent treatment with pembrolizumab, and a subject who discontinues pembrolizumab may not&#xD;
      receive further doses of SX-682.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Sequential Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>In this sequential model initially participant groups will enroll to receive SX-682 monotherapy for 21 days in a dose escalation phase. A 3 + 3 participant design will be used to determine the safe dose. After 21 days, at the specified dose of SX-682 monotherapy, subjects are administered combination therapy consisting of SX-682 at the same dose as used in monotherapy and standard pembrolizumab therapy. Again, a 3 + 3 participant design will be used to determine the safe dose of SX-682 in combination therapy with pembrolizumab. The next higher dose level will be enrolled only after subjects have received the current dose level safely for at least 6 weeks.&#xD;
Once the safe dose level of SX-682 in combination with pembrolizumab is determined, then participants will be enrolled at the highest safe dose level of SX-682, in combination with pembrolizumab, in an expansion phase.</intervention_model_description>
