  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of a decision support tool, the&#xD;
      Patient Medication Profile(TM), developed by Sano Informed Prescribing on medication&#xD;
      reconciliation and identification of drug-related problems in patients with serious mental&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lack of adherence to medications is an identifiable and growing problem in the United States&#xD;
      and can result in disease progression, disease complications, treatment failure, a lower&#xD;
      quality of life, and increased morbidity and mortality. Medication-related problems and&#xD;
      medication nonadherence have been estimated to cost $177 billion annually in total direct and&#xD;
      indirect U.S. health care costs. Moreover, medication adherence rates are poor for&#xD;
      individuals diagnosed with chronic conditions such as diabetes, depression, and&#xD;
      schizophrenia, which require long-term therapy. Recent publications have estimated that&#xD;
      nearly 50% of patients in the U.S. being treated for chronic conditions are non-adherent to&#xD;
      their medication regimens. Although increased medication adherence may lead to increased&#xD;
      spending on drug therapy, it is associated with greatly reduced total health care costs and&#xD;
      usage, and better patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons diagnosed with serious mental illness (SMI) such as schizophrenia and bipolar&#xD;
      disorder are at higher risk than the general population for medication nonadherence,&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality, and medical co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, obesity, nicotine dependence, and coronary heart disease. Poor adherence to&#xD;
      complex medication regimens, decreased access to care, and uncoordinated care between&#xD;
      psychiatry and medical care teams, have been identified as key contributors to the&#xD;
      disparities experienced by this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The United States healthcare system is complex and healthcare is fragmented, particularly for&#xD;
      those with serious mental illness who are often prescribed multiple medications from numerous&#xD;
      providers. One unifying piece of information that is of critical importance for optimizing&#xD;
      patient care is the patient medication list. Unfortunately, appropriate medication&#xD;
      reconciliation to obtain the correct medication list and information about medication&#xD;
      adherence is a complex and imperfect process. Using patient pharmacy records, electronic&#xD;
      health record (EHR), and patient interviews, discrepancies have been found with over one&#xD;
      third of patients upon hospital admission. Therefore, it can be expected that most&#xD;
      polypharmacy patients (defined as taking five or more medications) have errors in their&#xD;
      medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National and world health associations have identified several opportunities for health&#xD;
      professionals to provide services that aim to increase medication adherence and decrease&#xD;
      medication related problems. Several of the recommendations emphasize the use of coordinated&#xD;
      multidisciplinary efforts to provide patients with the most access to care and the highest&#xD;
      quality education about their medications. Pharmacists are among the most accessible health&#xD;
      care professionals and have specialized training to identify, prevent, and resolve&#xD;
      drug-related problems (DRPs). As medication experts, pharmacists are important members of the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team and are uniquely positioned to impact medication-related health&#xD;
      outcomes through accurate medication reconciliation, comprehensive mediation reviews (CMR),&#xD;
      and interventions to improve medication safety and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An objective measure of what medications patients are actually taking would enable healthcare&#xD;
      teams to better identify and tailor interventions to each specific patient situation. Using a&#xD;
      novel therapeutic drug monitoring assay and empirical clinical decision support tool, Sano&#xD;
      has shown that errors in patient medication lists are prevalent and poorly reflect patient&#xD;
      adherence to the intended medication regimen and actual medication exposure. For example, in&#xD;
      a cohort of psychiatry patients, only 37% were fully adherent to all medications in their&#xD;
      treatment regimen and roughly one in five medications detected was not in the medical record.&#xD;
      We anticipate that when medication reconciliation is performed by a pharmacist using Sano's&#xD;
      clinical decision support tool, medication adherence will improve and more drug therapy&#xD;
      problems will be identified and resolved. As a result, we expect to see an improvement in&#xD;
      patient outcomes and a reduction in healthcare spending (i.e. post-hospitalization unplanned&#xD;
      healthcare utilization).&#xD;
