      The PAL intervention uses a new software tool delivered on tablets to facilitate 5As-based&#xD;
      weight management counseling with a health coach and the VA PACT healthcare team to promote&#xD;
      goal-setting, behavior change, and weight loss in the primary care (PC) setting. The PAL&#xD;
      intervention also includes 10-12 health-coaching calls to the patient over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of a cluster-randomized controlled study, the investigators will randomize 17 PACT&#xD;
      teams at the Brooklyn VA to receive either the PAL Intervention or an Enhanced Usual Care&#xD;
      control. The primary aim of the study is to explore differences in feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and intermediate, behavioral, and weight loss outcomes at 6 and 12 months of&#xD;
      520 patients recruited from the randomized PACTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Explore the feasibility and impact of this intervention on intermediate, behavioral, and&#xD;
      weight loss outcomes at 6 and 12 months post-intervention when compared to enhanced usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans shoulder a disproportionate burden of obesity and its co-morbidities, including&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Modest weight loss in obese patients through diet&#xD;
      and exercise improves health and prevents chronic disease, but primary care providers (PCPs)&#xD;
      often fail to adequately counsel patients about their weight due to lack of time and&#xD;
      training. Thus, tools and brief interventions are needed to support providers' behavior&#xD;
      change counseling. The VA currently offers the MOVE! program to treat overweight and obese&#xD;
      patients, but only 9% of eligible patients attend. At the same time, Veterans on average see&#xD;
      their PCPs 3.6 times per year, which supports the importance of developing primary care&#xD;
      (PC)-based interventions. The United States Preventive Services Task force (USPSTF)&#xD;
      recommends the use of the 5As framework (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, Arrange) for&#xD;
      counseling patients about weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interactive behavior change technologies utilizing expert system software programs are an&#xD;
      innovative way to facilitate 5As counseling to promote behavior change in primary care. These&#xD;
      programs perform computerized risk, lifestyle, and theory- based, behavioral assessment to&#xD;
      provide computer-generated, tailored advice to patients. They also can provide information to&#xD;
      healthcare teams. The MOVE!11 software is an expert system program for VA patients referred&#xD;
      to MOVE!, but is not currently used in primary care by Patient-Aligned Care Teams (PACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborative goal setting can be used to achieve behavior change in this intervention. This&#xD;
      construct, a critical component of several behavior change theories and models and&#xD;
      corresponding to &quot;agree&quot; in the 5As model, has been widely recommended for health promotion&#xD;
      in primary care. The investigators' formative work (MIRB #01333) using key informant&#xD;
      interviews with PACT teamlets and MOVE! staff and focus groups with Veterans demonstrated&#xD;
      that goal setting is feasible and acceptable to patients and PACT teamlets and provided&#xD;
      insight on barriers to goal setting, and ways to facilitate goal-setting conversations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the development phase of this project, the investigators developed a primary&#xD;
      care-based intervention called MOVE! Toward Your Goals (MTG) to facilitate weight management&#xD;
      within primary care and increase adoption of intensive VA programs such as MOVE!. The PAL&#xD;
      intervention uses the MTG software tool (that the investigators developed) delivered on&#xD;
      tablets to facilitate 5As-based weight management counseling with a health coach and&#xD;
      healthcare team to promote goal-setting, behavior change, and weight loss in the primary care&#xD;
      setting. The Veteran also receives follow up with 10-12 health coaching calls over 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of a clustered randomized control trial, the investigators will randomize 17 PACT&#xD;
      teams to either Enhanced Usual Care or the PAL Intervention, recruiting 520 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test the impact of the PAL intervention on weight change and behavioral/clinical&#xD;
           outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify predictors of weight loss in Veterans participating in the intervention group&#xD;
           related to goal setting processes and intervention components&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the impact of the PAL intervention on PACT obesity-related counseling&#xD;
           practices and attitudes&#xD;
