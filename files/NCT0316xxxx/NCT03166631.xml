  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the dose-escalation parts of the trial is to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD), based on the frequency of patients experiencing dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs), and/or the recommended dose for further development of BI 891065&#xD;
      monotherapy as well as of BI 891065 in combination with BI 754091, and to evaluate its safety&#xD;
      and tolerability by monitoring the occurrence and severity of adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the determination of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BI 891065&#xD;
      monotherapy as well as of BI 891065 in combination with BI 754091, and the preliminary&#xD;
      assessment of anti-tumour activity.&#xD;

               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic&#xD;
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family&#xD;

             safety of the trial drug, such as cardiac, neurologic, psychiatric, infectious disease&#xD;
             or active ulcers (gastro-intestinal tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration,&#xD;
