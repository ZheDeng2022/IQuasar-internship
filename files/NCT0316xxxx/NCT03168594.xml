  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of irinotecan combined with&#xD;
      cisplatin (IP regimen) and etoposide combined with cisplatin (EP regimen) in advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic gastrointestinal pancreatic and esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective randomized phase II study, the investigators aim to compare the survival&#xD;
      benefit as well as the safety for irinotecan combined with cisplatin (IP regimen) versus&#xD;
      etoposide combined with cisplatin (EP regimen) in advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal&#xD;
      pancreatic and esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The enrollment was terminated early because the premature analysis found similar response in&#xD;
    the two arms.&#xD;
