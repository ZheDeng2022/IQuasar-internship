  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is commonly viewed as one of the hypertensive pregnancy disorders, which cover a&#xD;
      spectrum of clinical presentations from chronic hypertension ( hypertension occurring prior&#xD;
      to 20 weeks of gestation) and gestational hypertension (hypertension occurring after 20 weeks&#xD;
      of gestation) To more severe forms, including preeclampsia, eclampsia (its convulsive form),&#xD;
      and HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme S, and low platelets)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for patients who have developed preeclampsia or eclampsia mainly consists of&#xD;
      control of hypertension, magnesium sulphate for prevention of eclampsia and convulsions, and&#xD;
      planning for delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium sulfate has been used to prevent eclamptic convulsion since 1925, its efficacy was&#xD;
      confirmed by a large randomized controlled trial in 2002. Eclampsia could be prevented in&#xD;
      more than 50% after magnesium sulfate administration . The World Health Organization&#xD;
      recommended magnesium sulfate as the most effective, safe, and low-cost drug for the&#xD;
      prevention of seizure in severe preeclampsia and eclampsia . The recommended dose of&#xD;
      magnesium sulfate is 4 to 6 gram intravenous loading dose, followed by maintenance&#xD;
      intravenous drip at the rate of 1 to 2 gram per hour .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although different magnesium sulfate regimens have been tested, two dosing regimens are&#xD;
      internationally recommended and widely used. The Pritchard regimen is a predominantly&#xD;
      intramuscular regimen given as a loading dose of 4 g intravenously , and 5 g Intramuscular&#xD;
      into each buttock followed by a maintenance dose of 5 g Intramuscular every 4 hours. This&#xD;
      regimen is popular in resource-limited settings where intravenously administration of&#xD;
      magnesium sulfate may not be feasible. However, it is associated with pain and a higher risk&#xD;
      of infection at the injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Zuspan regimen is given as a 4 gram intravenously loading dose followed by continuous&#xD;
      intravenously infusion of 1 gram per hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Either 1 gram or 2 gram maintenance dose of Magnesium Sulphate has been reported to reduce&#xD;
      the development of eclampsia. Randomized controlled trials offering direct comparison between&#xD;
      these 2 doses are lacking.&#xD;
