  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to test strategies to raise rates of colorectal cancer&#xD;
      screening among the Latino population in a federally qualified health center that operates&#xD;
      multiple clinics. This intervention study will test automated and live prompts to a&#xD;
      direct-mail fecal testing program in two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase I (Years 01 - 02), the investigators will tailor and define intervention components&#xD;
      using a community-based participatory research approach called boot camp translation (BCT).&#xD;
      The ultimate design of the intervention will be defined by patient and provider feedback from&#xD;
      BCT. The investigators will then conduct a three-arm patient-randomized comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness trial in two pilot clinics to compare 1) automated prompts (i.e., automated&#xD;
      phone calls, text messages) to alert and remind patients to complete screening, 2) live&#xD;
      prompts (i.e., live phone calls), and 3) a combination approach of automated plus live&#xD;
      prompts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II (Years 03 - 05), the investigators will spread and test the spread of the adapted&#xD;
      intervention to additional clinics within the partnering health center using a two-arm main&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both phases will be guided by an advisory group of clinicians, researchers, policy makers,&#xD;
      and patients.&#xD;

      The study will fulfill the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Develop personalized messages (e.g., phone scripts, text messages, patient portal&#xD;
      prompts) and define an intervention using boot camp translation to increase colon cancer&#xD;
      screening among Latino populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess the reach, effectiveness, and differences by subgroup (e.g., preferred&#xD;
      language) of a three-arm colorectal cancer screening program among Latino FQHC patients, in 2&#xD;
      clinics, through a patient randomized-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to Usual Care, the arms are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Automated Prompts-an automated data-driven program for delivering FIT kit prompts (using&#xD;
           automated phone calls, text messages, and/or emails) to patients due for colorectal&#xD;
           cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Automated Plus Live Prompts-a higher-intensity program using automated, data-driven&#xD;
           strategies for delivering FIT kit prompts plus linguistically and culturally tailored&#xD;
           live prompts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Test the spread of the program across additional clinics using a two-arm randomized&#xD;
      approach and develop an implementation guide that includes outreach materials, strategies for&#xD;
      incorporating patient input, and resources.&#xD;

Phase II: This spread trial will use a stepped-wedge design, which is a variant of a crossover randomized trial, where clinics cross over from usual practice to the best practices program. In the stepped-wedge design, a baseline period controls for the level and rate of change of the outcomes prior to program implementation and the staggered implementation minimizes confounding due to changes in the secular trend. By randomizing practices to when they receive an intervention instead of whether they receive it, the stepped wedge design ensures that all practices eventually receive the intervention, an important consideration for clinic leadership. Furthermore, the wedge-defined clusters act as their own controls as they each receive both intervention conditions. (Number of Arms: 2)</intervention_model_description>
