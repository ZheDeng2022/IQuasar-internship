      Prospective, randomized study, including full term parturients scheduled for caesarean&#xD;
      section under spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia was performed in sitting position with a&#xD;
      25 G spinal needle and all patients received 15 ml/kg of crystalloid intravenously during the&#xD;
      spinal block. Baseline hemodynamics: heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were&#xD;
      recorded before spinal anesthesia and intraoperatively. Postspinal hypotension, defined as&#xD;
      decrease of Systolic blood pressure&gt;20% from the baseline value, was managed using Ephedrine&#xD;
      increments 6 mg/3min in patients of GE group or by 5 mcg Norepinephrine/3min for the patients&#xD;
      of GN group. Intraoperative hemodynamic data of the 2 groups were compared.&#xD;

      Prospective, randomized study including full term parturients scheduled for caesarean section&#xD;
      under spinal anesthesia. All patients were ASA status I/II and patients with arrhythmia were&#xD;
      excluded. Spinal anesthesia was performed in sitting position at L3-4 or L4-5. A 25 G spinal&#xD;
      needle was used for intrathecal injection of 8 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine, 2.5 mcg&#xD;
      sufentanil and 100 mcg morphine. All patients received 15 ml/kg of crystalloids intravenously&#xD;
      during the spinal block. Patients were positioned in left lateral tilt position. Baseline&#xD;
      hemodynamics; HR, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DPB) were recorded before&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia and intraoperatively (every 2 min). Post anesthesia hypotension was defined&#xD;
      as decrease of SBP&gt;20% from the baseline value. If hypotension occurred, patients were&#xD;
      randomized into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GE group in which hypotension were managed using ephedrine increments of 6 mg Ephedrine&#xD;
           every 3 min until correction of SBP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GN group: patients of this group received 5mcg of Norepinephrine/3 min demographic and&#xD;
           hemodynamic data of the two groups were compared.&#xD;
