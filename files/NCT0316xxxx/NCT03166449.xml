    <textblock>
      Background: Head injury is one of the top three diagnosis leading to intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) admission in Malaysia. There has been growing interest in using immunonutrition as a&#xD;
      mode of modulating the inflammatory response to injury or infection with the aim of improving&#xD;
      clinical outcome. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of an&#xD;
      immunonutrition on biomarkers (IL-6, glutathione, CRP, total protein and albumin) in&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Thirty six patients with head injury admitted to neurosurgical ICU in University&#xD;
      Malaya Medical Centre were recruited for this study, over a 6-month period from July 2014 to&#xD;
      January 2015. Patients were randomized to receive either an immunonutrition (Group A) or a&#xD;
      standard (Group B) enteral feed. Levels of biomarkers were measured at day 1, 5 and 7 of&#xD;
      enteral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Patients in Group A showed significant reduction of IL-6 at day 5 (p&lt;0.001) with&#xD;
      concurrent rise in glutathione levels (p= 0.049). Patients in Group A also demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant increase of total protein level at the end of the study (day 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: These findings indicate the potential of immunonutrition reducing cytokines and&#xD;
      increasing antioxidant indices in patients with TBI. However, further studies incorporating&#xD;
      patient outcomes are needed to determine its overall clinical benefits.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, injury ranked fifth as the most common cause of hospitalisation in Malaysia, with&#xD;
      86% of major trauma patients sustaining injuries to head and neck. It is known that injuries&#xD;
      to the brain is among the most likely to result in death and disability. Therefore, it was&#xD;
      unsurprising when the Malaysian Registry of Intensive Care reported head injury as one of the&#xD;
      top three diagnosis leading to intensive care unit (ICU) admissions with an in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality rate of 22.1%. In addition to causing a significant problem in Malaysia, injury&#xD;
      related mortality and morbidity also affects countries worldwide and is expected to be a&#xD;
      major cause of death and disability by the year 2030.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of a specific immunonutrition, Neomune, on biomarkers&#xD;
      (cytokines, acute phase serum proteins and antioxidants) in traumatic brain injury patients.&#xD;
      This immune enhancing enteral feed contains arginine, glutamine and omega-3 fatty acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study and its protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee University Malaya&#xD;
      Medical Center (MEC ID NO: 20143-15). Written informed consent was obtained from patient's&#xD;
      next of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective randomized controlled trial in patients with head injury comparing two high&#xD;
      energy protein enteral formula; Neomune (manufactured by Thai Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.,&#xD;
      Ltd., Thailand) and Fresubin® HP (manufactured by Fresenius Kabi, Bod Hamburg, Germany) was&#xD;
      conducted. Fresubin® HP energy is the standard enteral feeding used in neurosurgical ICU&#xD;
      patients in University Malaya Medical Centre. Neomune was chosen to study its&#xD;
      immune-modulating effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving Neomune were classified as Group A (n=18), whereas those receiving&#xD;
      Fresubin® HP energy as Group B (n=18). Neomune is enriched with arginine, glutamine and&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject recruitment criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty six patients with head injury admitted to neurosurgical ICU, University Malaya Medical&#xD;
      Centre were recruited for this study, over a 6-month period from July 2014 to January 2015.&#xD;
      Patient's inclusion criteria were a) age between 15-78 years old, b) admission within 48&#xD;
      hours of post traumatic event, c) moderate to severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale 3-12)&#xD;
      and, d) requiring enteral nutrition. Exclusion criteria were a) history of uncontrolled&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, b) history of renal or liver dysfunction, c) severe sepsis with multi&#xD;
      organ failure and d) history of significant abdominal or chest injuries requiring major&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feeding protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients were randomized into receiving either Neomune (Group A) or Fresubin® HP&#xD;
      energy (Group B) using a computerized random number generator. Fresubin® HP energy is a&#xD;
      premixed formula with an energy of 1.5kcal/ml. Neomune formula comes in powder form and thus&#xD;
      was prepared to reach a concentration of 1.5kcal/ml in order to make it comparable for the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteral feeding was delivered within 24 to 48 h after admission or surgery according to Brain&#xD;
      Trauma Foundation (BTF) Guidelines [6]. All feeding were introduced via nasogastric tube and&#xD;
      carried out using infusion pump. Enteral feeding was commenced at an initial rate of 20 ml/h,&#xD;
      and increased by 20 ml/h every 6 hours until target calorie was reached, provided that there&#xD;
      was no significant gastric residual volume (&lt;300 mL). The target calorie for each patient was&#xD;
      determined by the clinician working alongside the dietitian using Harris Benedict equation&#xD;
      which measures Resting Energy Expenditure (REE). This was further corrected 140% of REE based&#xD;
      on studies done on traumatic brain injured patients and nutrition guidelines published by the&#xD;
      BTF, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, and the Joint Section on Neurotrauma&#xD;
      and Critical Care. Patients going for scheduled surgery are kept nil by mouth 6 hours prior&#xD;
      surgery. Feeding interruption are also kept to a minimal if patients are undergoing&#xD;
      procedures, extubation or imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood was withdrawn from patients at day 1, 5 and 7 of enteral nutrition to measure&#xD;
      the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), glutathione, C-reactive protein (CRP), total protein and&#xD;
      albumin. The concentration of IL-6 and glutathione were determined by ELISA (R&amp;D Systems,&#xD;
      Minneapolis, USA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Prealbumin was not included as a&#xD;
      nutritional biomarker in this study because this test is not available in our standard&#xD;
      laboratory test. Furthermore, we were also limited by resource constraint. All measured&#xD;
      outcomes were compared between Group A and Group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this study was calculated based on a similar study done previously on&#xD;
      immune enhancing nutrition in traumatic brain injury by Painter et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The data were analysed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences) software version 20.0. Paired t-test was used to compare the concentration of&#xD;
      cytokines, acute phase serum proteins and antioxidants between day 1, 5 and 7 after the&#xD;
      administration of enteral feeding. Independent sample t-test was used to compare continuous&#xD;
      data which include cytokines, acute phase serum proteins and antioxidant levels between Group&#xD;
      A and Group B. Statistical significance was predetermined at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
