    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the variability of blood pressure in postmenopausal and hypertensive&#xD;
      women after only one session and after training of ten weeks of combined physical exercises&#xD;
      (aerobic and resisted).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before starting the training program, all the volunteers will sign the Free and Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form (TCLE) and must present a medical certificate releasing the participation. In&#xD;
      addition, the volunteers will respond to an anamnesis questionnaire and will undergo an&#xD;
      anthropometric evaluation before the experimental sessions. The physical exercise program&#xD;
      will be held three times a week for 10 weeks, containing aerobic exercise (exercise&#xD;
      treadmill) and resistance exercises (bodybuilding). Initially, a familiarization of the&#xD;
      ergometers used will be performed, followed by a session to evaluate the intensity of&#xD;
      resistance exercise through a maximal repetition test (1RM), and a session to evaluate&#xD;
      aerobic fitness through an incremental treadmill test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the training, volunteers will perform a single exercise session, following&#xD;
      the same exercise protocol. All the volunteers will be submitted to the evaluation of the&#xD;
      blood pressure during 24 hours through the measurement of ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) in&#xD;
      three moments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PR: pre-training rest - the volunteers will arrive at the laboratory, will be in rest&#xD;
           for 15 minutes and after that they will place the ABPM, without having done any&#xD;
           exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PE: post exercise - upon arriving at the laboratory, the volunteers will be submitted to&#xD;
           a single combined exercise session, will have a maximum interval of 20 minutes for the&#xD;
           bath and will place the MAP device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CR: rest after chronic training - after the end of the 10 weeks of training, the&#xD;
           volunteers will be submitted to ABPM, again at rest, with a maximum interval of 72&#xD;
           hours, between the end of the training and the placement of the device.&#xD;
