  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      protocols for studying the structure and function of the human body using 1.5 Tesla and 3.0&#xD;
      Tesla MRI scanners with or without the use of an MRI contrast agent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include on-going technical development work for the non-invasive diagnosis of&#xD;
      liver fat or iron accumulation and other abnormalities. MRI is a non-invasive imaging&#xD;
      technique with no known side effects. The study will utilize imaging equipment that is used&#xD;
      routinely in numerous hospitals and clinics around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project seeks to address optimization of the imaging methodology at 1.5 Tesla and 3.0&#xD;
      Tesla in the liver and abdomen in order to improve clinical evaluation and care of future&#xD;
      patients. Non contrast MRI studies will be performed in normal healthy subjects. In addition,&#xD;
      the study will include subjects with confirmed disease or who have suspicion for disease, and&#xD;
      are undergoing contrast or non-contrast MR imaging as part of their standard of care. Up to&#xD;
      sixty-five (65) male or female subjects eighteen years of age and older will be studied in&#xD;
      total (number includes healthy subjects and non-healthy subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, clinical MRI exams are of adequate spatial and temporal resolution, sufficient&#xD;
      quantitative accuracy, and acceptable exam duration, but improvements in each of these areas&#xD;
      would benefit the care of future patients. For example, improvements in spatial and temporal&#xD;
      resolution may confer greater conspicuity of disease and shortening the exam duration can be&#xD;
      expected to improve patient acceptance and minimize motion artifacts. The study explores&#xD;
      innovative ideas about ways to improve MRI exams to have impact in all three of these areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current MRI techniques for fat and iron quantification in the liver and abdomen are&#xD;
      challenged by respiratory and organ motion. As a result, imaging parameters (coverage,&#xD;
      resolution, etc) and TE (echo time) selection for fat/iron quantification are compromised to&#xD;
      accommodate a short breath-held 2D or 3D scan, which can still be affected by motion&#xD;
      artifacts and even unachievable for patients with limited breath-holding capability.&#xD;
      Therefore, the study aims to achieve robust free-breathing fat/iron quantification in the&#xD;
      liver and abdomen using innovative MRI techniques and algorithms.&#xD;
