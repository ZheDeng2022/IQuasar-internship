  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, randomized clinical trial of PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine (genetically&#xD;
      attenuated PfSPZ) in healthy malaria-naïve adult volunteers. This Phase 1 trial is divided&#xD;
      into two stages, Stage A and B. Stage A is an open label, single center, dose escalation&#xD;
      study in 19 volunteers. Stage B is a multi-center, double blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial in 48 volunteers. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability of direct venous inoculation (DVI) of PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine&#xD;
      in healthy adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage A, a Phase 1 dose-escalation study, will take place at Leiden University Medical Centre&#xD;
      (LUMC). Stage B, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, will be conducted at&#xD;
      LUMC and Radboudumc University Medical Centers (RUMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage A, 19 healthy, adult volunteers will be allocated into three groups to receive&#xD;
      increasing doses of PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine by DVI. Group 1 (n=3) will receive one dose of 1.35 x&#xD;
      10^5 PfSPZ of PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine. If this dose is safe for 28 days after inoculation, then&#xD;
      Group 2 (n=3) will receive one dose of 4.5 x 10^5 PfSPZ of PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine. If this dose is&#xD;
      safe for 28 days after inoculation, Group 3 (n=13) will receive one dose of 9.0 x 10^5 PfSPZ&#xD;
      of PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine. Volunteers will be followed closely for monitoring of adverse events&#xD;
      and possible breakthrough blood infections by testing for the presence of parasitemia by&#xD;
      qPCR. All volunteers will be treated with a curative regimen of atovaquone/proguanil (A/P)&#xD;
      should break-through parasites be detected in the peripheral blood, or at the end of the&#xD;
      follow-up period (28 days) if they are not qPCR positive. Six months after the inoculation, a&#xD;
      final visit will take place to assess adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If inoculation is deemed safe after 28 days for Group 3 and criteria for proceeding to Stage&#xD;
      B are met, the trial will continue to Stage B. In Stage B, 48 healthy, adult volunteers will&#xD;
      be randomized into four groups at 2 centers, LUMC and RUMC (24 volunteers at each site). Each&#xD;
      group will receive 3 repeat doses, 8 weeks apart, of PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine (low and high doses),&#xD;
      PfSPZ Vaccine (radiation attenuated sporozoites), or normal saline (NS) placebo (as control)&#xD;
      via DVI. Group 4 (n=13) will receive 9.0 x 10^5 PfSPZ of PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine/dose. Group 5&#xD;
      (n=13) will receive 4.5 x 10^5 PfSPZ of PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine/dose. Groups 6 (n=13) and 7 (n=9)&#xD;
      will receive 4.5 x 10^5 PfSPZ Vaccine and NS placebo per dose, respectively. Three weeks&#xD;
      after the last inoculation, all immunized volunteers and placebo controls (Group 7) will&#xD;
      undergo a CHMI with five NF54-infected mosquitoes (wild-type) to determine degree of&#xD;
      protection. After the CHMI, volunteers will be followed closely for monitoring of adverse&#xD;
      events and blood stage infections, and will be seen once daily from day 6 until day 21 after&#xD;
      infection and on day 28. All volunteers will be treated with a curative regimen of&#xD;
      antimalarials, which may be A/P or alternatively artemether/lumefantrine dosed according to&#xD;
      Dutch clinical practice, at the time of detection of blood stage parasitemia by qPCR or 28&#xD;
      days after CHMI. Adverse events will be assessed up to 6 months after the CHMI.&#xD;
