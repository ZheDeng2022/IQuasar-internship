      This is a Phase I/II study of blinatumomab in combination with pembrolizumab in adult&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory B-lineage ALL The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;

      (CR+ CRh) relative to blinatumomab alone in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell&#xD;

      This is a Phase I/II study of blinatumomab in combination with pembrolizumab in adult&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory B-lineage ALL The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if the addition of pembrolizumab to blinatumomab improves the overall response rate&#xD;
      (CR+ CRh) relative to blinatumomab alone in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell&#xD;
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia with high bone marrow lymphoblast percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms of resistance to blinatumomab are not well understood although inhibition of or&#xD;
      suboptimal T-cell activation may play an important role. PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression and&#xD;
      upregulation in lymphoblasts and the bone marrow microenvironment at baseline and in response&#xD;
      to cytokines including those released upon blinatumomab exposure may inhibit T-cell function&#xD;
      through the PD-1 receptor and lead to resistance to blinatumomab. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that part of the resistance to therapy with blinatumomab is mediated by the&#xD;
      exuberant cytokine release seen with higher disease burden leading to increased expression of&#xD;
      PD-L1 and PD-L2. Enhancing T-cell activity through use of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab is&#xD;
      predicted to augment the activity of blinatumomab and convert more patients to complete&#xD;
      remission and prolong remission durations. This study will also act to expand knowledge of&#xD;
      PD-L1 and PD-L2 dynamics in response to blinatumomab. It will also be a paradigm for the&#xD;
      addition of checkpoint inhibitors to therapy with bifunctional T-cell engaging antibodies&#xD;
      currently in development for targeting other liquid and solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune&#xD;
      control. This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune&#xD;
      evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the&#xD;
      IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands,&#xD;
      PD-L1 and PD-L2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 is to ensure safety of pembrolizumab in combination with blinatumomab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 of the study will include an expansion cohort of up to 21 additional subjects (for a&#xD;
      total of 24 subjects) to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of blinatumomab and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL&#xD;
