    <textblock>
      Melanoma is the most dangerous skin cancer and is becoming commoner, largely due to increased&#xD;
      foreign holidays and use of sun-beds. Melanoma usually begins as a new or changing mole. If&#xD;
      it is picked-up quickly enough it can be removed in a simple operation and effectively cured.&#xD;
      GPs can do this operation and many are highly experienced and skilled in minor skin surgery.&#xD;
      However, guidelines written by hospital specialists insist that all patients who might have a&#xD;
      melanoma should not be treated by GPs, but should be referred to hospital. This contrasts&#xD;
      with Australia, where melanoma is commoner and initial treatment by GPs is standard practice.&#xD;
      This creates several potential problems. First, melanoma can be difficult to diagnose. Many&#xD;
      moles that do not look concerning based on checklists do turn out to be melanoma, and the&#xD;
      opposite frequently occurs too, moles that look worrying at initial examination are not&#xD;
      melanoma. Second, people are becoming more skin aware and GPs are checking moles much more&#xD;
      often. Sensibly many of these patients are being sent to hospital for a check, although most&#xD;
      will not have melanoma. Third, as a result hospital skin clinics and minor surgery lists are&#xD;
      becoming very busy and waiting times are ever increasing. Fourth, the many people who have a&#xD;
      melanoma that is not clinically obvious are waiting an increasingly long time to have it&#xD;
      diagnosed and treated in hospital, and this could actually mean that melanoma has more chance&#xD;
      to spread while they wait. The investigators conducted studies on 1200 people diagnosed with&#xD;
      a melanoma in Northeast Scotland between 1991 and 2008 and found that 20% of these people had&#xD;
      had their melanoma diagnosed and first treated by their GP. These patients were no more&#xD;
      likely to receive improper treatment than those that had been referred to hospital. Also&#xD;
      people who had had their melanoma cut out by a GP were no more likely to die from melanoma,&#xD;
      and they actually required less hospital visits afterward. This suggests that the guidelines&#xD;
      could be changed to allow GPs to treat suspicious moles. The investigators think this will be&#xD;
      better for patients and the NHS in the long-run. However, the investigators cannot recommend&#xD;
      changes to the guidelines on the basis of local research. For this reason, the investigators&#xD;
      wish to extend the study using data from 18,000 patients diagnosed with melanoma from across&#xD;
      Scotland. The results of this inclusive study will inform how the health service should deal&#xD;
      with the growing problem of suspicious moles in the future.&#xD;

      Cutaneous melanoma is increasing in incidence. UK incidence has quadrupled since 1970. With&#xD;
      corresponding increased public skin cancer awareness, GPs are frequently asked to examine&#xD;
      pigmented lesions. Definitively diagnosing melanoma on clinical features alone is extremely&#xD;
      challenging and many lesions exhibiting worrying features require a skin biopsy. Existing&#xD;
      guidelines discourage initial primary care biopsy of suspicious skin lesions despite evidence&#xD;
      that it leads to earlier diagnosis and may benefit patients and the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from Previous Research To the investigators conducted the first blinded study&#xD;
      comparing relative performance of primary and secondary care in excising melanomas and found&#xD;
      patients receiving initial excision of melanoma in primary care were no more likely to have&#xD;
      it inadequately excised than those initially biopsied in secondary care. In a further study,&#xD;
      we found that patients receiving their initial diagnostic excision biopsy for melanoma in&#xD;
      primary versus secondary care were no more likely to be dead, or to have died of metastatic&#xD;
      malignant melanoma. Patients who had their initial diagnostic excision biopsy for melanoma in&#xD;
      primary care had significantly fewer subsequent hospital admissions and spent fewer days in&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether there is any difference in mortality for people diagnosed with&#xD;
           cutaneous melanoma in Scotland between 2005-2013 following initial excision in primary&#xD;
           versus secondary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether there is any difference in morbidity following initial excision in&#xD;
           primary versus secondary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is there a difference in survival between people having initial excision of melanoma in&#xD;
           primary versus secondary care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is there a difference in subsequent risk of death from recurrent melanoma between those&#xD;
           having initial excision of melanoma in primary versus secondary care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do people having initial excision of cutaneous melanoma in primary care versus secondary&#xD;
           care subsequently have more hospital admissions?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do people having initial excision of cutaneous melanoma in primary care versus secondary&#xD;
           care subsequently have more outpatient attendances?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Data from four national datasets will be linked: the Scottish Cancer Registry&#xD;
      (SMR06); general/acute inpatient and day cases (SMR01), outpatients (SMR00) and the GRO(S)&#xD;
      death registry. Following approval via the PBPP mechanism the data will be linked and&#xD;
      provided to the research team by Dr Fiona Campbell and team and the Information Statistics&#xD;
      Division of the NHS in Scotland, Edinburgh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Scottish Cancer Registry is maintained by the Information Services Division (ISD) and has&#xD;
      been collecting information on cancer since 1958. Approximately 47,000 registrations are made&#xD;
      annually in Scotland and the database currently holds over 1,500,000. The registry has high&#xD;
      levels of completeness and accuracy, with notifications from hospital, pathology, and death&#xD;
      records. Date of diagnosis, 'stage' at diagnosis, (Breslow thickness and Clark levels),&#xD;
      histological verification, tumour grade, initial treatment received and treatment dates are&#xD;
      all recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Scottish Morbidity Record SMR01 database is an episode-based record containing all&#xD;
      general/acute inpatient and day cases discharged from Scottish hospitals. The quality of the&#xD;
      database has been assured. The Scottish Morbidity Record SMR00 database records all new&#xD;
      outpatient attendances, although recording of re-attendances is variable. Diagnosis is not&#xD;
      recorded on SMR00, but hospital speciality and outpatient procedures are. General Register&#xD;
      Office for Scotland (GROS) Death Registry data include date of death, primary and secondary&#xD;
      causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Linkage Following appropriate approvals all individuals in the Scottish Cancer Registry&#xD;
      recorded with cutaneous melanoma between 2005- 2013 will be linked to SMR01, SMR00, and&#xD;
      GRO(S) using the CHI number, a unique patient identifying number issued to every person&#xD;
      registered with a GP in Scotland used to link health data for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all individuals with cutaneous melanoma, SMR01 data for 10 years prior to cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis will be used to construct co-morbidity scores in two ways. First, principal and&#xD;
      supplementary diagnostic codes from hospital attendances and admissions will be used to&#xD;
      construct Charlson scores. These scores are used to predict prognosis based on age and&#xD;
      comorbid conditions. With each increased level of the comorbidity index the cumulative&#xD;
      mortality attributable to comorbid disease increases in a step-wise fashion. The Charlson&#xD;
      score, an estimate of 10-year survival can be used in longitudinal studies. A second proxy&#xD;
      co-morbidity score will be constructed from total number of inpatient bed days during a&#xD;
      pre-defined interval preceding presentation with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The date of cutaneous melanoma diagnosis will be the date of issue of the pathology report,&#xD;
      which will be available for all individuals included in the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage Once linked these data will be placed into the National Data Safe Haven where it&#xD;
      will be accessed remotely by the members of the research team approved to access it. These&#xD;
      data will be accessible by the team for 3 months and subsequently archived for 5 years in&#xD;
      full compliance with the Research and Information Governance Procedures of the NHS in&#xD;
      Scotland, ISD and the National Safe Haven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All all-cause survival from the date of melanoma diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cause-specific survival (including recurrent melanoma) from date of melanoma diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Total number of hospital attendances (inpatient and outpatient visits) and total number&#xD;
           of days from date of melanoma diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Exposure Location of primary excision, (primary or secondary care) - identified from&#xD;
      electronic histopathology records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Independent Variables Patient level: age, gender, residence category, deprivation ,&#xD;
      Charlson co-morbidity score; inpatient bed days; type of biopsy type; anatomical site;&#xD;
      melanoma type; Breslow depth and Clark level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operator level: operator specialty (plastic surgeon, dermatologist, other hospital&#xD;
      specialist, GP frequent exciser, volume of biopsies submitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Analyses will be conducted using a hierarchical, multilevel framework,&#xD;
      with patients nested within operators. Estimated survival probability at the end of follow up&#xD;
      will be obtained. Univariate Cox regression will be used to compare survival probabilities&#xD;
      between individuals receiving initial diagnostic excision biopsy in primary versus secondary&#xD;
      care. Cox proportional hazards regression, with robust standard error estimates, will be used&#xD;
      to explore associations between patient-and operator-level factors with all-cause and&#xD;
      melanoma related mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore morbidity, number and duration of admissions and outpatient attendances (all and&#xD;
      individual specialty) will be calculated for each individual for each year following&#xD;
      diagnosis. Association between location of initial diagnostic excision biopsy and morbidity&#xD;
      will be examined using GLMs with (a) a Poisson distribution and log link function for outcome&#xD;
      factors which are counts (b) a Binomial distribution and log link function for outcome&#xD;
      factors which are binary, and (c) a Gaussian distribution and identity link function for&#xD;
      outcome factors which are continuous. Models will be unadjusted and then adjusted for&#xD;
      patient-and operator-level factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will use Stata (version 13) or MLwiN software. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant throughout.&#xD;
