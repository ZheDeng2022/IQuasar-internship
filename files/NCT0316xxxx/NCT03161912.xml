  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AURIGA is designed to collect data from routine clinical practice on the effectiveness and&#xD;
      utilization of intravitreal aflibercept in the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema (DME) or macula edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this observational study (OS) is to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      intravitreal aflibercept in 4 cohorts (with/without prior treatment in DME or macular edema&#xD;
      secondary to RVO) in each of the participating countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, utilization and treatment regimens in routine clinical practice will be&#xD;
      described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care resources and services as well as health out-comes related to vision loss will be&#xD;
      evaluated based on information collected using the AURIGA patient questionnaires.&#xD;
