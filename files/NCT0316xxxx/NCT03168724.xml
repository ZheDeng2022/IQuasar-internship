  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal Management Training (GMT) is a cognitive rehabilitation program targeting executive&#xD;
      dysfunction (problems with attention, reasoning, problem solving, planning, etc), which is a&#xD;
      central problem in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. It teaches self-management&#xD;
      principles, stress management and mindfulness, and trains participants in the use of several&#xD;
      strategies to reduce cognitive load in everyday tasks, and methods to cue attention to&#xD;
      maintain focus on specific tasks. GMT is a manualized protocol with set content conveyed&#xD;
      through a combination of slides and a workbook. Two-hour small group sessions are led, in&#xD;
      person, by a trained therapist once a week, for nine weeks. The small group sessions allow&#xD;
      participants to learn from each other, enhancing engagement. GMT has been shown to improve&#xD;
      cognitive function in a variety of neurological conditions, as well as in healthy older&#xD;
      people with cognitive concerns. These improvements have been shown to last at least 6 months&#xD;
      in some studies and are accompanied by changes in the brain networks underlying executive&#xD;
      function. GMT is thus a well-validated, high yield intervention with which to test the&#xD;
      potential of cognitive rehabilitation in older HIV+ people with cognitive concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesize that GMT will lead to improved cognitive function as assessed by&#xD;
      better performance on cognitive tests and reduced self-reported cognitive difficulties in&#xD;
      people with stable HIV infection who report cognitive difficulties at baseline.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation is a well-established approach to maintain function in the face of chronic&#xD;
      disease, and holds promise for addressing the health challenges faced by older people with&#xD;
      HIV. A Canadian-led knowledge synthesis review published in 2014 identified cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation as a promising approach in HIV, but highlighted the absence of high quality,&#xD;
      HIV-specific evidence in this area. A recent focused review also highlights the dearth of&#xD;
      evidence on this topic. Very few studies have been published, and to date all have been&#xD;
      restricted to computerized training programs only. While there is limited evidence for&#xD;
      computerized cognitive rehabilitation in any context, there is better evidence for more&#xD;
      conventional, in-person rehabilitation approaches, at least in other neurological disorders.&#xD;
      Although computerized training is appealing because it is more feasible to deliver on a wide&#xD;
      scale than conventional cognitive rehabilitation, The researchers propose that the first step&#xD;
      should be to establish an evidence base regarding the efficacy of any form of cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation in HIV. Evidence of efficacy of a 'high dose' established rehabilitation&#xD;
      method could be followed by work to define the key elements, and to study how those elements&#xD;
      could be delivered most cost-effectively, but there is no point in pursuing these secondary&#xD;
      steps if the most well-established cognitive rehabilitation approaches do not show efficacy.&#xD;
      Thus, the researchers propose to test conventional rehabilitation as a crucial first step is&#xD;
      a research program focused on evidence-based interventions for improving brain health in HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no gold standard conventional cognitive rehabilitation program, but most existing&#xD;
      approaches combine face-to-face therapy with at home practice over a period of at least&#xD;
      several weeks. In the absence of a gold standard, the researchers have selected one such&#xD;
      program: Goal Management Training (GMT). This program targets executive dysfunction, which is&#xD;
      a central problem in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. GMT is grounded in a&#xD;
      neurobiological framework and was developed based on nearly two decades of research on&#xD;
      practical approaches to minimizing the impact of executive dysfunction, aiming to help people&#xD;
      with brain injury manage real life tasks. The program teaches self-management principles,&#xD;
      stress management and mindfulness, and trains participants in the use of several explicit&#xD;
      strategies to reduce cognitive load in everyday tasks, and methods to cue attention to&#xD;
      maintain focus on specific tasks. GMT is a manualized protocol with set content conveyed&#xD;
      through a combination of slides and a workbook. Two-hour small group sessions are led, in&#xD;
      person, by a trained therapist once a week, for seven weeks. The small group sessions allow&#xD;
      participants to learn from each other, enhancing engagement. GMT has been shown to improve&#xD;
      cognitive function in a variety of neurological conditions, as well as in healthy older&#xD;
      people with cognitive concerns. Evidence from randomized trials shows that this intervention&#xD;
      leads to (i) significant improvements in performance on cognitive tests, including&#xD;
      naturalistic tests of real life tasks, (ii) reduced self-reported cognitive difficulties, and&#xD;
      (iii) significant improvements in everyday function compared to either a wait-list condition&#xD;
      or a general brain health education control. Positive effects have been found in older people&#xD;
      with cognitive difficulties, and neurological populations with mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      including mild traumatic brain injury, stroke and spina bifida. These improvements have been&#xD;
      shown to last at least 6 months in some studies and are accompanied by changes in the brain&#xD;
      networks underlying executive function. GMT is thus a well-validated, high yield intervention&#xD;
      with which to test the potential of cognitive rehabilitation in older HIV+ people with&#xD;
      cognitive concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot project is nested within an ongoing observational cohort study that aims to&#xD;
      understand and address the heterogeneous, multi-factorial nature of compromised brain health&#xD;
      in people living with HIV. Study participants will be randomly selected from those&#xD;
      participating in the ongoing, longitudinal Positive Brain Health Now (+BHN) study at 2 sites&#xD;
      in Montreal (The Montreal Chest Institute and L'Actuel Medical Clinic). This CIHR Team&#xD;
      Grant-supported observational, prospective cohort study has enrolled 840 consecutive patients&#xD;
      attending 5 HIV clinics across Canada, who are followed every 9 months for 27 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Participants will be recruited either at the time of their routine +BHN study&#xD;
      visit, or by phone or by email. Informed consent will occur with the therapist during the&#xD;
      first GMT group session during which they will also complete a questionnaire regarding any&#xD;
      cognitive concerns they may have (Communicating Cognitive Concerns-C3Q). At the end of the&#xD;
      last GMT session, they will be asked to complete the C3Q again. Then, within 4 weeks of&#xD;
      completing the GMT program, they will be asked to repeat the B-CAM, coincident with the +BHN&#xD;
      study visit if timing permits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The standard GMT program lasts 9 weeks and involves 9 weekly 2-hour small group&#xD;
      sessions led by a trained therapist. It follows a manualized program that teaches&#xD;
      participants a series of techniques to build attention and executive function, and shows them&#xD;
      how to implement these techniques in their everyday life. The small group sessions allow&#xD;
      individualization of the training to show how it can be applied to meet the particular&#xD;
      challenges reported by participants, and explicitly encourage participants to share their&#xD;
      challenges and successes with others in the group to promote learning and engagement with the&#xD;
      program. The sessions are reinforced with homework, in which participants practice what they&#xD;
      have learned. Sessions will be audiotaped for later review by the trainer and/or study&#xD;
      investigators to ensure adherence to the intervention manual. The material, including&#xD;
      homework, is provided in a workbook that participants use throughout the training, and keep&#xD;
      for later reference.&#xD;
