  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of identifying novel etiologic&#xD;
      agents associated with SARI in patients who have required intubation and in whom, after&#xD;
      analysis, a causative agent was not identified by standard microbiologic (culture) and&#xD;
      multiplex real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) platforms. Taking into account that&#xD;
      isolation of any pathogens is generally time sensitive, the study will evaluate subjects that&#xD;
      are culture negative at the time of consent. Not all subjects will actually prove to be&#xD;
      culture negative. Additionally, the study will compare etiologic agents identified on&#xD;
      broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) to etiologic agents identified by routine upper airway testing&#xD;
      on all subjects with SARI.&#xD;

        Subjects will be selected from hospitalized patients who seek medical care due to SARI at&#xD;
        the participating sites of LaRed Network, and who meet inclusion criteria and do not meet&#xD;
        any exclusion criteria. For those who accept participation, either personally or through a&#xD;
        Legally Authorized Representative (per all applicable legal and regulatory requirements&#xD;
        complying with the sites regulations) the study will be explained and informed consent will&#xD;
        be obtained. The study population will not include children. Pregnant women are not&#xD;
        eligible.&#xD;
