  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study documents real life weight bearing in patients treated with a TFNA, who are&#xD;
      allowed for immediate weight bearing as tolerated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective data will be collected from 30 patients presenting a per- or inter-trochanteric&#xD;
      fracture of the femur treated with the TFNA. Post-operatively patients will be asked to wear&#xD;
      a sensor insole in their shoes for up to 3 months after surgical treatment. The sensor insole&#xD;
      will be used in both feet and will not have any impact in patient's activities of daily&#xD;
      living while allowing real time measurements of weight bearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to weight bearing measurements, perceived pain (numeric rating scale), mobility&#xD;
      (Parker Mobility Score and Time Up and Go Test) will be assessed at 6 and 12 weeks after&#xD;
      surgical treatment and in conjunction with the standard (routine) of care follow up schedule.&#xD;
      In order to investigate the relationship between these variables and the weight bearing&#xD;
      measurements, patients or their care takers or assisting family members will be asked to&#xD;
      document the daily use of the insole in a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, over the course of the study, anticipated adverse events (AE) that may affect the&#xD;
      healing process will be collected. Special attention will be given to implant- or&#xD;
      bone-related AEs. Images from patients with implant- or bone related AEs will be collected as&#xD;
      per standard of care&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients treated with the TFNA; i.e. according to the technique guide and the&#xD;
             indications for use, patients who presented any of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stable or unstable pertrochanteric fractures&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intertrochanteric fractures&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who were able to walk before the fracture and are prescribed full weight&#xD;
             bearing as tolerated post-surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand the content of the patient information / informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to participate in the study according to the clinical&#xD;
             investigation plan&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not allowed to full weight bearing as tolerated post-surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition, which impairs weight bearing (e.g. additional acute fracture on the&#xD;
             ipsilateral and/or contralateral side, pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients, who due to their condition, are in opinion of the Prinicipal Investigator&#xD;
             (PI) unable to complete a reliable assessment&#xD;
