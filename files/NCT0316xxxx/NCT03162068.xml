  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis induced by glucocorticoids excess constitutes the main cause of secondary&#xD;
      osteoporosis. Most of data available are provided from cohort studies of patients treated by&#xD;
      corticosteroids, affecting among 1% of population. In contrast, very few data on osteoporosis&#xD;
      are available in the Cushing syndrome (CS), a rare disease affecting 1 or 2 million of&#xD;
      inhabitants, and characterized by an endogen glucocorticoid excess production. This affection&#xD;
      is responsable of frequent fractures, occuring in 30-60% of patients (vertebral asymptomatic&#xD;
      in 50% of case, hip, ribs). Fractures occurs often frequently above the threshold usually&#xD;
      used for osteoporosis (T-score&lt;-2.5), most often in the range of osteopenia. These data&#xD;
      suggest that surface bone density isn't sufficient to characterize bone fragility,&#xD;
      architectural factors are probably involved, and should be evaluated. The specificity of&#xD;
      osteoporosis induced by endogen glucocorticoids excess in comparison with osteoporosis&#xD;
      induced by estrogenic deficiency in post-menopausal women is poorly known, especially in&#xD;
      endogen glucocorticoid excess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent microarchitecture studies showed alterations of cortical compartment in patients&#xD;
      with Cushing's syndrome, confirming by our preliminary preclinical data from a transgenic&#xD;
      murin model of Cushing's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these ten last years, new radiologic tools have been developped, and are able to evaluate&#xD;
      bone architecture. The peripheral Quantitative Computed analyses the bone architecture with&#xD;
      distinction between cortical and trabecular compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we aim to determine the specificity of osteoporosis induced by glucocorticoids&#xD;
      excess in comparison to post menopausal osteoporosis thanks to pQCT analysis.&#xD;

      This study are divided in two parts :&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cross sectional cohort with both comparison between : Cushing syndrome versus control and&#xD;
      cushing syndrome versus post-menopausal women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes : Analysis thanks to pQCT will be carried out in order to compare radius and&#xD;
      tibia bone mineral volume (total, trabecular and cortical)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength parameters, muscle area adipose tissue surface will be assessed. Analysis of body&#xD;
      composition thanks to DXA (Dual Energy X ray Absorptiometry), and surface bone mineral&#xD;
      density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Vertebral Fracture Assesment&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Prospective cohort with a longitudinal follow up on 5 years to assess the evolution of&#xD;
      osteoporosis after treatment of Cushing syndrome (surgery or medical treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CS patients are recruited during hospitalisation in endocrinology service Post-menopausal&#xD;
      women are recruited within rheumatology service. Cases are recruited thanks to advertisement&#xD;
      within CHU.&#xD;
