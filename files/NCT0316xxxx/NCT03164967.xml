    <textblock>
      This study is part of the BIVIGAM® post marketing requirement (PMR). It is being conducted in&#xD;
      subjects aged 2-16 with primary immune deficiency disorders associated with defects in&#xD;
      humoral immunity to generate additional data on these populations, and more specifically&#xD;
      safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments.&#xD;
