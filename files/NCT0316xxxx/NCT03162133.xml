  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 12-week randomized controlled trail was conducted in 72 Chinese breast cancer survivors who&#xD;
      had received aromatase inhibitors treatment for more than 6 months. All participants were&#xD;
      assigned to either 12 weeks of Baduanjin classes which involved to two 90-minute sessions per&#xD;
      week or a wait-list control. Participants completed fitness assessments, measurements of&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinﬂammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6),&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β(IL-1β) ,C-reactive protein (CRP) ，BMI，BMD&#xD;
      and questionnaires to measure QoL, fatigue, sleep quality, Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced&#xD;
      Arthralgia, symptoms of climacteric syndrome were completed at baseline and 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>After completing the baseline tests, participants in exercise group were instructed to attend 90-minute, supervised Baduanjin exercise 2 times per week. The Baduanjin intervention used the standardized Baduanjin training program, designed by the General Administration of Sports of China. Two senior Baduanjin teachers from Guangzhou Sports University conducted the training.</description>
