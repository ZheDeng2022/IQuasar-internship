      Aim: To evaluate whether glass ionomer interim therapeutic restoration (ITR) in asymptomatic&#xD;
      teeth with deep cavities can help in determining the pulp status. Methodology: 146 mandibular&#xD;
      molars with deep carious lesion having positive response to pulp sensitivity were randomly&#xD;
      allocated to two study groups (75-ITR, 71- NON-ITR group). In the first group after partial&#xD;
      caries removal(PCR), interim therapeutic restoration of glass ionomer cement (GIC) Ketac&#xD;
      molar was placed for one month before definitive adhesive restoration. In NON-ITR group,&#xD;
      cavity preparation was similar to ITR group, but definitive restoration was done in the same&#xD;
      visit. Two examiners evaluated the clinical and radiographic outcomes for 18 months. Success&#xD;
      was defined as absence of signs and symptoms of irreversible pulpitis and absence of&#xD;
      periapical alterations.&#xD;

      Introduction Preservation of pulp vitality while managing the deep carious lesions is often a&#xD;
      great challenge and requires procedures like pulp capping and pulpotomy collectively termed&#xD;
      as vital pulp therapy (VPT). Such treatment involves elimination of bacteria from pulp&#xD;
      dentine complex and establishing an environment that will prevent any future bacterial&#xD;
      contamination and improves survival prognosis. Management of deep carious lesions in recent&#xD;
      years has changed from complete caries removal to partial caries removal. Partial caries&#xD;
      removal has gained importance due to reduction in pulpal exposures, less postoperative&#xD;
      complications, more preservation and maintenance of pulp tissue .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The important concern during VPT is accurate assessment of pulpal status. Methods to&#xD;
      determine pulpal vitality include patient history, signs and symptoms, radiographs and pulp&#xD;
      sensibility tests. One of the hallmarks of pulpal diagnosis is that it is difficult and has a&#xD;
      high rate of inaccuracy. Pain on cold and hot stimuli cannot be considered as a reliable&#xD;
      reference for making a treatment decision. Also insufficient evidence was found to determine&#xD;
      the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms, signs, and diagnostic tests to assess the pulp status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies using visual and histological inspection of exposed pulp to examine status of pulp&#xD;
      reported marked variation in sensitivity of cold and electric pulp test from 0 .21 to 0.94,&#xD;
      with relatively less variation in specificity from 0.73 to 0 .96.Sensitivity decreased to 67%&#xD;
      when the spectrum of the disease was altered i.e. when asymptomatic teeth with deep carious&#xD;
      lesions were included . Diagnosis of pulp status is often easy when there is a clear&#xD;
      distinction between healthy and necrosed pulp however it is more difficult in asymptomatic&#xD;
      teeth with deep carious lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Coll et al. proposed that glass ionomer cement (GIC) as interim therapeutic&#xD;
      restoration (ITR) improved pulpal diagnosis and VPT outcomes while interpreting diagnostic&#xD;
      assessment based on clinical pulp therapy success. Vij et al. reported that GIC temporization&#xD;
      for 1-3 months increased success of the subsequent VPT from 79% to 92% .However; both of the&#xD;
      studies were retrospective and were in deciduous teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No prospective clinical study has so far been conducted in permanent teeth that demonstrate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of GIC and other adhesive restoration materials in determining the pulpal&#xD;
      status. Aim of this double blinded randomized controlled trial was to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of GIC interim restoration in determining the pulpal status of asymptomatic&#xD;
      teeth with deep carious lesions. Null hypothesis was that GIC as ITR does not improve the&#xD;
      clinician's diagnostic ability to determine the correct pulp clinical diagnosis and does not&#xD;
      improve the treatment outcomes in vital pulp therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Selection This prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Department of&#xD;
      Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak,&#xD;
      India. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee (PGIDS/IEC/2015/64) of the&#xD;
      Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences. A total of 146 patients were included with an age&#xD;
      range of 15-54 years. The inclusion criteria for the study were: 1) mature permanent&#xD;
      mandibular molars having deep carious lesions involving half or more of the dentine detected&#xD;
      by radiographic examination, 2) pulp sensibility confirmed using the electric pulp test&#xD;
      (Digitest D626D; Parkell Electronics, New York, NY) and the cold test (Endo frost, Coltene,&#xD;
      Whaledent), 3) absence of apical and furcal radiolucency determined by radiographic&#xD;
      examination, 4) absence of clinical symptoms of irreversible symptoms, fistula, swelling and&#xD;
      abnormal tooth mobility. Clinical diagnosis of vital pulp was made by the chief supervisor&#xD;
      (Sanjay Tewari) on the basis of radiographic and clinical examination and the pulp&#xD;
      sensibility tests. Patients were excluded if they presented with signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      irreversible pulpitis, had negative response to vitality tests before or after ITR, diabetic,&#xD;
      immunocompromised, pregnant, or had a positive history of antibiotic use in past one month or&#xD;
      required antibiotic prophylaxis. Informed consent explaining benefits and risks of treatment&#xD;
      was taken from patients before participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation and Randomization The sample size calculation was done on the basis&#xD;
      of difference in the percentage of success of vital pulp therapy using GIC (98%) versus&#xD;
      non-GIC group (75%) (12) α=5% with a power of 90%. This indicated the need for 48&#xD;
      restorations per treatment group. Given an expected attrition rate of 20%, 60 teeth were&#xD;
      included in each treatment group. Randomization was developed to eliminate any bias on the&#xD;
      part of the investigators and to equalize the number of patients between the 2 treatment&#xD;
      groups. Using an equal proportion randomization allocation ratio, one of the investigators&#xD;
      (M.J) created envelopes containing concealed assignment codes that were assigned sequentially&#xD;
      to eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Procedure The procedure was performed under local anesthesia and rubber dam&#xD;
      isolation. Carious tissue from the lateral walls and dentinoenamel junction was removed&#xD;
      completely by using low-speed metal burs and/or hand excavator. Superficial necrotic dentin&#xD;
      was removed from the pulpal and axial wall using low speed round bur. A layer of soft, wet&#xD;
      carious dentin was left adjacent to pulpal wall. The cavity was cleaned with distilled water&#xD;
      and dried with sterile filter paper. In group ITR, the cavity was filled with GIC ( Ketac&#xD;
      Molar (3M ESPE, St. Paul, Minn., USA).Cavity was reopened after 1 months in asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients , restoration was removed completely ,base of resin modified glass ionomer&#xD;
      cement(RMGIC) (Fuji Lining LC;GC,Tokyo,Japan)was applied and cavity was restored with resin&#xD;
      composite(Tetric N-Ceram;Ivoclar Vivadent) according to manufacturer instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In NON-ITR group, cavity preparation was done similar to ITR group, after partial caries&#xD;
      excavation ,base of RMGIC (Fuji Lining LC;GC,Tokyo,Japan) was applied and all cavities were&#xD;
      restored with resin composite(Tetric N-Ceram;Ivoclar Vivadent) according to manufacturer&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Assessment Two blinded examiners assessed the clinical and radiographic outcomes of&#xD;
      test and control treatments at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 months after treatment. Success was defined as&#xD;
      absence of signs and symptoms of irreversible pulpitis (spontaneous pain, fistula and&#xD;
      swelling), positive response to pulp sensibility tests and absence of periapical alterations&#xD;
      (radiolucency at furcal or periapical region, calcification) (combined outcome). Pretreatment&#xD;
      pulpal diagnosis was considered successful when teeth treated with or without ITR were&#xD;
      diagnosed as vital and none of clinical and radiographic signs and symptoms of failure&#xD;
      developed during 18 month follow up.&#xD;
