  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young people with At Risk Mental State (ARMS) may have changes in their thoughts and the way&#xD;
      they see or hear things, which they might find odd and distressing. They may be feeling&#xD;
      tense, worried and low in mood and may not feel like socialising. They may also experience&#xD;
      difficulties with eating and sleeping. For many people these symptoms might not last for very&#xD;
      long, but for a small number of people, they might last longer and could become worse (health&#xD;
      professionals call this psychosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological therapy, which involves talking to a therapist, can help to stop these symptoms&#xD;
      from getting worse, stopping psychosis. It can also help to make the symptoms better.&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is the treatment that is most recommended to help young&#xD;
      people with ARMS. But, this is not always available, can take a long time and is quite&#xD;
      expensive. Some research has shown that brief therapy with a therapist who is warm and&#xD;
      understanding and helps the young person to make sense of their symptoms, may be as helpful&#xD;
      as CBT, and is quicker and cheaper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hopes to develop a treatment like this and to offer it to 12 young people, aged&#xD;
      between 16 and 25, who are experiencing the symptoms outlined. Participants will be given&#xD;
      four treatment sessions, and will be asked to complete some questionnaires. The study aims to&#xD;
      see how they find it and whether it seems to help them. It will also ask professionals who&#xD;
      work with these young people what they think about the new therapy. This is a feasibility&#xD;
      study so the findings will help us to decide whether more research should be done on this&#xD;
      treatment and whether it could be offered in the NHS in the future.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical Participants will receive a 4 session individual intervention, which will be delivered by Assistant Practitioners and Assistant Psychologists (who will have received specific training in the delivering of the intervention).&#xD;
The intervention will target the participant's attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, which will be referred to as: 'unusual' experiences (unless the participant prefers an alternative).&#xD;
The therapist will focus on creating a therapeutic relationship in which the participant experiences them as warm, accepting and empathic. The aim is for the participant to feel listened to and understood.&#xD;
The intervention will focus on taking a normalising and non-catastrophising approach to the individual's unusual experiences. The participants will be provided with psychoeducation to support this aim.</description>

    <description>The intervention aims to:&#xD;
Support the participant to explore their unusual experiences&#xD;
Reduce the distress or anxiety participants feel in response to their unusual experiences, through:&#xD;
Helping them to recognise how common these unusual experience&#xD;
Supporting them to make sense of their unusual experiences&#xD;
Supporting them to understand why they may be experiencing these symptoms&#xD;
Challenging any unhelpful beliefs they hold about their symptoms&#xD;
Help the participant to recognise the triggers to their unusual experiences&#xD;
Support the participant to increase their activities and socialisation&#xD;
The intervention is not aiming to 'get rid' of the participant's symptoms, but to reduce their distress in response to them, which may result in improved wellbeing and reduced symptoms.</description>
