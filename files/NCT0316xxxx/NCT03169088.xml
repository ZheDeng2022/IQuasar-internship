  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unhealthy lifestyles are major factors contributing to chronic conditions that impose a huge&#xD;
      financial burden in EU healthcare systems. Unfortunately, the communication of Public Health&#xD;
      failed to influence consumer to change their habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the aim is to evaluate the impact of a regular monitoring during 1 year on&#xD;
      wellbeing and dietary habits in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study follows the pilot study &quot;cook to health&quot; and is intended to confirm the results&#xD;
      obtained by the tools used in C2H, in a larger population (25-50 years)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today, medicine mainly curative and reactive is primarily interested in sick people. Now,&#xD;
      with our aging Western populations, we face a strong increase in chronic diseases incidence /&#xD;
      prevalence that have a financial cost that becomes unbearable. Society's resources are being&#xD;
      drained by the rising costs of disease management and of incremental improvements to our&#xD;
      existing health care system. Immediate action is required to reverse these trends. The&#xD;
      paradigm shift would be to move from a reactive to a proactive medicine that promote healthy&#xD;
      life style to decrease incidence of chronic conditions through P4 Medecine that is&#xD;
      Preventive, Participative, Predicitive and Personnalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, unhealthy lifestyles are major factors contributing to chronic conditions that&#xD;
      impose a huge financial burden in EU healthcare systems. Insufficient physical activity, poor&#xD;
      diet and obesity are significant risk factors for cancers, cardiovascular, chest, metabolic&#xD;
      disorders and leading causes of morbidity and premature mortality. Clinically studies&#xD;
      indicate that different conditions can be prevented and sometimes reversed through adaptation&#xD;
      of healthy habits. But the communication of Public Health failed to influence consumer to&#xD;
      change their habits. Hence, it is recognized as a gold standard that better nutrition and&#xD;
      better health will reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases, which impact heavily on health spending. A report by the French National Assembly&#xD;
      estimated the cost of obesity for the health insurance, if we add the daily allowances of&#xD;
      sick care costs, between 2 and 6 € billion / year (until 4.6% of current health expenditure).&#xD;
      As recently summarized by Caroline K. Kramer I 2015 moderate weight loss is related to&#xD;
      favorable clinical outcomes. A weight loss of 7% (modification of lifestyle) reduced diabetes&#xD;
      progression (-58%). The data collected addressed to health professionals will also enable&#xD;
      better guide diagnostics and more efficient care strategies. Unfortunately free-living&#xD;
      individuals are often poor at judging the healthiness of their own diet (choice of meal&#xD;
      constituents, cooking methods, and portion sizes pattern of eating). Moreover, there is a&#xD;
      lack of awareness of the contextual features influencing eating behavior and even where there&#xD;
      is motivation to change, people have difficulty translating good intentions into healthy&#xD;
      behaviors. Hence, their day-to-day constraints (lack of time, lack of knowledge, constraining&#xD;
      family and cultural habits, personal tastes) make it difficult for them to comply and adopt&#xD;
      the nationally recommended healthy lifestyles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the volunteers will be followed during one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wellbeing will be followed with :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  survey like FFQ, IPAQ, SF36, dietary habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  actimetry measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  one year follow-up of weight, waist measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nutritional biomarkers&#xD;
