  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of nivolumab, ipilimumab and radiation&#xD;
      therapy in treating patients with stage IVA-B head and neck cancer. Monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.&#xD;
      Giving nivolumab, ipilimumab, and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      stage IVA-B head and neck cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the safety of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab with radiation&#xD;
      treatment for definitive management of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      of the head and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the overall response rate and overall survival of patients at one year&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore whether PDL1 expression is associated with treatment response. II. To explore&#xD;
      whether there is a net change in the Th1/Th2 ratio (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL10, etc) or cell&#xD;
      subset frequencies (M2 monocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, etc) within a patient's&#xD;
      peripheral blood either at baseline or in response to treatment is associated with treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore whether exosomes or other immune related serum biomarkers change after&#xD;
      combination therapy.&#xD;
