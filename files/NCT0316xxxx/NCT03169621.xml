  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic endometritis (CE) is a persistent inflammation of the endometrial lining caused by&#xD;
      the infection of the uterine cavity mainly by bacterial pathogens. It is known that CE can&#xD;
      produce implantation failure, recurrent abortion and preterm labor. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that patients who have repeated implantation failures (RIF) despite transferring good quality&#xD;
      and normal embryos, diagnosed by preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD), into a receptive&#xD;
      endometrium, diagnosed by Endometrial Receptivity Analysis (ERA), may present asymptomatic&#xD;
      CE, being the altered endometrium the main cause of these implantation failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current diagnosis of CE is the microbiological culture of endometrial biopsy samples.&#xD;
      Alternatively, examination of the uterine cavity by hysteroscopy is effective at 93.4%.&#xD;
      However, both methods have limitations, such as the time needed to obtain the diagnosis, the&#xD;
      economic cost of the tests, the possibility of detecting microorganisms in culture etc. For&#xD;
      these reasons, the developing of a simple, fast, cheap and minimally invasive diagnostic tool&#xD;
      for CE patients subjected to IVF treatments is expected. It would be very useful in order to&#xD;
      establish a specific treatment and improve pregnancy rates in infertile patients. For this&#xD;
      reason, the bacterial DNA present in the endometrial fluid samples will be obtained and the&#xD;
      identification of the causative pathogens of CE will be done by sequencing (NGS) and/or&#xD;
      quantitative PCR with specific oligonucleotides for the most common bacteria causing CE. The&#xD;
      validation of this new method will be performed by comparison with the microbiological&#xD;
      diagnosis of those same patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On day 5 of the Hormonal Replacement Therapy (after 5 days of progesterone administration),&#xD;
      coinciding with the day of hysteroscopy indicated by the physician according to the routine&#xD;
      clinical practice, samples of endometrial fluid (EF) and endometrial biopsy (EB) of patients&#xD;
      with RIF will be obtained. These samples will be used for the diagnosis of CE by both classic&#xD;
      and molecular methods. Specifically, EF sample will be analyzed by molecular techniques using&#xD;
      Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) for the detection of infectious agents. EB sample will be&#xD;
      divided into three parts, one of them will be used for molecular analysis (as control of the&#xD;
      bacterial content present in the EF), another part will be subjected to microbiological&#xD;
      analysis and the third part will be analyzed using histological techniques. In this way,&#xD;
      comparisons will be made between the different diagnostic methods of CE in the two sample&#xD;
      types (EF and EB) and the efficacy values of the new diagnostic test (sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, positive and negative predictive values and Receiving Operating Characteristic&#xD;
      curves) will be obtained using the microbiological diagnosis as a reference (gold standard&#xD;
      method).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a negative outcome for CE (approximately 40%) will continue with the expected&#xD;
      assisted reproduction treatment (ART) according to the clinic's standard protocol and&#xD;
      patients with a positive outcome for CE (approx. 60%) will receive antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      according to usual clinical practice (time and type of antibiotic will be different according&#xD;
      to the microbiological diagnosis). Once this treatment is completed, the improvement of these&#xD;
      patients will be confirmed obtaining a second sample of EF and EB. The Assisted Reproductive&#xD;
      Treatment (ART) will be performed once the specialist considers it appropriated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, reproductive rates will be correlated with the diagnosis of CE. Therefore, an&#xD;
      observational analytical study, in which a comparison of the ART results before and after its&#xD;
      diagnosis of CE, will be carried out. The reproductive impact of an altered endometrial&#xD;
      microbiota will be assessed analyzing the implantation rates, pregnancy and ongoing&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
