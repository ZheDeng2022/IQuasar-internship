  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will adopt a non-blinded parallel-group randomized controlled trial design&#xD;
      that involves a Laughter Yoga group (intervention) and a treatment-as-usual group (Control).&#xD;
      It aims to determine the feasibility of using LY intervention on patients with Major&#xD;
      depressive disorder (MDD), and also to evaluate the potential effect of the intervention on&#xD;
      comorbid depression, anxiety and stress for these patients. It is hypothesized that, LY&#xD;
      group, as compared to the TAU group, will have significantly lower symptoms of depression,&#xD;
      anxiety and stress, but greater improvements in self-reported mental health/physical&#xD;
      health-related quality of life immediately post intervention and at 3 months' follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      72 community dwelling people with co-morbid symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress who&#xD;
      are diagnosed and treated for major depressive disorder (MDD) will be recruited into the&#xD;
      study from the Community Psychiatric Service (CPS) of Castle Peak Hospital. After baseline&#xD;
      measurements, 36 participants will be randomly allocated into the Laughter Yoga group (LY) or&#xD;
      Treatment-as-usual group (TAU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LY intervention will be delivered by a certified lead LY trainer and monitored by three&#xD;
      Co-Is and/or Research Assistants. The LY participants will be asked to attend a total of&#xD;
      eight 45-minutes sessions of group-based laughter yoga over a 4 week period. TAU participants&#xD;
      will receive their usual routine community mental health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collection will be conducted by a trained research assistant. Demographic data and&#xD;
      all the relevant clinical/treatment data will be collected at baseline, whereas outcome data&#xD;
      will be collected at three time points: Baseline, after the 4 weeks' intervention period, and&#xD;
      at 3 months after finishing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of depression, anxiety and stress will be the primary outcome of the study. They&#xD;
      will be measured by the Chinese version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21)&#xD;
      developed by Lovibond and Lovibond (1995) . The secondary outcome will be quality of life&#xD;
      (physical and mental health related), which will be assessed with the short Form 12 item&#xD;
      (version 2) Health Survey (SF12v2) (Lam et al., 2014). The Chinese language version of the&#xD;
      client satisfaction questionnaire (CSQ-8)(Attkisson and Zwick, 1982; Attkisson, 2012) will be&#xD;
      used to measure patient's view about their satisfaction with the LY intervention immediately&#xD;
      post intervention. To explore patient's experience on the LY intervention, a sample of 12&#xD;
      patients who received the LY intervention will be invited to a short individual interview&#xD;
      with the research assistant at three months' follow-up. Trial feasibility data, such as&#xD;
      refusal rate, response rate, drop out, attendance rate will also be recorded throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to contextualize the demographic and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of the study population at baseline. The baseline variables will be compared&#xD;
      between the groups so that potential confounders will be identified and where necessary&#xD;
      adjusted for. For pre-test and post-test comparisons between the two groups, ANOVA test will&#xD;
      be adopted if satisfactory normality of data is established. Otherwise, Kruskal-Wallis test&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;

    <description>A LY group will be composed of 8-12 participants. Each sessions will include 4 essential elements steps of laughter yoga, laughter meditation and grounding exercises. The 4 steps of laughter yoga are 1) warm up exercise, 2) deep breathing exercises, 3) childlike playfulness and 4) laughter exercises. The laughter meditation is a deeper experience of unconditional laughter in which laughter often comes in natural waves and it becomes infectious and set off a chain reaction to infect other people. The grounding exercises allow individuals to ground the energy of laughter and relax. The LY intervention will be facilitated by a certified lead LY trainer.</description>
