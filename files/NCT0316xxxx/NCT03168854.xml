    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 trial will include 16 subjects who will receive the Genetically-attenuated&#xD;
      p52-/p36-/sap1- Plasmodium falciparum Parasites (GAP3KO) vaccine administered by the bite of&#xD;
      approximately 200 infected Anopheles stephensi Mosquitoes in a controlled clinical&#xD;
      environment and 12 Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) infectivity controls (six for&#xD;
      each of the two CHMIs). Subjects will be observed for adverse events after each GAP3KO&#xD;
      administration. Solicited local and systemic Adverse Events (AEs) will be recorded on a&#xD;
      memory aid beginning of the day of first vaccine administration and continuing through 28&#xD;
      days after the last administration. During the vaccination phase clinical laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations for safety will be performed on venous blood. Unsolicited AEs will be collected&#xD;
      from the day of first vaccination through 28 days after last vaccination and serious adverse&#xD;
      events (SAEs) will be collected from the day of first GAP3KO administration through the end&#xD;
      of study follow-up. Subjects will be monitored for possible breakthrough peripheral&#xD;
      parasitemia with qRT-PCR testing. Four weeks after the last GAP3KO administration, all&#xD;
      subjects who completed the immunization phase (up to 16) and a group of six malaria-naïve&#xD;
      infectivity controls will be challenged on the same day with wild-type Plasmodium falciparum&#xD;
      NF54 sporozoites. Approximately twenty-six weeks after that challenge, all of the protected&#xD;
      subjects in Arms 1 and 2 (up to 16) and another six malaria-naïve infectivity controls will&#xD;
      receive five infectious A. stephensi mosquito bites on the same day using standard CHMI&#xD;
      procedures. For subjects in Study Arms 1 and 2 without documented parasitemia additional&#xD;
      post-CHMI follow-ups will occur. For subjects in Study Arms 1 and 2 with documented&#xD;
      parasitemia after the first CHMI or who are discontinued for other reasons after the first&#xD;
      CHMI, and for the infectivity controls, additional follow ups will occur. Serious Adverse&#xD;
      Events (SAEs) will be recorded from the day of CHMI through the end of study follow up and&#xD;
      clinical laboratory evaluations for safety will be performed on Day 29 and as clinically&#xD;
      indicated (all subjects) and, for subjects with documented parasitemia, on the day malaria&#xD;
      treatment is initiated and three days after malaria treatment is initiated. The primary&#xD;
      objectives are: 1) To assess the safety and reactogenicity of candidate GAP3KO malaria&#xD;
      vaccine when administered by the bite of approximately 200 infected mosquitoes on a five dose&#xD;
      schedule, with the first four vaccinations given four weeks apart and the fifth vaccination&#xD;
      given eight weeks after the fourth vaccination, and on a three dose schedule, with the second&#xD;
      vaccination given four weeks after the first vaccination and the third vaccination given&#xD;
      eight weeks after the second vaccination, to healthy malaria-naïve adults aged 18 through 50&#xD;
      years , 2) To confirm attenuation of GAP3KO parasites by assessing the occurrence of&#xD;
      breakthrough peripheral parasitemia from the time of first GAP3KO administration through 28&#xD;
      days after last GAP3KO administration.&#xD;

      administered by the bite of approximately 200 infected Anopheles stephensi Mosquitoes in a&#xD;
      controlled clinical environment and 12 Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) infectivity&#xD;
      controls (six for each of the two CHMIs). Subjects will be observed for adverse events for at&#xD;
      least 60 minutes after each GAP3KO administration. Solicited local and systemic Adverse&#xD;
      Events (AEs) will be recorded on a memory aid beginning of the day of first vaccine&#xD;
      administration and continuing through 28 days after the last administration. During the&#xD;

      blood. Unsolicited AEs will be collected from the day of first vaccination through 28 days&#xD;
      after last vaccination and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected from the day of&#xD;
      first GAP3KO administration through the end of study follow-up. Subjects will be monitored&#xD;
      for possible breakthrough peripheral parasitemia with qRT-PCR testing. Four weeks after the&#xD;
      last GAP3KO administration, all subjects who completed the immunization phase (up to 16) and&#xD;
      a group of six malaria-naïve infectivity controls will be challenged on the same day with&#xD;
      wild-type Plasmodium falciparum NF54 sporozoites. Approximately twenty-six weeks (six months)&#xD;
      after that challenge, all of the protected subjects in Arms 1 and 2 (up to 16) and another&#xD;
      six malaria-naïve infectivity controls will receive five infectious A. stephensi mosquito&#xD;
      bites on the same day using standard CHMI procedures. For subjects in Study Arms 1 and 2&#xD;
      without documented parasitemia additional post-CHMI follow-ups will occur. For subjects in&#xD;
      Study Arms 1 and 2 with documented parasitemia after the first CHMI or who are discontinued&#xD;
      for other reasons after the first CHMI, and for the infectivity controls, additional follow&#xD;
      ups will occur. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be recorded from the day of CHMI through&#xD;
      the end of study follow up and clinical laboratory evaluations for safety will be performed&#xD;
      on Day 29 and as clinically indicated (all subjects) and, for subjects with documented&#xD;
      parasitemia, on the day malaria treatment is initiated and three days after malaria treatment&#xD;
      is initiated. The primary objectives are: 1) To assess the safety and reactogenicity of&#xD;
      candidate GAP3KO malaria vaccine when administered by the bite of approximately 200 infected&#xD;
      mosquitoes on a five dose schedule, with the first four vaccinations given four weeks apart&#xD;
      and the fifth vaccination given eight weeks after the fourth vaccination, and on a three dose&#xD;
      schedule, with the second vaccination given four weeks after the first vaccination and the&#xD;
      third vaccination given eight weeks after the second vaccination, to healthy malaria-naïve&#xD;
      adults aged 18 through 50 years , 2) To confirm attenuation of GAP3KO parasites by assessing&#xD;
      the occurrence of breakthrough peripheral parasitemia from the time of first GAP3KO&#xD;
      administration through 28 days after last GAP3KO administration. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      are: 1) To assess the efficacy of GAP3KO vaccine given on a five dose schedule and GAP3KO&#xD;
      vaccine given on a three dose schedule against malaria challenge four weeks after last&#xD;
      vaccination, and re-challenge 26 weeks (six months) after the first challenge, using standard&#xD;
      controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) procedures, 2) To assess humoral and cell-mediated&#xD;
      immune responses to malaria antigens induced by GAP3KO administration and by CHMI.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Provides informed consent before initiation of any study procedure, correctly answers&#xD;
             = / &gt; 80 percent of questions* on the post consent quiz and is available for all study&#xD;
             visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Subjects who score less than 80 percent may retake the quiz one time and are excluded&#xD;
             if the second test is also less than 80 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is in good health, as judged by the investigator, and determined by medical history&#xD;
             and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Existing medical diagnoses or conditions (except those in the Subject Exclusion&#xD;
             Criteria) must be deemed as stable. A stable medical condition is defined as no change&#xD;
             in prescription medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the last three months&#xD;
             (90 days) and health outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within&#xD;
             acceptable limits in the last six months (180 days). Any change due to change of&#xD;
             health care provider, insurance company, or that is done for financial reasons, as&#xD;
             long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a violation of this&#xD;
             inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a&#xD;
             disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate&#xD;
             sub-investigator, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion.&#xD;

                  hysterectomy, or, if menopausal, still menstruating or &lt; 1 year of the last&#xD;
                  menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Study vaccination or CHMI&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of childbearing potential must have used a highly effective form of&#xD;
             contraception* in the 30 days prior to their first mosquito exposure**.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Highly effective single forms of contraception include abstinence from sexual&#xD;
             activity that could lead to pregnancy, monogamous relationship with vasectomized&#xD;
             partner who has been vasectomized for six months or more prior to enrollment,&#xD;
             successful Essure (R) placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal sterilization)&#xD;
             with documented confirmation test at least three months after the procedure, or use of&#xD;
             effective intrauterine devices or the contraceptive implant (Nexplanon). If none of&#xD;
             the highly effective single forms of contraception is used, a combination of an&#xD;
             acceptable barrier method and an acceptable hormonal method must be used. Acceptable&#xD;
             barrier methods include condom (male or female) and a spermicide (cream, film, foam,&#xD;
             or gel), diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, and the birth control sponge.&#xD;
             Acceptable hormonal methods include birth control patch, shot (Depo-Provera), and&#xD;
             pills, and the vaginal ring (NuvaRing).&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Negative serology for HIV 1/2*.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *If the ELISA is positive, HIV confirmation should be performed. If the HIV Western&#xD;
             Blot is not consistent with HIV infection, the subject may be enrolled. A past subject&#xD;
             in an HIV vaccine trial who has a positive antibody ELISA may participate if the&#xD;
             Western Blot is not consistent with pending seroconversion or positive or an HIV PCR&#xD;
             assay result is below the level of detection of HIV.&#xD;

             *Screening clinical labs include blood tests (white blood count [WBC], hemoglobin,&#xD;
             platelet count, creatinine, and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) and urine dipstick&#xD;
             tests (protein and hemoglobin). Any Grade 1 or higher value for any screening test&#xD;
             will exclude the subject from enrollment with the exception of hematuria &gt; / = 1 +&#xD;
             detected concurrent with endometrial bleeding for females. In this situation, the test&#xD;
             can be repeated if clinically warranted but is not considered an indicator of poor&#xD;
