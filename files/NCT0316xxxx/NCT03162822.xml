  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers and their child are being asked to participate because the investigators are&#xD;
      interested in typical caregiver-child interactions and health behaviors. In particular, the&#xD;
      investigators are interested in different ways that caregivers react to and understand their&#xD;
      young children's behavior, and their health behaviors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If they decide to participate in this study, caregivers and their child will come visit the&#xD;
      laboratory twice at times that are convenient for them. The first visit will take 2.5-3 hours&#xD;
      and the second visit will take 2-2.5 hours, so the subject runners will ask them to schedule&#xD;
      them at times when their child will be well-rested and fed prior to arrival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here is a list of activities that the subject runners will ask caregivers and their child to&#xD;
      participate in. These activities will be video-recorded and recordings will be kept digitally&#xD;
      on a secure password-protected server. A separate consent form for the video-recording will&#xD;
      be provided and caregivers must consent to the video-recording if they wish to participate in&#xD;
      this study. Video-recordings will be assigned a random subject ID number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon arrival at the laboratory during both visits, the subject runners will explain the&#xD;
           tasks to caregivers and the subject runners will set them and their child up with the&#xD;
           machine that allows us to measure heart rate and skin moisture. This means the subject&#xD;
           runners will place nine sensors on their and their child's bodies. These sensors will be&#xD;
           placed on the collar bones, the lower left rib cage, the upper and mid-chest, the upper&#xD;
           and midback, and the palm of their and their child's non-dominant hand. Caregivers and&#xD;
           their child will still be able to move freely around the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Next, the subject runners will either:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Conduct a short discussion where the subject runners will discuss caregivers'&#xD;
                responses to their child's behavior or the intentions behind their child's&#xD;
                behavior. A quarter of the research subjects in this study will complete a task&#xD;
                where their responses to their child's behaviors are discussed and another quarter&#xD;
                of the subjects will complete a task where the reasons for their child's behavior&#xD;
                are discussed. Which type of discussion participants have will be &quot;randomly&#xD;
                assigned&quot;, which means that a computer will generate this decision before they&#xD;
                arrive for their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Or have caregivers complete a short computerized activity where caregivers will&#xD;
                look at a series of images and descriptions or will be asked to rate a series of&#xD;
                images with facial expressions. A quarter of the research subjects in this study&#xD;
                will complete a computerized activity where they will look at a series of images&#xD;
                and descriptions and another quarter of the subjects will complete a computerized&#xD;
                activity where they will rate a series of images with facial expressions. Which&#xD;
                type of activity participants have will be &quot;randomly assigned&quot;, which means that a&#xD;
                computer will generate this decision before they arrive for their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After this brief discussion, the subject runners will have caregivers and their child&#xD;
           complete a series of tasks that are the sorts of activities they might encounter in&#xD;
           daily life. In the first task the subject runners will have caregivers direct their&#xD;
           child to clean up toys. In the second task the subject runners will have their child&#xD;
           play with some toys while they are occupied on their phone. In the third task the&#xD;
           subject runners will give them questionnaires to complete while their child waits on a&#xD;
           mat. All three of these tasks will take 25-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After this task, the subject runners will either:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Allow caregivers to have a break with their child. The subject runners will provide&#xD;
                toys, drinks and snacks during the break. The subject runners will then ask&#xD;
                caregivers to brush their child's teeth with a toothbrush that the subject runners&#xD;
                provide, as they normally would.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Or have caregivers complete a task where they will rate what they felt and thought&#xD;
                during their interaction with their child while watching a video of their&#xD;
                interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of these tasks the subject runners will provide caregivers with the&#xD;
           opportunity to discuss the visit, their child's behaviors, and any other questions or&#xD;
           concerns they may have. The subject runners will not ask them to participate in any&#xD;
           additional visits or questionnaires after their second visit.&#xD;
