      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last two decades, some clinical investigators have focused their interest on the&#xD;
      development of minimally invasive surgical approaches in periodontal surgery. Harrel &amp; Rees&#xD;
      proposed the minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with the aim to produce minimal wounds, minimal&#xD;
      flap reflection and gentle hand ling of the soft and hard tissues in periodontal surgery.&#xD;
      Cortellini &amp; Tonetti tested the use of operative microscopes and microsurgical instruments to&#xD;
      increase visual acuity and accuracy in the application of papilla preservation flaps in&#xD;
      periodontal regeneration. The increased patient acceptance and decreased morbidity with&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery offers a promising therapeutic modality and may replace the need&#xD;
      for more extensive surgical procedures. Recently, a new surgical approach, the ''minimally&#xD;
      invasive surgical technique (MIST)'', has been proposed to treat isolated intrabony defects&#xD;
      with periodontal regeneration. Results from a cohort study in isolated deep intrabony defects&#xD;
      showed marked improvements in terms of clinical attachment level (CAL) gains and PD&#xD;
      reduction. The background foundations for this technique are the concepts of the MIS, and the&#xD;
      application of papilla preservation techniques with a microsurgical approach. The cited study&#xD;
      also reported a very limited patient morbidity and a reduced length of the surgical procedure&#xD;
      following application of the MIST. An enhancement of this technique, the modified minimally&#xD;
      invasive surgical technique (M-MIST), has been recently designed to further reduce the&#xD;
      surgical invasiveness, with three major objectives in mind: (1) minimize the interdental&#xD;
      tissue tendency to collapse, (2) enhance the wound/soft tissue stability and (3) reduce&#xD;
      patient morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal researchers and clinicians, in an effort to develop effective regenerative&#xD;
      therapies, have sought to understand key events involved in the regeneration of the&#xD;
      periodontium. An increased knowledge of specific cellular response and function within the&#xD;
      periodontium has led to the development of numerous treatment modalities exhibiting different&#xD;
      degrees of success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments including ''grafting'' with bone or bone substitutes, stimulation of cells with&#xD;
      growth factors, hormones, or extracellular matrix proteins; cell occlusive barrier membranes&#xD;
      for selective cell growth in periodontal defects; and modification of the tooth root surface&#xD;
      have all been explored for their ability to predictably regenerate the periodontium. Although&#xD;
      some treatments have yielded promising results, there remains a need for a treatment that&#xD;
      leads to faster and more predictable regeneration of the periodontium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of bioactive surgical additives, which are being used to regulate the&#xD;
      inflammation and increase the speed of healing process, is one of the great challenges in&#xD;
      clinical research. In this sense, healing is a complex process, which involves cellular&#xD;
      organization, chemical signals, and the extracellular matrix for tissue repair. The&#xD;
      understanding of healing process is still incomplete, but it is well known that platelets&#xD;
      play an important role in both hemostasis and wound healing processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets' regenerative potential was introduced in the 70's, when it was observed that they&#xD;
      contain growth factors that are responsible for increase collagen production, cell mitosis,&#xD;
      blood vessels growth, recruitment of other cells that migrate to the site of injury, and cell&#xD;
      differentiation induction, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the latest innovations in oral surgery is the use of platelet concentrates for in vivo&#xD;
      tissue engineering applications. Platelet concentrates are a concentrated suspension of&#xD;
      growth factors found in platelets, which act as bioactive Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) was&#xD;
      first used in 2001 by Choukroun et al., specifically in oral and maxillofacial surgery, and&#xD;
      is currently considered as a new generation of platelet concentrate. It consists of a matrix&#xD;
      of autologous fibrin and has several advantages over Platelet rich plasma (PRP), including&#xD;
      easier preparation and not requiring chemical manipulation of the blood, which makes it&#xD;
      strictly an autologous preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRF consists of an autologous leukocyte-platelet-rich fibrin matrix, composed of a tetra&#xD;
      molecular structure, with cytokines, platelets, cytokines, and stem cells within it, which&#xD;
      acts as a biodegradable scaffold that favors the development of microvascularization and is&#xD;
      able to guide epithelial cell migration to its surface. Also, PRF may serve as a vehicle in&#xD;
      carrying cells involved in tissue regeneration and seems to have a sustained release of&#xD;
      growth factors in a period between 1 and 4 weeks, stimulating the environment for wound&#xD;
      healing in a significant amount of time. It has a complex architecture of strong fibrin&#xD;
      matrix with favorable mechanical properties and is slowly remodeled, similar to blood clot .&#xD;
      Some studies have demonstrated that PRF is a healing biomaterial with a great potential for&#xD;
      bone and soft tissue regeneration, without inflammatory reactions and may be used alone or in&#xD;
      combination with bone grafts, promoting hemostasis, bone growth, and maturation. This&#xD;
      autologous matrix demonstrated in in vitro studies a great potential to increase cell&#xD;
      attachment and a stimulation to proliferate and differentiate osteoblasts. Dohan et al.&#xD;
      stated that PRF has immunological and antibacterial properties, may lead to leukocyte&#xD;
      degranulation, and has some cytokines that may induce angiogenesis and pro/anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into consideration of above mentioned advantages of PRF and M-MIST it was hypothesised&#xD;
      that this combination (PRF+M-MIST) would be more beneficial in achieving healing of intrabony&#xD;
      defects. Furthermore the concomitant use of Platelet Rich Fibrin with M-MIST has not been&#xD;
      previously attempted in periodontal practice. Thus the aim of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of PRF along with M-MIST in the treatment of intrabony defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology , Post&#xD;
      Graduate Institute Of Dental Sciences,(PGIDS) Rohtak, Haryana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from regular outpatient department of the Department of&#xD;
      Periodontics and Oral Implantology. Minimum total 36 patients will be included as per&#xD;
      eligibility in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior informed consent will be taken from each patient after explaining the procedure in&#xD;
      patient's language along with risk and benefits involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 36 patients were selected and divided into 2 groups of 18 each&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the eligible patients will be randomly assigned at the time of surgery into either of the&#xD;
      two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test group: Modified-Minimally Invasive Surgical Technique + Platelet Rich Fibrin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: Modified-Minimally Invasive Surgical Technique alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the clinical parameters will be recorded at baseline, 3 months and 6 months post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival status will be assessed using the Loe and Silness Gingival Index . Plaque status&#xD;
      will be recorded using Silness and Loe Plaque Index. The clinical parameters will include&#xD;
      relative clinical attachment level (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD) and gingival recession&#xD;
      will be recorded to the nearest millimetre (at the deepest location of the selected&#xD;
      interproximal site) with the help of a UNC-15 probe (university of north carolina)at&#xD;
      baseline, 3 months and 6 months post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the parameters will be clinically assessed by a single examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-oral periapical radiographs of the selected teeth will be taken using long cone&#xD;
      paralleling technique at baseline, 3 months and 6 months post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the radiographs will be assessed by the another investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anatomical landmarks of the intrabony defect will be selected on the radiographs based on&#xD;
      the criteria set by Schei et al., which include cementoenamel junction (CEJ), alveolar crest&#xD;
      (AC) and base of the defect (BD). The radiographic parameters evaluated will be percentage&#xD;
      bone fill (%BF) and the change in alveolar crest position (C-ACP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical approach (M-MIST)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the surgical procedures will be performed using microsurgical instruments. The&#xD;
      defect-associated papilla will be surgically approached with the M-MIST . The defect&#xD;
      associated papilla will be surgically approached with modified papilla preservation technique&#xD;
      at interdental sites. A thorough surgical debridement of the osseous defect will be performed&#xD;
      using curettes from under the papilla, aided with surgical microscope. The defect will be&#xD;
      debrided with mini curettes and the root will be carefully planed. Special care will be taken&#xD;
      to reach all the parts of the exposed root surface and residual bony wall partly hidden by&#xD;
      the non elevated lingual and papillary soft tissue. To allow instrumentation the buccal&#xD;
      papillary flap will be slightly reflected carefully protected with a periosteal elevator and&#xD;
      frequently irrigated with saline. Once the debridement is over, the vertical defect depth&#xD;
      (from the bottom of the defect to the alveolar crest) and the number of bony walls present&#xD;
      will be recorded. If the vertical defect depth is ≥3 mm, final subject eligibility will be&#xD;
      confirmed. The required quantity of the PRF will be delivered into the osseous defect in test&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgical care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate post-operative instructions will be given to the patients. Sutures will be&#xD;
      removed 1 week following surgery.&#xD;
