      The 'REstricted versus Liberal positive end-expiratory pressure in patients without Acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome' (RELAx) trial is a national multicenter, open randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in ICU patients without ARDS at start of ventilation. It will be the first&#xD;
      RCT comparing ventilation with the lowest possible positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&#xD;
      level with ventilation with the median PEEP level currently practiced in the Netherlands that&#xD;
      recruits a sufficient number of patients to test the hypothesis that ventilation with the&#xD;
      lowest possible PEEP level is non-inferior to ventilation with a PEEP level of 8 cm H2O with&#xD;
      regard to objective and patient-relevant clinical endpoints.&#xD;

      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is mechanical ventilation with the lowest possible PEEP level, as compared to mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation with the PEEP level currently practiced, non inferior in terms of the number of&#xD;
      ventilator-free days at days 28 in patients without ARDS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      National multicenter, non-inferiority, open randomized controlled trial in intubated and&#xD;
      ventilated adult ICU patients without ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of patients safety and reviewing of safety issues is performed by a designated&#xD;
      independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB).The DSMB watches over the ethics of&#xD;
      conducting the study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult intensive care unit(ICU) patients without ARDS with an anticipated duration of&#xD;
      ventilation of at least 24 hours, within 1 hour after initiation or admittance to the ICU if&#xD;
      already intubated and ventilated admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group size calculation is focused on demonstrating non-inferiority. When the sample size in&#xD;
      each is 445, an one-sided non-inferiority t-test (targeted at 0.05 significance level) for&#xD;
      the difference in means of log-transformed normalized data has a 80% power to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis that the number of VFD-28 in the 'restricted PEEP'-arm is inferior to the number&#xD;
      of VFD-28 in the 'liberal PEEP'-arm by a margin of 10% anticipating on a coefficient of a&#xD;
      variation of 0.70 (www.stichting-nice.nl), in favor or the alternative hypothesis that the&#xD;
      number of VFD-28 in the 'restricted PEEP'-arm is non-inferior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice for a margin of 10% is motivated by what is considered acceptable from a clinical&#xD;
      point of view as the maximal acceptable reduction of the ventilator-free period for&#xD;
      non-inferiority. Clinically this margin means that an increase of &gt; 10% in the duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation will reduce the VFD-28 with &gt; 12 hours (calculated over the expected&#xD;
      mean duration of mechanical ventilation of 5 days) (www.stichting-nice.nl), which will be&#xD;
      considered inferior. To allow for an anticipated drop out of 10% a total of 980 patients will&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in participating intensive care units (ICU) are screened for eligibility and&#xD;
      randomized within one hour of initiation of invasive ventilation or, if already intubated and&#xD;
      ventilated before admission, on ICU admission. Demographic data on screened patients&#xD;
      regardless of meeting enrollment criteria will be recorded (registry: age, gender, type of&#xD;
      surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed using a dedicated, password protected, SSL-encrypted website.&#xD;
      Randomization sequence is generated by a dedicated computer randomization software program.&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding is not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the 'restricted PEEP'-arm (i.e. lowest&#xD;
      possible PEEP level, 0-5 cm H2O) or to the 'liberal PEEP'-arm (i.e. a PEEP level of 8 cm H2O,&#xD;
      the median PEEP level applied in the Netherlands)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allowed ventilation modes are: volume-controlled or pressure-controlled ventilation, and&#xD;
      pressure support ventilation. Automated modes, in particular those that automatically change&#xD;
      PEEP and FiO2, are never allowed. With volume-controlled and pressure-controlled ventilation&#xD;
      the inspiration-to-expiration ratio is set at 1:2. With volume-controlled ventilation the&#xD;
      inspiration time and pause are set at 25% and 10%, respectively. With pressure support&#xD;
      ventilation the highest possible pressure rise is chosen, and cycling off is set at 25%.&#xD;
      Tidal volume size is between 6-8 ml/kg predicted body weight, which is calculated according&#xD;
      to the following formula 50 + 0.91 x (centimeters of height - 152.4) for males and 45.5 +&#xD;
      0.91 x (centimeters of height - 152.4) for females. The respiratory rate is adjusted to&#xD;
      obtain a normal arterial blood pH (7.35 to 7.45). In case of metabolic acidosis or alkalosis,&#xD;
      a lower or higher than normal PaCO2 can be accepted, which is left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending physician. Recruitment maneuvers are allowed when deemed necessary, but the&#xD;
      decision to perform a recruitment maneuver is also left to the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients randomized to the 'restricted PEEP'-arm start with a PEEP level of 5 cm H2O and&#xD;
      with an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) between 0.21 and 0.6. The goal is to ventilate with&#xD;
      the lowest possible PEEP level resulting in an acceptable level of oxygenation. For this, the&#xD;
      operator, usually the attending ICU nurse, will reduce the level of PEEP in steps of 1 cm H2O&#xD;
      to a minimum level of 0 cm H2O. Every 15 minutes the PEEP level is reduced with 1 cm H2O, as&#xD;
      long as the pulse oximetry reading shows a SpO2 &gt; 92% or the arterial blood gas shows a PaO2&#xD;
      &gt; 8 kPa. Thereafter, ventilation continues with the lowest PEEP level at which the SpO2 &gt; 92%&#xD;
      or PaO2 &gt; 8 kPa, using a FiO2 of between 0.21 and 0.6. In case the SpO2 drops below 92% or&#xD;
      the PaO2 drops below 8 kPa, brief periods up to 5 minutes may be tolerated, first FiO2 is&#xD;
      increased up to maximum 0.6 before PEEP is increased in steps of 1 cm H2O until 5 cm H2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These so-called down-titrations of the PEEP level are allowed as often as wanted, but with a&#xD;
      minimum of three per ICU nurse shift.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are weaned from the ventilator and tracheally extubated using the lowest PEEP level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients randomized to the 'liberal PEEP'-arm start with a PEEP level of 8 cm H2O and with&#xD;
      a FiO2 between 0.21 and 0.6. The goal is to ventilate the patient mainly at this level of&#xD;
      PEEP till tracheal extubation. For this, the operator will increase the level of PEEP, if a&#xD;
      level of &lt; 8 cm H2O was used, to 8 cm H2O in one single step. Thereafter, ventilation&#xD;
      continues at 8 cm H2O using a FiO2 of between 0.21 and 0.6. In case the SpO2 drops below 92%&#xD;
      or the PaO2 drops below 8 kPa, first FiO2 is increased to maximum 0.6 before the level of&#xD;
      PEEP is further increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are weaned of the ventilator and tracheally extubated using a PEEP level of 8 cm&#xD;
      H2O. If preferred, the level of PEEP can be set at 5 cm H2O for one to two hours directly&#xD;
      before tracheal extubation, left to the discretion of the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The oxygenation target ranges for SpO2 and PaO2 are 92% to 96%, and 8 kPa to 11.5 kPa,&#xD;
      respectively. Oxygenation will be maintained in the target ranges primarily by adjusting the&#xD;
      FiO2, which is typically set between 0.21 and 0.6 to maintain the oxygenation target ranges.&#xD;
      The oxygenation target is primarily assessed by peripheral saturation (SpO2) as measured by&#xD;
      pulse oximetry and only in case of unreliable reading the oxygenation will be assessed by the&#xD;
      arterial blood oxygen pressure (PaO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in whom the risk of severe hypoxemia could be become unacceptable during the&#xD;
      trial (e.g., in patients who develop: ongoing cardiac ischemia due to cardiac infarction and&#xD;
      failed revascularization, delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage, increased&#xD;
      and uncontrollable intracranial pressure (of ≥ 18 mmHg), necrotizing fasciitis or severe&#xD;
      untreatable anemia such as with Jehovah's Witnesses), the target ranges for oxygenation can&#xD;
      be increased to SpO2 and PaO2 of 94% to 96%, and 9 kPa to 11.5 kPa, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - In all patients who receive assist ventilation, three times a day it should be tested&#xD;
      whether the patient accepts assisted ventilation; this should also be tried when a patient&#xD;
      shows respiratory muscle activity during assist ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attending physician decides when to tracheally extubate a patient, based on general&#xD;
      extubation criteria (i.e. responsive and cooperative, adequate cough reflex, adequate&#xD;
      oxygenation with FiO2 ≤ 0.4, hemodynamically stable, no uncontrolled arrhythmia and a rectal&#xD;
      temperature &gt; 36 Celsius and after successfully passing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)&#xD;
      with a T-piece or ventilation with minimal support (pressure support level &lt; 10 cm H2O) and&#xD;
      FiO2 ≤ 0.4. In case SBTs are used, an SBT is judged as successful when the following criteria&#xD;
      are met for at least 30 minutes, the attending physician takes the final decision for&#xD;
      extubation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory rate &lt; 35/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral oxygen saturation &gt; 90%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase &lt; 20% of heart rate and blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No signs of anxiety and diaphoresis In case a patient needs to be re-intubated and&#xD;
           ventilated, the PEEP level is set as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation follows the local guidelines for sedation in each participating unit. In general,&#xD;
      these guidelines favor the use of analgo-sedation over hypno-sedation, use of bolus over&#xD;
      continuous infusion of sedating agents, and the use of sedation scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The statistical analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. In addition,&#xD;
           a per-protocol analysis will be performed to check for robustness of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days and alive at day 28 after ICU&#xD;
           admission. The null hypothesis entails that ventilation with the 'restricted PEEP'-arm&#xD;
           is inferior by a margin of 10% to ventilation with the 'liberal PEEP'-arm. If the 95% CI&#xD;
           upper bound for inferiority of the 'restricted PEEP'-arm is &lt;10%, the null hypothesis of&#xD;
           inferiority is rejected. If the non-inferiority criterion is satisfied, then a secondary&#xD;
           analysis of the primary endpoint for superiority will be tested. With an appropriate&#xD;
           nonparametric analysis method the confidence interval for the difference between the two&#xD;
           medians of the ventilator free days from both PEEP arms will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous normally distributed variables will be expressed by their mean and standard&#xD;
           deviation or, when not normally distributed, as medians and their interquartile ranges.&#xD;
           Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Differences&#xD;
           between groups in continuous variables will be analyzed with Students t-test or if&#xD;
           continuous data is not normally distributed, the Mann-Whitney U test will be used.&#xD;
           Categorical variables will be compared with the Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test,&#xD;
           as appropriate. Time-dependent data will be expressed with Kaplan-Meier curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost-effectiveness analysis. Alongside the proposed RCT a prospective economic study&#xD;
           will be performed. The economic evaluation primarily focuses on the possible gained&#xD;
           benefits of ventilation with restricted PEEP versus liberal PEEP and the associated&#xD;
           healthcare costs within 28 days (the primary outcome of the RCT). Incremental Cost&#xD;
           Effectiveness Ratios (ICER) will be calculated by extra costs per TISS/NAS point, a&#xD;
           valuable score reflecting workload and resource utilization in daily ICU practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A budget impact analysis (BIA) will be designed and executed according to the ISPOR&#xD;
           guidelines. The BIA will evaluate the nationwide economic/financial consequences of the&#xD;
           adoption of treating non-ARDS patients at the ICU with ventilation with restricted PEEP&#xD;
           level or liberal PEEP level in the future. The analysis will be based on the decrease in&#xD;
           ICU costs (e.g. ventilator free days and alive at day 28) as estimated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudies of the RELAx study ('RELAxECHO', 'RELAxLUS' and 'RELAxBiomarkers') are performed&#xD;
      in patients admitted to the ICU of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam and who are&#xD;
      enrolled in the RELAx study. The protocol of each substudy is described in the appendices of&#xD;
      the RELAx protocol: appendix IV 'RELAxECHO'; appendix V 'RELAxLUS' and appendix VI&#xD;
      'RELAxBiomarkers'. The link to the RELAx protocol including the appendices for substudies can&#xD;
      be found under 'references'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment of RELAx patient in the substudies started on 25th July 2018, 25th July 2018 and&#xD;
      4th December 2018 in the Academic Medical Center.&#xD;
