  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess whether the hospital-based, adaptive behavioral&#xD;
      intervention strategy promotes treatment entry and reduces risk of additional&#xD;
      substance-exposed pregnancies (SEPs), as well as HIV and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) risks among&#xD;
      substance-using NICU mothers. Additionally, to assess whether the intervention increases use&#xD;
      of professional obstetrical/gynecological resources for contraception to reduce&#xD;
      substance-exposed pregnancies (SEPs).&#xD;
