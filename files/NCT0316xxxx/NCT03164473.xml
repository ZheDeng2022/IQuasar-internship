  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate, after achievement of remission, the efficacy of&#xD;
      rituximab compared with azathioprine maintenance therapy on duration of remission, in&#xD;
      patients with relapsing or newly-diagnosed Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis EPGA&#xD;
      receiving standard of care therapy including glucocorticoid therapy reduction/withdrawal.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has been shown to be as effective as&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide to induce GPA and MPA remission, with an acceptable safety profile, leading&#xD;
      to its registration by the FDA and EMA as remission-induction therapy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the MAINRITSAN trial has demonstrated that 500 mg rituximab given every 6 months&#xD;
      for 18 months was significantly more effective than azathioprine standard of care to maintain&#xD;
      remission in patients with GPA or MPA, with a similar profile of tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGPA patients were excluded from these trials. Long-term studies have shown that only 29% of&#xD;
      EGPA patients achieved long-term remission and that relapses occurred in more than 40% of&#xD;
      them, leading to high cumulative morbidity and damage. Moreover, most patients cannot be&#xD;
      weaned off corticosteroids due to asthma and rhino-sinusal manifestations, even after&#xD;
      vasculitis remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, recent retrospective series indicated that rituximab may also be an effective&#xD;
      remission induction and maintenance agent in refractory or relapsing EGPA. REOVAS, the first&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with rituximab as induction therapy in EGPA, has started within&#xD;
      the French Vasculitis Study Group network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MAINRITSEG trial is a phase III, comparative, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      double-dummy and superiority trial, comparing pre-emptive low-dose rituximab-based regimen&#xD;
      with azathioprine standard therapy, for the remission maintenance in newly-diagnosed or&#xD;
      relapsing EGPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, with newly diagnosed or relapsing EGPA, after achievement of remission, will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard regimen: maintenance oral azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) for 24 months. This&#xD;
           control group will receive conventional therapy plus 4 infusions of placebo-rituximab&#xD;
           (every 6 months for 18 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental regimen: pre-emptive 500-mg fixed-dose of rituximab every 6 months for 18&#xD;
           months (4 infusions). This group will receive intravenous rituximab plus orally&#xD;
           placebo-azathioprine for 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard of care therapy including glucocorticoid therapy&#xD;
      reduction/withdrawal.&#xD;
