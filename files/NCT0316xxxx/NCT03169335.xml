  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the similarity between QL1101 and Avastin®&#xD;
      respectively combined with chemotherapy in terms of efficacy and safety in patients with&#xD;
      non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The study intends to include first-line patients&#xD;
      with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and uses QL1101 combined with basic&#xD;
      chemotherapy CP (paclitaxel + carboplatin). The regimen is consistent with the usage and&#xD;
      dosage of Avastin® at home and abroad indicated for the treatment of non-squamous non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      The study is a randomized, double-blind, positive drug-controlled, multi-center Phase III&#xD;
      study. It is planned to enroll 512 treatment-naïve patients with non-squamous non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Subjects are randomized into the QL1101 combined with&#xD;
      paclitaxel/carboplatin or Avastin® combined with paclitaxel/carboplatin treatment group by a&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1, and stratified by age (≥65 years, &lt;65 years), sex (male, female) and EGFR&#xD;
      subtype (sensitive mutation type, wild type).&#xD;
