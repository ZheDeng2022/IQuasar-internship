  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy of the acellular porcine derived&#xD;
      collagen matrix (PADM) in comparison with connective tissue graft (SCTG ) in the treatment of&#xD;
      multiple adjacent gingival recessions (MAGR). The primary objectives of the study were to&#xD;
      evaluate mean and complete roots coverage. Additionally, the secondary objective was to&#xD;
      evaluate and compare the clinical effectiveness of PADM and SCTG for the treatment of MAGR&#xD;
      defects applying modified coronally advanced tunnel technique (MCAT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of multiple adjacent gingival recessions (MAGR) still presents a challenge for the&#xD;
      clinician. The management of soft tissues becomes more complicated and the wound healing may&#xD;
      be compromised by a variety of factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the available medical databases, predictable root coverage is possible for&#xD;
      multiple-tooth recession defects using subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG)&#xD;
      procedures. However, alternative materials to SCTG are supported by evidence of varying&#xD;
      strength, with the need for additional research to confirm their performance and success&#xD;
      rate. Because of that, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy of the&#xD;
      acellular porcine derived collagen matrix (PADM) in comparison with connective tissue graft&#xD;
      (SCTG ) in the treatment of multiple adjacent gingival recessions (MAGR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomised controlled clinical trial of 12 months duration. Sixteen patients&#xD;
      with a total of 81 MAGR Miller's Class I or II were enrolled in this study. Recessions were&#xD;
      randomly treated with PADM and SCTG, combined with a modified coronally advanced tunnel&#xD;
      technique (MCAT). Several parameters, such as gingival recession coverage (RC), keratinized&#xD;
      tissue width (KTW), keratinized tissue thickness (KTT) and clinical attachment level (CAL)&#xD;
      were recorded at baseline and one year postoperatively. Healing index (HI) was registered on&#xD;
      1st, 2nd, and 3rd-week post-surgery in order to estimate healing events.&#xD;

    <description>Following local anaesthesia (Articaine hydrochloride 4% with 1:200,000 epinephrine injection) administration, sulcular incisions were made in the recession's areas of teeth without damaging interdental papilla. Mucoperiosteal (MP) dissections were made using the periostal elevator creating the deep pouch beyond the mucogingival junction so that the (MP) flap could be moved coronally without tension. Porcine-derived acellular dermal collagen matrix (PADM) was positioned at the level of a cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) and skin tight for teeth to avoid forming a blood clot. Separate single sutures per tooth with 5-0 resorbable suture were used to stabilise graft. The tunnel flap was positioned coronally above the CEJ to completely cover the graft and sutured with non-resorbable polypropylene suture.</description>
