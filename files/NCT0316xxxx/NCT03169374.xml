      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of virtual reality for&#xD;
      anxiety treatment in mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanically ventilated patients (those on a breathing machine) often experience heightened&#xD;
      levels of anxiety and discomfort. This is usually treated by using sedative medications,&#xD;
      however these drugs often have unintended side effects. This study will investigate the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of using relaxing virtual reality environments for reduction of&#xD;
      anxiety in mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;
