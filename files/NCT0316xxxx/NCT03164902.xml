    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the ability of digital medicines, Proteus Discover, to promote adherence&#xD;
      and thus achieving a cure for hepatitis C in patients at high risk for not adhering to their&#xD;
      hepatitis therapy. In this single-arm, prospective study, subjects at high risk for&#xD;
      nonadherence will be prescribed hepatitis C therapy that will be co-encapsulated with&#xD;
      ingestible sensors (creating the digital medicine) by a pharmacy. Both the subject and the&#xD;
      providers will have access to the ingestion adherence.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a preventable and curable blood-borne virus. Adherence to HCV&#xD;
      therapies is essential to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) or cure. New&#xD;
      direct-acting agents (DAA) are now available, such as fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir&#xD;
      and sofosbuvir, which is given once daily with or without ribavirin to treat HCV infection in&#xD;
      8-12 weeks, which can cure hepatitis C with a once daily regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      which is given once daily with or without ribavirin to treat HCV infection in 8-12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providers and third-party payers are concerned that patients use these high-cost therapies as&#xD;
      prescribed and obtain the intended value of their treatment, so as to prevent otherwise&#xD;
      avoidable medicine wastage and re-treatment. Some HCV-infected patients are currently&#xD;
      excluded from using the newer direct-acting therapies because they are considered to have a&#xD;
      high risk of not completing their intended treatment, or they do not have access to care due&#xD;
      to other issues like transportation difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, third party payers and providers have proposed to assess patient adherence&#xD;
      during treatment with HCV RNA level and additional adherence assessments. However,&#xD;
      determining adherence to anti-viral therapy based upon decreases that are observed in RNA&#xD;
      titers at intermittent intervals, or periodic assessments of medication use, subsequent to&#xD;
      therapy initiation are indirect and retrospective. Additionally, this practice can be a&#xD;
      burden for patients, especially those who live far away from their providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteus Discover™ provides wirelessly observed therapy (WOT) for passive direct, timely&#xD;
      confirmation of medication ingestion. Proteus Discover includes a FDA cleared and CE-marked&#xD;
      device, which consists of three components: 1) an Ingestible Sensor (IS) embedded inside of a&#xD;
      placebo pill, which can be co-encapsulated with prescribed medication (CEM); 2) a wearable&#xD;
      sensor patch (herein referred to as the Proteus Patch), which passively detects and stores&#xD;
      time-stamped CEM ingestions, as well as physiological and behavioral metrics such as heart&#xD;
      rate and activity patterns (e.g., step count, time spent in physical activity, number of&#xD;
      hours of rest); and 3) software to aggregate and display Proteus Patch data. The offering&#xD;
      also includes the Proteus Discover App, which allows the subject to review and interact with&#xD;
      the data via a mobile device. Providers can view the data via the Proteus Discover Portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide WOT in this study, the Proteus Ingestible Sensor pill will be placed in a capsule&#xD;
      along with HCV medication by the patient's pharmacy to create a digital medicine version of&#xD;
      the therapy. The adhesive wearable sensor patch worn by the patient on the left lower torso&#xD;
      will be used for detection of CEM ingestions which are then displayed on a mobile application&#xD;
      for the patient, and on a web portal for physicians and the study healthcare teams to assist&#xD;
      them in identifying when support for the subject may be needed for taking medication&#xD;
      consistently.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Note: None of the five individual sub-criteria (i.e., 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, or 3e)&#xD;
                       alone may be used to qualify more than approximately 20% of the total study&#xD;
                       population for randomization. For example, &quot;3d&quot; may be used to qualify no&#xD;

                       additional sub-criteria also being met (e.g., &quot;3d&quot; + &quot;3a&quot;). The data center&#xD;
                       will monitor the use of these five enrolment sub-criteria, and study sites&#xD;
                       will be notified when qualification for enrollment may no longer be based&#xD;
                       upon meeting only a specific one of the five sub-criteria alone (e.g., &quot;3d&quot;&#xD;
