      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crohn s disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease. It causes inflammation of the gut.&#xD;
      Symptoms may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. CD has&#xD;
      no cure, but symptoms can sometimes be controlled with medicine. Researchers want to see if&#xD;
      it is safe to treat CD with the medicine vorinostat. It is thought that vorinostat may reduce&#xD;
      the inflammation process of CD. This may then help to relieve symptoms of CD. Participants&#xD;
      who respond to Vorinostat will be invited to an extension phase of treatment with Vorinostat&#xD;
      and possibly a maintenance treatment using Ustekinumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if vorinostat is safe for people with moderate-to-severe CD. To see if it is safe for&#xD;
      people with moderate-to-sever CD to receive maintenance therapy using Ustekinumab after&#xD;
      successful treatment of Vorinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18-65 with moderate-to-severe CD that medicine is not controlling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I is screening. It may last 120 days. Participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of blood, urine, and stool samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculosis skin test&#xD;
&#xD;
      They may have a colonoscopy and lymphapheresis collection. These will be explained in a&#xD;
      separate consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will keep a diary of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II is treatment using Vorinostat. It will take 12-13 weeks. Participants will take the&#xD;
      study drug by mouth twice daily for 12 weeks. They will get a weekly phone call to talk about&#xD;
      how the drug makes them feel. They will have blood taken regularly. Every 4 weeks, they will&#xD;
      have a check-up that will repeat some screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III extension treatment of Vorinostat for an additional 6 months for those who respond&#xD;
      to vorinostat and it is safe for them to continue treatment. Participants will continue to&#xD;
      receive weekly calls to talk about how the drug makes them feel. They will have blood taken&#xD;
      regularly. Every 3 months, they will have a check-up that will repeat some screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IV: is maintenance therapy for 2 years with Ustekinumab. Participants will receive a&#xD;
      one time loading dose of ustekinumab, and then will receive the approved maintenance dose&#xD;
      once every 8 weeks, at which time they will return to the NIH Clinical Center for evaluation.&#xD;
      The participant will get a phone call 3 days after each dose and again 2 weeks later to see&#xD;
      how the drug makes them feel. After two years of receiving treatment with ustekinumab the&#xD;
      participant will have an end of study visit, where some of the screening tests, including a&#xD;
      colonoscopy, will be repeated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn s Disease (CD), a major sub-type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a chronic,&#xD;
      life-long condition characterized by relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      tract. Despite recent advances in IBD therapeutics, a significant number of patients with CD&#xD;
      continue to have significant symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prior studies, it has been demonstrated that epigenetic modifications of the genome are&#xD;
      associated with and may contribute to the pathogenesis of various disease entities. One type&#xD;
      of epigenetic modification involves acetylation and deacetylation of histones, mediated by&#xD;
      histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Acetylation and&#xD;
      deacetylation of histones regulates the affinity of histones for DNA, thus modulating the&#xD;
      accessibility of transcription factors to gene promoters and enhancer sites. Of interest in&#xD;
      this context is evidence that epigenetic modifications brought about by HDAC inhibitors&#xD;
      (HDACi), i.e., agents that cause hyperacetylation of histones, can limit the course of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal inflammation. One naturally occurring HDAC inhibitor, the bacterial product&#xD;
      butyrate, has been shown to have effects on gene transcription that regulate potentially&#xD;
      deleterious pro-inflammatory responses to microbiota in the gut environment. It has been&#xD;
      shown that treatment of dendritic cells and macrophages with butyrate leads to&#xD;
      down-regulation of lipopolysaccharide induced pro-inflammatory mediators such as nitric&#xD;
      oxide, IL-6 and IL-12. In addition, butyrate has been shown to enhance the differentiation of&#xD;
      intestinal Foxp3-positive T cells (T regulatory T cell (Treg) development that then modulates&#xD;
      GI inflammation and contributes to mucosal homeostasis. Along the same lines, another HDAC&#xD;
      inhibitor, vorinostat, has been shown to ameliorate graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) affecting&#xD;
      the GI tract in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. This&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect was also attributable to increased Treg activity, suggesting that&#xD;
      vorinostat, like butyrate, decreases inflammation by enhancing the activity of cells with the&#xD;
      capacity to down- regulate immune responses. The effect of vorinostat on Treg cell expansion&#xD;
      in this study was particularly notable because it suggested that Treg cell numbers can be&#xD;
      increased by agents that have an intrinsic effect on the transcription of key Treg cell&#xD;
      transcription factors. On this basis, treatment of patients with inflammatory and autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases by influencing Treg cell numbers may be a more effective than alternative existing&#xD;
      methods of inducing Treg cell expansion such as administration of purified Tregs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol we propose a proof of concept clinical trial to study the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of vorinostat (100 mg PO BID for 36 weeks) in treating 20 individuals with&#xD;
      moderate-to- severe CD who have not been controlled by standard maintenance therapy. This&#xD;
      will be accomplished in Phase II (12 weeks of treatment) and Phase III (36 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment). We will assess the effectiveness of vorinostat by evaluating changes in symptom&#xD;
      scores, endoscopic/histologic findings, and immunologic/laboratory parameters. The&#xD;
      participant will return to the NIH CC after starting treatment on week 4, week 8, and week 24&#xD;
      for assessment of safety labs and testing of clinical response. On Week 12 and week 36&#xD;
      participants will return to the NIH CC for assessment of safety labs and testing of clinical&#xD;
      and immunologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Crohn s disease most patients have alternating periods of relapse and remission with half&#xD;
      of patients requiring surgery within 10 years of diagnosis on present maintenance therapy.&#xD;
      Therefore, the approach to treatment must also evolve from induction control of symptoms to&#xD;
      preventing progression of the disease with maintenance therapy. Thus, treatments that safely&#xD;
      maintain long-term remission are essential. Treatment guidelines for Crohn s disease&#xD;
      recommend maintenance therapy after remission is achieved, particularly for moderate- to-high&#xD;
      risk patients. Potential benefits include reduction in hospitalization and surgery and&#xD;
      improved quality of life. Long-term efficacy has been studied with&#xD;
      azathioprine/mercaptopurine, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, and&#xD;
      vedolizumab. Although TNF antagonists have significantly advanced the care of Crohn s&#xD;
      disease, their efficacy is limited and the development of anti-drug antibodies is associated&#xD;
      with loss of response in maintenance therapy. In addition, potential significant side effects&#xD;
      of maintenance treatments include bone marrow suppression malignancy and serious infections.&#xD;
      Therefore, a need exists for safer agents that have demonstrated improved long-term&#xD;
      maintenance efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut inflammation complicating Crohn s disease has been characterized as a T helper type 1&#xD;
      (Th1)/T helper type 17 (Th17) inflammatory response, with excess IL-12, IL-23 cytokine&#xD;
      production leading to the generation of excessive IFN-g and IL-17. Ustekinumab, a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody to the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, is currently FDA approved for the treatment&#xD;
      of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, and moderately to&#xD;
      severely active CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior clinical trials have demonstrated long-term efficacy and safety profile of ustekinumab&#xD;
      in psoriasis. Similarly, the long-term efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in Crohn s disease&#xD;
      dosing had been established in the UNITI trial studies (up to 44 week treatment) in patients&#xD;
      who have failed TNF antagonists or other conventional therapies. These studies demonstrated&#xD;
      significant response rates and induction of remission rates with a positive safety profile.&#xD;
      Studies addressing long term maintenance efficacy of ustekinumab in patients that are in&#xD;
      remission have not been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present protocol (Phase IV), Crohn s disease patients that have achieved either a&#xD;
      defined clinical response or are in remission with vorinostat will then be enrolled to&#xD;
      receive long term maintenance treatment with ustekinumab. Participants will receive a weight-&#xD;
      based IV loading dose of ustekinumab followed by administration of maintenance doses of 90 mg&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) every 8 weeks with participants followed over a 2-year period.&#xD;
