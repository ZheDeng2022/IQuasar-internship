      Neurocognitive disorders are still highly prevalent in the HAART era; despite a dramatic&#xD;
      reduction in dementia cases, 15-50% of patients may develop mild or asymptomatic&#xD;
      neurocognitive disorders (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, HAND).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among other hypothesis neurotoxicity of antiretrovirals has been postulated but its impact is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that using drugs with reduced in vitro neurotoxicity may improve cognition&#xD;
      in HIV-positive patients withHAND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      76 patients with HAND will be randomized to either continue their treatment or switch to&#xD;
      emtricitabine, darunavir/cobicistat, maraviroc. Patients will be re-tested 6 months later.&#xD;

      Scientific Rationale for Study / Scientific Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive disorders are still highly prevalent in the HAART era; despite a dramatic&#xD;
      reduction in dementia cases, 15-50% of patients may develop mild or asymptomatic&#xD;
      neurocognitive disorders (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, HAND). It should be&#xD;
      highlighted that patients presenting no abnormalities in everyday living activities&#xD;
      (asymptomatic neurocognitive disorders, ANI) are at higher risk of worse results in&#xD;
      performance-based tests, adherence-based measures and they show a significant risk of&#xD;
      progressing to more severe forms of impairment. Excluding significantly confounding&#xD;
      comorbidities, several factors have been associated with this neurocognitive decline&#xD;
      including a low nadir CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, a high HIV DNA, a lower compartmental viral&#xD;
      control, a lower concentration/penetration effectiveness score, a lower efficacy in&#xD;
      macrophage-derived cells and antiretroviral-generated neuronal toxicity. However several data&#xD;
      point out that vascular abnormalities, very common in HIV-positive patients, may deeply&#xD;
      influence neurocognitive disorders development and severity: of note, intima media thickness,&#xD;
      a well recognized proxy of systemic atherosclerosis, was associated with HAND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of HAND diagnosis, the only recommended approach is to optimize treatment according&#xD;
      to plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resistance tests; no strategy is currently suggested&#xD;
      in case of suppressed plasma and CSF HIV RNA or in case of low level CSF HIV RNA (without&#xD;
      evidence of genotypic resistance). It has been postulated that antiretrovirals may have&#xD;
      neurotoxic effects through different mechanisms and such effects might become evident once&#xD;
      the beneficial effect of HIV RNA suppression vanishes. Available data suggest that, in vitro,&#xD;
      the drugs associated with the least neurotoxic effect were emtricitabine, tenofovir,&#xD;
      darunavir and maraviroc. Furthermore, several pieces of evidence and a small randomized trial&#xD;
      suggest that maraviroc, in HAART-treated subjects may have beneficial effects in terms of&#xD;
      improved neurocognitive function, reduced CSF inflammatory biomarkers and improved MRI&#xD;
      markers of neuronal integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study has so far investigated the effect of using drugs with a low neurotoxic profile in&#xD;
      HAART-treated patients with HAND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of the study is the variation in neurocognitive tests (global deficit&#xD;
      score), 6 months after treatment switch while secondary objectives include the improvement in&#xD;
      other biomarkers of neuronal and vascular integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized, controlled, pilot study. HIV-positive patients that fulfill the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and that sign the informed consent will be enrolled. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 (block randomization) to either continue their treatment or to switch to&#xD;
      once-daily emtricitabine (200 mg) plus darunavir/cobicistat (800/150 mg) plus maraviroc (300&#xD;
      mg). A lumbar puncture will be performed 6 months after treatment switch.&#xD;
