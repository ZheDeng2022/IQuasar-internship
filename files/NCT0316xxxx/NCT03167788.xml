  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The REDJUVENATE Trial proposes to test the hypothesis that postoperative organ injury and&#xD;
      inflammation will be less if patients undergoing cardiac surgery who are at risk of large&#xD;
      volume blood transfusion (defined as the administration of ≥4 units of red cells) receive&#xD;
      rejuvenated washed cells compared to standard care (unwashed aged stored cells).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the REDJUVENATE trial, we propose to establish whether the administration of rejuvenated&#xD;
      red cells will reduce inflammation and organ injury in cardiac surgery patients at risk of&#xD;
      large volume blood transfusion when compared to standard care. Organ injury and sepsis&#xD;
      accounts for the majority of all deaths following cardiac surgery. Once organ injury is&#xD;
      established care is primarily supportive and there are no effective treatments. Prevention is&#xD;
      therefore a key clinical strategy to prevent death, morbidity and high healthcare costs&#xD;
      attributable to these complications. Sepsis and inflammatory organ injury are also the&#xD;
      principal causes of death following paediatric cardiac surgery, trauma, non-cardiac complex&#xD;
      surgical procedures and in critical care; clinical settings that are also among the principal&#xD;
      consumers of blood components. National and international blood management strategies are&#xD;
      focused on these patients. Evidence of a clinical benefit attributable to the use of&#xD;
      rejuvenated red cells in cardiac surgery patients is therefore likely to translate into more&#xD;
      widespread benefits to patients and the National Health Service (NHS).&#xD;
