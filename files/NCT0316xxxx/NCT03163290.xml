  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral Pain (PFP) is one of the most common disorders that affecting the physically&#xD;
      active population, and its incidence is higher among women. Despite the high incidence, the&#xD;
      etiologies of this painful syndrome are still unclear. Research has verified the influence of&#xD;
      hip stabilizers on knee injurie and has demonstrated a deficit of strength of the hip lateral&#xD;
      rotator, abductors and extensors muscles in patients with PFP. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of strengthening the Posterolateral Hip Complex with the&#xD;
      Anteromedial Hip Complex associated with quadriceps strengthening for pain reduction and&#xD;
      improvement of functional capacity in patients with PFP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The physical therapy sessions will average duration of one hour, often twice a week for six&#xD;
      weeks. The exercise intensity will be monitored by the physiotherapist as determined by the&#xD;
      participant's ability to complete 10 repetitions for a particular exercise and its difficulty&#xD;
      of execution perceived by the modified Borg scale (CR-10). The exercises are performed with&#xD;
      load between 60-80% of their capacity, the load will be increased from 2 to 10% when the&#xD;
      patient can perform 14 full repetitions in the last series. It will be set to 30 seconds of&#xD;
      rest between reps and 2 minutes between sets of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will perform prior heating exercises bike for 5 minutes with moderate intensity&#xD;
      with the Borg scale. Then there will be one stretche repetitions held for 45 seconds of&#xD;
      muscle groups: hamstrings, quadriceps, abductors, adductors and gastrocnemius. Thus, they&#xD;
      will be performed strengthening exercises in extension and knee in open kinetic chain and&#xD;
      squat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Posterolateral Hip Complex (PLC) add hip abduction exercise, Clam exercise and external&#xD;
      rotation exercise. Studies prior point out that these exercises are among those withhigher&#xD;
      electromyographic activity of the gluteus medius and maximus muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Anteromedial Hip Complex (AMC) add hip adduction exercise, adduction with a ring between&#xD;
      the thighs and internal rotation exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercises will be carried out to load 60-80% of 1 repetition maximum 8-12 reps, 1-3 sets&#xD;
      and 2-3 times a week. All exercises are performed without worsening pain and intensity of&#xD;
      exercise will be controlled according to the perceived exertion scale of Borg.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The dynamic knee valgus was assessed by the FPPA during the forward step-down test filmed with a digital camera (60 fps). FPPA was measured by the angle formed by the intersection of the lines between the anterior superior iliac spine and the center of the malleoli at the center of the femoral condyles. The step height was normalized to 10% of the height of each participant. All participants performed two training tests and three valid tests, with a five-second cadence for each test. The FPPA was calculated at the time of the heel touch on the ground by the Kinovea® Video Editor program. We considered a positive value as dynamic valgus and a negative value as dynamic varus.</description>
