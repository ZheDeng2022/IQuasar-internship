    <textblock>
      AposTherapy is a home based exercise program utilizing footwear that causes exercise with&#xD;
      normal activity that may significantly improve function in patients with back pain since&#xD;
      patients with back pain have altered mechanics of motion contributing or due to the presence&#xD;
      of the conditions. Capitalizing on the reported excellent adherence and clinical benefit of&#xD;
      ApostTherapy in patients with significant knee and back pain, we propose to evaluate this as&#xD;
      a conservative treatment that may supplant/supplement traditional pain medications and&#xD;
      physical therapy in an at-risk urban inner city population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      AposTherapy® is a home-based exercise program utilizing footwear that causes exercise with&#xD;
      normal daily activity that may significantly improve function in patients with back pain in&#xD;
      general, and specifically Axial Low Back Pain (NSLBP). Capitalizing on the reported excellent&#xD;
      adherence and clinical benefit of Apos Therapy in patients with significant back pain, we&#xD;
      propose to evaluate this as a conservative treatment that may supplant/supplement traditional&#xD;
      pain medications and physical therapy in NSLBP population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible potential use of AposTherapy® as a replacement for traditional physical therapy&#xD;
      may yield a less costly, more effective therapy with better adherence. Problems with&#xD;
      traditional therapy include poor patient adherence to both outpatient and home therapy&#xD;
      programs, the added cost of travel (which may be more than $100 per session for ambulette or&#xD;
      access-a-ride for eligible patients), and the lack of continuation in an ongoing exercise&#xD;
      program[6-8], all of which can lead to relapse and need for retreatment. Additionally, access&#xD;
      to physical therapy is limited for many patients since there are not enough available&#xD;
      outpatient therapy services to meet the needs of all patients. Finding an alternative&#xD;
      exercise program that will increase adherence, decrease total therapy visits, and improve&#xD;
      patient's outcomes with decreased dependence on pain medications is a high priority from both&#xD;
      patient care and cost management perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AposTherapy® potentially overcomes many of these issues by improving/modifying abnormal&#xD;
      biomechanics (therefore decreasing pain), and providing an independent home-based exercise&#xD;
      program utilizing footwear that causes exercise with normal activity by promoting&#xD;
      perturbation. This biomechanical approach may significantly reduce pain and improve function&#xD;
      in patients with nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP). Capitalizing on the reported excellent&#xD;
      adherence and clinical benefit of AposTherapy® in patients with significant NSLBP, we propose&#xD;
      to evaluate the biomechanical exercise (wearing an appropriately calibrated shoe at home for&#xD;
      a prescribed amount of time each day) as a conservative treatment that may supplement or&#xD;
      supplant traditional pain medications, interventional pain procedures and physical therapy in&#xD;
      an at-risk urban inner city population with NSLBP.&#xD;
