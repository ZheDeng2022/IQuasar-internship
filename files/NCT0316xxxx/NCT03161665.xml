  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic cell transplantation (BMT), or commonly referred to as blood and marrow&#xD;
      transplantation (BMT), is a potentially life-saving therapy for many malignant and&#xD;
      non-malignant conditions. Despite advances over the past decade, which have led to improved&#xD;
      outcomes, BMT remains an intense treatment modality often requiring prolonged&#xD;
      inpatient--based care. While many patients endure the acute complications of the procedure,&#xD;
      it is common for BMT patients and their caregivers to experience increased risk of financial&#xD;
      and emotional burden, hospital readmission, and health service utilization. This highlights&#xD;
      the importance of active involvement of BMT patients in their own health care&#xD;
      (self--efficacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the intense nature of BMT, however, caregivers also play a critical role in the process&#xD;
      and are a necessary component of proceeding with transplant. As such, caregiver activation on&#xD;
      behalf of the patient plays a critical role in effective patient--caregiver-provider&#xD;
      partnerships, which is increasingly recognized as the optimal model for health care delivery,&#xD;
      particularly for those facing life--altering medical treatments. It is essential to develop&#xD;
      effective strategies to enhance this partnership. Health information technology (IT)-mediated&#xD;
      tools offer the potential to overcome constraints in health care delivery limited by provider&#xD;
      time, complicated health information, and financial pressures. Significant gaps in knowledge&#xD;
      exist on the use of health IT tools using low- cost and well- accepted delivery platforms in&#xD;
      routine inpatient care, especially for high- risk or critically ill populations. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that a tablet--based tool displaying personal health information could provide a&#xD;
      platform to promote caregiver activation and enhance health communication.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be recruited by BMT RN Coordinators and physicians prior to patient&#xD;
             admission to the BMT Unit. Caregiver (age 18 years or older) of any patient eligible&#xD;
             to undergo autologous or allogeneic BMT and any patient (age 18 years or older)&#xD;
             eligible to undergo autologous or allogeneic BMT will be recruited during the&#xD;
             &quot;Pre-Transplant Work-up&quot; stage in the outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CAREGIVER PARTICIPANTS: Caregiver (age 18 years or older) of a patient who will be&#xD;
             hospitalized to undergo first-time autologous (self) or allogeneic (alternative donor)&#xD;
             BMT in the University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital BMT Unit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PATIENT PARTICIPANTS: Patients (age 18 years or older) who will be hospitalized to&#xD;
             undergo first-time autologous or allogeneic BMT will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
             assent/consent and participate in the study. With his/her permission, the patient will&#xD;
             also be provided with their own iPad® BMT Roadmap information system to use.&#xD;
             Qualitative interviews will be conducted in patients with their assent/consent.&#xD;
