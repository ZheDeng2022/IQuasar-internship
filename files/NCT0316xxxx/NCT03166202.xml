    <textblock>
      Previous work collectively suggests that rod-mediated dark adaptation (RMDA) is a promising&#xD;
      candidate as a functional endpoint measure for evaluating interventions to slow early&#xD;
      progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, there is no agreement among&#xD;
      the clinical, research and regulatory communities as to what constitutes a clinically&#xD;
      (practically) significant slowing in RMDA. Treatments for AMD are often not considered&#xD;
      efficacious if they do not result in a criterion level of improvement in vision. But how much&#xD;
      change in the rate of dark adaptation constitutes a clinically significant change? Until this&#xD;
      issue is resolved, progress in developing clinical trials on early AMD are at a standstill&#xD;
      since there is no functional endpoint to be used in the trial. One approach to establishing&#xD;
      clinical significance is to examine how RMDA relates to the performance of an everyday visual&#xD;
      task under low luminance conditions, such as night driving or reading. However, such data are&#xD;
      not yet available. The purpose of this project is to examine the relationship between RMDA&#xD;
      and night-time driving and reading under poor illumination. This information will guide the&#xD;
      development of a definition of a clinically significant difference in RMDA that can be used&#xD;
      in designing clinical trials on early AMD.&#xD;

      The specific aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine the association between RMDA as assessed by the rod intercept time and self&#xD;
      reported driving difficulty and experiences during night time driving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine the association between RMDA as assessed by rod intercept time and reading&#xD;
      performance as assessed by the MNREAD test administered under a low light level. Reading&#xD;
      performance will be defined in terms of maximum reading speed, critical print size (i.e., the&#xD;
      smallest print size that supports maximum reading speed), reading acuity (i.e., the smallest&#xD;
      print size that can be just read) and the reading accessibility index (i.e., an individual's&#xD;
      access to text over the range of print sizes found in everyday life).&#xD;
