    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide.The main cause of cancer&#xD;
      related death is the invasion and metastasis. The usual site of spread outside the breast is&#xD;
      to lymph nodes in the axilla.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of axillary metastasis is important for prognosis and determining of treatment&#xD;
      plan, so identification of axillary metastasis in early stage newly diagnosed breast cancer&#xD;
      is important for staging of disease and treatment. However, approximately 40% of women who&#xD;
      presents with early stage breast cancer also have axillary metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The status of lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer used to be evaluated with axillary&#xD;
      lymph node dissection. During the last 15 years, sentinel lymph node biopsy has replaced for&#xD;
      grading of patients with clinically lymph node negative breast cancer. Despite being a less&#xD;
      invasive method when compared to axillary lymph node dissection, sentinel lymph node biopsy&#xD;
      also leads to complications such as lymphedema, seroma, localized swelling, pain,&#xD;
      paresthesia, decrease in arm strength, infectious neuropathy and shoulder stiffness in 20% of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging modalities for assessing the axillary lymph nodes are rapidly evolving.&#xD;
      Ultrasound is applied widely for its convincing and dynamic observation. However, the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for lymph node metastasis were unreliable and&#xD;
      controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Owing to radiation and relative lower diagnostic accuracy, computed tomography is limited in&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography and positron emission tomography/computed tomography can reflect&#xD;
      metabolism of glycolytic activity. Undoubtedly, they have shown the higher diagnostic&#xD;
      significance in assessing distant metastasis and regional metastatic axillary lymph nodes,&#xD;
      but their high radiation and expensive fee keep the common people away. Ultrasmall super&#xD;
      paramagnetic iron oxide is the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging is developing with an unimaginable speed. Over the past years, it&#xD;
      has been used to evaluate axillary lymph nodes. Its sensitivity and specificity for&#xD;
      metastatic axillary lymph nodes were higher than ultrasound and computed tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion weighted imaging is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging application which&#xD;
      derives its image contrast from the differences in water mobility in the extracellular&#xD;
      spaces, reflecting cellular density, organization, microstructure and microcirculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that diffusion weighted imaging can serve as a powerful tool for&#xD;
      differentiating benign from malignant breast lesions. In addition to this use, diffusion&#xD;
      weighted imaging may also be used in the assessment of axillary lymph nodes, since they show&#xD;
      similar tissue characteristics to the primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of lymph nodes is a promising novel application of diffusion weighted imaging ,&#xD;
      which can easily be applied as an adjunct to conventional breast magnetic resonance imaging .&#xD;
      There are a few preliminary studies that have shown that diffusion weighted imaging can be&#xD;
      used to detect lymph nodes affected by malignant cells. Koh reported that after the&#xD;
      involvement of nodes with malignancy, they undergo changes and the increase in cellularity&#xD;
      leads to diffusion restriction and low apparent diffusion coefficient values.&#xD;

    <description>The axillary lymph nodes will be evaluated on axial Time 1-weighted images obtained without fat saturation. We will measure the largest dimension and cortical thickness of each lymph node and ratio of the two measurements will be calculated.&#xD;
The lymph nodes seen in Time 1-weighted images will be subsequently identified on the diffusion-weighted images to calculate the apparent diffusion coefficient value of each lymph node.&#xD;
Axillary lymph nodes scanned by magnetic resonance imaging will be compared by results of histopathological examination.</description>
