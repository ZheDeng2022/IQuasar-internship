  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) of nemtabrutinib (formerly ARQ 531) tablets in selected participants with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory hematologic malignancies. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes 2 parts: Phase 1 (dose escalation) and Phase 2 (dose expansion). In Phase&#xD;
      1, participants will enroll using 3+3 dose escalation design. The starting dose of&#xD;
      nemtabrutinib in oral tablet form was 5mg/day continuously. Dose escalation will continue&#xD;
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and dosing&#xD;
      schedule is reached based on protocol-defined dose limiting toxicity (DLT). After the&#xD;
      determination of the RP2D, 9 expansion cohorts will be initiated to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy of nemtabrutinib at RP2D in participants with specifically defined&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

Any Grade 5 TEAE, any Grade 3 nonhematological TEAE except alopecia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and transient Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities which recover within 1 week without intervention, any Grade 3 hematological TEAE that does not recover to Grade 1 or baseline within 7 days with the exception of Grade 3 lymphocytosis, which is considered to be an expected outcome of BTK inhibition, any Grade 4 nonhematological and hematological TEAE, or any other toxicity that in the view of the investigator represents a clinically significant hazard to the participant.</description>
