      Obesity prevalence is increasing worldwide, and Kuwait is currently considered to be the&#xD;
      country with the most obese population1. Accordingly, standardization of the weight loss&#xD;
      procedures has been made according to the Body Mass Index (BMI), keeping the more advanced&#xD;
      surgeries for class II obesity (BMI 35- 39.9) and above, with consideration of other factors&#xD;
      like, for example, obesity-related comorbidities. For those patients whom considered in the&#xD;
      category of overweight (BMI = 25- 29.9) &amp; class I obesity (BMI 30- 34.9), after failure of&#xD;
      diet attempts, the weight loss options are limited. Of the highly requested options are the&#xD;
      various types of intra-gastric balloons. Conventional endoscopic gastric balloons have proven&#xD;
      to be safe and effective, with Excess Weight Loss (%EWL) of 25-50%2. A new swallowable&#xD;
      gastric balloon, named Elipse, has been launched recently in Kuwait and became highly popular&#xD;
      due to its unique concept of being &quot;procedure-less&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elipse is a weight loss device that does not require anesthesia, endoscopy, or surgery in its&#xD;
      &quot;way in&quot; or &quot;way out&quot;. It's designed to be a swallowable capsule that is converted to a&#xD;
      balloon in the stomach after filling it with a PH-titrated fluid through its connected&#xD;
      catheter. It works by restricting the stomach and, as a result, weight loss is achieved by&#xD;
      decreasing the overall food quantity intake. Four months later, part of the balloon patch&#xD;
      side is shed-off and the fluid is expelled in the stomach in a gradual manner. Later, the&#xD;
      fluid and the thin paper-like wall of the balloon pass through the gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      until excreted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study aims to observe the efficacy &amp; safety of the procedure-less&#xD;
      intra-gastric Elipse balloon as a tool aiding in weight loss applied to all patients in our&#xD;
      clinic who fulfill the criteria &amp; underwent insertion procedure by one surgeon. In this paper&#xD;
      we share our experience regarding this new type of balloon, since Kuwait is one of the first&#xD;
      countries to start official practice with this new device and data in literature is still&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective pilot study of 48 patients underwent Elipse balloon insertion by the&#xD;
      same surgeon at Faisal polyclinics in Kuwait city during six months period from July 2016 to&#xD;
      January 2017. After insertion, the patients were followed for a period of four months until&#xD;
      the expected day of excretion. Weight, BMI, &amp; waist circumference were calculated once&#xD;
      pre-insertion and at 1,2, and 4 months post-insertion in the clinic. Patients were also&#xD;
      encouraged to send their body composition data through email using electronic scale at home&#xD;
      in weekly basis. All the data regarding any difficulties or adverse events during the&#xD;
      procedure were recorded. At the last visit, a simple questionnaire was handed to the patients&#xD;
      to address the commitment to peri and post procedural instructions, symptoms &amp; their severity&#xD;
      encountered after insertion and excretion, overall costs spent, and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
      Ethical approval was obtained from the Ministry of Health in Kuwait &amp; national ethics&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
