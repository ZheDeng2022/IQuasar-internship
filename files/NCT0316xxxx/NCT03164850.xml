  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During laparoscopic surgery, video camera becomes a surgeon's eyes since the surgeon uses&#xD;
      image from the video camera positioned inside the patient's body to perform the procedure.&#xD;
      The greatest limitation is the impairment or complete lack of tactile sensation normally used&#xD;
      to assist in surgical dissection and decision making. The Investigator proposes to develop a&#xD;
      tactile sensing system, Laparoscopic Tactile Imager (LTI), to be used in urogynecological&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery for tactile imaging and tissue characterization (elasticity, structure,&#xD;
      boundaries, blood vessel detection) which will be imposed on the video image at area of&#xD;
      interest in real time.&#xD;

      For this study, the investigator identified the sacrocolpopexy as the target procedure for&#xD;
      the evaluation of LTI. In the cases of sacrocolpopexy, often performed in conjunction with a&#xD;
      hysterectomy, one of the most frustrating elements is the lack of tactile feedback at the&#xD;
      level of the sacral promontory. The surgeon needs to open up the peritoneum and dissect the&#xD;
      underlying tissue to expose the sacral bony structures and ligament without injury to the&#xD;
      surrounding bowel, ureter or vascular structures. Sometimes, the sacral promontory is covered&#xD;
      with a fat pad which makes it difficult to visualize the promontory and the &quot;safe&quot; space&#xD;
      below the aorta and between the iliac arteries/veins is difficult to discern. A difference&#xD;
      that is very easy to appreciate with an open procedure where one can easily palpate through&#xD;
      the fatty tissues. That step is very critical for the repair and has the greatest potential&#xD;
      for catastrophic error without tactile sensation. Because of the reproducibility of the&#xD;
      surgical technique and target anatomy for this portion of the procedure, it was thought the&#xD;
      sacral promontory dissection to identify and clear the anterior longitudinal ligament would&#xD;
      be appropriate surgical procedure to evaluate the use of LTI.&#xD;

        Adult female subjects volunteers, scheduled for a pelvic floor surgery will be considered&#xD;
        to be enrolled in the pilot clinical study. Conditions precluding patients from&#xD;
        participation are listed in the study exclusion below ( Eligibility Criteria) criteria. No&#xD;
        patients will be excluded on the basis of age or race. Women younger the age 21 will not be&#xD;
        included due to the very low probability of pelvic floor diseased condition in the age.&#xD;
