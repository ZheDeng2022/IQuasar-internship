  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigators are comparing 2 drugs (oxytocin and carbetocin) at 2 different&#xD;
      dosages, to help prevent serious bleeding (hemorrhage) after cesarean deliveries. These drugs&#xD;
      are used routinely to help contract the uterus and keep it contracted after the delivery of&#xD;
      the baby and placenta; this reduces the amount of blood you might lose. At Mount Sinai&#xD;
      Hospital, currently oxytocin is used, but its effect on the uterus is much shorter than that&#xD;
      of carbetocin. Internationally, there is no consensus as to what the most effective drug to&#xD;
      use is and at which dose. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada has&#xD;
      recently revised its guidelines to suggest 100 micrograms (mcg) of carbetocin as the drug of&#xD;
      choice at elective cesarean section. Guidelines from the United Kingdom and the United States&#xD;
      currently suggest oxytocin at various doses as the drug of choice at elective cesarean&#xD;
      sections. Previous studies at Mount Sinai Hospital have shown that lower doses of oxytocin,&#xD;
      0.35 International Units (IU), and carbetocin, 20 mcg, may be as effective as the higher&#xD;
      recommended doses. The investigators plan to conduct a large study to confirm these findings&#xD;
      so that they can use the most appropriate dose in the future. Furthermore, the investigators&#xD;
      hope to demonstrate that side effects are lower with the lower dose regimens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal death worldwide. Oxytocin is the&#xD;
      most commonly used uterotonic drug to prevent and treat PPH in the world. However, oxytocin&#xD;
      has a very short duration of action, requiring a continuous infusion to achieve sustained&#xD;
      uterotonic activity. Moreover, large doses are associated with adverse effects like&#xD;
      hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dysrhythmias and ST changes. The Society of Obstetricians and&#xD;
      Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) has recommended a single dose of 100 mcg of the longer acting&#xD;
      carbetocin at elective cesarean section to promote uterine contraction. In multiple studies&#xD;
      performed at Mount Sinai Hospital, we have shown that smaller doses of oxytocin (ED 90 0.35&#xD;
      IU) and carbetocin (ED 90 14.8 mcg) are effective in achieving adequate uterine tone at&#xD;
      elective cesarean section. No study has directly compared the high dose regimens with the low&#xD;
      dose regimens; therefore a large double-blind randomized controlled trial is necessary to&#xD;
      show the non-inferiority of the lower doses of both drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of consensus as to what the optimal uterotonic regime is globally.&#xD;
      Furthermore, variability in the international guidelines regarding the choice of first line&#xD;
      uterotonic in prevention of PPH adds to the confusion. With the widespread availability of&#xD;
      carbetocin in some of the developed countries, including Canada, the question of which&#xD;
      uterotonic to adopt and at which dose becomes even more difficult to ascertain. Studies that&#xD;
      have currently been published suggest the ED90 doses of carbetocin and oxytocin provide&#xD;
      adequate uterine contraction with possibly fewer side effects associated with the lower dosed&#xD;
      regimens. These advantages may provide a better safety profile and patient satisfaction. To&#xD;
      the best of our knowledge, no studies have compared the low doses (ED90) of oxytocin vs.&#xD;
      carbetocin, or low (ED90) vs high (conventional) doses of the two drugs in the setting of&#xD;
      elective cesarean section. The results of this study will provide evidence on the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of the ED90 dosing compared directly to the higher dosing of both drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the ED90 doses of carbetocin and oxytocin will not be inferior to the&#xD;
      higher dosing as determined by the intensity of uterine contraction using a VNRS in women&#xD;
      undergoing elective cesarean section. We anticipate that the intensity of uterine contraction&#xD;
      using the VNRS at 2 minutes post administration of all drugs will fall within the&#xD;
      predetermined margin to signify non-inferiority of all regimens.&#xD;
