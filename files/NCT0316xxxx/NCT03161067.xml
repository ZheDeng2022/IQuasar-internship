    <textblock>
      The Bidirectional Cortical Neuroprosthetic System (BiCNS) consists of NeuroPort&#xD;
      Microelectrode Array Systems and NeuroPort Electrodes (Sputtered Iridium Oxide Film), Patient&#xD;
      Pedestals, the NeuroPort BioPotential Signal Processing System, and the CereStim C96&#xD;
      Programmable Stimulator. The goals of this early feasibility study consist of safety and&#xD;
      efficacy evaluations of this device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed early feasibility, investigator-initiated study is led by Dr. Pablo A. Celnik,&#xD;
      M.D. at Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM). The Bidirectional Cortical Neuroprosthetic System&#xD;
      (BiCNS) consists of modified versions of 510(k) cleared NeuroPort Electrode Array Systems&#xD;
      (Blackrock Microsystems, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) as well as a neurostimulator module&#xD;
      (CereStim R96) for long term neural recording and intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of&#xD;
      the brain. The BiCNS is termed bidirectional because it permits both the recording of&#xD;
      information from the brain for controlling an end effector device, as well as enabling&#xD;
      information regarding that end effector to be returned to the brain in the form of ICMS. &quot;End&#xD;
      effector&quot; in this sense is used to mean a physical or virtual device designed to interact&#xD;
      with its (physical or virtual) environment. Electrode arrays will be implanted in the brain&#xD;
      in pairs, with a pair comprising a recording array and a stimulating array. A total of six&#xD;
      NeuroPort arrays, consisting of three array pairs, will be implanted in each study&#xD;
      participant. Each pair will consist of an array implanted in primary motor cortex (M1) for&#xD;
      recording and an array implanted in primary sensory cortex (S1) for stimulation and/or&#xD;
      recording; both arrays in each pair will be connected to a single percutaneous pedestal as an&#xD;
      external interface. In each participant, two such array pairs will be implanted in the&#xD;
      hand/arm area of M1 and S1 in the dominant brain hemisphere (e.g., the left hemisphere for a&#xD;
      right-handed individual). A third pair will be implanted in the hand/arm area of M1 and S1 in&#xD;
      non-dominant hemisphere (e.g. right hemisphere for a right handed-individual). The recording&#xD;
      arrays implanted in M1 are the NeuroPort microelectrode arrays with platinum (Pt) tips&#xD;
      (K070272), whereas the ICMS arrays implanted in S1 are NeuroPort microelectrode arrays with&#xD;
      Sputtered Iridium-Oxide Film (SIROF) tips (K110010). The study has Investigational Device&#xD;
      Exemption (IDE) approval from FDA to implant these devices for 52 weeks (plus/minus 2 weeks).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of BiCNS: The device is not explanted during 52-week study</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be considered successful if the device is not explanted during the 52-week period. Explantation of the device prior to the 52-week study period implies that the device is putting the subject at risk (e.g. through a serious infection at implantation site) and therefore must be removed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of BiCNS: Control of one end-effector using neural signals acquired by the BiCNS</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>One or more participants demonstrate successful control of an assistive device using the action research arm test (ARAT). The ARAT's is a 19 item measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement). Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale ranging from:&#xD;
3) Performs test normally 2) Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has great difficulty&#xD;
1) Performs test partially 0) Can perform no part of test</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensory feedback: the participants can perceive environmental information through delivery of intracortical microstimulation (ICMS).</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intracortical microstimulation will be delivered to participants through the BiCNS device. The effect of ICMS will be measured based on participants' verbal reporting of what the stimuli feel like (quality of percepts) and where they appear to be coming from (location of percepts).</description>
