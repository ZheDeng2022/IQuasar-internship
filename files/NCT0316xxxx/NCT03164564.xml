      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the long-acting injectable agent&#xD;
      cabotegravir (CAB LA) compared to daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine&#xD;
      (TDF/FTC) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in HIV-uninfected women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the long-acting&#xD;
      injectable integrase inhibitor cabotegravir (CAB LA) compared to daily oral tenofovir&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in a&#xD;
      population of sexually active HIV-uninfected women at risk for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in three steps. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Participants will receive daily oral CAB and TDF/FTC placebo for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Participants will receive injections of CAB LA at two time points 4 weeks apart and&#xD;
      every 8 weeks thereafter and daily TDF/FTC placebo beginning at Week 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Participants will receive daily TDF/FTC and oral CAB placebo for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Participants will receive daily TDF/FTC and intramuscular (IM) placebo injections at&#xD;
      two time points 4 weeks apart and every 8 weeks thereafter beginning at Week 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 will continue until the last enrolled participant reaches approximately 76 weeks on&#xD;
      Step 2 (Week 81 for the last enrolled participant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Step 3, all participants (Arms A and B) will receive daily TDF/FTC for up to 48 weeks,&#xD;
      starting no later than 8 weeks after the last injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Step 3, all participants will then transition to locally available HIV&#xD;
      prevention services, including services for PrEP, if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at Day 0 and at Weeks 2 and 4 during Step 1. During Step 2,&#xD;
      participants will attend up to 24 visits, depending on when they enroll in the study. Study&#xD;
      visits will occur every 12 weeks during Step 3. Study visits may include physical&#xD;
      examinations; blood, urine, and vaginal swab collection; risk reduction, adherence&#xD;
      counseling, and contraception counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPTN 084-01 is a sub-study of HPTN 084. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and acceptability of CAB LA for the prevention of HIV among adolescent females.&#xD;
      Participants will receive oral CAB for 5 weeks, followed by 34 weeks on CAB LA, then&#xD;
      quarterly visits for 48 weeks after final injection. All participants who have received at&#xD;
      least one injection will be followed for 48 weeks after their last injection. Total study&#xD;
      duration per participant will be approximately 21 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Born female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18-45 years at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to undergo all required study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-reactive HIV test results at Screening and Enrollment. Note: HIV-uninfected, based&#xD;
             on HIV test results obtained at Screening and just prior to randomization at the&#xD;
             Enrollment visit. All HIV test results from the Screening visit must be obtained and&#xD;
             must all be negative/non-reactive. This includes testing for acute HIV infection,&#xD;
             which must be performed within 14 days of Enrollment. In addition, at least one HIV&#xD;
             test result using blood drawn at the Enrollment visit must be obtained prior to&#xD;
             randomization into the study and must be negative/non-reactive. Individuals who have&#xD;
             one or more reactive or positive HIV test result(s) will not be enrolled, even if&#xD;
             subsequent confirmatory testing indicates that they are not HIV-infected (see SSP&#xD;
             Manual). Those with any enrollment HIV test result positive will proceed through the&#xD;
             HIV algorithm per the SSP but will not be able to receive study product regardless of&#xD;
             subsequent test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active (i.e., vaginal intercourse on a minimum of two separate days in the 30&#xD;
             days prior to Screening)&#xD;

          -  Score of greater than or equal to 5 using a modified VOICE risk score&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No plans to re-locate or travel away from the site for greater than or equal to 8&#xD;
             consecutive weeks during study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 60 mL/min (using Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
             equation) (use sex at birth for calculation)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Although not protocol exclusionary, sites should carefully consider the&#xD;
                  advisability of enrolling participants with calculated creatinine clearance&#xD;
                  between 60-70 mL/min, as limited changes in creatinine clearance during study&#xD;
                  conduct will lead to protocol-mandated product holds and may alter the&#xD;
                  risk-benefit considerations of study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) negative and accepts vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and total&#xD;
             bilirubin (Tbili) less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN&#xD;

             sterilization procedure per self-report, such as hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,&#xD;
             tubal ligation or salpingectomy), must have a negative beta human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (βHCG) pregnancy test (sensitivity of less than or equal to 25 mIU/mL)&#xD;
             performed (and results known) on the same day as and before initiating the&#xD;
             protocol-specified study product(s) at Enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have documented evidence of surgical sterilization, OR documented evidence of no&#xD;
             uterus (e.g., hysterectomy), OR must agree to use a reliable form of long acting&#xD;
             contraception, during the trial and for 52 weeks after stopping the long acting&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No alcohol or substance use that, in the opinion of the study investigator, would&#xD;
             interfere with the conduct of the study (e.g., provided by self-report, or found upon&#xD;
             medical history and examination or in available medical records)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
