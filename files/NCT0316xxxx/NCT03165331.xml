  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A visible difference can have a profound impact in a society with a massive emphasis on&#xD;
      appearance and &quot;looks&quot;. A vulnerable group is adolescents with a condition affecting their&#xD;
      appearance as a result of injuries (burns, accidents), treatment (cancer), skin conditions or&#xD;
      congenital anomalies (birthmarks, craniofacial conditions). Research has identified potential&#xD;
      psychological difficulties, which, if not addressed, can lead to anxiety, depression, and&#xD;
      eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to medical treatment options, aiming at diminishing a difference that may be&#xD;
      visible to others, young people with appearance concerns also need self-management skills.&#xD;
      However, evidence-based interventions are scarce and specialised psychological treatment is&#xD;
      difficult to reach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Centre for Appearance Research (Bristol, UK) has developed an online intervention for&#xD;
      adolescents, now translated into Norwegian (www.ungfaceit.no). UNG Face IT provides easy&#xD;
      access to specialist advice and support via a home computer, using information, videos, and&#xD;
      interactive activities. It provides advice, teaches coping and social skills, strengthening&#xD;
      psychological adjustment to a visible difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic evaluation of the Norwegian version is needed. UNG Face IT could potentially&#xD;
      address unmet needs, provide a cost-effective tool to reduce the need for &quot;face-to-face&quot;&#xD;
      psychological and surgical/medical services, and contribute to make online health care&#xD;
      available for young people with a visible difference.&#xD;
