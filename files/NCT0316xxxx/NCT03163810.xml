    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low level laser therapy (LLLT) using the&#xD;
      Erchonia VERJU and EVRL laser devices is effective in reducing aminoalanine transaminase&#xD;
      (ALT) levels in individuals with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disorder in the USA,&#xD;
      present in 20% to 30% of the population and rapidly increasing. Fatty liver is generally&#xD;
      diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound frequently as an incidental finding. Major risk factors for&#xD;
      NAFLD include central (or abdominal) obesity, diabetes, elevated lipids, and metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are those patients where the presence of fat in the liver&#xD;
      is accompanied by an inflammatory process that can cause progressive fibrosis in the liver.&#xD;
      Which can ultimately lead to end stage liver disease (i.e., cirrhosis) and hepatic failure&#xD;
      requiring liver transplantation. The 1990's was the decade of hepatitis C-related cirrhosis&#xD;
      requiring transplantation. NASH is found in 3-5% of the population and is a subset of those&#xD;
      patients with fatty liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aminoaminoalanine Transaminase (ALT) is the liver enzyme measured in the blood that is a&#xD;
      surrogate marker for inflammation and is frequently elevated in patients with NASH.&#xD;
      Normalization of ALT is the ultimate treatment goal; however reduction in ALT is of&#xD;
      significant clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the only treatment modality for patients with fatty liver disease is weight loss&#xD;
      and exercise which is challenging for most patients. Therefore, a huge need exists for an&#xD;
      alternative approach to reducing ALT levels for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low level laser light therapy (LLLT) offers a simple, non-invasive, safe, effective and&#xD;
      side-effect free alternative to achieving this goal, through LLLT's proven ability to effect&#xD;
      weight loss, body circumference reduction and inflammation reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of the Erchonia® Verjú™ (green diode) Laser and Erchonia 635nm (red light) lasers&#xD;
      to the body mid-region has been proven through controlled clinical trials to reduce body&#xD;
      circumference in these areas in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful manner&#xD;
      and to effect a decrease in overall body weight, both associated with reducing in ALT levels&#xD;
      for the management of NASH patients. The Erchonia® EVRL Laser violet diode has been proven in&#xD;
      controlled clinical trials to additionally effect inflammation reduction, another factor&#xD;
      important in the management of NASH patients. Additionally, the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (U.S. FDA) identifies the Erchonia 532nm (green diode) and 635nm (red diode)&#xD;
      lasers under Product Code OLI as: &quot;A Low Level Laser System for Aesthetic Use is a device&#xD;
      using low level laser energy for the disruption of adipocyte cells within the fat layer for&#xD;
      the release of fat and lipids from these cells for non-invasive aesthetic use.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is hypothesized that treatment application with the Erchonia LLLT devices will&#xD;
      effect a reduction in body circumference, weight and inflammatory factors significant enough&#xD;
      to effect a clinically meaningful decrease in ALT levels in NASH patients in a safe and&#xD;
      timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biochemical effect of Erchonia® low level laser light therapy devices stimulates the&#xD;
      mitochondria of the adipocyte cells which in turn increases the production of adenosine&#xD;
      triphosphate (ATP). The newly synthesized ATP triggers the up-regulation of cyclic adenosine&#xD;
      monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP has been shown to stimulate cytoplasmic lipase, triggering the&#xD;
      conversion of triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol that can easily pass through the&#xD;
      cell membrane. The transitory pore is evidence that the laser is allowing for the movement of&#xD;
      fatty acids, glycerol, and triglycerides to pass across the membrane and into extra-cellular&#xD;
      space. Through vasodilation of nearby blood vessels and arteries, oxidization of the&#xD;
      triglycerides and fatty acids occurs within the extra-cellular space. Additionally, LLLT is&#xD;
      known to influence the receptors on the membrane of the cell and on the membrane of the&#xD;
      cell's mitochondrion, eventually reaching the cell's DNA, which directly controls cell&#xD;
      function. When cells function better, so do tissues, and as such, LLLT promotes inflammation&#xD;
      reduction and the consequent healing and regeneration of damaged tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LLLT has been found to alter gene expression, cellular proliferation, intra-cellular&#xD;
      (potential of hydrogen) phosphorus (pH) balance, mitochondrial membrane potential, generation&#xD;
      of transient reactive oxygen species and calcium ion level, proton gradient and cellular&#xD;
      oxygen consumption. With laser light able to induce cellular modulation, it has been proposed&#xD;
      that LLLT may be able to serve as a subtle, non-invasive instrument in the reduction of&#xD;
      clinical levels such as serum cholesterol levels, wherein it is proposed that laser therapy&#xD;
      may suppress cholesterogenesis by altering the transcription factors responsible for the&#xD;
      expression of essential genes involved in the biosynthetic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have already identified the modulation of transcription factors subsequent to&#xD;
      laser irradiation. Jackson and coworkers (2002) have identified more than twenty&#xD;
      transcription factors that are regulated by the intracellular redox state. In a pilot study,&#xD;
      Erchonia observed that low-level laser application 3 times per week for two weeks reduced&#xD;
      cholesterol levels, and even more importantly, reduced LDL levels while preserving HDL&#xD;
      levels. It is proposed that laser therapy, by means of altering the intracellular redox&#xD;
      state, can affect the function of transcription factors tightly associated with cholesterol&#xD;
      synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, laser therapy has been proven via multiple investigational studies to emulsify&#xD;
      adipose tissue liberating all adipocyte stored fatty debris, demonstrated clinically through&#xD;
      the observance of circumference reduction following LLLT administration. It is theorized that&#xD;
      the liberation of fat is absorbed via the lymphatic system where lipolysis occurs in the&#xD;
      lymph nodes and fatty-acid oxidation occurs in the liver. The mobilization of the fatty&#xD;
      debris and production of ketone bodies may have an effect on applicable clinical lab markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the Erchonia Lasers are proven to be efficacious in effecting weight loss,&#xD;
      circumference reduction, reduction of inflammation and improvement in clinical levels, all of&#xD;
      which are factors that both directly and indirectly impact the reduction of ALT levels and&#xD;
      improvement in the overall condition of NASH in affected individuals.&#xD;
