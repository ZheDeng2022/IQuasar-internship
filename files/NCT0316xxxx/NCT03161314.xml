    <textblock>
      (Subproject 1) &quot;Plantar heel pain (PHP)&quot; or &quot;plantar fasciitis&quot; is one of the major foot&#xD;
      problems which can occur in any age group. It is a commonly encountered musculoskeletal&#xD;
      problem that can cause disability, activity limitation, discomfort, and affect the quality of&#xD;
      life. It involves pain and inflammation of the plantar fascia, which runs across the bottom&#xD;
      of the foot and connects the heel bone to toes. PHP frequently found in active workers aged&#xD;
      between 25 and 65 years with the highest incidence in people aged between 40 and 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, very few studies investigated the alterations of the multisegmental foot motions and&#xD;
      muscle functions in patients with PHP. To prescribe the relevant program of treatment and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of symptoms chronicity, it is necessary to have an in-depth understanding of&#xD;
      changing mechanisms in patients with PHP. To explain how the symptoms occur in patients with&#xD;
      PHP, foot function is another aspect that should be determined. One of the popular&#xD;
      questionnaires determining foot function is the Foot Function Index (FFI) questionnaire. It&#xD;
      has been proved to have good reliability and validity and has been translated into several&#xD;
      languages. To be able to use the international standard questionnaire, it is necessary to&#xD;
      translate the FFI into Thai. This can be implemented in Thailand and be able to compare the&#xD;
      findings of the interventional effect internationally. In addition, very few studies reported&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the treatment program for patients with PHP. Among previous evidences,&#xD;
      the controversial findings existed. Thus, the intervention program should be evaluated for&#xD;
      obtaining the effective treatment for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Subproject 3) The objectives of the study will be General Objective is to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of strengthening exercise program on symptoms in patients with plantar heel&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives is to compare the effectiveness between physical therapy treatment&#xD;
      program with strengthening exercise and with stretching exercise on foot function score, pain&#xD;
      at worst score, plantar fascia thickness, muscles strength, ankle motion, and gait parameters&#xD;
      in patients with plantar heel pain among baseline, after 4th and 8th of treatments, and after&#xD;
      1st and 2nd month of self-home based exercise.&#xD;

      (Sub-project 1) Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will attend data collection on a single occasion and allocate into the&#xD;
      healthy or patients with PHP with the selection criteria before enrollment. They will dress&#xD;
      with short pants which researcher prepare. Before testing, the NORAXON TeleMyo Receiver will&#xD;
      be synchronized with the forceplate and video. The real-time signal of motion, EMG, and force&#xD;
      data will simultaneously synchronize and present on the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin will be prepared over the sites for electrode placements by shaving, lightly&#xD;
      abrading, and cleaning with 70% alcohol prior to electrode application. The electrodes will&#xD;
      place 20 mm center to center interelectrode space over the site in each muscle.&#xD;
      Interelectrode impedance is less than 10 kiloohm. The elastic adhesive tape is used to fixed&#xD;
      electrodes to control movement artefacts. Participants will perform reference contractions to&#xD;
      check the placement and cross-talk of the electrodes between EMG signals from different&#xD;
      muscles prior to data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG placement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle activation will be measured by electromyography (TeleMyo DTS Telemetry, NORAXON USA&#xD;
      Inc.) at a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz in order to quantify the dynamic muscle function of&#xD;
      the lower extremity. Surface electrodes will be placed according to recommendations of the&#xD;
      European Recommendations for Surface Electromyography (SENIAM). Pairs of wet-gelled bipolar&#xD;
      Ag-AgCl Dual surface electrodes (Ag/AgCl NORAXON Dual electrodes 20 mm spacing) are selected&#xD;
      for surface EMG sensor. The location and orientation of electrode placements are localized in&#xD;
      the supine position by the same researcher. The electrode will be placed on Peroneus longus&#xD;
      (PL) which will be placed at 1/4 on the line between the tip of the fibular and tip of the&#xD;
      lateral malleolus. Tibialis anterior (TA) electrode will be placed at 1/3 on the line between&#xD;
      the tip of the fibular and tip of the medial malleolus. Gastrocnemius medial head (GM) and&#xD;
      Gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) electrodes will be placed on the largest bulb of the muscle at&#xD;
      medial head. All exact position of the muscles will confirm by their actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum Voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants perform 5 seconds MVIC against manual resistance in each of the muscle for 3&#xD;
      times. The PL and TA will be assessed in supine lying position and gastrocnemius will be&#xD;
      assessed in standing position. Participants will perform the action of each muscle against&#xD;
      manual resistance from researcher and equipment. The peak amplitude of EMG signal in each&#xD;
      trial will be selected and will be averaged from 3 seconds over the EMG. The peak mean&#xD;
      amplitude of the 3 trials for each muscle will be used for normalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric data assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric data will be obtained from each subject for calculating the kinematic and&#xD;
      kinetic data. It includes body height, body weight, leg length, and joint widths of the knee&#xD;
      and ankle. Leg length is the distance between anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and medial&#xD;
      malleolus. The knee width is the distance between medial and lateral condyles across the knee&#xD;
      joint. The ankle width is the distance between medial and lateral malleoli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Marker placement&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower body markers of Plug-in-Gait will be used in the study to observe lower extremity&#xD;
      motion data during walking. The model consists of left and right anterior superior iliac&#xD;
      crests, left and right posterior superior iliac crests, left and right knees, left and right&#xD;
      thighs, left and right ankles, left and right tibias, left and right toes, left and right&#xD;
      heels. Right back marker will be used for the markers auto-label process in order to&#xD;
      discriminate the left or the right.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foot model&#xD;
&#xD;
      The markers will be placed on foot bony prominence following the Oxford Foot Model to obtain&#xD;
      multisegmental foot motion during walking. The Oxford Foot Model has been used in previous&#xD;
      studies to determine the multisegmental foot motion (35, 36) and proved to be validated and&#xD;
      reliable (35, 36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the forefoot segment, markers will be placed on the most distal, medial aspect of&#xD;
      the first metatarsal shaft, the most proximal and distal lateral aspects of the fifth&#xD;
      metatarsal shaft, and midway between second and third metatarsal heads. For the rearfoot&#xD;
      segment, markers will be placed on sustentaculum tali, lateral calcaneus, heel (distal part&#xD;
      of the calcaneus), posterior proximal calcaneus and a peg marker will be placed on posterior&#xD;
      calcaneus between the heel and proximal calcaneus markers. For the tibial segment, markers&#xD;
      will be placed on medial malleolus, lateral malleolus, anterior aspect of tibial crest,&#xD;
      tibial tuberosity and head of fibula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to comparing the foot and ankle kinematic data between patients with PHP and normal&#xD;
      healthy, repeatability of data will be assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)&#xD;
      values among trials of walking for ensuring the data can be acceptable, especially in the&#xD;
      pathologic condition of the foot as PHP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will walk on the 8-meters walkway until they familiar with the environment of&#xD;
      the laboratory. Then, gait data will be collected for 3 success trials at their comfortable&#xD;
      speed. Motion data will be collected at 100 Hz and will be filtered by using the Butterworth&#xD;
      filtering technique at 5 Hz. Averaged data of EMG and motion from 3 trials will be used for&#xD;
      further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Sub-project 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit patients with Plantar heel pain (PHP) from the Physical Therapy&#xD;
      Center, Faculty of Physical Therapy, Mahidol University. The eligible participants will be&#xD;
      screened and recruited following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The participants will&#xD;
      be screened according to the criteria. Purposes, procedures, and possible risks of the study&#xD;
      will be explained to the participants. Prior to participating in the study, they will sign in&#xD;
      the informed consent. The participants will be allocated into the group of intervention,&#xD;
      which is the experimental (strengthening) group and the control (stretching) group, according&#xD;
      to the stratified randomization technique. The participants will be assessed all outcomes for&#xD;
      the baseline; pain at worst, FFI, plantar fascia thickness, muscle strength, ankle range of&#xD;
      motion and gait measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, all participants will be received the same conservative treatment (therapeutic&#xD;
      ultrasound, tissue mobilization, and joint mobilization) by the experienced physician. Then,&#xD;
      the participants will be instructed to do the exercise following the program of their&#xD;
      allocated group. The experimental group will be performed toe flexor muscle exercise, ankle&#xD;
      evertor muscles exercise, and high-loading strength training, but the control group will be&#xD;
      performed the gastrocnemius muscle, soleus muscle and plantar fascia stretching. All&#xD;
      participants will be treated for 8 times (2 times per week) and perform the home-based&#xD;
      exercise program three times a day. After the treatment end, the participants will continue&#xD;
      their home-based exercise for 2 months. The home-based exercise protocol will be prescribed&#xD;
      by the physical therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of all outcomes data will perform for 5 times; 1) baseline, 2) after 4th and&#xD;
      3) 8th of treatments, and 4) after 1st and 5) 2nd month of self-home based exercise. The&#xD;
      researcher who evaluates the outcome data will be blinded to the group of participant. They&#xD;
      will be involved only in the admission, randomization, physical examination, and discharge.&#xD;
      All physical therapists will be undergoing the meeting and practical session to clarify the&#xD;
      study protocol and treatment guidelines. To ensure the participants able to do home program&#xD;
      exercise properly, the understanding and compliance will be checked by phone call and record&#xD;
      the number of exercise in the logbook.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical significance will be estimated at probability (p-value &lt; 0.05). The&#xD;
      descriptive statistic will be used to analyze the demographic and baseline characteristics of&#xD;
      the participants. The Kolmogorov- Smirnov Goodness of Fit test will be tested the data&#xD;
      distribution. The baseline data will be compared between groups to investigate the difference&#xD;
      by using the independent t-test and Mann-Whitney U test for normal and non-normal&#xD;
      distribution of data. The outcome measurements are the VAS score, FFI score, gait parameter,&#xD;
      plantar fascia thickness, muscle strength, and ankle ROM will be analyzed by the two-way&#xD;
      repeated ANOVA among baseline, after 4th and 8th of treatments, and after 1st and 2nd month&#xD;
      of self-home based exercise. If the data are not normally distributed, Friedman test will be&#xD;
      used to compare the mean differences.&#xD;
