  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin in this phase I study. The secondary objectives are to determine the response&#xD;
      rate, progression free survival, overall survival, and safety profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive a triplet chemotherapy consisting of nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      (Abraxane®) 150 mg/m2 IVD 30 min followed by Oxaliplatin 60 - 85 mg/m2 IVD 2hr at D1, plus&#xD;
      oral S-1 35mg/m2 and Leucovorin 30mg twice daily from D1 to D7, every 14 days as a cycle till&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;

      Eligible patients will receive a triplet chemotherapy consisting of nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      (Abraxane®) 150 mg/m2 IVD 30 min followed by Oxaliplatin 60 - 85 mg/m2 IVD 2hr at D1, plus&#xD;
      oral S-1 35mg/m2 and Leucovorin 30mg twice daily from D1 to D7, every 14 days as a cycle till&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study (a standard 3 x 3 design), patients will be enrolled in cohort of 3 to receive&#xD;
      escalating dose of Oxaliplatin at three dose levels (level I, 60 mg/m2, level II, 75 mg/m2&#xD;
      and level III, 85 mg/m2). Intra-patient dose escalation will not be allowed. If none of the&#xD;
      first 3 patients of a cohort experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then dose escalation&#xD;
      will proceed for next cohort of patients. If 1 of 3 patients developed DLT, the cohort will&#xD;
      be expanded to 6 patients. If ≤2 patients of the 6 patients experience DLT, then dose&#xD;
      escalation will proceed in next study cohort unless 85 mg/m2 have reached. If 2 of the first&#xD;
      3 or ≥3 of 6 patients developed DLT at certain dose level, then dose escalation will be&#xD;
      withheld and the prior dose level will be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A minimum of 6&#xD;
      evaluable patients will be treated at the MTD dose level with no more than 2 of the 6&#xD;
      patients having DLT at this dose level. The MTD will be considered as the recommended dose&#xD;
      for future Phase II studies. The number of patient accrual will range from 12 and 18 (6/dose&#xD;
      level) evaluable patients in the dose-finding stage to determine the MTD of Oxaliplatin in&#xD;
      this combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of patients who experience grade 2 sensory neuropathy after the triplet chemotherapy,&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin will be omitted (only nab-paclitaxel plus S-1/LV will be continued) until the&#xD;
      recovery of sensory neuropathy to grade 1 or less then Oxaliplatin will be re-instituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBC/DC, AST/ALT and BUN/Cr will be determined at baseline and every 2 weeks during study&#xD;
      period. Serum level of albumin, bilirubin (T), LDH, Alk-P/GGT, Na/K/Mg/Ca/P and CRP will be&#xD;
      determined at baseline and every 4 weeks during the treatment. Radiographic objective tumor&#xD;
      response assessment, according to RECIST version 1.1, by CT scan or MRI at baseline, and then&#xD;
      every 6 weeks during the study period. Tumor marker, CEA and CA 19-9, will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and every 4 weeks during the treatment.&#xD;
