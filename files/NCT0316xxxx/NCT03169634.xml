      Lay Person's Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee replacement surgery has been successfully carried out for many years. However, in time,&#xD;
      some knee replacements will fail-usually either because of wear or loosening of the&#xD;
      replacement parts. This may mean the patient has to undergo further surgery-this is known as&#xD;
      revision total knee replacement (rTKR). This revision surgery is often more complex than the&#xD;
      original operation and presents the operating surgeon with several technical challenges. Of&#xD;
      particular concern, is that when the old knee replacement is removed, a large cavity can be&#xD;
      left in the bone. The new knee replacement has to be placed into this, but it is essential&#xD;
      that it is immediately stable and secure. The large cavity has to be somehow either filled in&#xD;
      or bypassed to ensure the new knee replacement is secure enough for early weight-bearing and&#xD;
      long term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different techniques have been used for many years to overcome this problem. Firstly, it may&#xD;
      be possible to simply cement another knee replacement into the cavity- probably needing more&#xD;
      cement than was previously used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative option to this is use a device called a &quot;cone&quot; which sits into the bony cavity&#xD;
      created by removing the original knee replacement, and a new knee replacement can be cemented&#xD;
      into this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone grows onto the cone to ensure its stability. The new knee replacement can have either&#xD;
      short stemmed components like the original Total Knee Replacement (TKR), or long stemmed&#xD;
      components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these types of rTKR are presently in use throughout the United Kingdom (UK). At this&#xD;
      point in time, no-one knows which type is best. The research team are planning to run this&#xD;
      study to see if it is possible to identify which type of rTKR gives the best outcome for&#xD;
      patients. The research team will examine the results in different ways including&#xD;
      questionnaires to measure how well the patients feel their knee is performing, specific tests&#xD;
      to measure knee function, and by using x-rays and scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will identify patients suitable for inclusion in the study from their&#xD;
      medical notes, x-rays and scans. If patients consent to be in the study, the research team&#xD;
      will randomly allocate them to receive one of the 3 rTKR options (no cone and new knee&#xD;
      replacement only, cone with short stemmed components or cone with long stemmed components)&#xD;
      and monitor their progress for 5 years after the operation.&#xD;

&#xD;
      A preliminary analysis of the data generated by the study will be carried out 2.5 years after&#xD;
      recruitment of the 1st participant to assess compliance with the study protocol.&#xD;

      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised, prospective internal pilot study is to be set up to compare the results of&#xD;
      different ways of approaching revision Total Knee Replacement (rTKR). The invsetigators will&#xD;
      examine 3 differing ways of treating patients undergoing this procedure who present with a&#xD;
      grade 2 Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute (AORI) bony defect. One arm of the study will&#xD;
      be randomised to receive a long or short stemmed cemented prosthesis (according to&#xD;
      intra-operative findings and surgeon decision at that time), another to receive a metaphyseal&#xD;
      cone into which a short stemmed prosthesis will be cemented (&lt;/=50mm) and a third arm to&#xD;
      receive a metaphyseal cone with a long stemmed cemented prosthesis (&gt;/=100 mm). The study&#xD;
      will be carried out in the operating theatres, orthopaedic out-patients department and the&#xD;
      physiotherapy department at the Royal Devon and Exeter (RD+E) Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to take part in the study in one of 2 ways. Firstly, by their&#xD;
      surgeon when they are initially listed for rTKR surgery at their out-patient consultation at&#xD;
      the RD+E Hospital. Alternatively, if identified from the current surgical waiting list as&#xD;
      suitable for inclusion. In this latter case, potential participants will be contacted by&#xD;
      letter by their surgeon asking for permission for one of the research team to approach them&#xD;
      to discuss the study. Patients who agree to enter the trial will be divided at random to&#xD;
      enter the different treatment arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be carried out using a computer generated random number assignment list.&#xD;
      51 patients will be initially included with allocation to either arm of the trial by drawing&#xD;
      appropriately marked slips of paper from an opaque envelope. The operating surgeon will not&#xD;
      be able to read the slips before they are drawn, nor will they perform the randomisation&#xD;
      which will be carried out by one of the investigators not carrying out the surgery on the&#xD;
      individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will undertake a preliminary analysis of the study data 6 months after 51&#xD;
      participants have been recruited (i.e. 2.5 years after 1st patient recruited). This will be&#xD;
      to see if the pilot study aims and objectives and study progression rules have been met.&#xD;
      Based on this analysis, the aim is to recruit further participants to the number recommended&#xD;
      in the preliminary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be under the care of the Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit at the RD+E Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact treatment effect of the use of cones in revision knee replacement is unknown. There&#xD;
      are no prospective studies to use as a basis for calculating sample size. The choice of 51&#xD;
      participants initially with the potential for further recruitment after preliminary analysis&#xD;
      of the 6 month post-surgery (i.e. 2.5 years after recruitment of the 1st participant)&#xD;
      follow-up data is to allow an assessment of treatment size effect to allow the investigators&#xD;
      to work out a definitive study sample size requirement. The investigators have taken&#xD;
      statistical advice on this and are confident that this number will be sufficient to test the&#xD;
      progression rules and to offer reasonable estimates of standard deviations of the intended&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will initially recruit 17 cases to each arm of the study (no cone used,&#xD;
      cone with short stemmed knee replacement and cone with long stemmed knee replacement)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pragmatically, (based on 2015 figures) the Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU) undertake&#xD;
      approximately 62 rTKR procedure per year and in 2015, 27 of these did not meet the study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. The investigators believe this to be a representation of other years. Of&#xD;
      the remaining 35 cases, if 20% are unwilling to participate this will leave 28 cases per&#xD;
      annum. The study is therefore likely to recruit 56 potential participants in just under a 2&#xD;
      year period. The plan is to initially recruit 51 subjects (17 to the no cone arm and 17 each&#xD;
      to the cone with short or long stem arms respectively). A preliminary analysis of the data&#xD;
      will be carried out after 51 cases have been recruited, operated upon and have 6 months of&#xD;
      follow up completed (i.e. 2.5 years after recruitment of 1st participant), to look for any&#xD;
      significant trends. Based on these preliminary results of the internal pilot study the aim is&#xD;
      to recruit further cases to reach a recruitment target that has been set based on the pilot&#xD;
      study results. This figure would be calculated to allow the research team to identify a total&#xD;
      number of participants that would give results with statistical significance in either the&#xD;
      primary or secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial number of study participants is 51 patients but with potential for an increased&#xD;
      number based on analysis of the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential candidates for this study will be identified in one of 2 ways. Firstly, patients&#xD;
      are listed for rTKR surgery whilst attending orthopaedic out-patient clinics at the RD+E&#xD;
      Hospital. At the time of this consultation patients will be offered the opportunity to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Potential participants will be given a copy of the information&#xD;
      about the study and the consent form. This will allow the opportunity therefore, to discuss&#xD;
      the study with family, friends or General Practitioner (GP) if necessary. Alternatively,&#xD;
      patients will be identified from existing surgical waiting lists. In this case, potential&#xD;
      recruits will be contacted in writing or by telephone asking for permission for one of the&#xD;
      study team to approach them about the study. If permission is given, the patient will be sent&#xD;
      a copy of the participant information sheet and a consent form so that they can decide if&#xD;
      they would like to be involved. One of the research team- either the study coordinator or one&#xD;
      of the research nurses- will then contact the patient and if they are willing to be involved,&#xD;
      will obtain written consent for study participation. Consent is likely to be obtained at the&#xD;
      pre-operative assessment clinic which usually occurs 2-4 weeks before surgery and with the&#xD;
      patients consent, their GP will be informed of participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 copies of written consent will be obtained. One will be returned to the patient. One will&#xD;
      be placed in the medical notes and one will be kept by the research team in the patient's&#xD;
      case record file (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Generated Clinical Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All rTKR patients attend the hospital for routine pre-operative assessment-whether involved&#xD;
      in the study or not. At this appointment, trial participants will complete the questionnaires&#xD;
      related to the study- the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), the Knee Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score&#xD;
      (KOOS) and the Euroquol Questionnaire (EQ5D). These 3 questionnaires are contained within the&#xD;
      revision cones study Patient Recorded Outcome Measures (PROMS). Participants will also&#xD;
      complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Radiological Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo standardised long leg Antero-Posterior (AP) and lateral&#xD;
      radiographs pre and post-operatively as part of routine care for rTKR patients. These will be&#xD;
      reported upon by the surgeons and the results documented in the medical notes electronically&#xD;
      via Clinical Document Manager (CDM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to routine care, all patients will undergo a Dual Emission X-ray Absorptiometry&#xD;
      (DEXA) scan at the University of Exeter for pre-operative bone density evaluation. At the&#xD;
      time of the initial DEXA scan patients will be asked to complete the following&#xD;
      questionnaires: 1) Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) and 2) General health&#xD;
      questionnaire (bone health female/male) to assess the impact this may have on bone density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative Functional Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will attend the physiotherapy department at the RD+E Hospital for a&#xD;
      functional assessment. The Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU)Knee Arthroplasty Functional&#xD;
      Assessment will be undertaken with analysis by the Nurture Functional Assessment Tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knee surgery team meet every Tuesday to discuss the operations planned for the next week.&#xD;
      One of the research team (study coordinator or research nurse) will attend this meeting and&#xD;
      open the envelope that assigns each patient to the appropriate arm of the study. (See&#xD;
      methodology above). The operating surgeon and theatre staff will be informed. It is necessary&#xD;
      to do this in advance of the day of the operation to ensure all instrumentation required for&#xD;
      the surgery is ready for use, sterile, available and laid out in preparation for the surgery.&#xD;
      The patient will be assigned a study number and their randomisation slip stored by the study&#xD;
      team. The randomization schedule will be determined using an on-line random assignment&#xD;
      sequence generator (www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm) and will be kept and&#xD;
      controlled by the study co-ordinator, and the surgeons will not have access to this schedule.&#xD;
      A hand written note will be made by one of the research team in the orthopaedic section of&#xD;
      the patient's medical notes after their surgery, confirming that they consented to the study&#xD;
      and detailing which arm of the study they were allocated to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be to one of 3 arms of the study. The patient will either receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A new TKR using the Triathlon Component System cemented into the bony cavity left after&#xD;
           removal of the original TKR-stem length to be decided by surgeon during the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Triathlon Cone into which a new TKR will be cemented- stem length &lt;/=50mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A Triathlon Cone into which a new TKR will be cemented-stem length &gt;/= 100mm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating techniques will be standard techniques as used by the 3 surgeons involved in the&#xD;
      study. All 3 are experienced rTKR surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All stems will be cemented using a cement plug, suction catheter and pressurisation. All&#xD;
      patients receive the Triathlon Total Stabilised (TS) Revision Implant with the TS&#xD;
      polyethylene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both femoral and tibial components will be revised in all cases. A decision to revise the&#xD;
      patella component will be taken intra-operatively by the operating surgeon. If the patient's&#xD;
      patella was not resurfaced during the original operation, it is likely to be resurfaced&#xD;
      during the revision procedure. If the patella was previously resurfaced it will be visually&#xD;
      assessed per-operatively for component wear and manually assessed for loosening. It will be&#xD;
      revised if found to be significantly loose or worn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be discharged home allowed to fully weight-bear as comfort allows and with&#xD;
      walking aids for use for a 6 week period if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per routine care, the patients will be reviewed at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and&#xD;
      5 years post-operatively. At each follow up appointment they will repeat the questionnaires&#xD;
      above, (OKS, KOOS, HADS and EQ5D) and the weight bearing AP long leg and standard lateral&#xD;
      radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional assessment will also be carried out at the 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 year and 5&#xD;
      year follow up time frames.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a DEXA scan to assess the bone density in the bone immediately&#xD;
      adjacent either to the new knee replacement+/- cone post-operatively at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 24&#xD;
      and 60 months. The DEXA scan will be performed at the University of Exeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients with a cone implanted will undergo a dual energy Computerised Tomography&#xD;
      (CT) scan at 6 months after surgery to assess potential bony on-growth onto the cone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary outcome of the Pilot Study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • An assessment of compliance with the study protocol. For this, the research team will&#xD;
      measure compliance of study participants with the pre and post-operative attendance schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Frame: 2.5 years after recruitment of 1st subject&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An assessment of ease of recruitment to the study by comparing the potential number of&#xD;
           recruits to those actually recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure for any reason requiring further revision surgery: including but not exclusive&#xD;
           to loosening of the components, infection, instability or pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The assessment of early stability of the newly implanted prosthesis as measured&#xD;
           radiographically on x-rays by subsidence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of on-growth of bone onto the prosthesis via dual energy CT scan for&#xD;
           patients in those arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of bone density in the bone surrounding the cone via DEXA scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment using the KOOS tool, the OKS, the HADS and the EQ5D questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional assessment using EKRU Knee Arthroplasty Functional Assessment and the Nurture&#xD;
           assessment tool&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The development of post-operative infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be undertaken by the clinician undertaking the specific procedure concerned or by the&#xD;
      Chief Investigator of the study or by research nurses attached to the RD+E Hospital provided&#xD;
      by the hospital Research and Development (R+D) department and the National Institute Health&#xD;
      Research (NIHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be stored on RD+E Hospital secure computers. Data will be entered into an Excel&#xD;
      spread sheet for later transfer into a statistical package such as Statistical Package for&#xD;
      the Social Sciences (SPSS) v15, StatsDirect or Stata for analysis. All patient identifiers&#xD;
      will be removed. The study data will be kept for 5 years and destroyed thereafter by deleting&#xD;
      it from the hard drive of the Hospital computers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a pilot study, an estimate of effectiveness is not the primary aim of the&#xD;
      analysis. However, as part of the secondary outcome measures, an analysis of the Minimally&#xD;
      Clinically Important Difference results from the EQ5D (0.14 from the EQ5D index) between the&#xD;
      3 arms of the study will be performed to establish if there are differences identified that&#xD;
      can allow the investigators to power a larger study. Regarding secondary outcomes, the&#xD;
      research team will be interested in the central tendency and variation found in the outcome&#xD;
      data. Thus descriptive analyses will be conducted giving means and standard deviations of&#xD;
      outcome scores or median and interquartile ranges where appropriate, if the data are not&#xD;
      normally distributed and cannot be easily transformed. This will apply to the various&#xD;
      questionnaire-based outcome measures. Estimates of central tendency and variation will enable&#xD;
      a sample size calculation to be conducted in order to power a larger definitive trial at a&#xD;
      later date. The research team will arrange for independent statistical analysis of the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the substantive study, there will be an analysis of covariance as there are 3 groups&#xD;
      being compared with repeated measure Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) as data are being collected&#xD;
      at more than one time point (i.e. at follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures to avoid bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participants will be blinded as to which arm of the study they are allocated to.&#xD;
           However, the participants allocated to one of the cone arms of the study may recognise&#xD;
           this when they called for the post-operative CT scan. It is not ethical to CT scan all&#xD;
           participants due to the radiation exposure when useful information from this examination&#xD;
           can only be gleaned from the groups who have a cone implanted. Thus, patients with a&#xD;
           cone device in situ may work out that they must have a cone device when they are having&#xD;
           a CT scan. However, study participants will not be able to determine whether a short or&#xD;
           long-stemmed TKR is in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The surgeon cannot be blinded to randomisation as he will be performing the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The members of staff interpreting the results of the CT and DEXA scans cannot be blinded&#xD;
           as to which group the patients are allocated to as it will be clear to see on the&#xD;
           radiological images&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The physiotherapist carrying out the functional assessments will be blinded to study arm&#xD;
           allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No surgeon will report upon the x-rays of a patient upon whom they have operated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The statistician analysing the results will be blinded to study arm allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personnel:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chief Investigator- Andrew Toms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgeons-Andrew Toms, Jonathan Phillips and Keith Eyres&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-Ray interpretation: Andrew Toms, Jonathan Phillips and Keith Eyres. No surgeon will&#xD;

&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the research staff will be trained as per the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      (GCP) in research trained. All National Health Service (NHS) staff involved are bound by&#xD;
      patient confidentiality requirements of the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr Knapp (who undertakes the DEXA scans at Exeter University) will be bound to&#xD;
      confidentiality requirements as part of GCP adherence as will Michael Gundry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants GP will be informed that their patient is involved in the research-&#xD;
      particularly as the patient may wish to discuss their involvement in the research with their&#xD;
      GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the data associated with the study will be kept electronically on the hard drives of&#xD;
      computers within the Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU). It will be stored on encrypted&#xD;
      and password protected hospital computers. The data will only be accessible by members of the&#xD;
      research team and by the R+D department at the RD+E Hospital who will require access to the&#xD;
      data to ensure compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study (see timescales below), all research data will be destroyed by being&#xD;
      permanently deleted from the RD+E hospital computers. Copies will be archived by the study&#xD;
      sponsor in line with standard research material archiving procedures. Radiographs and scans&#xD;
      will remain on the secure hospital systems as per routine care.&#xD;

      Timescales:&#xD;
&#xD;
      62 rTKR operations were carried out at the RD+E in 2015. Of these, approximately 35 cases&#xD;
      would have met the study inclusion criteria. If one considers that 20% of potential study&#xD;
      participants will decline participation, it is estimated that 28 candidates could be&#xD;
      recruited per year. Thus recruitment of 51 candidates is likely to take just under 2 years,&#xD;
      provided adequate numbers of new cases are identified as needing revision and meet the entry&#xD;
      criteria. However, there are at this time, approximately 15 patients awaiting surgery who&#xD;
      already meet the entry criteria for this study. These patients have the potential to allow&#xD;
      faster recruitment to the pilot study as their surgery is already planned as opposed to&#xD;
      waiting for patients to be seen in clinics and for decisions to be taken regarding the need&#xD;
      for surgery, and then patients being placed on surgical waiting lists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary analysis of the data will be performed once the 51 patients are recruited and&#xD;
      have completed 6 months post-operative follow-up (i.e. 2.5 years after recruitment of the 1st&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete follow up is for 5 years post entry into the study. It will take a further 1 year&#xD;
      for data analysis, project write up and submission for publication post study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, if 51 participants are recruited over 2 years, followed up for 5 years and the&#xD;
      data is analysed over 1 year, the total study length is 8 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the preliminary analysis of the first 51 cases allows calculation of a sample size for a&#xD;
      substantive study, the research team will then be able to give an estimate for study length&#xD;
      for the substantive study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be destroyed 5 years after completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be informed in writing of the results if they so desire. The Research&#xD;
      and Development department at the RD+E will be informed of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team plan to present the results both nationally and internationally at knee&#xD;
      surgery conferences (such as the British Orthopaedic Association and the European Knee&#xD;
      Society) and to publish the results in a peer reviewed journal (such as the Bone and Joint&#xD;
      Journal, the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery-America, The Journal of Arthroplasty.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is an internal pilot study, the impact of this study may be limited. The main aim is&#xD;
      to answer the pilot study aims and objectives. However, if it is possible to identify a clear&#xD;
      advantage of one study arm over the others, then it is likely that this technique will become&#xD;
      standard rTKR procedure- with the aim of providing patients with the best clinical and&#xD;
      functional results after their revision knee surgery. Similarly, if a clear difference is&#xD;
      found in one study arm, it is hoped that presentation of the results to colleagues at other&#xD;
      institutions will result in better long term results for their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that no technique proves superior to the others, then this will provide surgeons&#xD;
      with the reassurance that no matter what their preferred technique, no patient is being&#xD;
      disadvantaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is found that the cemented rTKR performs as well or better than the cone device plus&#xD;
      knee replacement, and if this became the technique of choice for this operation, this could&#xD;
      have significant cost savings for the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflicts of Interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stryker UK have supported this study financially. However, it remains completely independent&#xD;
      from them in study design, results and dissemination of findings. The 3 surgeons involved all&#xD;
      undertake consultancy work for Stryker UK and will complete the necessary applications&#xD;
      regarding this on the ethics application for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The out-patient appointments, surgical costs, follow up costs and plain radiographs are&#xD;
           all costs paid for by the NHS as part of routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional assessment, CT scan, DEXA scan. These costs will be covered by external&#xD;
           funding provided by Stryker UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research support nurses are paid for by the RD+E Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study coordinator will provide the support for participant identification,&#xD;
           recruitment, ensuring time frame adherence for follow up appointments, scans and&#xD;
           functional assessment and will maintain the database of study data. Salary costs for&#xD;
           this are being met by Stryker UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Costs of statistician for analysis of results after the study will be met by the&#xD;
           external funding provided by Stryker UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Involvement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team have consulted with patients on the feasibility of participating in the&#xD;
      study at all and in particular about the demands of attending the appointments for functional&#xD;
      assessment. The study was discussed at the EKRU patient research panel. (This panel is a&#xD;
      group of patients who have undergone knee replacement surgery in the EKRU and who are&#xD;
      therefore, well placed to comment on the practicalities of study involvement, as well as on&#xD;
      the appropriateness and clarity of the patient information leaflet.) Attendance at all time&#xD;
      frames is critical for completion of the secondary measure functional outcome and it was&#xD;
      stressed by the patient representatives that the patients need to be fully informed of the&#xD;
      commitment required should they agree to take part. Similarly, it was recommended that the&#xD;
      extra commitment for CT and DEXA scan appointments be highlighted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bi-annual meetings of the patient research panel are held and if issues arise when running&#xD;
      the study that require further patient involvement, they will be taken to the panel for&#xD;
      consultation. If a meeting is not due for some time, the research team will contact a panel&#xD;
      member personally for their advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the research team consulted on the design and wording of the patient information leaflet&#xD;
      and the consent form, various changes were recommended and implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the operative care is already part of routine practice in the RD+E Hospital. Thus the&#xD;
      research team do not believe involvement in this study changes the risks from surgery that&#xD;
      the patients already face as a part of routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator has discussed the study with the radiological protection officer (RPO)&#xD;
      at the RD+E Hospital who has provided radiation dose calculations and a risk assessment based&#xD;
      on plain x-ray as per routine care, and the pre-op, 6 week post-op and 3, 6, 12, 24 and 60&#xD;
      month post-op DEXA scans. The RPO will be our medical physics expert (MPE) on the ethics&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing a knee replacement have 7 planar x-ray examinations at the same&#xD;
      frequency of the study and will receive a radiation dose of 717.5µSv (milli Sieverts)-&#xD;
      equivalent to 3.4months background radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients involved in the study will receive 7 additional DEXA examinations of the Lumbar&#xD;
      spine, dual hip, total body and both knees receiving a total dose of 740.5µSv which includes&#xD;
      the additional 23µSv,i.e. the DEXA adds very little extra dose. The lifetime risk of&#xD;
      developing a cancer resulting from this excess dose is 1 in 1,100,000 for a 50 year old&#xD;
      patient, (this would fall to 1 in 1,600,000 for a 65 year old patient). For the ages of the&#xD;
      expected cohort, this is considered to be a negligible risk (Health Protection Agency Centre&#xD;
      for Radiation Chemical and Environmental Hazards (HPA-CRCE) 028, 2011 and National Radiation&#xD;
      Protection Board (NRPB), 2001 and is equivalent to around 3.4 days of natural background&#xD;
      radiation in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who undergo 1 additional dual energy CT examination of the knee will receive a&#xD;
      total dose of 890.5µSv, which includes 23 µSv for the DEXA studies and a dose of 150µSv for&#xD;
      the CT. Their total additional dose is 173 µSv. The lifetime risk of developing a cancer from&#xD;
      this excess dose is 1 in 150,000 for a 50 year old patient, (this would fall to 1 in 218,000&#xD;
      for a 65 year old patient). For the ages of the expected cohort, this is considered to be a&#xD;
      very low risk (HPA-CRCE-028, 2011 and NRPB, 2001) and is equivalent to around 0.8 of a month&#xD;
      of natural background radiation in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring Adverse Events/Stopping the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A log of adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse device effects and serious adverse&#xD;
      device effects will be kept by the study coordinator. Any such event events occurring in the&#xD;
      immediate peri and post-operative events should be reported to the study coordinator by the&#xD;
      consultant surgeon in charge of the case who will contact the study sponsor within the time&#xD;
      frames as specified by them. Similarly any such adverse events may be identified in clinic&#xD;
      and again, the surgeon concerned should report these back to the study coordinator to be&#xD;
      logged and the sponsor will be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that adverse events will occur that are dealt with either by the Accident and&#xD;
      Emergency (A+E) department, the patient's GP or other hospitals. These may not be readily&#xD;
      apparent to the research team. Therefore the team will specifically ask participants to&#xD;
      inform their surgeon if any complications or adverse events occur and similarly ask the&#xD;
      surgeons to specifically ask their patients for this information at each clinic attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meeting of the research team will be held on a 3 monthly basis to discuss progress of the&#xD;
      study, any specific problems and to consider whether there are any justifications for&#xD;
      stopping the study. As all 3 techniques being studied of performing rTKR are already part of&#xD;
      routine practice, and it is not anticipated that an unexpected complication will be&#xD;
      identified that would necessitation an early termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
