  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting is defined as any nausea, retching, or vomiting occurring&#xD;
      during the first 24-48 h after surgery in inpatients. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is&#xD;
      one of the most common causes of patient dissatisfaction after anesthesia, with reported&#xD;
      incidences of 30% in all post-surgical patients and up to 80% in high-risk patients. In&#xD;
      addition, postoperative nausea and vomiting is regularly rated in preoperative surveys, as&#xD;
      the anesthesia outcome the patient would most like to avoid. While suture dehiscence,&#xD;
      aspiration of gastric contents, esophageal rupture, and other serious complications&#xD;
      associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting are rare, nausea and vomiting is still an&#xD;
      unpleasant and all-too-common postoperative morbidity that can delay patient discharge from&#xD;
      the post-anesthesia care unit and increase unanticipated hospital admissions in outpatients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many well-established risk factors for Postoperative nausea and vomiting which are&#xD;
      classified in two classes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Patient related risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Female gender is consistently the strongest risk factor for postoperative nausea and&#xD;
           vomiting, female patient are three times more likely than men to suffer from&#xD;
           postoperative nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For adult patient, age is a statistically, though not clinically, relevant risk factor,&#xD;
           with the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting decreasing as patients age. For&#xD;
           pediatric patients, however, age increases the risk of post-operative vomiting , such&#xD;
           that children older than 3 years have been shown to have an increased risk of&#xD;
           post-operative vomiting compared with children younger than 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obesity is a strong risk factor for postoperative nausea and vomiting : patients with&#xD;
           body mass index more than 30 have the double risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Non-smoking status roughly doubles the patient's risk of postoperative nausea and&#xD;
           vomiting. The specific mechanism underlying smoking's protective effect is unknown, but&#xD;
           one of the most commonly believed theories is that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in&#xD;
           cigarette smoke induce cytochrome P450 enzyme which increase the metabolism of&#xD;
           emetogenic volatile anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. History of gastrointestinal disease as gastritis, gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer&#xD;
           increases the risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. History of motion sickness, Meniere's disease or previous postoperative nausea and&#xD;
           vomiting indicates a general susceptibility to postoperative nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Anesthesia related risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The use of volatile anesthetics is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of&#xD;
           postoperative nausea and vomiting , with risk increasing in a dose dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intraoperative and postoperative opioid use increases the risk of postoperative nausea&#xD;
           and vomiting in a dose dependent manner by the mechanism of reducing muscle tone and&#xD;
           peristaltic activity, thereby delaying gastric emptying, inducing distention, and&#xD;
           triggering the vomiting reflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The duration of anesthesia can help predict the patient's risk of postoperative nausea&#xD;
           and vomiting, since the duration of anesthesia describes the patient's exposure to&#xD;
           emetogenic stimuli like volatile anesthetics and intraoperative opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two lines of anti-emetic drugs used to treat postoperative nausea and vomiting :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first line is classified into three classes: serotonin antagonists (e.g. ondansetron),&#xD;
      corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone), and dopamine antagonists (e.g. droperidol) have similar&#xD;
      efficacy against postoperative nausea and vomiting , with a relative risk reduction of ~25%.&#xD;
      Moreover, they act independently and when used in combination, have additive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone can be effective in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting in adults and&#xD;
      children. Compared with other operative medications, dexamethasone has equal or even better&#xD;
      efficacy in reducing the incidence of Postoperative nausea and vomiting and has the&#xD;
      advantages of low cost and longer effectiveness as well. The mechanism of the antiemetic&#xD;
      action of dexamethasone is still not clearly known. Glucocorticoids receptors are found in&#xD;
      nucleus of the solitary tract, the raphe nucleus and the area postrema and all are associated&#xD;
      with regulating nausea and vomiting. Dexamethasone may affect postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting by modulating neurotransmission or receptor density in these nuclei. Clinically,&#xD;
      dexamethasone as a preventive drug against postoperative nausea and vomiting has not caused&#xD;
      fatal outcome; therefore, it is generally considered to be an effective and safe anti-emetic.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, its use in this regard may lead to adverse effects, principally postoperative&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second line is characterized by less favorable side effect profiles or limited evidence&#xD;
      of efficacy: Metoclopramide is a widely used D2 antagonist. Contrary to popular belief, the&#xD;
      10 mg dose has no effect on post-operative nausea and vomiting, but 25-50 mg has similar&#xD;
      efficacy compared with other anti-emetics. Metoclopramide use has been associated with&#xD;
      extrapyramidal and sedative side-effects. Dimenhydrinate is an antihistamine like&#xD;
      promethazine and cyclizine. There are few randomized controlled trials investigating its use&#xD;
      for postoperative nausea and vomiting , and the drug is associated with a significant rate of&#xD;
      side-effects like sedation, dry mouth, visual disturbance, and urinary retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azithromycin , one of macrolides, was introduced in the 1950s and after years of clinical&#xD;
      experience it still remains a commonly relied upon antibiotic but the function of&#xD;
      erythromycin as a prokinetic agent has also been investigated recently for a range of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal motility disorders and more recently within the context of critically ill&#xD;
      patients. Azithromycin has a gastrointestinal motility stimulating effect; it has been known&#xD;
      for over 20 years that they act as a motilin receptor agonist in the gut and gallbladder&#xD;
      stimulating enteric nerves and smooth muscle and triggering a phase of the migrating&#xD;
      myoelectric complex. The antral motor effects of erythromycin A in humans are mediated via&#xD;
      different pathways. The induction of a premature activity is mediated through activation of&#xD;
      an intrinsic cholinergic pathway, while the induction of enhanced antral contractile activity&#xD;
      may be mediated via a pathway potentially involving activation of non muscular receptor.&#xD;
      Different doses of azithromycin may have different effects - as suggested in studies in&#xD;
      patients with diabetic gastro-paresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty mg azithromycin elicited a premature phase 3 complex that started in the stomach and&#xD;
      migrated to the small intestine, while doses of 200 and 350 mg erythromycin A elicited a&#xD;
      burst of antral phase-3-like contractions that did not migrate to the small intestine, but&#xD;
      were followed by a prolonged period of antral contractile activity.&#xD;
