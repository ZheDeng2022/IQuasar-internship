      the immune (antibody) response, efficacy and safety of a cell-derived quadrivalent subunit&#xD;
      influenza virus vaccine (Seqirus QIVc) in comparison with a non-influenza comparator,&#xD;
      meningococcal serogroup A, C, W-135, and Y (Menveo®, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, S.A.) in&#xD;

      This Phase 3/4, randomized, observer-blind, multi-center, stratified study evaluated the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a cell-derived quadrivalent subunit influenza virus&#xD;
      vaccine (Seqirus QIVc) compared to a non-influenza comparator vaccine in healthy male and&#xD;
      female participants between 2 to &lt;18 years of age. A total of 4514 children/teens were&#xD;
      randomized, receiving either QIVc or the non-influenza comparator vaccine. The comparator was&#xD;
      (meningococcal [Groups A, C, W-135, and Y] oligosaccharide diphtheria CRM197 conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine [Men ACWY]). Randomized enrollment was stratified in a 1:1 ratio via an Interactive&#xD;
      Response Technology (IRT) system which assigned the participants into two age cohorts: 2 to&#xD;
      &lt;9 years of age and 9 to &lt;18 years of age. Subjects between 2 to &lt;9 years of age were further&#xD;
      stratified by previous influenza vaccine status (&quot;previously vaccinated&quot; or &quot;not previously&#xD;
      vaccinated&quot;).&#xD;
