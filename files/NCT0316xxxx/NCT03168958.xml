      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery often experience moderate to severe pain in the early&#xD;
      postoperative period. A number of methods have been used to help control pain after surgery;&#xD;
      however, each of these techniques adds additional costs and risks. A simple and effective way&#xD;
      to decrease this pain is to administer a long-acting opioid in the operating room. Methadone&#xD;
      is a opioid that can produce analgesia (pain relief) that lasts up to 48 hours when given in&#xD;
      large doses (0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg). Previous studies have demonstrated that both pain and&#xD;
      requirements for analgesic medications are significantly reduced for up to three days after&#xD;
      surgery if methadone is given at induction (the start) of anesthesia. In the study that was&#xD;
      performed at Evanston Hospital, cardiac surgical patients who were given methadone also&#xD;
      appeared to &quot;feel better&quot; after surgery compared to those given a standard or typical&#xD;
      intraoperative opioid. The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to determine whether&#xD;
      overall quality of postoperative recovery can be enhanced if methadone is given in the&#xD;
      operating room. Quality of recovery will be determined by using a validated scoring system,&#xD;
      the QoR 40, which will be given to patients to complete on the first three days after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      Postoperative pain for the adult cardiac surgery patient is complex. Pain can be caused by&#xD;
      incisions, intraoperative tissue retraction and dissection, multiple intravascular&#xD;
      cannulations, chest tubes left after surgery, and multiple invasive procedures that patients&#xD;
      undergo in the operating room and intensive care unit (ICU). Postoperative pain has been&#xD;
      described as one of the primary sources of concern for cardiac surgery patients. In this&#xD;
      patient population, several studies have demonstrated that pain intensity was moderately&#xD;
      severe (approximately 5 on an intensity scale of 10) during the first 2 postoperative days&#xD;
      (POD) and did not begin to decline until POD 3. The primary method of pain management used in&#xD;
      cardiac surgical patients during early recovery in the intensive care unit (ICU) is the&#xD;
      administration of intravenous morphine. Morphine is typically administered per patient&#xD;
      request or during nursing assessments for pain. Studies have demonstrated that relatively&#xD;
      small doses of morphine (or oral analgesics on the ward) are used following cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      The relatively high intensity of postoperative pain and the low doses of analgesics&#xD;
      administered suggest that postoperative pain in cardiac surgical patients is an&#xD;
      under-recognized and under-treated problem in the early recovery period. Therefore, methods&#xD;
      to more successfully manage pain are needed, especially during the first postoperative days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids remain the primary therapeutic agents for treatment of pain after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Intermittent (every 3-4 hour) intravenous administration remains the most common mode of&#xD;
      delivery. This technique results in significant fluctuations in serum levels of opioids and&#xD;
      consequently variability in levels of pain control. An alternative strategy is the use of an&#xD;
      opioid with a long half-life which will provide stable blood concentrations after a single&#xD;
      intravenous dose. Such an opioid could provide prolonged and constant analgesia. Methadone is&#xD;
      an opioid which fulfills these criteria. A primary advantage of methadone is its long&#xD;
      half-life, which ranges from 25-52 hours. This unique property of methadone means that single&#xD;
      daily doses can be used. Although it is best known as a drug used to treat narcotic&#xD;
      addiction, methadone has also been used as an analgesic agent. A number of recent&#xD;
      investigations have demonstrated that methadone is effective in treating a number of chronic&#xD;
      pain conditions. Methadone has also been studied as an agent to provide prolonged&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia. When methadone was administered intravenously to surgical patients,&#xD;
      a half-life of 35 hours was observed, resulting in a median duration of analgesia lasting 26&#xD;
      hours. In patients undergoing abdominal, orthopedic, or gynecologic surgery, the use of a&#xD;
      single dose of methadone (20 mg or 0.25-0.3 mg/kg) at induction of anesthesia resulted in&#xD;
      improved analgesia for the first 24 hours after surgery, when compared to other&#xD;
      intraoperative opioids. In these investigations, patients in the methadone groups required&#xD;
      significantly less postoperative pain medication and reported lower pain scores during the&#xD;
      first postoperative day. Up to 39% of patients required no additional pain medications,&#xD;
      despite undergoing major surgery associated with moderate-to severe-levels of postoperative&#xD;
      pain. No adverse events directly attributable to methadone were reported in these clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery typically receive a moderate dose of a short-acting&#xD;
      opioid (most-commonly fentanyl) at the time of induction of anesthesia. Many clinicians&#xD;
      believe that the analgesic effects of fentanyl will persist into the postoperative period.&#xD;
      However, when standard doses (500-1000 mcg) of this opioid are given at induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia in cardiac patients, a relatively short plasma half-life is observed (3.3 hours).&#xD;
      An intraoperative opioid with more desirable pharmacokinetic (long half-life and low&#xD;
      clearance) and pharmacodynamic properties may provide for improved postoperative analgesia in&#xD;
      a cardiac surgical patient population. In addition to providing for prolonged pain relief,&#xD;
      methadone has other unique properties that may be advantageous in cardiac surgical patients.&#xD;
      Recent evidence has demonstrated that methadone has the ability to block N-methyl-D-aspartate&#xD;
      (NMDA) receptors. NMDA receptors have been implicated in the development of postoperative&#xD;
      hyperalgesia (amplification of pain stimuli), and techniques that block NMDA receptors reduce&#xD;
      pain. In addition, recent evidence has demonstrated that blockade of NMDA receptors may&#xD;
      reduce depression and improve mood. Furthermore, methadone inhibits the reuptake of serotonin&#xD;
      and norepinephrine; elevation of these monoamines may play a role in antinociception and mood&#xD;
      elevation. Finally, the use of methadone has been reported to be associated with a reduced&#xD;
      incidence of nausea and vomiting, when compared to other standard intraoperative opioids.&#xD;
      These findings suggest that in addition to providing prolonged and consistent pain relief,&#xD;
      methadone may improve several other components of postoperative recovery. Previous studies of&#xD;
      opioid use in patients undergoing cardiac surgery have focused on physiologic variables and&#xD;
      major adverse events as primary endpoints. As the safety of anesthesia and surgery has&#xD;
      improved, assessment of quality of postoperative recovery has become an increasingly&#xD;
      important outcome measure in clinical research. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of&#xD;
      postoperative recovery should include factors important to both clinicians (hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS)) and patients (physical comfort,&#xD;
      mood). In particular, an important component of recovery from anesthesia and surgery is&#xD;
      patient perception of quality of health in the early postoperative period. Several tools have&#xD;
      been recently developed to assess this outcome variable. The QoR-40 is a 40-item scoring&#xD;
      system specifically designed to measure health status following anesthesia. The QoR-40&#xD;
      measures five dimensions of recovery: physical comfort (12 questions); emotional state (9&#xD;
      questions); physical independence (5 questions); psychological support (7 questions); and&#xD;
      pain (7 questions). Each question is rated by the patient on a five-point Likert scale, with&#xD;
      possible scores ranging from 40 (extremely poor quality of recovery) to 200 (excellent&#xD;
      quality of recovery). A systematic review of instruments used to measure patient-based&#xD;
      recovery outcomes determined that the QoR-40 was the only assessment tool that fulfilled the&#xD;
      criteria of appropriateness, reliability, validity, responsiveness, precision,&#xD;
      interpretability, acceptability, and feasibility. The QoR-40 has been used to assess the&#xD;
      impact of anesthetic interventions on recovery after cardiac surgery; furthermore, low&#xD;
      postoperative QoR-40 scores have been associated with complications and increased hospital&#xD;
      LOS in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this randomized, double-blind study is to examine the effect of a single&#xD;
      intraoperative dose of methadone on quality of recovery in the early postoperative period.&#xD;
      Quality of recovery will be assessed using the QoR 40 scoring system over the first 3&#xD;
      postoperative days. Secondary outcome measures to be assessed will include postoperative pain&#xD;
      scores and analgesic requirements, as well as other standard recovery variables (length of&#xD;
      postoperative intubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, incidence of nausea or vomiting,&#xD;
      level of sedation). Based upon the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties of&#xD;
      methadone, we hypothesize that patients randomized to receive this long-acting opioid will&#xD;
      have improved QoR 40 scores, particularly in the dimensions of physical comfort, emotional&#xD;
      state, and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Patients: One-hundred patients will be enrolled in this clinical trial. All&#xD;
      patients presenting for elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass will be eligible&#xD;
      for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic management: Patients will be randomized to receive either methadone or&#xD;
      saline-control on the basis of a computer generated random number table. Patients in the&#xD;
      methadone group will receive a standard intraoperative dose of methadone that will allow for&#xD;
      early tracheal extubation (within 4-8 hours of the conclusion of the surgical procedure).&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the methadone group will be given 0.4 mg/kg of methadone at induction&#xD;
      of anesthesia (maximal dose 30 mg). Patients assigned to the saline-control group will be&#xD;
      administered saline at anesthetic induction. Study drugs will be prepared by the pharmacy.&#xD;
      The syringes will be administered over five minutes at induction of anesthesia. The&#xD;
      administration of all other anesthetic agents will be standardized and reflect the usual&#xD;
      practices of cardiac anesthesiologists at NorthShore. All anesthesia care team members,&#xD;
      nurses, surgeons, and researchers will be blinded to group assignment throughout the hospital&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection The primary endpoint of the study is the QoR 40 score. The QoR-40 consists of&#xD;
      40 questions designed to assess quality of recovery following anesthesia and surgery. The QoR&#xD;
      40 will be presented to the patient to complete four times in the perioperative period;&#xD;
      immediately before surgery, and the morning (9AM to 11 AM) of postoperative days 1, 2, and 3.&#xD;
      The questionnaire will be completed by the patient. If the patient is unable to circle the&#xD;
      correct responses on the form, a researcher will verbally present the questions to the&#xD;
      patient and then record the responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data will be collected by a research assistant at the time the QoR 40 is completed&#xD;
      by the patient. Pain on 11-point verbal analogue scale (0=no pain, 10=worst pain imaginable)&#xD;
      will be assessed at rest and with coughing. Level of sedation will be determined by observers&#xD;
      using a 4-point sedation scale (0=fully awake, 1=mildly sedated (seldom drowsy and easy to&#xD;
      awake), 2=moderately sedated (often drowsy and easy to awake), 3=severely sedated (somnolent,&#xD;
      difficult to awake). Any episodes of nausea and vomiting will be recorded. Patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with overall pain management will be determined using a 100-point verbal rating&#xD;
      scale (1=highly dissatisfied (worst), 100=highly satisfied (best)). The amount of pain&#xD;
      medication used in each study interval (listed above) will be recorded.&#xD;
