  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Walking can be slow and unsteady in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study will&#xD;
      investigate whether orthotic shorts might help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthotic shorts are similar to the tight clothing believed to improve performance in&#xD;
      athletes. Research suggests that such shorts help stroke survivors to walk faster. Some&#xD;
      people with MS find that similar garments improve coordination and stability. Public funding&#xD;
      is controversial because there is no research investigating whether they work in people with&#xD;
      MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-over study in which participants will each trial two different pairs of&#xD;
      shorts. The first aim is to determine whether these shorts are acceptable to people with MS.&#xD;
      Secondly, the study will develop the tools required to test the shorts. For example, by&#xD;
      determining which measures seem most appropriate and if specific factors predict whether the&#xD;
      shorts might help. The hypothesis being tested is that the shorts are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with MS will be invited to participate in this mixed methods study, aiming for a&#xD;
      sample size of 16 people. Participants will trial two different pairs of shorts, one of which&#xD;
      will fit more closely than the other. The shorts will be tested in a movement laboratory and&#xD;
      in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the movement laboratory, participants will be measured in both pairs of shorts and in&#xD;
      normal, loose clothing. Walking pattern, speed and variability will be measured when the&#xD;
      shorts are first worn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will test shorts in their normal daily life for up to two weeks. They will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires about their walking and balance in the different shorts and record&#xD;
      how long they wear the shorts. Interviews will explore expectations and experiences of the&#xD;
      shorts and of the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the analyses, data from interviews will be combined with the numerical information gained&#xD;
      from laboratory measures, diaries and questionnaires. If the shorts are acceptable, this&#xD;
      study will inform a larger trial investigating effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design - This is a mixed methods, randomised cross-over study investigating two&#xD;
      different pairs of orthotic shorts. The shorts will be tested in two main ways, firstly, the&#xD;
      impact of the shorts on objectively assessed walking ability when first worn and, secondly,&#xD;
      acceptability and impact of the shorts on self-perceived ability over a two-week period when&#xD;
      the shorts are worn in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants - Participants will be people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) who identify&#xD;
      themselves as having some difficulty walking, with a lack of stability around the hips and/or&#xD;
      lower trunk. The study aims to recruit 16 PwMS over a 15-16-month period. It is felt that a&#xD;
      sample size of 16 will enable the shorts to be trialled with participants with a range of&#xD;
      different movement problems as well as different ages, genders and activity levels. These&#xD;
      characteristics may impact upon the effect and acceptability of the shorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment - Participants will be made aware of the study through flyers, online&#xD;
      advertisements and in discussion with local healthcare professionals. Potential participants&#xD;
      will be identified through a local neurological therapy service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure - Each participant will visit Sheffield Hallam University on four occasions and be&#xD;
      seen at home on three occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first Sheffield Hallam visit (Appointment 1) will include informed consent, collection of&#xD;
      basic participant details, an initial interview around expectations and motivations,&#xD;
      completion of self-report measures, assessment and measurement for shorts with a&#xD;
      representative from the orthotics company and provision of a falls diary for completion over&#xD;
      the following two weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to the order in which the&#xD;
      different shorts will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second and third Sheffield Hallam visits (Appointments 3 and 5) follow the same structure&#xD;
      with each visit testing one of the two pairs of shorts. Firstly, walking ability without the&#xD;
      shorts will be measured. They will put the shorts on and spend about 30 minutes becoming&#xD;
      familiar with wearing the shorts before the objective measures are repeated. After the&#xD;
      objective assessments, participants will be provided with further information on wearing and&#xD;
      caring for the shorts and a wear diary and falls diary to be completed whilst the shorts are&#xD;
      trialed at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final Sheffield Hallam visit (Appointment 7) will include a final measure of walking&#xD;
      ability without shorts plus a semi-structured interview around the participants' experiences&#xD;
      of the shorts and the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In between the above visits to Sheffield Hallam, there will be three shorter visits. Each&#xD;
      participant can choose to attend university or meet in an agreed location if preferred. The&#xD;
      first of these (Appointment 2) will be with the representative from the orthotics company to&#xD;
      check the fit of the shorts and measure the pressure exerted by the shorts. If adjustments&#xD;
      are required at this point, this will be done within 3 days and the shorts will then be&#xD;
      delivered to the chief investigator. Appointments 4 and 6 are to collect the shorts, the&#xD;
      diaries and the self-report measures reporting the perceived impact of the shorts after the&#xD;
      period of home wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - The orthotic shorts will be custom-made by a UK based company that specialises&#xD;
      in dynamic, elastomeric orthoses for healthcare and sport. They will provide two pairs of&#xD;
      shorts for each participant, which will differ in the closeness of their fit. The company&#xD;
      representative, who will assess each participant, will decide the compression and fit of the&#xD;
      shorts, such as whether support for the lower trunk is required. The shorts can be&#xD;
      manufactured with a toileting hole, if preferred, allowing participants to toilet without&#xD;
      removing the shorts. Shorts with a toileting hole are usually worn beneath usual underwear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and allocation - Counter-balancing will ensure that half the group use the more&#xD;
      closely fitting shorts first and half the looser shorts first. A randomisation schedule will&#xD;
      be created by a using the Sealed Envelope online system for blocked randomisation. Shorts&#xD;
      will be placed into sealed envelopes labelled &quot;Shorts 1&quot; and &quot;Shorts 2&quot; by a third party&#xD;
      using the randomisation schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection - Semi-structured interviews will be conducted on two occasions for each&#xD;
      participant - at the first appointment and at the final appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Appointment 1, participants will be interviewed to explore their motivations for joining&#xD;
      the study, their expectations of the shorts, their current daily activities and their&#xD;
      readiness for change. The data from this interview will enable investigation of whether&#xD;
      certain aims, motivations or perceptions impact upon the eventual acceptability of the&#xD;
      shorts. This initial interview is likely to last 20 - 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Appointment 7, participants will be interviewed about their experiences during the study.&#xD;
      This interview aims to determine the acceptability of the shorts and participants' views on&#xD;
      the study processes such as the information and support they received, and the outcome&#xD;
      measures used. Prior to the interview, the interviewer will review the data and reflective&#xD;
      notes from the initial interview; the wear diaries and the Participant Global Rating of&#xD;
      Change scores at the initial assessment and will use this information to inform the questions&#xD;
      that are asked. This will ensure the interviews are focussed on aspects that are important to&#xD;
      each participant. This final interview is likely to last 40 - 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of walking ability - Outcome measures are described elsewhere and have been chosen&#xD;
      according to current guidelines on the most relevant assessment battery for walking in PwMS.&#xD;
      In addition to movement laboratory measures, participants will complete self-report&#xD;
      assessments of their walking and balance; a falls diary and a rating of the overall impact on&#xD;
      the shorts on their walking ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis - Qualitative and quantitative data will first be analysed separately and then&#xD;
      combined, partly by transforming qualitative into categorical data where this provides a&#xD;
      valid representation of the data and partly by comparing, contrasting and relating the&#xD;
      findings of the different data types for each objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data analysis will use the Framework Approach to thematic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive quantitative data analysis will determine individual and average changes on each&#xD;
      measure and effect sizes for the impact of the shorts. Effect sizes will indicate which&#xD;
      measures are most responsive to this intervention and this information may be used to inform&#xD;
      a sample size calculation for future studies.&#xD;
