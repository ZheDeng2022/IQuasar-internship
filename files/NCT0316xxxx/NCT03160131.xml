  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark, about 120,000 people suffer from brain damage, of whom approx. 75,000 with brain&#xD;
      damage after stroke. Serious and often lasting vision impairments affect 20% to 35% of people&#xD;
      after stroke. Vision is the most important sense in humans, and even smaller permanent&#xD;
      injuries can drastically reduce quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vision impairments after brain damage inhibits rehabilitation and enhances other invalidating&#xD;
      effects. Reduced vision results in impaired balance, increased risk of serious falls,&#xD;
      increased support needs, reduced quality of life, and impaired ability to perform activities&#xD;
      of daily living. Restoration of visual field impairments occur only to a small extent during&#xD;
      the first month after brain damage, and therefore the time window for spontaneous&#xD;
      improvements is very limited. Hence, brain-impaired persons with visual impairment will most&#xD;
      likely experience chronically impaired vision already 4 weeks after brain injury and the need&#xD;
      for visual compensatory rehabilitation is substantial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuro Vision Technology (NVT) is an supervised training course where people with visual&#xD;
      impairments are trained in compensatory techniques using special equipment. Through the NVT&#xD;
      process, the individual's vision problems are carefully investigated and personal data is&#xD;
      used to organize individual training sessions that practice the individual in coping with&#xD;
      situations that cause problems in everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether rehabilitation with NVT can cause&#xD;
      significant and lasting improvement in functional capacity in persons with chronic visual&#xD;
      impairments after brain injury. Improving eyesight is expected to increase both physical and&#xD;
      mental functioning, thus improving the quality of life. Participants included in the project&#xD;
      will be investigated in terms of both visual and mental functions, including quality of life,&#xD;
      cognition and depression. Such an investigation has not been performed previously and can&#xD;
      have a significant impact on vision rehabilitation both nationally and internationally.&#xD;

      Background and purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke is the main cause of brain injury in Denmark, is the most common cause of invalidity&#xD;
      among adults and affects 11,000 Danes annually. By comparison, the second most common cause&#xD;
      of brain damage is traumatic brain injury, affecting 3,000 Danes annually. In total, approx.&#xD;
      22,000 children and adults annually experience brain injury in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark, about 120,000 people suffer from brain damage, of whom approx. 75,000 with brain&#xD;
      damage after stroke. Serious and often lasting vision impairments affect 20% to 35% of people&#xD;
      with stroke. In general, vision is the most important sense in humans, thus even small&#xD;
      permanent deficits can dramatically affect the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of vision (anopia) after brain damage limits rehabilitation and enhances other&#xD;
      invalidating effects. Impaired vision results in impaired balance, increased risk of serious&#xD;
      falls, increased support needs, reduced quality of life and impaired ability to perform&#xD;
      activities of daily living. Recovery of visual field deficits occurs primarily and only to a&#xD;
      modest extent the first month after brain injury, and thus the time window for spontaneous&#xD;
      improvements is very limited. Hence, brain-impaired persons with visual impairment will most&#xD;
      likely experience chronically impaired vision already 4 weeks after brain injury, and the&#xD;
      need for visual compensatory rehabilitation is substantial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuro Vision Technology (NVT) is a supervised training course where people with visual field&#xD;
      deficits are trained in compensatory and restorative techniques. The course includes a&#xD;
      special computer program, a light panel and a special training program, and the course is&#xD;
      conducted with Certified Orientation &amp; Mobility Instructors (O &amp; M instructors) with visual&#xD;
      expertise. Through the NVT course, the individual's specific vision deficits are carefully&#xD;
      identified through a five-step program. Personal data is used to organize individual training&#xD;
      and thereby teaching the individual to cope with situations that cause problems in everyday&#xD;
      life. In spite of reported positive results of NVT training among several individuals, there&#xD;
      are currently few and insufficient scientific studies on whether rehabilitation with NVT&#xD;
      results in lasting and clinically significant improvements in people with severe and chronic&#xD;
      visual field impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test whether rehabilitation with NVT can lead to significant&#xD;
      and lasting improvements in persons with chronic visual impairments after brain injury.&#xD;
      Improving eyesight is expected to increase both physical and mental functioning, thus&#xD;
      improving the quality of life. Study participants will be investigated in terms of both&#xD;
      visual and mental functions, including quality of life, cognition and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a controlled prospective study in which the same subject is&#xD;
      examined before and after the intervention. These are subjects with chronic visual field&#xD;
      impairments, who will not experience significant spontaneous remission or deterioration.&#xD;
      These subjects have typically experienced a stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury. There is a high risk of injury worsening in persons with malignant or&#xD;
      progressive tumors, making it difficult or impossible to document a beneficial effect of the&#xD;
      intervention; People with such progressive diseases will be excluded from participation in&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: NVT and Mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term O &amp; M is understood as the ability to move safely in physical space and in the&#xD;
      surrounding community. By controlling orientation and mobility techniques, a person with a&#xD;
      restricted field of vision can be able to move not only safely, but also freely and&#xD;
      independently. The Neuro Vision Technology method uses a special device in the form of light&#xD;
      panels and neurological vision tests that give an overview of cognitive difficulties. This&#xD;
      light panel is connected to a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Static scanning is investigated using the special light panel with 24 light bulbs divided&#xD;
      into two rows, the panel length corresponding to the 180 degrees that normal and&#xD;
      well-functioning human eyes can see. Where it is considered relevant, the study participants&#xD;
      are referred to the ophthalmologist, specialist optician, or a reading / visual clinic to&#xD;
      ensure participants the optimal starting point for using his or her vision. Records are&#xD;
      obtained in which the test results are stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the intervention, cognitive tests are performed as well as a standardized&#xD;
      route training (mobility route training) that the subject must be able to perform&#xD;
      independently. On the route there are a number of targets (stars) that study participants&#xD;
      should try to locate. Investigators measure the time spent by study participants on the&#xD;
      route, as well as the number of targets ignored by any participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants are then placed at the light panel, where the scan pattern is automated&#xD;
      and gradually transferred to indoor mobility routes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the procedures are automated, the exercise is done outdoors using progressively&#xD;
      increasing complexity. Training also Involves the use of public transport and exercises in&#xD;
      order to safely move in the traffic. A NVT course includes 3 hours of cognitive (baseline)&#xD;
      testing, then a total of 22 hours of teaching given twice a week for 2½ to 3 months. A&#xD;
      re-test of 3 hours duration is performed 6 weeks after the NVT course has been finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized to intervention or control groups. As far as possible, it is&#xD;
      ensured that the investigator who measures the subjects' functional level at the end of&#xD;
      intervention has not previously had contact with, or knowledge of, the particular&#xD;
      participant. Thus, the levels of function of the participants is evaluated by different&#xD;
      persons before and after intervention to ensure impartial assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suitable subjects are consecutively included from the Institute for Blind and Partially&#xD;
      Sighted (IBOS), Herlev University Hospital, especially Neurological Department, and other&#xD;
      neurological departments. A screening will be performed to assess the suitability of a person&#xD;
      to participate in the trial. Attendance is voluntary and all sessions are free for the&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the ability to perform the mobility route test with the lowest&#xD;
      possible number of errors. After trial start, 40% of the correct targets are expected to rise&#xD;
      to 65% at the end of the trial. As a basis for power calculation, α = 0.05 and β = 0.5 are&#xD;
      used. Sample size is calculated to 22 participants in each group. Due to age, difficulty in&#xD;
      transport and the time-consuming intervention, up to 25% dropouts are expected, thus we aim&#xD;
      to include 56 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 56 people with permanent visual impairment after brain damage corresponding to&#xD;
      hemianopia, quadrant hemianopia or scotoma resulting in functional impairment at activity or&#xD;
      participation level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and databases are prepared for registration and data processing. Data at&#xD;
      baseline include: Age, living single / cohabitant at home, in-home care services, mobility&#xD;
      aids, social network, height, weight, smoking, alcohol consumption etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the limited group sizes, data can not be assumed to be normally distributed and&#xD;
      non-parametric statistics will be used. Mann-Whitney's test will be used for comparing two&#xD;
      individual groups (unpaired observations), while Spearman's rankorder correlation test will&#xD;
      be used for ranked pairs. Fisher's exact probability test will be used for categorical data&#xD;
      comparisons resulting from classifying data in two different ways. Group-specific test score&#xD;
      changes at baseline and after the NVT intervention will be evaluated using Wilcoxon's&#xD;
      signed-rank test for paired observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of data is acceptable as long as an assessment of the primary endpoint is still&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from participants that make it possible to assess the primary endpoint will be used as a&#xD;
      minimum; However, we hope that data from all subjects can be used to evaluate secondary&#xD;
      effect targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, has been assessed by the&#xD;
      Scientific Ethics Committee, Protocol No.: H-17001534 and can be initiated. The law of&#xD;
      protecting personal data will be uphold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no invasive treatments, and no adverse events or risks are expected in the trial.&#xD;
      Regardless of the reason, any subject may at any time cease to participate in the trial.&#xD;
