  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The paradigm of pre-operative exercise as a neoadjuvant therapy to reduce morbidity is&#xD;
      increasingly promoted within general surgery and surgical oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with lung cancer participating in pre-operative exercise have better aerobic&#xD;
      capacity and pulmonary function and shorter hospital length-of-stay after surgery.&#xD;
      Additionally, pre-operative exercise may increase the likelihood of resuming exercise&#xD;
      post-surgery, thereby accelerating the pace of rehabilitation and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to translate the research findings into sustainable clinical practice,&#xD;
      clinician-scientists need to develop pragmatic and effective home-based exercise protocols.&#xD;
      Wearable fitness devices offer a way to approximate the supervision that occurs in exercise&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the investigators can develop an intervention in which patients receive tailored&#xD;
      support similar to what occurs with supervised exercise, they need to pilot test the&#xD;
      monitoring aspect of the wearable fitness device in conjunction with the pre-operative&#xD;
      exercise program. The investigators propose a mixed methods, 16 single arm feasibility study&#xD;
      of an unsupervised, pre-operative exercise prescription (uPEP) augmented by a wearable&#xD;
      fitness device. The proposed study of 30 patients scheduled for lung cancer surgery will&#xD;
      identify the strengths, weaknesses, and utility of this approach.&#xD;

      The investigators propose a parallel mixed methods, 16 single arm, pre-post study with 30&#xD;
      participants scheduled for lung cancer surgery. At time of enrollment (at least 3 weeks&#xD;
      before their scheduled surgery), participants will complete baseline assessments, receive the&#xD;
      uPEP exercise prescription, and be oriented to the wearable fitness device. A research&#xD;
      assistant will call the participant to conduct an audiotaped semi-structured interview&#xD;
      regarding the acceptability of the electronically-monitored uPEP within 7- 14 days of&#xD;
      enrollment. The study team will complete follow-up assessments on the day of surgery, two&#xD;
      weeks after surgery, and four months after surgery. Data will also be collected from chart&#xD;
      review and the wearable fitness device throughout the study.&#xD;

                  willingness to use a study-provided iPod to allow the data to be uploaded to the&#xD;
                  study team);&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Are able to provide voluntary, written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be excluded based on electronic health record (EHR) review (after&#xD;
             obtaining HIPAA waiver) if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have a life expectancy of &lt; 12 months or are receiving hospice services;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Have a psychiatric diagnosis that would require significant study modification to&#xD;
                  meet their needs such as uncontrolled severe mental illness, substance abuse, or&#xD;
