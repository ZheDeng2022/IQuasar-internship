  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib study to look at the combination of an antibody immunization vaccine&#xD;
      strategy using oregovomab and an investigational stage immune booster (poly ICLC / Hiltonol),&#xD;
      both of which have previously been used in combination with other cancer treatments and&#xD;
      demonstrated to be active in advanced cancer, but which have not previously been used&#xD;
      together. This study will assess the approach as to whether these two drugs can safely add to&#xD;
      the response seen with either drug alone, both of which have doses that are based on prior&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with stable disease for whom a 12 week break from therapy for their persistent and&#xD;
      progressive advanced ovarian cancer is appropriate, who have signed informed consent and for&#xD;
      whom baseline clinical information is completed, will receive 4 cycles of oregovomab/Hiltonol&#xD;
      immunization every three weeks (weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9). Blood will be obtained for to look for&#xD;
      a CA125 specific T cell response at 12 weeks before initiating any additional therapy&#xD;
      according to the best clinical judgment of the investigator. At week 16 the subjects will&#xD;
      receive a final dose of the combination of oregovomab/Hiltonol and at week 17 will have an&#xD;
      additional blood draw for analysis of T-cell response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib evaluation of the combination of an antibody immunization vaccine strategy&#xD;
      using oregovomab and an investigational stage immune adjuvant (poly ICLC / Hiltonol), both of&#xD;
      which have previously been used in combination with other cancer treatments and demonstrated&#xD;
      to be bioactive in advanced cancer, but which have not previously been combined together. The&#xD;
      doses selected for each agent have been selected previously through human clinical study for&#xD;
      use in immunization protocols as a well-tolerated and bioactive immune stimulatory dose. For&#xD;
      immunization purposes a maximum tolerated dose is not a relevant pharmacologic objective.&#xD;
      Rather this is an exercise in efficiently assessing a preliminary immunization protocol as a&#xD;
      cost effective product development strategy assessing the ability of the combination to&#xD;
      safely augment the immune signals measurable with either agent alone, both of which have been&#xD;
      titrated to the current dose based on the principle of bell shaped dose response in&#xD;
      immunization in prior studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with stable disease for whom a 12 week break from cytotoxic therapy for their&#xD;
      persistent and progressive advanced ovarian cancer is appropriate, who have signed informed&#xD;
      consent and for whom baseline clinical information including laboratory, radiologic and&#xD;
      physical documentation of their status is completed, will receive 4 cycles of&#xD;
      oregovomab/Hiltonol immunization every three weeks (weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9). Blood will be&#xD;
      obtained for the measurement of CA125 specific T cell immunity at 12 weeks before initiating&#xD;
      continuing salvage therapy according to the best clinical judgment of the investigator. At&#xD;
      week 16 the subjects will receive a final immunization with oregovomab/Hiltonol and at week&#xD;
      17 an additional blood draw for analysis of T-cell immunity.&#xD;
