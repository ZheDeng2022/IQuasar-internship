      To evaluate the safety, advantages, and appropriateness of performing transarterial hepatic&#xD;
      emobolization of liver cancer via arterial access from the radial artery versus conventional&#xD;
      transfemoral arterial access. The procedures that will be followed utilizing arterial access&#xD;
      include transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), specifically performed for hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma, and transarterial embolization (TAE) which is performed for types of liver tumors&#xD;
      such as carcinoid tumors or liver metastases.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The use of transradial (TR) access for the purpose of diagnosis and intervention in the&#xD;
      arterial system is a well-established concept, particularly in coronary angiography, with&#xD;
      many distinct advantages over conventional transfemoral (TF) access. The first series of 100&#xD;
      coronary angiographic procedures performed via TR access, published by Campeau in 19891,&#xD;
      demonstrated 88% technical success rate and a 6% asymptomatic radial artery occlusion rate.&#xD;
      Further experience and data accumulated with the first TR angioplasty procedure in 1992 and&#xD;
      the first TR coronary stent placement in 1993. TR access for coronary artery interventions in&#xD;
      the United States has grown exponentially over the past few years with the proportion of&#xD;
      transradial percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) procedures increasing from 1.2% in the&#xD;
      first quarter of 2007 to 16.1% in the third quarter of 20122. And yet, its usage is largely&#xD;
      absent in the interventional radiology and vascular surgery communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for this include a lack of appropriate training and equipment, but the potential&#xD;
      advantages of TR over TF access are abundant in both coronary and non-coronary applications.&#xD;
      Firstly, the radial artery is more superficial than the femoral artery without surrounding&#xD;
      neurovascular structures susceptible to injury. In addition, any sustained arterial damage is&#xD;
      significantly less detrimental because of the hand's dual arterial vascular supply. In&#xD;
      addition, the radial artery is readily compressible regardless of the patient's body habitus.&#xD;
      This compressibility has been shown to decrease the incidence of post-procedural bleeding&#xD;
      complications as well as cardiac mortality during PCI3,4,5. In addition to patient safety,&#xD;
      there are numerous benefits to overall patient comfort and convenience. For one, after TR&#xD;
      access, patients may sit up in bed and ambulate immediately with faster discharge to home. In&#xD;
      one randomized trial, Cooper et al demonstrated a strong patient preference, improved&#xD;
      quality-of-life metrics, and decreased hospital costs for TR over TF access during cardiac&#xD;
      catherization6. These benefits have yet to be empirically demonstrated for non-coronary&#xD;
      applications like transarterial hepatic embolization. Even so, these potential benefits are&#xD;
      of even greater importance in the patient population undergoing chemoembolization/bland&#xD;
      embolization given the chemo/bland embolization's association with nausea and emesis post&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, complications with TR approach have proven rare in both coronary and noncoronary&#xD;
      applications. Most commonly, a local small hematoma may develop with mild pain, usually&#xD;
      treated with NSAIDS if necessary. Despite meticulous hemostatic technique, radial artery&#xD;
      thrombosis may occur. Nevertheless, this thrombosis almost always remains asymptomatic7, at&#xD;
      least partially because a modified Allen's test is performed before all procedures using TR&#xD;
      access. The Allen's test is a clincal examination technique that determines the presence of&#xD;
      dual arterial supply to the hand and palmar arch patency in the event of radial artery&#xD;
      occlusion. Additional possible complications of TR access include radial artery&#xD;
      pseudoaneurysm, spasm, dissection, digit ischemia, as well as cerebral infarction, but all of&#xD;
      the following have proven to be extremely low incidence particularly with the usage of&#xD;
      intraprocedural heparinization and vasodilators, which are included in our procedure&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally and increasing more importantly in the modern era of health care reform, TR access&#xD;
      offers many benefits to hospital costs and patient satisfaction. Many studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated decreased costs associated with TR versus traditional TF access5,8,9, primarily&#xD;
      due to the nonutilization of arterial closure devices and decreased readmission for bleeding&#xD;
      complications. International studies have long promoted TR access as a feasible, safe, and&#xD;
      well tolerated method for performing hepatic transarterial chemoembolization10,11. In a&#xD;
      recent series performed in the United States, technical success was obtained in all&#xD;
      procedures. Furthermore, 100% of patients who underwent both TF and TR access preferred TR&#xD;
      over TF access12. Our study seeks to further establish TR arterial access as a viable and&#xD;
      typically preferable method for performing hepatic transarterial embolization as well as&#xD;
      refine patient suitability criteria for TR access.&#xD;
