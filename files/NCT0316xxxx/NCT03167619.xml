  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, international, multicenter, Phase II study designed to explore the&#xD;
      efficacy of olaparib or olaparib in combination with durvalumab in platinum-treated mTNBC.&#xD;
      The primary objectives are to explore olaparib or olaparib in combination with durvalumab as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy following clinical benefit with platinum-based therapy in subjects with&#xD;
      mTNBC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects suitable for enrollment into this trial are adult subjects with histologically&#xD;
      documented triple negative adenocarcinoma of the breast that is inoperable, locally advanced,&#xD;
      or metastatic, and is not amenable to resection with curative intent, and who have received&#xD;
      at least 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy in the 1st or 2nd line setting AND derived&#xD;
      clinical benefit (CR / PR / SD) per RECIST 1.1 with platinum-based therapy as determined by&#xD;
      the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to either olaparib or olaparib in combination with&#xD;
      durvalumab. Study treatment will continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity,&#xD;
      elective withdrawal from the study, or study completion or termination. Upon treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation, subjects will be followed every 2 months for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although randomization will be used to allocate subjects to either the olaparib or olaparib&#xD;
      in combination with durvalumab arm, no comparisons between treatment regimens are planned.&#xD;
      The purpose of randomization was to reduce bias due to subject selection into either&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
