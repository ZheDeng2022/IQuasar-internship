      This Phase 1b study examines the safety and efficacy of parenterally-administered lanicemine&#xD;
      in a parallel-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients&#xD;
      (N=24) with significant PTSD symptoms and elevated anxiety potentiated startle (APS).&#xD;
      Investigator hypothesize that lanicemine (100 mg) displays a normalization of APS following&#xD;
      three infusions over 5 non-consecutive days. If target engagement is demonstrated and the&#xD;
      drug is safe and tolerable in this patient population, investigator will proceed to a larger&#xD;
      POC study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide a rigorous test of functional target engagement and &quot;go/no go&quot;&#xD;
      milestones for a subsequent POC trial. Investigator will conduct a parallel-arm, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess lanicemine (100 mg) with respect to a&#xD;
      functional pharmacodynamic readout of target engagement (APS). Twenty-four patients with&#xD;
      significant PTSD symptoms and elevated APS will be randomized to one of 2 treatment groups&#xD;
      [placebo or 100 mg], and undergo three 60 min parenteral infusions over a 5 day period. APS&#xD;
      and other neurophysiological biomarkers will be tested before and after the 1st and 3rd&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective is to examine, relative to placebo, whether lanicemine will demonstrate&#xD;
      normalization of the APS response following three treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives are to examine, relative to placebo, whether lanicemine will demonstrate&#xD;
      effects on P50 auditory evoked potentials, gamma band EEG, and Mismatch Negativity.&#xD;
      Investigator also explore whether target engagement will mediate the effect of treatment on&#xD;
      CAPS-5 scores.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must provide acceptable proof of identity documentation to confirm initials&#xD;
             and date of birth&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male and female patients aged 21 to 65 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All male patients who are sexually active must agree to use a double barrier method of&#xD;
             contraception (condom with spermicide) from the first dose of IP until 12 weeks after&#xD;
             their last dose. All females must have a negative serum pregnancy test. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential (WOCBP, see below) must use a highly effective form of birth&#xD;
             control plus the use of a condom by the male sexual partner, reviewed and approved by&#xD;
             the PI. The highly effective form of birth control includes: true sexual abstinence, a&#xD;
             vasectomized sexual partner, Implanon, female sterilization by tubal occlusion, any&#xD;
             effective IUD/IUS, Depo-Provera injections, oral contraceptive, and Evra Patch or&#xD;
             Nuvaring. Women should be on a stable method of birth control for a minimum of 3&#xD;
             months , prior to randomization and 3 months after the last dose of IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women of non-childbearing potential. Women of non-childbearing potential are defined&#xD;
             as women who are either permanently sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,&#xD;
             or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered&#xD;
             postmenopausal if they are amenorrheic for 12 months prior to randomization without an&#xD;
             alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women &lt; 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic&#xD;
             for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women ≥ 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic&#xD;
             for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. CAPS-5 score ≥ 25 and CGI-S ≥ 4 at Screening and Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Anxiety Potentiated Startle T-score ≥ 2.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Psychotropic medications must remain at a stable dose for at least 42 days prior to&#xD;
             screening, without clinically significant adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Be able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, as judged by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are currently participating in another clinical study in which the&#xD;
             patient is exposed to an investigational or non-investigational drug or device, or&#xD;
             have done so within the last 30 days prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have no regular contact with an adult who could come to the patient's aid&#xD;
             should an urgent need arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a history of DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or&#xD;
             schizoaffective disorder, or currently exhibiting psychotic symptoms associated with&#xD;
             depression; dementia or suspicion thereof, is also exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Currently being treated with MAOIs, lithium, divalproex, carbamazepine, barbiturates,&#xD;
             or benzodiazepines. Patients taking medications with known activity at the NMDA or&#xD;
             AMPA glutamate receptor [eg, riluzole, amantadine, lamotrigine, memantine, topiramate,&#xD;
             dextromethorphan, D-cycloserine], or the mu-opioid receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who meet DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorder (amphetamines, cocaine,&#xD;
             hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives/hypnotics/anxiolytics) within 1 month&#xD;
             prior to screening. Patients with a positive urine drug screen (UDS) are excluded&#xD;
             except for patients testing positive for prescribed medications that are otherwise&#xD;
             permitted and there is no evidence of misuse or abuse. Patients can be re-tested only&#xD;
             if either the initial opiate or barbiturate result is positive and they have a&#xD;
             prescription, but the patient should be excluded if the result is still positive at&#xD;
             the second test. Patients with positive UDS for drug(s) legally available by&#xD;
             prescription must provide evidence of prescription for the drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a binge-pattern of alcohol use which makes them at risk for&#xD;
             withdrawal-related seizures. Also, significant alcohol withdrawal symptoms that&#xD;
             require medical detoxification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a suicide attempt within the last 3 months or at imminent risk of&#xD;
             suicide and not suitable for an outpatient study, in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Clinically significant laboratory value, physical examination, or ECG that signifies a&#xD;
             major medical illness that is unstable or inadequately controlled, or that may put the&#xD;
             subject at risk during the study in the judgment of the investigator. Hypothyroidism&#xD;
             is permitted if corrected and the patient is on a stable treatment regimen for a&#xD;
             minimum of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Systolic BP &lt; 85 or &gt; 160 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg or heart rate &lt; 50 or &gt;105&#xD;
             beats per minute at Screening or Randomization. Exclusionary values may be repeated&#xD;
             once.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. QTcF (Fridericia-corrected) ≥ 450 msec at Screening or Randomization. Exclusionary&#xD;
             values may be repeated once.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with any history of seizure disorder (except for febrile seizures in&#xD;
             childhood) or traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Previous exposure to lanicemine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with a personality disorder which in the opinion of the investigator has a&#xD;
             major impact on the patient's current psychiatric status and would preclude safe study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m2&#xD;
