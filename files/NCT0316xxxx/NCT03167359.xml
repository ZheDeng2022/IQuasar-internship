  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the number of breast cancer (BrCA) survivors has markedly increased, clinicians are now&#xD;
      seeking to reduce treatment-related toxicities and inconveniences of treatment, namely the&#xD;
      traditional 6 weeks of daily radiation treatment (XRT). Skin thickening, fibrosis, and edema&#xD;
      are some of the most common acute and potentially long-term debilitating toxicities of BrCA&#xD;
      XRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn if three weeks of daily radiation treatment (RT) to the&#xD;
      breast is safe in breast cancer patients who are usually prescribed 6 weeks of daily&#xD;
      radiation after breast surgery (e.g. lumpectomy or mastectomy) as standard of care.&#xD;

      Investigators seek to assess the rate of cutaneous toxicity, the rates of lymphedema&#xD;
      determined by arm measurements and Grade 3 brachial plexopathy in patients receiving regional&#xD;
      nodal irradiation, as well as local control, quality of life, and fatigue levels.&#xD;

Grade 2: Intense or widespread; intermittent; skin changes from scratching (e.g., edema, papulation, excoriations, lichenification, oozing/crusts); limiting instrumental ADLs.

        <description>The GLTEQ is a self-reported questionnaire used to measure usual leisure-time exercise habits during a typical seven day period. The GLTEQ specifically inquires about frequency of mild, moderate, and strenuous physical activity done during a typical 7-day period with exercise of more than 15 min or more per day during the previous week.&#xD;
Total score for the Godin leisure-time exercise questionnaire is calculated using this formula.Weekly leisure activity score = (9 × Strenuous) + (5 × Moderate) + (3 × Light).&#xD;
The GLTEQ total score can be broken into three categories:&#xD;
less than 14 points = sedentary 14 - 23 points is = moderately active 24 points or more = active The score ranges from 0 to 119.</description>
