    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-center, open-label trial of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma as second-line treatment after failure of sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 60 subjects will be enrollment to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will begin with all subjects without regard for PD-L1 expression status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluable specimen for PD-L1 status must be available and confirmed prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects will be evaluated every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) following the date of IP drug&#xD;
      adminstration for the first 12 months and every 12 weeks (+/- 7 days) thereafter until&#xD;
      progression of disease is documented with radiologic imaging (computed tomography or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR (objective response rate) per RECIST 1.1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will participate in the trial from the time the subject signs the Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form (ICF) through the final contact. After a screening phase of up to 28 days,&#xD;
      eligible subjects will receive treatment beginning on Day 1 of each 3week dosing cycle for&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with pembrolizumab will continue until documented disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      adverse event(s),intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,&#xD;
      investigators' decision to withdraw the subject, subject withdraws consent, pregnancy of the&#xD;
      subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, subject receives 24&#xD;
      months of pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment. After&#xD;
      the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring&#xD;
      (serious adverse events and events of clinical interest will be collected for 90 days after&#xD;
      the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject initiates new&#xD;
      anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who discontinue after 24months of therapy for reasons other than disease progression&#xD;
      or intolerability or who discontinue after attaining a CR may be eligible for up to one year&#xD;
      of retreatment after they have experienced radiographic disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression will have post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up for disease status until disease progression, initiating a non-study cancer&#xD;
      treatment, withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will be followed&#xD;
      by telephone for overall survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial. The&#xD;
             subject may also provide consent for Biomedical Research. However, the subject may&#xD;
             participate in the main trial without participating in Biomedical Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of HCC (fibrolamellar and&#xD;
             mixed hepatocellular/cholangiocarcinoma subtypes are not eligible) based on pathology&#xD;
             report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage C disease, or BCLC Stage B disease not&#xD;
             amenable to locoregional therapy or refractory to locoregional therapy, and not&#xD;
             amenable to a curative treatment approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a Child-Pugh class A liver score&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has experienced documented objective radiographic or clinical disease progression&#xD;
             during first-line sorafenib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have measurable disease based on RECIST1.1 as determined by investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be willing to provide fresh tissue for biomarker analysis, and, based on the adequacy&#xD;
             of the tissue sample quality for assessment of biomarker status. Repeat samples may be&#xD;
             required if adequate tissue is not provided. Newly obtained endoscopic biopsy&#xD;
             specimens are preferred to archived samples and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded&#xD;
             (FFPE) block specimens are preferred to slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study&#xD;
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational&#xD;
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has received sorafenib within 14 days of first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has had esophageal or gastric variceal bleeding within the last 6 months. All subjects&#xD;
             will be screened for esophageal varices, unless such screening has been performed in&#xD;
             the past 12 months before first dose of treatment. If varices are present, they should&#xD;
             be treated according to institutional standards before starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Had a solid organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has received locoregional therapy to liver (transcatheter chemoembolization [TACE],&#xD;
             transcatheter embolization [TAE], radiation, radioembolization, or ablation) or major&#xD;
             surgery to liver or other site within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Minor surgery (e.g., simple excision, tooth extraction) must have occurred at least 7&#xD;
             days prior to the first dose of study treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1).&#xD;
