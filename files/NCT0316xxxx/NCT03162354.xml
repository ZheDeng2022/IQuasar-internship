  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To increase the accuracy of doctors' decisions to launch or forgo child abuse evaluations in&#xD;
      their young, acutely head-injured patients, investigators have derived and validated a&#xD;
      clinical decision rule (CDR) that detects abusive head trauma (AHT) with 96% sensitivity in&#xD;
      pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) settings. This &quot;CDR Implementation Trial&quot; across eight&#xD;
      PICU sites will assess the CDR's actual impact on AHT screening accuracy, identify factors&#xD;
      associated with maximal physician acceptance and application of this novel AHT screening&#xD;
      tool, and assess the sustainability of active CDR implementation strategies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators' long-term goal is to increase the accuracy of doctors' decisions to launch or&#xD;
      forgo child abuse evaluations in their young, acutely head-injured patients. To this end,&#xD;
      PediBIRN investigators have derived and validated a 4-variable clinical decision rule (CDR)&#xD;
      that detects abusive head trauma (AHT) with 96% sensitivity in PICU settings. Applied at PICU&#xD;
      admission, the CDR categorizes young, acutely head-injured patients as higher risk vs. lower&#xD;
      risk, and recommends thorough abuse evaluations for all higher risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;CDR Implementation Trial&quot; across eight PICUs will assess the CDR's actual impact on AHT&#xD;
      screening accuracy. The stratified cluster randomized trial design will facilitate direct&#xD;
      comparison of child abuse evaluations at four, randomly selected, control sites to four&#xD;
      matched intervention sites, where investigators will deploy active, multifaceted,&#xD;
      implementation strategies designed to promote CDR acceptability and application. These&#xD;
      strategies will include physician training with onsite visits, monthly &quot;booster training&#xD;
      emails,&quot; access to an &quot;AHT probability calculator,&quot; audit and site-specific feedback, and&#xD;
      local &quot;information sharing sessions&quot; designed to address local barriers to CDR acceptance and&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PediBIRN investigators will conduct the CDR Implementation Trial with three Specific Aims.&#xD;
      Aim 1 is to assess the CDR's actual impact on AHT screening accuracy. Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that deployment of CDR implementation strategies at the four intervention sites&#xD;
      will be associated with higher percentages of higher risk patients evaluated thoroughly for&#xD;
      abuse, and lower percentages of lower risk patients evaluated (even partially) for abuse. Aim&#xD;
      2 is to identify factors that impact CDR application in PICU settings. Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that PICUs with higher patient volumes, providers with child abuse expertise, and&#xD;
      providers with more intense exposure to CDR implementation strategies will be predictive of&#xD;
      higher percentages of higher risk patients thoroughly evaluated for abuse, whereas patients&#xD;
      of minority race or ethnicity will be predictive of higher percentages of lower risk patients&#xD;
      evaluated for abuse. Investigators' third Exploratory Aim is to measure the sustained impacts&#xD;
      of CDR implementation strategies. Investigators hypothesize that CDR utilization at&#xD;
      intervention sites will be sustained twelve months after CDR implementation strategies have&#xD;
      been discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on strong Preliminary Studies, investigators predict that CDR adoption as an AHT&#xD;
      screening tool will increase AHT detection; reduce overall abuse evaluations and their&#xD;
      associated risks; reduce unwarranted variation in current AHT screening practices; minimize&#xD;
      the adverse impacts of doctors' inherent biases, uncertainty, and practice disparities;&#xD;
      reduce AHT-associated acute health care costs in PICU settings; and save the lives of&#xD;
      children who will be reinjured and killed if their AHT is missed or unrecognized.&#xD;

    <measure>The Number of Higher Risk Patients Evaluated Thoroughly for Abuse at Intervention vs. Control Sites</measure>
    <time_frame>To be measured 32 months after the start of the clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure facilitates a comparison of the percentage of patients that the clinical decision rule stratified as higher risk who were evaluated thoroughly for abuse (with both skeletal survey and retinal exam) at intervention vs. control sites. We hypothesized that thorough evaluations of higher risk patients would be significantly higher at intervention sites.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>The Number of Lower Risk Patients Evaluated Even Partially for Abuse at Intervention vs. Control Sites</measure>
    <time_frame>To be measured 32 months after the start of the clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure facilitates a comparison of the percentage of patients that the clinical decision rule stratified as lower risk who were nevertheless evaluated at least partially for abuse (with skeletal survey and/or retinal examination) at intervention vs. control sites. We hypothesized that (partial or complete) abuse evaluations of lower risk patients would be significantly lower at intervention sites.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated Rates (Percentages) of Missed AHT at Intervention vs. Control Sites</measure>
    <time_frame>To be measured 32 months after the start of the clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measures and compares estimated rates (percentages) of missed AHT (among all patients with AHT) at intervention vs. control sites. Using secondary outcome measures, it was calculated as [estimated cases of missed AHT] / [estimated cases of missed AHT + patients with corroborating findings of abuse]. We hypothesized that the estimated rate of missed AHT would be significantly lower at intervention sites. This outcome measure is best interpreted in the following contexts: (1) Applied accurately and consistently, the clinical decision rule's potential sensitivity for AHT is 96% (see references). That is, it should &quot;miss&quot; (categorize as lower risk) only 4% of AHT patients, and (2) We estimate that intervention and control site physicians &quot;missed&quot; 15% and 11% of their AHT patients, respectively, in prior PediBIRN studies (see the Post-Hoc Outcome &quot;The Estimated Rate of Missed AHT at Intervention vs. Control Sites in Prior PediBIRN Studies&quot;).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Patients Evaluated at Least Partially for Abuse at Intervention vs. Control Sites</measure>
    <time_frame>To be measured 32 months after the start of the clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure facilitates a comparison of the percentage of patients evaluated at least partially for abuse (with skeletal survey and/or retinal examination) at intervention vs. control sites. Thus, it facilitates a broad-based comparison of AHT evaluation practices at intervention vs. control sites.</description>

    <measure>The Number of Patients With Corroborating Findings of Abuse at Intervention vs. Control Sites (Aka Overall Diagnostic Yield)</measure>
    <time_frame>To be measured 32 months after the start of the clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure facilitates a comparison of the percentage of patients whose completed skeletal surveys and/or retinal exams revealed findings considered moderately or highly specific for abuse at intervention vs. control sites. Thus, it is also a measure of the overall diagnostic yield of patients' completed skeletal surveys and retinal examinations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Estimated Patients With Missed AHT at Intervention vs. Control Sites</measure>
    <time_frame>To be measured 32 months after the start of the clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure facilitates a comparison of the estimated percentage of patients with missed AHT (among potential cases of missed AHT) at intervention vs. control sites. It was calculated as [potential cases of missed AHT] x [their mean estimate of abuse probability]. The patient-specific estimates of abuse probability used to calculate the mean estimates were accessed by applying the 4-variable rule as a clinical prediction tool (rather than a directive decision rule).</description>

    <measure>Estimated Prevalence of AHT at Intervention vs. Control Sites</measure>
    <time_frame>To be measured 32 months after the start of the clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure facilitates a comparison of the estimated prevalence of AHT (among all eligible patients) at intervention vs. control sites. It was calculated as [patients with corroborating findings of abuse + estimated cases of missed AHT] / [all eligible patients in each arm of the trial].</description>

    <description>This outcome measure facilitates a comparison of the percentage of higher risk patients evaluated thoroughly for abuse (with skeletal survey AND retinal examination) at intervention sites in prior strictly observational PediBIRN studies vs. the current cluster randomized trial.

    <time_frame>To be measured 32 months after the start of the clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure facilitates estimation of the clinical decision rule's potential AHT screening sensitivity IF it had been applied accurately and consistently across all eight participating sites. It was calculated based on the following assumptions: (1) All higher risk patients were evaluated thoroughly for abuse with skeletal survey AND retinal exam by an ophthalmologist; Therefore, all cases of AHT among higher risk patients were recognized, and (2) Abuse evaluations were deferred in all lower risk patients; Therefore, all cases of AHT among lower risk patients were missed or unrecognized.</description>

          <description>To reduce cases of missed or unrecognized abusive head trauma (AHT), Pediatric Brain Injury Research Network (PediBIRN) investigators derived and validated an AHT screening tool. The screening tool comes in the form of a directive, 4-variable, clinical decision rule (CDR). The &quot;PediBIRN-4&quot; CDR stratifies patients as &quot;higher risk&quot; vs. &quot;lower risk&quot; and recommends that every higher risk patient be thoroughly evaluated for abuse. Higher risk patients were those who presented for intensive care with any one or more of the CDR's four predictor variables.</description>

        <title>Estimated Rates (Percentages) of Missed AHT at Intervention vs. Control Sites</title>
        <description>This outcome measures and compares estimated rates (percentages) of missed AHT (among all patients with AHT) at intervention vs. control sites. Using secondary outcome measures, it was calculated as [estimated cases of missed AHT] / [estimated cases of missed AHT + patients with corroborating findings of abuse]. We hypothesized that the estimated rate of missed AHT would be significantly lower at intervention sites. This outcome measure is best interpreted in the following contexts: (1) Applied accurately and consistently, the clinical decision rule's potential sensitivity for AHT is 96% (see references). That is, it should &quot;miss&quot; (categorize as lower risk) only 4% of AHT patients, and (2) We estimate that intervention and control site physicians &quot;missed&quot; 15% and 11% of their AHT patients, respectively, in prior PediBIRN studies (see the Post-Hoc Outcome &quot;The Estimated Rate of Missed AHT at Intervention vs. Control Sites in Prior PediBIRN Studies&quot;).</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>CDR implementation supports may not have been delivered uniformly. We relied on imperfect patient-specific estimates of AHT probability to predict the results of abuse evaluations never completed. We failed to capture prospective data that might explain absent or incomplete abuse evaluations (e.g., early death). The trial was likely underpowered. Our results are not generalizable to non-PICU settings, to PICUs in non-academic centers, or to PICUs lacking access to CAP physicians.</limitations_and_caveats>
