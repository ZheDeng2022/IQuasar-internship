      Background: Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in Singapore, and studies&#xD;
      have found that intensive specialized stroke rehabilitation can improve post-stroke&#xD;
      functional outcomes for a substantial proportion of stroke patients. However, despite the&#xD;
      benefits associated with adherence to prescribed rehabilitation, the uptake rate of&#xD;
      outpatient rehabilitation services (ORS) in Singapore is only 33%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to local longitudinal studies, the financial burden of out-of-pocket service costs&#xD;
      and the inconvenient transportation from home to rehabilitation centres are important&#xD;
      barriers to access to ORS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To examine the effect and cost-effectiveness of providing incentives for ORS to&#xD;
      improve the uptake of ORS compared to usual care (control) with no incentives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: An evidence-based program to test the effectiveness of providing incentives to&#xD;
      alleviate the financial burden as well as inconvenience of transportation for ORS will&#xD;
      improve the uptake of and adherence to ORS among stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This study is an individual-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 300&#xD;
      stroke patients recruited from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and Changi General Hospital&#xD;
      (CGH). They will be randomized to one of three study arms (education only, free&#xD;
      transportation, and free services and transportation) and interviewed at the time of&#xD;
      recruitment and four months after the enrolment in the study. Participants' health&#xD;
      conditions, socioeconomic situation, health &amp; medical services utilization, stroke-related&#xD;
      disability measures, quality of life, and reasons for uptake/rejection/withdraw from the&#xD;
      services will be collected during both baseline and the 4th month assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: As the first study in Singapore to test innovative ways to increase the stroke&#xD;
      ORS uptake rates, it will provide evidence for future policy changes in financing outpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation and other long-term care services in Singapore. It will also provide important&#xD;
      empirical parameter estimates for Systems Dynamics modelling of the demand and supply of ORS&#xD;
      in Singapore.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in Singapore. Stroke accounts&#xD;
      for 9.1% of years of life lost (YLL) and 6.1% of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). With&#xD;
      a rapidly aging population, the burden of stroke is anticipated to grow correspondingly in&#xD;
      the years to come. Stroke survivors with moderate or severe functional disabilities require&#xD;
      long-term medical and social care, imposing financial and psychological burdens on the&#xD;
      patients and their family members. Research indicates that intensive specialized stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation can improve post-stroke functional outcomes for a substantial portion of&#xD;
      stroke patients. Extant studies also indicate that rehabilitation is cost-effective in both&#xD;
      inpatient and outpatient settings, and can potentially lead to reductions in both sub-acute&#xD;
      and long-term post-stroke healthcare costs. In addition, a longitudinal study on post-stroke&#xD;
      patients in Singapore found that receiving outpatient rehabilitation service at day&#xD;
      rehabilitation centers resulted in earlier functional recovery. However, despite the benefits&#xD;
      associated with adherence to prescribed rehabilitation sessions, the uptake rate of and&#xD;
      adherence to outpatient rehabilitation service in Singapore is low. Only 33% of stroke&#xD;
      survivors who were recommended for post-discharge community-based rehabilitation actually&#xD;
      took up the service. The low uptake rate also implies substantial potential avoidable&#xD;
      disability among stroke patients in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance According to a longitudinal survey on patients who were discharged from&#xD;
      community hospital and recommended for post-discharge outpatient rehabilitation in Singapore,&#xD;
      financial burden of rehabilitation services and the inconveniences of transportation are&#xD;
      associated with the low attendance rates to outpatient rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral economic theory and empirical studies also suggest that the low rate of uptake and&#xD;
      adherence, at least in part, is attributable to stroke patients' perceptions or uncertainty&#xD;
      about the health benefits of rehabilitation. Stroke patients may make a decision to utilize&#xD;
      ORS or not, based on incomplete information about the service attributes (e.g. service&#xD;
      quality, social connectedness, and perceived benefits). Over time, patients and caregivers&#xD;
      may update their perceived service attributes through information and education on stroke&#xD;
      management or actual experiences. Hence, providing incentives to take up ORS and educational&#xD;
      materials on post-stroke management will elevate the current uptake rate of ORS and long-term&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be the first attempt in Singapore to test innovative ways of&#xD;
      encouraging uptake of stroke ORS. It will systematically test promising economic strategies&#xD;
      that might be effective and cost-effective in increasing the uptake of and adherence to the&#xD;
      prescribed ORS. Given the high bed occupancy rate in public acute hospitals in Singapore,&#xD;
      outpatient center-based rehabilitation service could be a more viable option than inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation and more cost-effective in Singapore. It will provide evidence for future&#xD;
      policy change in financing outpatient rehabilitation service and other long-term care&#xD;
      services in Singapore and other countries experiencing similar problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims &amp; Hypothesis Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in Singapore,&#xD;
      and the burden of stroke is posing challenges to the healthcare system and society. Previous&#xD;
      international and regional research studies suggest that a substantial proportion of stroke&#xD;
      patients can benefit from post-stroke rehabilitation services and achieve improved functional&#xD;
      outcomes. However, despite government subsidies and Medisave coverage for outpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation, the uptake rate of outpatient rehabilitation service (ORS) among stroke&#xD;
      patients is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test different interventions&#xD;
      aimed at improving the uptake of and adherence to outpatient rehabilitation services: a&#xD;
      rehabilitation educational program (Group 1, Education), free transportation only (Group 2,&#xD;
      Transportation Incentives) and free transportation and rehabilitation sessions (Group 3,&#xD;
      Transport &amp; Sessions Incentives) for the first 3 months from the date of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine whether incentives for outpatient rehabilitation services (Group 2 and Group 3)&#xD;
           are more effective at improving the uptake of rehabilitation services compared with&#xD;
           education program only (Group 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether stroke patients in Group 3 Transport &amp; Sessions Incentives are more&#xD;
           likely to take up ORS than those in the Group 2 Transport Incentives only;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the effectiveness of interventions (Group 2 and Group 3) on patient health&#xD;
           outcomes; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the interventions (Group 2 and Group 3) at the 4th&#xD;
           month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each recruitment site, the Research Coordinator will assess the patient's eligibility&#xD;
      before approaching them for recruitment. The patient will be given an Abbreviated Mental Test&#xD;
      (AMT) for cognitive assessment. If the patient is cognitively unfit, then his/her&#xD;
      caregiver/proxy will be required to sign the informed consent form on behalf of the patient.&#xD;
      The enrolment period will last for approximately 14-16 months or when the recruitment target&#xD;
      of 300 participants has been achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment: After signing the informed consent form, the Research Coordinator will&#xD;
      proceed with the baseline assessment which consists of participant's socioeconomic&#xD;
      characteristics, health status, health and medical services utilization, financial status,&#xD;
      stroke-related disability measures, quality of life, and self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Coordinator will educate all participants on their conditions and how to recover&#xD;
      after stroke. A pamphlet with information on post-stroke rehabilitation will also be&#xD;
      distributed to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-level Intervention: The intervention phase is for a period of three months&#xD;
      post-discharge. The Study Team at Duke-NUS will be coordinating all the incentivised services&#xD;
      for the participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures and Analysis The primary study outcome is uptake of outpatient rehabilitation&#xD;
      services. Uptake is defined as a patient attending at least one rehabilitation session after&#xD;
      discharge. A key secondary outcome will be adherence, defined as the proportion of times the&#xD;
      participant attended prescribed outpatient rehabilitation sessions during the study period.&#xD;
      Additional secondary outcomes of the study include measures of participants' stroke-related&#xD;
      functional status (Modified Rankin Scale, mRS, and modified Barthel Index for Activities of&#xD;
      Daily Living (ADL) limitation), quality of life (EQ-5D), resilience (CD-RISC 10), and&#xD;
      participants' inpatient and other medical services utilization. The investigators will also&#xD;
      obtain participants' baseline socio-demographic data and health status from electronic&#xD;
      medical records and self-reported questionnaire as control variables. In addition, the&#xD;
      program costs of all incentives provided to those in the interventions arms will be tracked&#xD;
      systematically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct bivariate analyses and employ generalized linear model to&#xD;
      examine the differences among three study arms in the outcomes of interest, as identified&#xD;
      above. For all the health outcome variables such as, functional status, and will employ a&#xD;
      difference-in-differences (DID) design to assess the impact of incentives. This method&#xD;
      controls for secular trends in outcomes by comparing the longitudinal change in the controls&#xD;
      from the concurrent change in cases between the baseline and follow-up period. Specifically,&#xD;
      the covariates for the interaction term in the regression model (i.e. the&#xD;
      difference-in-differences estimates) represent the difference in the changes over time. In&#xD;
      addition, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for interventions will be&#xD;
      calculated by dividing the difference in costs of control arm and that of intervention arms&#xD;
      by the incremental effectiveness of both intervention arms compared with control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation Assuming the uptake rate for control arm is 33% and the detectable&#xD;
      difference for the intervention arm is 10% (that is, the intervention arm that is most&#xD;
      different from control has an uptake rate of 43%), the desired sample size is a total of 300&#xD;
      subjects (100 per arm) to achieve 80% power and to accommodate 10% attrition.&#xD;
