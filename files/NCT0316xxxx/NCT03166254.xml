  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and extensive stage small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (SCLC) are incurable with current therapies, but due to mutations induced by&#xD;
      cigarette smoke, typically express a large number of altered proteins that can be recognized&#xD;
      as foreign by the immune system. This antigenicity is thought to explain the efficacy of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab as either a first or second line treatment in this disease. For patients who&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy plus immunotherapy as a first line therapy, there is sound rationale for&#xD;
      combination treatment with immunotherapy and a therapeutic antitumor vaccine as a maintenance&#xD;
      strategy. Regardless of PD-L1 expression in the tumor, monoclonal antibodies that block&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are effective second line therapies after chemotherapy in both NSCLC&#xD;
      and SCLC. In addition, by targeting the immune system against tumor specific antigens using a&#xD;
      peptide vaccine, the efficacy of pembrolizumab alone is expected to be enhanced, with an&#xD;
      improved response rate and prolonged overall survival with no additional toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will provide a preliminary test of the feasibility of generating a&#xD;
      personalized, tumor neoantigen-specific therapeutic vaccine and the safety of combining it&#xD;
      with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.&#xD;

      Please note that this study originally opened with ID# 201707041 but was withdrawn due to&#xD;
      change in standard of care chemotherapy. This study was revised and submitted as an amendment&#xD;
      to the same IND but our IRB required it to be submitted as a new study and it received a new&#xD;

In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.</description>
