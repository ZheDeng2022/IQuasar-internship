  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a post-market clinical follow-up study. The data collected from this study will&#xD;
      serve the purpose of confirming safety and performance of the ALTERA™ Expandable implant.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation is based on the following elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety as measured by the rate of serious operative and post-operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects quality of life, measured by health-related quality of life questionnaires and&#xD;
           Subject-reported outcome measures up to 24 months following the procedure, as compared&#xD;
           to Subject's preoperative baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Global and segmental lumbar lordosis (LL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed upto 24 months post-operative&#xD;

             stock or quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
