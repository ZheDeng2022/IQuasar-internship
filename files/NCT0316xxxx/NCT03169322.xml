      Studies reveal association between dry conditions and decreased healing in wounds or any&#xD;
      treatment. From these studies, it can be hypothesized that healing in mouth breathers after&#xD;
      scaling and root planing in terms of bleeding on probing, gingival index, plaque Index,&#xD;
      clinical attachment level, probing depth may not show as much improvement as in case of nose&#xD;
      breathers. No study has been conducted till date to find effect of scaling and root planing&#xD;
      in periodontitis patients among mouth breathers and nose breathers.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mouth breathing is perceived to be responsible for persistant marginal gingivitis. The most&#xD;
      common region to be affected by gingivitis in mouth breathers is maxillary anterior region.&#xD;
      Other areas are affected in following decreasing order: maxillary posterior areas, mandibular&#xD;
      anterior region and mandibular posterior region. Various reasons are considered to be&#xD;
      responsible for gingival inflammation in mouth breathers. Possible factors responsible for&#xD;
      gingival inflammation may be continuous loss of saliva over marginal tissues leading to&#xD;
      increased plaque scores or qualitative change in plaque in terms of incorporation of more&#xD;
      virulent strains of bacteria in plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mouth breathing, lip seal, upper lip coverage are related. In one study, mouth breathing&#xD;
      along with incompetent lip seal and decreased upper lip coverage were associated with&#xD;
      gingivitis. In other study plaque was thought to be a contributing factor for gingivitis in&#xD;
      patients with decreased upper lip coverage. One study showed lack of lip seal due to&#xD;
      increased overjet to be responsible for increased gingival inflammation. Kolawole KA et al in&#xD;
      their study found that lip incompetence was associated with increased plaque scores. It may&#xD;
      be due to lack of normal cleansing action of saliva. No association between mouth breathing&#xD;
      and gingivitis prevalence had been reported in the study by Sutcliffe. However mouth&#xD;
      breathing slightly increased severity of gingivitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva performs very important functions including lubrication of oral tissues, antimicrobial&#xD;
      action, regulation of pH, elimination of food bolus and facilitating in removal of carbon.&#xD;
      Salivary flow provides mechanical cleansing of residues present in mouth such as non adherent&#xD;
      bacteria, cellular and food debris. Lack of salivary flushing action results in accumulation&#xD;
      of food debris and dental plaque thus promoting an acidogenic and aciduric oral bacteria&#xD;
      responsible for dental caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xerostomia /dry mouth is responsible for increase in gingival inflammation and also affects&#xD;
      periodontal conditions with increased probing depth, plaque index. In one study, young adults&#xD;
      with self reporting of xerostomia had increased sites with bleeding on probing and increased&#xD;
      plaque scores. Proliferative activity of oral gingival epithelium is decreased in inflamed&#xD;
      gingiva of patients with xerostomia. In one study, healing in gingivectomy wound was delayed&#xD;
      in sialadenectomized rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In habitual mouth-breathers, 50% of the inspired air passes through mouth. In&#xD;
      mouth-breathers, amount of water evaporated from saliva into air may reach 0.24 mL/min&#xD;
      resulting in greater retention of bacteria in oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For transient relief of xerostomia, salivary substitutes and sugar free gums and lozenges are&#xD;
      available. Effect of salivary substitutes along with scaling and root planing in mouth&#xD;
      breathers have been evaluated in one study. It was found that in mouth breathers, scaling and&#xD;
      root planing along with application of salivary substitutes provided better improvement in&#xD;
      gingival index, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level than in whom scaling and root&#xD;
      planing alone was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better response of gingiva was seen in mouth breathers after 4-6 weeks of oral debridement&#xD;
      and use of petroleum jelly. However when use of petroleum jelly was withheld inflammation was&#xD;
      again noticed in gingiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar effects of drying conditions are seen in various parts of body. In children with dry&#xD;
      skin and predisposition to atopic dermatitis, use of emollients was seen to improve their&#xD;
      skin conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these studies reveal association between dry conditions and decreased healing in wounds&#xD;
      or any treatment. From these studies, it can be hypothesized that healing in mouth breathers&#xD;
      after scaling and root planing in terms of bleeding on probing, gingival index, plaque Index,&#xD;
      clinical attachment level, probing depth may not show as much improvement as in case of nose&#xD;
      breathers. No study has been conducted till date to find effect of scaling and root planing&#xD;
      in periodontitis patients among mouth breathers and nose breathers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in Department of Periodontics, Post Graduate Institute of Dental&#xD;
      Sciences(PGIDS), Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION AND DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from chronic periodontitis of age group 20-35 years will be recruited from&#xD;
      regular OPD of the Department of Periodontics in the study. Approximately 60 patients would&#xD;
      comprise test group and control group. Test group (n≈30) will include individuals having&#xD;
      mouth breathing habit. Control group (n≈30) will comprise of patients who are nose breathers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical standards outlined in the 1964&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of mouth breathing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of mouth breathing will be made on the basis of patient history. Patients would be&#xD;
      asked whether, in their opinion, they are mouth breathers, and also whether they have dry&#xD;
      mouth on awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      After carefully explaining the nature and objectives of the study, written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from each patient of study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants belonging to both study groups would receive conventional periodontal treatment,&#xD;
      i.e. scaling and root planing (SRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the participants will undergo full mouth examination in a standardized way using&#xD;
      illumination by a standard dental light, a mouth mirror, explorer and University of North&#xD;
      Carolina -15(UNC-15) periodontal probe and the following parameters will be recorded: plaque&#xD;
      index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), and clinical&#xD;
      attachment level (CAL). Degree of maxillary incisor coverage by upper lip at rest would be&#xD;
      classified into 2 types: total coverage, maxillary labial gingiva exposed. Teeth will be&#xD;
      assessed at four sites for PI and GI, and at six sites for PD, CAL, and BOP during full mouth&#xD;
      periodontal examination. BOP will be assessed as a dichotomous measure within 15 seconds of&#xD;
      probing to full pocket depth. After the initial readings for PI, GI, BOP, PD, CAL at baseline&#xD;
      will be recorded; patients would receive oral hygiene instructions and full-mouth SRP.&#xD;
      Patients will be re-examined at 4th, 8th, 12th week. Reinforcement of oral hygiene will be&#xD;
      carried out at each recall visit. PI, BOP and GI will be recorded at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. The other parameters would be measured only at the completion of 12 weeks of SRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical periodontal examinations will be carried out by a single investigator to&#xD;
      preclude any inter-examiner variability.&#xD;
