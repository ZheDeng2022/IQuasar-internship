  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Policing is an increasingly sedentary occupation and high levels of physical and&#xD;
      psychological morbidities are reported by officers and staff. Wearable fitness technology may&#xD;
      be a feasible intervention to promote physical activity and improve health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of introducing wearable fitness&#xD;
      technology (Fitbit™ activity monitors linked to the 'Bupa Boost' smartphone app) as a&#xD;
      motivator for increasing physical activity within the police force. Additional aims are to&#xD;
      and to assess the potential impact of the intervention on physical activity, sedentary time,&#xD;
      health and wellbeing, stress, sickness absence and self-perceived productivity, and to&#xD;
      explore which motivational strategies (e.g. individual goal-setting vs. social competitions)&#xD;
      are most acceptable and potentially effective and for which groups of staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-group, before and after, mixed methods exploratory trial will be conducted.&#xD;
      Approximately 180 police officers and staff from two sites (Plymouth Basic Command Unit and&#xD;
      North Dorset) will be recruited to take part. Participants will use the technology for 12&#xD;
      weeks initially followed by a further five months of optional use. A combination of&#xD;
      questionnaire surveys, interviews and analysis of staff absence records will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected pre-intervention, mid-intervention (6 weeks), post-intervention (12&#xD;
      weeks) and follow-up (8 months). Primary outcomes are change in objectively recorded step&#xD;
      count, self-reported physical activity and sedentary time. Secondary outcomes include general&#xD;
      health and wellbeing, perceived stress and productivity, sickness absence, engagement with&#xD;
      the intervention and perceived usability and usefulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will add to our understanding of the feasibility and acceptability of mobile&#xD;
      fitness technology in a specific workplace setting, and inform a potential larger trial&#xD;
      within the police force.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The workplace is increasingly seen as a setting for health promotion and preventive health&#xD;
      activities, not only to prevent occupational injury, but also to improve people's overall&#xD;
      health and wellbeing. The police force experiences higher than average rates of illness&#xD;
      compared to the general population, including several common risk factors for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and metabolic syndrome, in addition to high stress levels. Regular physical activity&#xD;
      plays a pivotal role in the prevention and treatment of many health-related conditions and&#xD;
      stress reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The profile of crime is changing. Lower rates of street crime and increasing rates of white&#xD;
      collar and cybercrime mean that the act of policing is becoming a more sedentary occupation.&#xD;
      Police officers also experience a number of barriers to undertaking physical activity&#xD;
      including long working hours, shift work, job pressures and lack of access to training&#xD;
      facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wearable fitness technology (smartphone applications and personal physical activity monitors)&#xD;
      provides people with accessible ways to engage with and monitor their physical activity at&#xD;
      their convenience. There has been a recent proliferation of research into the application of&#xD;
      such technology for behaviour change and health improvement. However, much of this research&#xD;
      has so far been inconclusive. For studies that have reported significant effects, these have&#xD;
      generally been modest and short-term. Remaining knowledge gaps include which strategies&#xD;
      should be used to maintain motivation, and the impact of the technology within different&#xD;
      populations and subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Bupa Boost' is a smartphone application (app) run by the private health insurer Bupa. The&#xD;
      app is a health and wellbeing tool designed for use in the workplace, which focuses on&#xD;
      fitness, nutrition, mindfulness and relaxation. Devon and Cornwall Police and Dorset Police&#xD;
      will work in partnership with Bupa, which will provide the app for free to staff and support&#xD;
      research around the app. The organisations will supply a specific activity monitor (the&#xD;
      Fitbit Charge 2™) to synchronise with the Bupa Boost app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupa Boost contains several features or strategies intended to motivate behaviour change. For&#xD;
      the purpose of this study and based on relevant theories, the features are categorised in two&#xD;
      'motivational frames':&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individual (goal-setting to earn points and virtual rewards such as badges)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Social (connecting with colleagues for support and to take part in competitive and&#xD;
           collaborative/team challenges).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This PhD project will conduct an exploratory trial to examine the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of introducing wearable fitness technology (personal activity monitors linked&#xD;
      to a smartphone app) as a motivator for increasing physical activity within the police force.&#xD;
      The trial will explore engagement and acceptability of the intervention in both the short and&#xD;
      long term, including the maintenance of physical activity behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work will include an exploratory analysis of a range of outcomes. It is predicted that&#xD;
      the intervention will be associated with increased levels of physical activity, which will&#xD;
      lead to improved health and wellbeing and reduced stress of staff, and an increase in&#xD;
      productivity and reduction in sick leave and absenteeism across the organisations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that the different motivational strategies within the app (i.e. individual&#xD;
      and social) will appeal to different individuals. Consequently, a further aim of this study&#xD;
      is to explore which motivational strategies (i.e. individual and social) are most acceptable&#xD;
      and potentially effective for different groups of police staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to gain an understanding of the wider context of physical activity&#xD;
      within the police force through the identification of key barriers and facilitators, to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention at various levels of the&#xD;
      organisation, and to assess the feasibility and acceptability of trial methods to inform a&#xD;
      potential larger scale trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the wearing of a physical activity monitor (Fitbit Charge 2™) and use of the 'Bupa&#xD;
           Boost' app a feasible and acceptable way to increase physical activity levels within the&#xD;
           Devon and Cornwall and Dorset police forces?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the longer term engagement and acceptability of the intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the potential impact of the intervention on physical activity (and sedentary&#xD;
           time), and are physical activity levels maintained in the longer term?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do increasing levels of physical activity impact positively on health, wellbeing and&#xD;
           stress levels within the police force?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Are increased levels of physical activity associated with a healthier workplace, as&#xD;
           measured by an increase in perceived productivity and reduction in sick leave and&#xD;
           absenteeism?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What is the experience and impact of the different app-based motivational strategies&#xD;
           (individual vs. social) on the level of physical activity undertaken by police staff,&#xD;
           and are there any differences according to age, gender or occupation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. What are the key facilitators and barriers to physical activity within the police force?&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. What is the perceived feasibility and acceptability of the intervention at various&#xD;
           levels of the organisation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Do the findings indicate feasibility and acceptability for a larger scale trial of&#xD;
           wearable fitness technology within the police force?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single group exploratory trial with a pre- and post- evaluation (i.e. before and after use&#xD;
      of the wearable fitness technology) will be conducted. Volunteer participants from two sites,&#xD;
      Plymouth Basic Command Unit (urban) and North Dorset (rural), will receive the intervention,&#xD;
      i.e. the Fitbit activity monitor and Bupa Boost app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an initial week of wearing the activity monitor only (for baseline data&#xD;
      collection), participants will take part in a 12 week intervention where the activity monitor&#xD;
      will be linked to the Bupa Boost app. They will set specific goals including increasing their&#xD;
      step count, and they will then be encouraged to engage with all of the motivational&#xD;
      strategies within the 'individual' frame in weeks 1-6, followed by the 'social' frame in&#xD;
      weeks 7-12. At the end of the 12 weeks, there will be a 5 month 'maintenance phase' during&#xD;
      which participants may continue to use the device and app if and when they desire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to use only the device they are given (Fitbit Charge 2™) and&#xD;
      Bupa Boost, and to use only the features that relate to the 'individual' or 'social'&#xD;
      motivational frame as appropriate. Data on step count will be directly collected by the&#xD;
      device; participants will send this electronically to the researcher at four different time&#xD;
      points - pre-intervention (baseline), mid-intervention (6 weeks), post-intervention (12&#xD;
      weeks) and follow-up (5 months post-intervention). They will also complete a range of online&#xD;
      questionnaires relating to their physical activity levels, health and wellbeing, stress,&#xD;
      perceived productivity and absenteeism at the same time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study will be approximately 12 months and is part of a 36 month PhD. A&#xD;
      small pilot study will be undertaken to ensure the data collection methods are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With participants' permission, some data will also be collected from staff occupational&#xD;
      health records. This will include sickness and absence time, and most common reasons for&#xD;
      sickness absence before and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to quantitative data, there will be a parallel qualitative study to gain an&#xD;
      understanding of participants' expectations (before the intervention) and experiences (after&#xD;
      the intervention) of the wearable fitness technology, and facilitators of and barriers to its&#xD;
      use and participating in physical activity. This will involve interviews with a small sample,&#xD;
      including participants who showed various levels of engagement. There will also be a small&#xD;
      survey with managers, commissioners and occupational health staff within the police force to&#xD;
      assess their perceptions of the usefulness, acceptability and feasibility of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre- and post-trial analysis will be undertaken. Baseline data will be compared with&#xD;
      post-intervention and follow-up outcomes. An appropriate statistical method (e.g. paired&#xD;
      t-test, repeated measures analysis of variance) will be selected for the primary outcome of&#xD;
      step count. Inferential analysis will be used for key secondary outcomes (International&#xD;
      Physical Activity Questionnaire outcomes, SF-12 health survey, Perceived Stress Scale,&#xD;
      absenteeism and presenteeism) where possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in outcomes between the two motivational frames will also be compared to assess their&#xD;
      impact, and subgroup analysis will be used to explore any potential associations between&#xD;
      varying effectiveness and sociodemographic factors (i.e. age, gender, occupation). All&#xD;
      statistical analyses will be performed in Stata (version 14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed and a thematic and framework analysis&#xD;
      will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contribution and Justification of Benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has the potential to fill some of the gaps in the existing evidence surrounding&#xD;
      mobile fitness technology, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Application of the technology to promote physical activity in a specific workplace&#xD;
           setting;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of the preferred and potentially effective motivational/behaviour change&#xD;
           strategies in this context;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-group differences - impact of the intervention and strategies according to age,&#xD;
           gender and occupation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study of both physical activity and sedentary behaviour (as the latter is an&#xD;
           independent risk factor for poor health);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide further insight into adherence to the use of wearable devices and mobile health&#xD;
           technology and the longer-term impact on maintenance of physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are potential benefits to the health and wellbeing of the police force, which is likely&#xD;
      to impact on the organisation and also the local community through the reduction of staff&#xD;
      pressure due to sick days, increased health and wellness whilst at work and increased&#xD;
      productivity and resilience to stress.&#xD;
