  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RESPOND-HF is a prospective, multi-center, non-significant risk pilot study with cross-over&#xD;
      design. The purpose of the study is to investigate if rate adaptive pacing has the potential&#xD;
      to provide benefit to HF patients with preserved ejection fraction, referred to as HFpEF&#xD;
      patients. Findings from this pilot study may be used to guide subsequent efforts to design&#xD;
      and conduct a prospective, randomized, multi-center pivotal trial powered to show improvement&#xD;
      in patient outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RESPOND-HF is a prospective, multi-center, investigational, pilot study with cross-over&#xD;
      design. Patients with existing pacemakers who have been diagnosed with HFpEF and meet study&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to be conducted at up to 5 centers in the United States and up to 300&#xD;
      patients will be consented to enroll up to 100 qualifying patients . Up to 60 patients&#xD;
      meeting chronotropic incompetence (CI) criterion will be enrolled. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in subjects who have previously (≥ 30 days) been implanted with Medtronic, dual&#xD;
      chamber pacemaker (IPG) device with rate adaptive pacing (RAP) feature. Additionally, up to&#xD;
      40 patients who do not meet CI criterion will be enrolled to collect ambulatory activity and&#xD;
      heart rate data using AVIVO/SEEQ patch. These patients will be followed for only 1 week. It&#xD;
      is estimated that subject enrollment will take approximately 12 to 18 months, with a study&#xD;
      follow-up of 18 weeks.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>To assess whether rate adaptive pacing provides benefit to HFpEF patients, a pool of up to 60 qualifying subjects with pre-existing pacemaker and established diagnosis of HFpEF who demonstrate chronotropic incompetence (CI) with RAP turned off will be enrolled.&#xD;
Subjects who meet CI criterion during Visit 2 will be randomized. Subjects' principal investigator and study team will be blinded to the randomization assignment. However clinical site personnel performing the device programming will not be blinded. Site personnel performing the CPET and 6-min hall walk assessments will be blinded to the randomization assignment.&#xD;
Crossover of study subjects will occur during Visit 3, which will occur 12 weeks after subject enrollment. Subjects who were randomized with RAP ON first will have the device programmed to RAP OFF and conversely, subjects who were randomized to RAP OFF first will have the device programmed to RAP ON.</intervention_model_description>
