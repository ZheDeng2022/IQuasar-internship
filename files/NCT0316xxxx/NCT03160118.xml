  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical fase IV study, using the administration of a single dose of a quadrivalent,&#xD;
      inactivated, split influenza virus vaccine as biological intervention will mirror a study&#xD;
      conducted at Imperial College, London, UK that will use a challenge with live virus as&#xD;
      intervention. Comparison of the clinical observations and laboratory measurements generated&#xD;
      in both studies will inform us about the similarities and differences in innate and adaptive&#xD;
      immune responses elicited by both types of exposure to influenza virus antigen(s).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a monocentric, open label study. All subjects will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      alfa-Rix Tetra 2016-2017. The following will be measured - clinical events (recorded adverse&#xD;
      events), physiological responses (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, injection site),&#xD;
      innate immune responses (cytokine levels and whole blood gene expression) and adaptive immune&#xD;
      responses (serum antibody and antigen-specific cellular responses) at various time points&#xD;
      after immunisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, full physiological parameters (including body temperature, heart rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure) will be obtained and the injection site will be examined for the presence of&#xD;
      any redness or swelling that will be measured and recorded. Standardized diary cards will be&#xD;
      used to collect solicited and unsolicited clinical event data. At each visit the diary cards&#xD;
      will be examined and any relevant clinical event will be entered into the clinical event&#xD;
      form. Participants will be asked to monitor oral temperature from day 0 until day 7 when they&#xD;
      wake up and when going to bed. The results of these measurements will be reported in a diary&#xD;
      card. Any skin reactions at the site of injection will be evaluated; largest diameter of&#xD;
      redness and swelling will be measured with a ruler and data reported on the diary card.&#xD;
      Samples of blood (PAXgene tubes, plasma, serum and PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells)) will be collected for analysis and processing using protocols already in place.&#xD;
      Subjects will also have blood obtained for standard safety markers (haematology,&#xD;
      biochemistry) as well as acute phase proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to generate a set of data that will be analysed by integrated&#xD;
      systems biology approach, for validation in subsequent clinical trials or in animal models.&#xD;
      The dataset will broadly characterise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physiological responses at various time points after immunisation by measuring:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Local and systemic vaccine-related clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Physiological assessments: heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Haematology (Complete Blood Count (CBC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) ,&#xD;
                phenotyping of White Blood Cells (WBC)), biochemistry parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Innate and adaptive immune responses including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Innate immune activation detected by global gene expression in whole blood&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Adaptive immunity determined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Humoral immune response via serum anti-influenza HAI (Haemagglutination Inhibition)&#xD;
           titre ii. Cellular immune response c. Immune activation detected by concentration of&#xD;
           selected inflammatory soluble mediators in serum including: i. chemokines and cytokines&#xD;
           ii. acute phase proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Genetic testing of subjects when deemed necessary (genetic testing analysis may be SNIP&#xD;
           (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) analysis or full genome analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Correlations in changes in innate and adaptive immune activation with adverse events,&#xD;
           haematology and biochemistry panels, genotype and physiological assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will biobank all samples for the duration of the BIOVACSAFE programme so that&#xD;
      different samples and different time points depending on the results generated can&#xD;
      selectively be analysed, principally from the gene expression analysis of whole blood.&#xD;
