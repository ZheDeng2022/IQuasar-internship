      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cannabidiol&#xD;
      administered via inhalation and oral ingestion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be conducted at the Johns Hopkins Behavioral Pharmacology Research&#xD;
      Unit (BPRU) and the Johns Hopkins Bayview Clinical Research Unit (CRU). Participants will&#xD;
      complete 4 acute drug administration periods, each consisting of a single drug exposure&#xD;
      followed by a 5-day observation period (3-days (58-hours) inpatient and 2-days outpatient).&#xD;
      Biological specimens will be obtained to characterize the pharmacokinetics of THC, CBD, and&#xD;
      their metabolites in whole blood, oral fluid, urine, and hair during this period. Each&#xD;
      participant will receive all 4 dose conditions in a counterbalanced order using a placebo&#xD;
      controlled within-subject crossover design. The 4 drug conditions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition 1: Inhalation of cannabis vapor containing approximately a 20:1 ratio of&#xD;
           CBD:THC and will be measured to deliver a target dose of 100mg CBD and 5mg THC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition 2: Inhalation of 100mg CBD vapor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition 3: Ingestion of 100mg CBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition 4: Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration will be double blind and double dummy; both inhalation and oral ingestion&#xD;
      of study drugs will occur during all 4 sessions. The order of drug administration will be&#xD;
      counterbalanced across participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research volunteers will be recruited until up to 18 participants have completed each of the&#xD;
      four study sessions (received Conditions 1-4). Immediately before (baseline) and following&#xD;
      each exposure, a battery of assessments including biological fluid collection and testing,&#xD;
      subjective questionnaire administration, and performance testing will be conducted for all&#xD;
      study participants. Post-exposure testing will be conducted in two phases: a 3-day (58 hour)&#xD;
      residential stay, and a 2-day outpatient period, for a total of 5 days. Participants who drop&#xD;
      out of the study prior to completion of all 4 drug conditions will be considered &quot;incomplete&quot;&#xD;
      and replaced. Approximately one week (minimum of 6 days) will separate the administration of&#xD;
      each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target demographic for study participation are healthy adults who: 1) have a history of&#xD;
      intentionally inhaling cannabis/CBD, 2) have not used cannabis in the past month (desire is&#xD;
      to have participants free of cannabinoids in biological matrices at the time of initial drug&#xD;
      administration), and 3) who are not currently dependent on or seeking treatment for use of&#xD;
      cannabis or other psychoactive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcome variables include quantitative levels of CBD and its primary metabolites, THC&#xD;
      and its primary metabolites, results of drug testing procedures conducted in accordance with&#xD;
      current federal Mandatory Guidelines for workplace drug testing, subjective drug effect&#xD;
      ratings, and performance on behavioral assessments. Biological specimens will be analyzed by&#xD;
      an independent laboratory with validated analytical procedures that are specific and accurate&#xD;
      for measurement of marijuana constituents and related metabolites. Subjective, cardiovascular&#xD;
      and behavioral outcomes will be assessed using multiple regression analyses appropriate for&#xD;
      repeated measures testing based on the final characteristics of the data set (e.g. normal&#xD;
      distribution, skewness, kurtosis), and correlated with biomarker results of interest.&#xD;
