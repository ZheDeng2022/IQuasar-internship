    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomised placebo controlled trial examining the effectiveness of using&#xD;
      an intranasal evaporative cooling device (the RhinoChill intransal device) in providing&#xD;
      relief of pain and symptoms of acute migraine.The treatment works by introducing cooling into&#xD;
      the passageways of the nose through two small cannulas thereby cooling the local nasal tissue&#xD;
      and the blood vessels which supply blood to the brain. This cooling effect will cause the&#xD;
      blood vessels to constrict as well as stimulating special cold receptors that are thought to&#xD;
      be involved in the relief of migraine, thereby providing both pain and associated symptomatic&#xD;
      relief. In total, 90 patients randomised in a 1:1 fashio n will be recruited from three&#xD;
      different NHS Trusts. The patients will have a 30-day period of data collection for their&#xD;
      current migraine frequency, treatment and response to medication (with a minimum of 2&#xD;
      migraine attacks recorded) before starting the treatment phase with the RhinoChill Device.&#xD;
      Treatment will be for 3 migraine attacks. Only a single treatment is allowed for the first&#xD;
      attack, but on the second attack the patient may deliver 2 treatments with a gap of at least&#xD;
      2 hours between treatments, if indicated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical techniques to alleviate migraine symptoms have been used for many years, cooling&#xD;
      and compression being the most frequently applied. Cryotherapy is the most common&#xD;
      non-pharmacological self-administered pain-relieving method currently used by migraine&#xD;
      sufferers. The first manuscript documenting the application of ice mixtures was published by&#xD;
      James Arnott in 1849. Simple techniques based on cryotherapy, using various methods of cold&#xD;
      and ice application have been reported over the last three decades. Friedman described a&#xD;
      device using hollow metal tubes cooled by circulating cold water, applied to the periapical&#xD;
      area of the maxillary molars. Sprouse-Blum reported benefit from applying frozen icepacks&#xD;
      targeting carotid arteries at the front of the neck in migraine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several pathophysiological mechanisms of action have been proposed. These mechanisms include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neurovascular mechanism: Application of cold induces vasoconstriction with subsequent&#xD;
           decreased downstream blood flow. This leads to inhibition of the release of inflammatory&#xD;
           mediators which results in decreased vascular permeability and local oedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain gating by differential effect on nerve conduction: Cryotherapy induces analgesia by&#xD;
           slowing nerve conduction velocity, with small myelinated fibers being affected first,&#xD;
           followed by large myelinated fibers and the unmyelinated fibers being affected last. Via&#xD;
           mechanism of the gate control of pain, affecting the small myelinated nociceptive pain&#xD;
           afferents first, cryotherapy induces analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Metabolic mechanism: Cryotherapy decreases metabolic and enzymatic activity, due to&#xD;
           reduced demand for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels: Recent studies suggest that TRP channels&#xD;
           may have a role in headache and pain genesis due to their response to environmental&#xD;
           stimuli such as temperature changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nasal cavity provides a large diffuse surface area that is highly vascular. Cooling via&#xD;
      the nasal cavity therefore offers the ability to cool across the thin cribriform plate via&#xD;
      both direct conductive mechanisms that do not rely on spontaneous circulation as well as&#xD;
      indirect haematogenous mechanisms. Numerous subarachnoid and pial arterial branches exposed&#xD;
      to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have diameters in the range of the vessels of the retia&#xD;
      mirabilia of animals in which selective brain cooling has been clearly established&#xD;
      experimentally. Vascular anatomy allows transfer of venous blood from the skin of the head as&#xD;
      well as nasal and paranasal mucous membranes to the dura mater thereby providing an excellent&#xD;
      basis for the convective process of intranasal evaporative cooling. The dura mater, with its&#xD;
      high vascularization, may transmit temperature changes to the CSF compartment, which may&#xD;
      influence the temperature of brain parenchyma directly or indirectly, via brain arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We suppose that another effect of intranasal cooling may be local vasoconstriction and&#xD;
      subsequent associated vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries due to the presence of the&#xD;
      nebulized coolant in the nasal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many sufferers use mechanical techniques to relieve the headache. Simple techniques that have&#xD;
      been recommended and tried include cryotherapy. Applying an icepack to the painful area has&#xD;
      been the most frequently mentioned method. Many studies demonstrating the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      variety of non-pharmacological modalities have been reviewed over the years. Although&#xD;
      definite proof of effectiveness through traditional scientific method has been lacking in&#xD;
      most instances. There is a trial reported by Friedman, where intraoral cooling was applied.&#xD;
      Significant migraine relief has been obtained from chilling confined to the area. Thirty-five&#xD;
      symptomatic episodic migraine patients were enrolled in this study, comparing 40 minutes of&#xD;
      bilateral intraoral chilling, 50 mg of oral sumatriptan, and 40 minutes of sham (tongue)&#xD;
      chilling. Hollow metal tubes chilled by circulating ice water were held in the maxillary&#xD;
      molar periapical areas by the patient. Pain and nausea were recorded at baseline and 1, 2, 4,&#xD;
      and 24 hours after start of treatment, using a numeric symptom-relief scale. Significant mean&#xD;
      headache relief was obtained by maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at all four time&#xD;
      intervals, with poor relief obtained by placebo. Maxillary chilling was more effective than&#xD;
      sumatriptan at all four time intervals. Significant nausea relief was obtained by maxillary&#xD;
      chilling and sumatriptan at post treatment and 2 and 4 hours later. At 24 hours, some&#xD;
      headache and nausea recurrence was noted with sumatriptan. The repeated-measures analysis of&#xD;
      variance indicated that both treatments, drug (P = 0.024) and maxillary chilling (P = 0.001),&#xD;
      reduced the headache, as compared with the control group. Tenderness in the premolar area&#xD;
      suggests local inflammation associated with vasodilatation and oedema. Because chilling can&#xD;
      resolve local oedema, authors raised the possibility that an intraoral inflammation may be a&#xD;
      factor in migraine aetiology. Although it is a possibility the cooling effect might have&#xD;
      caused indirect vasoconstriction of the dilated meningeal blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the COOLHEAD 1 trial, investigators found that the use of RhinoChill® intranasal cooling&#xD;
      within a clinic environment for 15 patients provided a statistically significant reduction of&#xD;
      pain and associated symptoms of migraine at 5 minutes and 10 minutes (during treatment), and&#xD;
      at 1 hour and 2 hours following treatment (all p values &lt;0.001) along with a significant&#xD;
      effect on pain and symptoms at 24 hours (p &lt;0.001). In total, 87% of patients enrolled into&#xD;
      the trial received a treatment benefit following from a short term (&lt;20minutes) period of&#xD;
      intranasal cooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment into the trial was challenging as participants were required to present at the&#xD;
      hospital clinic for treatment between the hours of 9am to 7pm Monday to Friday, which for&#xD;
      some, was too difficult while undergoing a migraine headache, and for others, the centre was&#xD;
      not open for treatment at the time of their migraines. For those that did come in for&#xD;
      treatment, it was found to be burdensome to travel while a migraine was present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this trial demonstrate that the RhinoChill® intranasal cooling device is both&#xD;
      safe and effective to treat migraine patients within the setting of a hospital clinic&#xD;
      environment. In this planned BrainCool-Migraine trial, the treatment will be&#xD;
      self-administered by the patient. To allow for a swifter enrollment of patients into the&#xD;
      study, to evaluate this treatment methodology in an as close to real world environment as&#xD;
      possible, and to minimize any burden or discomfort to the patient by traveling to the&#xD;
      hospital clinic with an active migraine headache on the one hand and to achieve best possible&#xD;
      control of the study on the other hand, the self-administration by the patient in this study&#xD;
      will be allowed and required to be done at home, as opposed to the clinic or any other&#xD;
      location. The proven treatment methods and procedures as examined and described in the&#xD;
      COOLHEAD 1 in-clinic trial will be implemented throughout the BrainCool-Migraine trial&#xD;
      treatment procedures so as to ensure the high quality and standards associated with the&#xD;
      previous trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recognised that migraine treatments are prone to placebo effects, which is further&#xD;
      enhanced by the use of a medical device in an in-hospital setting, therefore in this&#xD;
      BrainCool-Migraine trial, the design will be that of a double blinded, randomised, two arm,&#xD;
      placebo control multicentre clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis we propose is that the application of RhinoChill® nasal cavity cooling will&#xD;
      provide effective relief of pain and symptoms associated with episodic migraine (with or&#xD;
      without aura). The null hypothesis is that no significant difference in pain scores, headache&#xD;
      response or symptom severity scores will be found between the active treatment and placebo&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
