      a minimum of two metastatic lesions (at least one measurable), are eligible if they have an&#xD;
      ECOG Performance Status of 0-1. Patients will receive on Day 1, ipilimumab (every 6 weeks)&#xD;

      NSCLC patients with metastatic disease who have failed at least one prior treatment and have&#xD;
      a minimum of two metastatic lesions (at least one measurable), are eligible if they have an&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-ablative radiotherapy (6GyX5) is directed to one lesion during a first immunotherapy&#xD;
      treatment with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (± 24hrs from first RT dose). On day 22 the combined&#xD;
      treatment of ipilimumab plus nivolumab will start (nivolumab 240mg q 2 weeks, ipilimumab&#xD;
      1mg/kg q 6 weeks), and administered until evidence of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are re-imaged at Week 9 (day 70 ± 7) to evaluate for response (defined as an&#xD;
      objective response by RECIST of the measurable metastatic sites outside the radiation field).&#xD;
      This response will be evaluated assessing clinical and positron emission computed tomography&#xD;
      (PET/CT) responses in the non-irradiated measurable metastatic sites using RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
