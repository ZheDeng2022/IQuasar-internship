  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional requirements for dietary amino acids in children have traditionally been&#xD;
      determined utilizing the nitrogen balance technique, which is prone to underestimating&#xD;
      protein requirements. As a result, there is a need to re-evaluate recommendations in order to&#xD;
      characterize how dietary amino acid needs may be modulated by physical activity in healthy,&#xD;
      active children. The purpose of this study is to measure the protein requirement in children&#xD;
      (boys and girls) using the IAAO technique in the presence of a variable intensity exercise&#xD;
      stimulus. It is hypothesized that the present study will deem current amino acid requirements&#xD;
      to be underestimates of appropriate amino acid requirements for this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Provided energy needs are met, the adequate ingestion of dietary amino acids is the most&#xD;
      critical nutritional factor to support the optimal remodeling and deposition of lean body&#xD;
      mass in individuals of all ages, including active youth. Despite the fact that the most&#xD;
      consistent and rapid growth velocities outside of infancy occur during childhood and&#xD;
      adolescence, respectively, there is a paucity of research into the fundamental questions of&#xD;
      how exercise and nutrition (i.e. dietary amino acid ingestion) enhance protein turnover in&#xD;
      these key demographics. Of primary importance is the impact exercise has on the nutritional&#xD;
      requirement for dietary amino acids in concurrently growing youth. This lack of dedicated&#xD;
      research represents a significant knowledge gap for a large segment of the world's&#xD;
      population. Nutritional requirements for dietary amino acids in young adults has&#xD;
      traditionally been determined utilizing the antiquated and often erroneous nitrogen balance&#xD;
      technique, which makes it difficult to adequately define the protein needs of this&#xD;
      population, let alone those of children. In addition, nitrogen balance requires a prolonged&#xD;
      adaptation period, which exposes subjects to deficient intakes for 7-10 days, making it&#xD;
      unsuitable for use in vulnerable populations like children. As a result, there is a need to&#xD;
      establish (in the case of children) recommendations utilizing advanced stable isotope&#xD;
      methodology in order to characterize how dietary amino acid needs may be affected by physical&#xD;
      activity over the critical early years of development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies using the minimally invasive indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique have&#xD;
      suggested that protein requirements in young men and children are at least 50% higher than&#xD;
      WHO/FAO guidelines based on nitrogen balance data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will use, for the first time in active children, the gold-standard IAAO&#xD;
      technique to achieve two major objectives: i) to determine the impact of high levels of&#xD;
      physical activity on protein requirements in active, growing children, and; ii) to determine&#xD;
      whether exercise in adolescence, previously determined in a separate study, alters protein&#xD;
      requirements relative to similarly active children.&#xD;
