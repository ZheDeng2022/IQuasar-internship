&#xD;
          5. Highly treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients with documented genotypic and/or&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Have full viral sensitivity/susceptibility to at least one approved antiretroviral&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Be willing to remain on treatment without any changes or additions to the OBT regimen,&#xD;
             except for toxicity management or upon meeting criteria for treatment failure;&#xD;
