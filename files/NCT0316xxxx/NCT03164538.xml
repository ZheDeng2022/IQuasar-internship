    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of a&#xD;
      customized, combined positive psychology and motivational interviewing (PP-MI) health&#xD;
      behavior intervention in a group of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare a combined positive psychology and motivational interviewing&#xD;
      (PP-MI) intervention that is adapted for patients with T2D to a diabetes education&#xD;
      intervention (control) in a randomized controlled trial. The investigators will enroll 70&#xD;
      participants, who will be randomized to either a 16-week PP-MI health behavior intervention&#xD;
      or an 16-week diabetes education intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators plan to do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the feasibility and acceptability of a 16-week, telephone-delivered health&#xD;
           behavior intervention utilizing PP exercises and MI with systematic goal-setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether the PP-MI intervention leads to greater increases in physical activity&#xD;
           than the education intervention in T2D patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the impact of the PP-MI intervention on other psychological, behavioral, and&#xD;
           medical outcomes, compared to the education intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo an initial screening visit during which they will meet with study&#xD;
      staff in person. At this visit, study eligibility will be confirmed, and eligible and willing&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled. Following enrollment, participants will complete self-report&#xD;
      measures, and vital signs and A1c will be measured. They then will take home and wear an&#xD;
      accelerometer for one week, to measure baseline physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline information about enrolled participants will be obtained from the participants, care&#xD;
      providers, and the electronic medical record as required for characterization of the&#xD;
      population. This information will include data regarding medical history (type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus), current medical variables (conditions affecting physical activity), medications,&#xD;
      and sociodemographic data (age, gender, race/ethnicity, living alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a second in-person visit once adequate baseline physical activity&#xD;
      data has been obtained. In this visit, accelerometer data will be reviewed to ensure that&#xD;
      adequate baseline activity was captured. If so, participants will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      PP-MI or diabetes education condition, then begin the study intervention. During this second&#xD;
      in-person visit, participants will receive either a PP-MI or diabetes education treatment&#xD;
      manual, depending on randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the PP-MI intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each session, a PP exercise will be described in the manual, with instructions and space&#xD;
      to write about the exercise and its effects. Next, an MI section will outline specific&#xD;
      MI-based topics (e.g., pros/cons, managing slips) and facilitate physical activity&#xD;
      goal-setting. At subsequent sessions, participants will review the prior week's PP exercise&#xD;
      and learn about a new exercise, then will review the prior week's physical activity goal and&#xD;
      set a new one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the diabetes education intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each week, participants will learn about a different health behavior topic related to&#xD;
      diabetes health. This includes information about diabetes self-monitoring, medication&#xD;
      adherence, having a heart-healthy diet, and being physically active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete the remaining sessions by phone approximately weekly over the next&#xD;
      16 weeks. Phone sessions will last approximately 30 minutes, with PP-MI and physical activity&#xD;
      assignments completed between phone sessions. PP and MI will be delivered step-wise within&#xD;
      sessions (rather than intertwined) based on our experience, participant feedback, and pilot&#xD;
      work. If a week is missed, the session will not be skipped, but rather the intervention will&#xD;
      be completed sequentially (with participants who miss weeks then missing the final sessions),&#xD;
      with the exception of the final visit, which skips to Planning for the Future in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo an in-person follow-up assessment at 16 weeks. At this session,&#xD;
      participants will repeat self-report assessments that were administered at baseline. Vital&#xD;
      signs and a blood sample will again be collected at this in-person visit. Prior to this&#xD;
      assessment, participants will wear an accelerometer for 7 days to measure physical activity.&#xD;
      Participants will also undergo a phone follow-up assessment at 24 weeks. During this session&#xD;
      over the phone, participants will repeat self-report assessments that were administered at&#xD;
      baseline. Finally, prior to this follow-up, participants will wear another accelerometer for&#xD;
      7 days to measure physical activity.&#xD;

          <description>Participants will complete weekly positive psychology exercises and will systematically set goals related to physical activity. Study trainers will review the positive psychology exercises on the phone each week and will use motivational interviewing techniques to facilitate goal setting.&#xD;
Positive Psychology + Motivational Interviewing: Participants randomized to PP-MI will receive a treatment manual. For each session, a PP exercise will be described in the manual, with instructions and space to write about the exercise and its effects. Next, an MI section will outline specific MI-based topics (e.g., pros/cons, managing slips) and facilitate physical activity goal-setting. Following randomization, participants will engage in weekly, 30-minute phone calls over the next 16 weeks. Participants will independently complete PP exercises and MI-based goals between phone sessions and review them during phone sessions.</description>

          <description>Participants will speak on the telephone each week with a study trainer. During these calls, the trainer will provide education about a health behavior related to diabetes health (physical activity, medication adherence, diet).&#xD;
Diabetes Education: Each week, participants will learn about a different health behavior topic related to diabetes health. As an attentional control, this condition has a parallel structure to the experimental arm with a treatment manual, weekly assignments, and weekly calls to review assignments.</description>

          <title>Self-Reported Physical Activity</title>
          <description>Measured by the self-report International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The measure assesses the types of intensity of physical activity that people do as part of their daily lives. All activities are converted to multiples of resting energy expenditure (MET) minutes per week.</description>

For each session, a PP exercise will be described in the manual, with instructions and space to write about the exercise and its effects. Next, an MI section will outline specific MI-based topics (e.g., pros/cons, managing slips) and facilitate physical activity goal-setting. Following randomization, participants will engage in weekly, 30-minute phone calls over the next 16 weeks. Participants will independently complete PP exercises and MI-based goals between phone sessions and review them during phone sessions.</description>

For each session, a PP exercise will be described in the manual, with instructions and space to write about the exercise and its effects. Next, an MI section will outline specific MI-based topics (e.g., pros/cons, managing slips) and facilitate physical activity goal-setting. Following randomization, participants will engage in weekly, 30-minute phone calls over the next 16 weeks. Participants will independently complete PP exercises and MI-based goals between phone sessions and review them during phone sessions.</description>
