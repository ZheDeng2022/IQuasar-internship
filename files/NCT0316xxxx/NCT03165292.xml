  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of two intensified consolidation strategies in&#xD;
      very-high risk neuroblastoma (VHR-NBL) patients in terms of event-free survival from&#xD;
      randomisation date. This evaluation will follow a hierarchical testing procedure: each&#xD;
      experimental treatment will be first evaluated as a single-arm phase 2 study, and in case of&#xD;
      positive conclusion, the relative efficacy of both arms will then be evaluated comparatively.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-risk metastatic neuroblastoma is not cured by a single treatment. All patients who have&#xD;
      become long-term survivors have received sequential treatments with various drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, this trial does not compare two single treatments, but compares two&#xD;
      sequential treatment strategies. In these two strategies, most of the components are&#xD;
      evidence-based best practice, although the level of evidence supporting each component&#xD;
      varies. There is one experimental component in each strategy. Indeed, none of these two&#xD;
      treatment schedules can be considered as standard therapy, and none has been previously&#xD;
      compared with any standard therapy in a randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it might be considered that this trial should have a standard therapy arm as a&#xD;
      comparator, analysis of patients treated in the SIOPEN HR NBL trial 1 who have failed to meet&#xD;
      the R1 criteria has shown a wide heterogeneity of treatments. Therefore, there is no&#xD;
      recognised or accepted standard treatment in this very high-risk patient group, and no&#xD;
      guidelines exist for poor responders. Survival in this very high-risk group is currently very&#xD;
      poor. Considering all these points, it is considered ethical to compare two experimental&#xD;
      schedules without a standard comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial compares two such strategies in a randomised way. Patients are eligible for entry&#xD;
      into the trial if they fail to have an adequate response to induction and therefore cannot&#xD;
      proceed directly within the high-risk study to BuMel PBSCR. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomised at that time point, even though further standard treatment will be administered&#xD;
      before the randomised element, and there may be circumstances when an individual patient&#xD;
      although randomised to a particular strategy, is unable to receive the randomised element of&#xD;
      treatment. For example, if it proves impossible to perform an adequate PBSC harvest. All&#xD;
      randomised patients will be analysed on an intention to treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomisation, all patients will continue with standard dose chemotherapy with&#xD;
      irinotecan and temozolomide for three courses to allow for PBSC harvest (it is not mandatory&#xD;
      to have clear bone marrows before attempting a harvest) and to facilitate scheduling of the&#xD;
      randomised element of the study which may necessitate referral to another centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will then receive one of two investigational intensification therapies according&#xD;
      to random allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  high administered activity 131I-mIBG and topotecan and ASCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  high-dose thiotepa and ASCR Then all patients will proceed to second high-dose&#xD;
           chemotherapy: BuMel and ASCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensified consolidation chemotherapy will be followed by external radiotherapy as&#xD;
      appropriate, by local surgery of the tumour residues as appropriate.&#xD;
