      The RAND approach to appropriateness makes it feasible to take the best of what is known from&#xD;
      research and apply it-using the expertise of experienced clinicians-over the wide range of&#xD;
      patients and presentations seen in real-world clinical practice. The major limitation of the&#xD;
      RAND approach, however, is that it still utilizes a limited definition of appropriateness;&#xD;
      one that relies heavily on safety, efficacy and effectiveness. Until now the RAND method has&#xD;
      not included patient preferences or resource utilization effectiveness. These are both&#xD;
      serious absences. In the past decade we have seen an evolution in outcome measures from&#xD;
      clinician based objective measures to patient-centered and subjective measures. The&#xD;
      development of Patient Based Outcome Assessments (PBOA); Patient Reported Outcomes&#xD;
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and the recent establishment of Patient-Centered&#xD;
      Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) all contest to the growing importance of the patient's&#xD;
      perspective in determining outcomes and therefore also appropriateness. In the Center, we&#xD;
      propose to advance appropriateness methods by adding three additional dimensions to the RAND&#xD;
      appropriateness methods: patient outcomes, patient preferences and cost&#xD;

      The primary objective of this Center of Excellence is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Develop and refine methods for the study of the appropriateness of care in CAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Center of Excellence will have four Projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Project 1: Clinician Based Appropriateness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Project 2: Outcomes Based Appropriateness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Project 3: Patient Preferences Appropriateness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Project 4 : Resource Utilization Based Appropriateness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because much of CAM faces the challenge of limited evidence], and because these methods are&#xD;
      well-established, we will have as our core project&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project 1: Clinician-Based Appropriateness the application of the RAND approach to the&#xD;
      determination of appropriate care for Manipulation/Mobilization (M/M) for chronic .low back&#xD;
      pain (CLBP) and chronic cervical pain (CCP). This approach uses a mixed (CAM and non-CAM)&#xD;
      panel of expert clinicians to interpret syntheses of all available data on safety, efficacy&#xD;
      and effectiveness and clinical experience to apply these data to the question of care&#xD;
      appropriateness for low back and cervical M/M. This approach has been applied successfully to&#xD;
      M/M for low back pain and a literature review and expert panel was previously done for M/M&#xD;
      for cervical manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the core project (Project 1) are to develop a set of ratings of the&#xD;
      appropriateness of M/M for chronic low back and chronic neck pain across various patient&#xD;
      presentations, to be used in the determination of the prevalence of appropriate and&#xD;
      inappropriate care in a national sample of these patients, and to provide feedback to the&#xD;
      research community regarding the patient presentations where substantial uncertainty remains&#xD;
      as to the appropriateness of M/M. We will also, however, in the Resource Utilization project&#xD;
      examine M/M in relationship to other forms of a non-invasive therapy for cervical pain to get&#xD;
      comparative ratings of appropriateness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the Other Center Projects. The other projects in the Center each add to the&#xD;
      RAND-based method in different ways by exploring the broader dimensions of appropriateness&#xD;
      which may be applicable for CAM as well as health care in general. Project 2 (Outcomes Based&#xD;
      Appropriateness) will examine the patient-assessed outcomes which, in part, contribute to the&#xD;
      determination of appropriateness made by patients. Its objectives include developing&#xD;
      CAM-sensitive PROMIS measures for patients using manipulation/mobilization for CLBP and CCP&#xD;
      and to analyze data collected from a national study of chiropractic patients with CLBP and&#xD;
      that can be used to evaluate appropriateness of their care from the patient's perspective.&#xD;
      Given the prevalence of patient self-referral in CAM and the health system-wide focus on&#xD;
      patient-centered care, Project 3 (Patient Preference Appropriateness) will examine how&#xD;
      patient preferences affect what is considered to be appropriate care. Objectives here include&#xD;
      understanding how CLBP and CCP patients decide to use M/M and determining what they believe&#xD;
      is appropriate care. Finally, given the high proportion of out-of-pocket costs in CAM and the&#xD;
      dramatic rise of healthcare costs in general, Project 4 (Resource Utilization Based&#xD;
      Appropriateness) will examine how cost affects both which care is most appropriate and the&#xD;
      appropriate course of care once implemented. Objectives here include providing data on the&#xD;
      relative cost-effectiveness of care options for CLBP and CCP to the Appropriateness Panel&#xD;
      (Project 1) to see if cost data changes their ratings, and analyzing data from our national&#xD;
      sample to begin to understand the characteristics of an appropriate course of care once M/M&#xD;
      is chosen.&#xD;
