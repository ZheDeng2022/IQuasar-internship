  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has 2 phases: Phase 1 (dose escalation) and Phase 2 (dose expansion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Phase 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose&#xD;
      combination of selumetinib and olaparib that can be given to patients who have solid tumors&#xD;
      that are advanced or recurrent (has returned after treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Phase 2 is to learn if the highest tolerable dose combination found in Phase 1&#xD;
      can help to control advanced or recurrent solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the study drug combination will also be studied in both parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Selumetinib is not FDA approved or commercially available.&#xD;
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. Olaparib is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of ovarian cancer that has a certain type of genetic&#xD;
      mutation (change). It is considered investigational to use selumetinib in combination with&#xD;
      olaparib to treat advanced or recurrent cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 90 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a phase&#xD;
      depending on when you join the study. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in Phase 1, and&#xD;
      up to 60 participants will be enrolled in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Phase 1, the dose of the study drugs you receive will depend on when&#xD;
      you join this study. Up to 3 dose level combinations of selumetinib and olaparib will be&#xD;
      tested. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of each study&#xD;
      drugs. Each new group will receive a higher dose of either selumetinib or olaparib study&#xD;
      drugs than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue&#xD;
      until the highest tolerable dose combination of the study drugs is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive the highest study drug combination that was&#xD;
      tolerated in Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take both selumetinib and olaparib by mouth 2 times each day, about 12 hours apart&#xD;
      (1 dose in the morning, 1 dose in the evening). You should fast (have nothing to eat or drink&#xD;
      except water) for at least 2 hours before and 1 hour after your dose. If you vomit or miss a&#xD;
      dose, you should not retake the dose. Wait and take your next scheduled dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the dose level of selumetinib you are receiving, you may only take the study&#xD;
      drug on Days 1-5 of each week. The study doctor will tell you how often you should take&#xD;
      selumetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a study drug diary to record when you take each dose. The study staff will&#xD;
      show you how to fill it out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will wait to take your morning dose of study drugs at the clinic on certain days. The&#xD;
      study staff will remind you before each of these clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to receive the study drugs for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      your best interest. You will no longer be able to receive the study drugs if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your active participation on the study will be over after the 30-day follow-up visit;&#xD;
      however, you will be contacted by phone every 3 months to check on you and the status of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and PD testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Phase 1, part of this sample on Day 1 will be used for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
           (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time&#xD;
           points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Phase 2, part of this sample will be used for tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 15, if you are in Phase 2, you will have a tumor biopsy for PD testing, including&#xD;
           genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and PD tests. If you are in Phase&#xD;
           2, part of this sample will be used for tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 22 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and PD tests. If you are in Phase&#xD;
           2 and have endometrial or ovarian cancer, part of this blood will be used for tumor&#xD;
           marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and PD tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Phase 1, part of this blood will be used for PK testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Phase 2, part of this blood will be used for tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 26 of Cycle 2, you will have an MRI or a CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;

           2, part of this blood will be used for tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day 1 of Cycle 4 and every 3 cycles after that, you will have an ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycles 4 and 6 and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 9, 12, 15, and so on), you&#xD;
      will have MRI or a CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time the study doctor thinks it is needed, you may have some or all of these tests&#xD;
      repeated to check on your health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days after your last dose of study drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and PD tests.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after your last study drug dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be called by a member of the study staff every 3 months to ask how you are doing and&#xD;
      if you have had any side effects. This call should last about 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
