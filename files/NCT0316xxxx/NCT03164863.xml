  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of cancer patients every year receive chemotherapy with only a 20-60% probability of&#xD;
      pathological response, while most experience adverse side effects that lower quality of life&#xD;
      without prolonging it. Reliable identification of ineffective therapies can eliminate&#xD;
      needless human suffering while increasing overall probability of positive response to&#xD;
      treatment. Chemotherapy resistance profiling entails testing whether a patient exhibits&#xD;
      strong resistance to a therapy prior to its final selection by the oncologist. However, there&#xD;
      are no effective methods for quickly assessing patient chemotherapy resistance. Patient&#xD;
      Derived Xenograft (PDX) models have replaced older Chemotherapy Sensitivity and Resistance&#xD;
      Assays (CSRAs) to some degree, but both technologies suffer from long testing times, high&#xD;
      cost, and/or low accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motility Contrast Tomography (MCT) has recently emerged as a technology that measures the&#xD;
      biodynamic response of intact tumor biopsies to applied therapeutics by using Doppler&#xD;
      detection of infrared light scattered from intracellular motions inside living tissue.&#xD;
      Several small scale animal, xenograft, and human studies have shown this phenotypic profiling&#xD;
      technique to be highly accurate in prediction of response and resistance to chemotherapy.&#xD;
      This project will be the first human trial of biodynamic phenotyping to predict chemotherapy&#xD;
      response among breast cancer patients. Specifically, the study cohort will include patients&#xD;
      selected for neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment, because this setting offers the opportunity&#xD;
      for near-term outcome measurement at the time of post-chemo surgery. Pre-therapy fresh tumor&#xD;
      specimens will be imaged using MCT, and the resulting bio-dynamic signatures will be compared&#xD;
      to confirmed pathological response at the time of surgery. Observation of a high predictive&#xD;
      value will provide the basis for expanded clinical trials and prompt commercialization of a&#xD;
      biodynamic chemotherapy selection assay for breast and other cancer patients.&#xD;

      STUDY RATIONALE: The demonstrated ability of MCT to accurately assess tumor xenografts may&#xD;
      establish it as a reliable technique for patient tumor stratification based on predicted&#xD;
      response to therapy, which could enable a treatment selection based on the personal needs of&#xD;
      an individual patient. This study is designed to assess MCT as an assay for predicting&#xD;
      chemosensitivity to treatment with chemotherapy agents routinely used in the neoadjuvant and&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. If positive, the results of this study will provide the&#xD;
      basis for expanded clinical trials and use of MCT in therapy selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: Live cell imaging has become the standard for high-content analysis and drug&#xD;
      discovery applications. The most common assays on live cells include viability, proliferation&#xD;
      and cytotoxicity assays as cellular physiology and function are measured responding to&#xD;
      applied perturbations of xenobiotics. Cellular and tissue viability assays are typically&#xD;
      measured using exogenous vital dyes as biomarkers of membrane integrity or cellular metabolic&#xD;
      activity. However, dyes are invasive, potentially toxic, and often require fixing of the&#xD;
      tissue or permeabilization of the membranes [1, 2]. Furthermore, the common format of high&#xD;
      content analysis and flow cytometry requires isolated cells, or cells distributed on flat&#xD;
      hard surfaces. Isolated cells lack many of the biologically-relevant intercellular&#xD;
      connections and communications that are hallmarks of healthy tissue [3, 4], and flattened&#xD;
      cells on plates have pathological shapes and anisotropic cellular adhesions [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discovery of technology that can predict response to cancer therapy is an urgent priority.&#xD;
      While many technologies exist to evaluate early response to drugs ex vivo, the need to&#xD;
      perform viability, cytotoxicity and proliferation assays in three-dimensional tissue or&#xD;
      culture has become increasingly urgent [6, 7], as drug response in 2D is often not the same&#xD;
      as drug response in biologically-relevant three dimensional culture. This is in part because&#xD;
      genomic profiles are not preserved in monolayer cultures [8-10]. There have been several&#xD;
      studies that have tracked the expression of genes associated with cell survival,&#xD;
      proliferation, differentiation and resistance to therapy that are expressed differently in 2D&#xD;
      cultures relative to three-dimensional culture. For example, cell lines of epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      cancer [11, 12], hepatocellular carcinoma [13-15] or colon cancer [16] display expression&#xD;
      profiles more like those from tumor tissues when measured in three-dimensional culture, but&#xD;
      not when grown in 2D. In addition, the three-dimensional environment of 3D culture presents&#xD;
      different pharmacokinetics than 2D monolayer culture and produce differences in cancer drug&#xD;
      sensitivities [17-20]. Finally, most current technologies rely on destructive end-point&#xD;
      assessment, preventing meaningful longitudinal observation of therapy response over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main challenges to migrating drug-response assays to the third and fourth&#xD;
      dimensions has been to find a means to extract vital information from deep (up to a&#xD;
      millimeter) inside living tissue. Tissue is translucent and light can propagate diffusively&#xD;
      many centimeters. Furthermore, the dynamic motions of living cells cause dynamic light&#xD;
      scattering that produces phase fluctuations on the scattered light fields that can be&#xD;
      measured as dynamic speckle in diffusely reflected light from tissue. This is the basis of&#xD;
      diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) [21, 22] and diffusion correlation spectroscopy (DCS)&#xD;
      [23-26], but these techniques lack depth resolution. A powerful tool in the characterization&#xD;
      of light propagation in tissues is the use of interferometry [27]. Interferometric detection&#xD;
      is the underlying process in optical coherence tomography (OCT) [28-31], which is a&#xD;
      point-scanning technique that suppresses speckle [32-34], although speckle decorrelation in&#xD;
      OCT data can provide similar information as provided by DCS. This has been used to measure&#xD;
      intracellular rheology [35] and to find dynamic signatures of apoptosis [36]. Transport also&#xD;
      can be detected at cellular resolution using phase contrast microscopy [38], but this&#xD;
      approach cannot be used in thick tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Nolte and colleagues have developed volumetrically-resolved tissue dynamic imaging that&#xD;
      uses the advantages of depth selectivity from low-coherence interferometry, combined with&#xD;
      high speckle contrast in broad-illumination digital holography. The technique is called&#xD;
      Motility Contrast Tomography (MCT) and uses low-coherence digital holography to penetrate up&#xD;
      to 1 millimeter into living tissue to measure speckle dynamics from light scattering from&#xD;
      dynamic motion in living cells [37]. It was previously applied as a cytotoxicity assay to&#xD;
      study the efficacy of anti-mitotic drugs [40]. In essence, the technology works by profiling&#xD;
      the 'movement' of cellular organelles. Specific changes in organelle motion are detectable&#xD;
      very early in cells undergoing response to chemotherapy treatment, and may be usable as an&#xD;
      early predictor of chemotherapy response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCT is based on optical coherence imaging (OCI) [38]. OCI is a full-field short-coherence&#xD;
      holography [39] that collects backscattered speckle. With the help of coherence gating, OCI&#xD;
      can optically section tissue up to 1 mm deep. MCT specifically uses intracellular motion as&#xD;
      the endogenous contrast to characterize submicron subcellular motion inside three-dimensional&#xD;
      living tissue [42].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 1 shows the holographic recording principle of MCT. After calibration, the short&#xD;
      coherence light is first divided into an object beam and a reference beam. The object beam&#xD;
      hits the living tissue sample, and backscattered speckles from the tissue are collected by&#xD;
      the lens L1. The living tissue sample locates at the focal plane of the lens L1, so L1 also&#xD;
      performs an optical Fourier transform of the backscattered light. The charge coupled device&#xD;
      (CCD) locates at the other focal plane of L1, so it captures the Fourier transformed&#xD;
      scattering light from the tissue. The reference beam is controlled by a delay stage (not&#xD;
      shown in the figure) to adjust the path length of the reference beam to perform a zero-path&#xD;
      match between the object and reference beams. The beam splitter combines both beams and&#xD;
      because they are zero-path matched, they interfere at the CCD plane. The reference beam is&#xD;
      tilted by 20° in an off-axis configuration, and the spacing of the interference fringes (Λ)&#xD;
      is 3 pixels (24 μm). The speckle size (aspec) is adjusted to be 3 fringes wide (70 μm).&#xD;
      Additional details about the experimental setup can be found in reference [41].&#xD;

      transformed by L1 and interfered with reference beam on the CCD chip. The speckle hologram is&#xD;
      recorded on the Fourier plane with a 20 crossing angel with the reference beam. Examples of&#xD;

&#xD;
      EX VIVO CANCER CHEMOSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MCT was previously applied to study the efficacy of&#xD;
      anti-mitotic drugs using multicellular tumor spheroids [40]. When applying MCT to tumor&#xD;
      xenografts, it is also capable of showing a significantly different response between two cell&#xD;
      lines under cisplatin. After applying the drug, the normalized standard deviation (NSD) value&#xD;
      of the platinum-sensitive cell line (A2780) drops from 0.7 to 0.1 in 8 hours. In contrast,&#xD;
      the NSD value of the platinum-resistant cell line (A2780-CP70) remains nearly constant (0.81&#xD;
      to 0.80) 9 hours after applying drug. The NSD value of normal mouse tissue attached to the&#xD;
      tumor xenograft decreases only a little (0.6 to 0.52) compared with A2780. Fig. 2 shows the&#xD;
      cisplatin drug response curves. The NSD value of each point is averaged over the entire&#xD;
      target. The time between measurements is 24 minutes for A2780-CP70 and normal mouse tissue&#xD;
      and is 12 minutes for A2780. The 20 μM cisplatin was applied at time t = 0, and the&#xD;
      measurements lasted 9 hours for A2780-CP70 and normal mouse tissue, and lasted 8 hours for&#xD;
      A2780. At time=0, the aggressive cell line A2780-CP70 has the highest NSD and the normal&#xD;
      mouse mesenterium tissue has lowest NSD (0.6). The NSD of the platinum-sensitive cell line&#xD;
      A2780 lies in the middle: 0.7. After applying cisplatin, the NSD curve of A2780 drops&#xD;
      immediately. The NSD value of the A2780-CP70 almost doesn't change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fig. 2 Motility metric (NSD) of ovarian cancer tumor xenografts responding to 20 μM&#xD;
      cisplatin. The x-axis is time (minute), the y-axis is NSD value. The sensitive tumor is&#xD;
      A2780, while the insensitive tumor A2780-CP70. Both tumor tissues begin with higher motility&#xD;
      than normal mouse tissue. The cisplatin was added at time t=0. The NSD of A2780 dropped very&#xD;
      fast and after 8 hours it dropped to 0.1. The NSD of the insensitive tumor A2780-CP70 didn't&#xD;
      change during 9 hour peroid. The NSD of normal mouse tissue dropped a little compared with&#xD;
      the A2780.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a further study in a veterinary clinical setting, MCT has been used to predict patient&#xD;
      outcome for canine non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Canine non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are initially&#xD;
      characterized by tumoral infiltration of peripheral lymph nodes. Canine non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphomas are diverse in their clinical aggressiveness and response to chemotherapy. The only&#xD;
      current biomarker for chemoresponsiveness is tumor cell immunophenotype (i.e. T-cell vs.&#xD;
      B-cell origin), but chemoresponsiveness varies tremendously within immunophenotype, which&#xD;
      reduces the clinical utility of this biomarker. In our study, we used MCT to measure the&#xD;
      heterogeneous response of canine lymphoma biopsies to the standard-of-care doxorubicin. The&#xD;
      biodynamic signatures of doxorubicin responsivity ex vivo were correlated with canine patient&#xD;
      outcome. These studies have demonstrated, for the first time, the utility of label-free&#xD;
      intracellular biodynamic markers to predict therapeutic efficacy for cancer treatment in&#xD;
      dogs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS The primary study objective is to examine the feasibility of using MCT as a&#xD;
      chemosensitivity assay among breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy by&#xD;
      comparing MCT patterns consistent with chemotherapy response or resistance ex-vivo to&#xD;
      confirmed response or resistance to chemotherapy as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT: Objective pathological response measured at the time of surgery.&#xD;
