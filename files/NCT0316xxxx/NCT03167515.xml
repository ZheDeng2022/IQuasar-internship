  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of 074-6751&#xD;
      Lotion applied twice daily for four weeks (28 days) in clinical subjects with moderate plaque&#xD;
      psoriasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin diseases that cause swelling like psoriasis can be improved by using products applied to&#xD;
      cover the skin, keeping the skin moist. Keeping the skin moist will ease the local signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, such as skin redness, scaling, and itching in patients with plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
      Researchers are testing 074-6751 Lotion in clinical subjects with moderate plaque psoriasis&#xD;
      to see if it can act as a protective barrier for the skin so the skin remains moist and heals&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      074-6751 Lotion is an investigational device. Eligible clinical subjects will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study and apply 074-6751 Lotion twice daily to all psoriasis plaques in the assigned&#xD;
      Treatment Area for 28 days. Efficacy will be assessed in the Treatment Area by Investigator's&#xD;
      Global Association (IGA) score, clinical signs of psoriasis, pruritus, and percent BSA&#xD;
      affected. Safety will be assessed by adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
