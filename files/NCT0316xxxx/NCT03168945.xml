    <textblock>
      TB kills most people with HIV in Africa. TB is out of control. Radically different approaches&#xD;
      to deal with the disease is therefor needed. It is known that intensified case finding works&#xD;
      in high HIV prevalence environments. However, the poor performance of conventional&#xD;
      diagnostics makes the strategy costly and unpalatable for policy makers. If it can be shown&#xD;
      that a package of new diagnostic technologies significantly enhances ease and speed of&#xD;
      diagnosis, and time to treatment initiation when using intensified case finding, this will&#xD;
      usher the way for further studies and policy adjustments to tackle TB. Thus, the work, if&#xD;
      found to be useful, could have major policy implications&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study will be to determine the diagnostic yield, impact and feasibility&#xD;
      of community-based intensified TB case finding using symptom screening, point-of-care TB&#xD;
      testing (Xpert Omni), point-of-care HIV testing and CD4 count (Alere PIMA), if HIV-infected,&#xD;
      together with a clinic-based diagnostic package (sputum smear microscopy, MGIT sputum&#xD;
      culture, and digital chest radiograph). Additionally, the study will assess the&#xD;
      infectiousness of previously undiagnosed TB cases in the community using cough aerosol&#xD;
      sampling technology (CASS) and will determine the genomic, transcriptomic and lipidomic&#xD;
      profile of TB isolates from patients undergoing CASS sampling. The cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      using a novel TB diagnostic platform (Xpert Omni) for intensified case finding compared to&#xD;
      conventional methods will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ~6000 people will be screened to enrol 600 participants with suspected TB. It is expected&#xD;
      that using the GeneXpert® Omni POC mobile clinic of 2- to 3-person team of healthcare workers&#xD;
      in an inexpensive panel van will substantially reduce the time to treatment initiation, and&#xD;
      the proportion of individuals initiating and completing TB treatment. Investigators will also&#xD;
      review and follow up Household contacts of active TB participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the study investigators will also contribute data and specimens to the RePORT&#xD;
      consortium (Regional Prospective Observational Research for Tuberculosis), that aims to&#xD;
      create a multinational bank with the primary objective of providing specimens and data to&#xD;
      RePORT consortia biomarker researchers and their collaborators over the next decade to&#xD;
      achieve a better understanding of the prognosis of TB disease; and the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      progression from TB exposure to disease.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TB kills most people with HIV in Africa. TB is out of control. Healthcare professionals&#xD;
      therefore need radically different approaches to deal with the disease. It is known that&#xD;
      intensified case finding works in high HIV prevalence environments. However, the poor&#xD;
      performance of conventional diagnostics makes the strategy costly and unpalatable for policy&#xD;
      makers. If it can be shown that a package of new diagnostic technologies significantly&#xD;
      enhances ease and speed of diagnosis, and time to treatment initiation when using intensified&#xD;
      case finding, then this will usher the way for further studies and policy adjustments to&#xD;
      tackle TB. Thus, the work, if found to be useful, could have major policy implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active community-based case finding using a package of diagnostic tools incorporating the new&#xD;
      GeneXpert® Omni will detect untreated highly infectious tuberculosis cases (using cough&#xD;
      aerosol sampling) and will reduce time to treatment initiation of confirmed TB cases and will&#xD;
      increase the proportion of culture-positive TB cases initiating and completing TB treatment,&#xD;
      compared to community based screening using a standard intensive-case finding strategy (smear&#xD;
      microscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A randomised controlled trial will be used to compare the two diagnostic&#xD;
      packages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial several months of the study, because of delays in procuring the newest locked&#xD;
      in version of the Xpert Omni, investigators will use a mobile GeneXpert® 2 module instrument&#xD;
      (and not the GeneXpert® Omni) in the intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will undergo separate training on the GeneXpert Omni platform before&#xD;
      implementation in the main study. To ensure seamless continuation and minimise bias&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a user appraisal and feasibility questionnaire and assessment as&#xD;
      done previously in the Xpert RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      ~6000 people will be screened to enrol 600 participants with suspected TB. Investigators&#xD;
      expect to show that using the GeneXpert® Omni POC mobile clinic of 2 to 3-person team of&#xD;
      healthcare workers in an inexpensive panel van will substantially reduce the time to&#xD;
      treatment initiation, and the proportion of individuals initiating and completing TB&#xD;
      treatment. At present, 50% of the TB caseload remains undiagnosed in the community and these&#xD;
      cases as transmission sentinels that drive the epidemic. GeneXpert® Omni will be a simple and&#xD;
      user-friendly approach to intensive case finding compared to a conventional GeneXpert®&#xD;
      machine. The data accumulated here will also be used to model the likely impact of this&#xD;
      intervention and its cost-effectiveness. These data have substantial implications for active&#xD;
      case finding and public health strategy in TB and HIV endemic countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary studies have indicated that a third of community-diagnosed index cases are&#xD;
      smear-positive. Investigators expect that approximately 25% of participants are CASS positive&#xD;
      and therefore highly infectious. Investigators will also interrogate the contacts of these&#xD;
      index cases. Uniquely, investigators will be able to quantify the duration AND the magnitude&#xD;
      of infectiousness of index cases in the community. Thus, investigators will be able to later&#xD;
      to model the impact of our intervention on disease burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge, the sputum characteristics of index cases who drive&#xD;
      transmission in the community have never been comprehensively characterized. Next generation&#xD;
      WGS will be used to compare the M.tb isolates obtained from passive case finding clinical&#xD;
      cohorts that have already been completed from the same areas. The investigators have the&#xD;
      necessary capability to perform WGS and RNAseq as outlined in our preliminary data. Nile red&#xD;
      staining have already been performed on about 400 TB sputum samples. It is likely that the&#xD;
      investigators will identify specific molecular biomarkers that, in conjunction with&#xD;
      cavitation and HIV status, will predict cases who are more likely to transmit disease. This&#xD;
      will generate preliminary data for a larger study that will aim to generate a bio-clinical&#xD;
      score to identify high transmission risk index cases. The investigators will also determine&#xD;
      levels of hetero-resistance and strain variability in isolates from CASS + participants. This&#xD;
      will provide insights into strain variability, evolution, and transmission dynamics in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RePORT consortium The investigators have also been invited to contribute data and&#xD;
      specimens to the RePORT consortium (Regional Prospective Observational Research for&#xD;
      Tuberculosis), that aims to create a multinational bank with the primary objective of&#xD;
      providing specimens and data to RePORT consortia biomarker researchers and their&#xD;
      collaborators over the next decade to achieve a better understanding of the prognosis of TB&#xD;
      disease; and the pathogenesis of progression from TB exposure to disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study Sites and Population The study will be conducted in Cape Town within high&#xD;
      burden developing communities with high HIV prevalence (15-40%) and at their associated&#xD;
      primary care TB clinics. This study will be conducted in congregate settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure Each day during the week, a research nurse together with a local community&#xD;
      health care worker (CHC) will travel, to the chosen site to perform community based&#xD;
      screening. The vehicle will be equipped with portable awning providing shelter, fold up&#xD;
      tables, HIV lateral flow testing capability, POC CD4 count estimator (PIMA), a small portable&#xD;
      fold-up cubicle for privacy during sputum acquisition, and facilities to securely house and&#xD;
      operate the GeneXpert® Omni machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weekly location for the community-based screening will be mapped out so that the entire&#xD;
      community is adequately covered during the study period but will be clustered around&#xD;
      community congregate settings. Community members will be encouraged to participate using a&#xD;
      loudspeaker and vehicle and community-based advertising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Participants will be counselled and tested for HIV using a rapid diagnostic kit as per&#xD;
      the national guidelines. A positive HIV result will be confirmed by using a second&#xD;
      finger-prick test. Incongruent results will be confirmed by an ELISA blood test. TB screening&#xD;
      will depend on HIV status as outlined in the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The rationale for&#xD;
      including all HIV-positive participants regardless of symptoms is outlined in &quot;Background&quot;&#xD;
      above. Sputum will be collected in portable tents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants undergoing screening will have demographic details, 2 mobile numbers&#xD;
      documented and tested, and if possible their addresses will be GPS-mapped. The team of&#xD;
      research nurse and CHC will aim to screen between 15-20 consenting community members each&#xD;
      morning. Participants found to be either HIV-infected or symptomatic for TB will then undergo&#xD;
      randomised to either standard diagnostic tools (sputum smear and culture) or a package of&#xD;
      novel diagnostic tools (urine LAM strip testing if HIV-infected, sputum MTB/RIF and culture).&#xD;
      An SMS randomisation system will be used. A case record form will be completed for all&#xD;
      participants undergoing randomisation to document relevant demographics, past medical,&#xD;
      occupational and smoking history, TB symptoms and vital signs. Each patient will then be&#xD;
      required to give the following samples at baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) 2 or 3 sputum samples (&gt;1ml each): 2 samples for GeneXpert® Omni MTB/RIF Assay and MTB&#xD;
      culture (arm 1) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 sample for fluorescence smear microscopy and MTB culture (arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 sample for bio-banking 2) 25μl blood for POC CD4 testing (only if HIV positive) 3) A Urine&#xD;
      Sample (15ml) 4) Whole blood for biobanking (10ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants unable to spontaneously produce sufficient sputum will undergo sputum induction&#xD;
      using the standard protocol and infection control. Participants randomized to arm 1 will have&#xD;
      the GeneXpert® assay performed in the van.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest X-rays will be performed on the following participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants with active TB confirmed on GeneXpert, Smear or culture. All asymptomatic&#xD;
      HIV positive participants. All participants with negative TB microscopy (HIV negative or&#xD;
      positive), with ongoing TB symptoms at the 2-month follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-rays taken on asymptomatic HIV-positive participants will not be used to drive referral to&#xD;
      community health centres and/or to advise on empirical treatment, but will be reviewed after&#xD;
      the study is concluded to assess the degree of radiological features of TB in an asymptomatic&#xD;
      cohort of ambulant HIV-positive participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All newly diagnosed TB cases with POC MTB/RIF testing will be giving a letter to commence&#xD;
      immediate TB treatment at the nearest DOTs clinic, and participants receiving smear + culture&#xD;
      will be contacted telephonically or with home visits and given a letter to commence&#xD;
      treatment. TB clinic registers will be visited for all participants commencing anti-TB&#xD;
      treatment to determine patient outcomes and ascertain treatment completion status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with positive diagnostic tests for TB will be recalled for cough aerosol sample&#xD;
      testing (CASS), using a sampling system previously validated. Participants are instructed to&#xD;
      cough into the CASS as frequently and as strongly as they can for 5 min. They are rested for&#xD;
      5 min before a second 5-min period of coughing. The CASS uses an impactor with agar plates&#xD;
      with pores of different sizes to capture droplets in the respirable range. Plates are read at&#xD;
      1 week to detect contaminants, and then at 3 and 6 weeks to count CFU of MTB, which are&#xD;
      confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Culture+ isolates will be biobanked and DNA will be&#xD;
      extracted for WGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this CASS-visit (which will take place prior to the initiation of treatment, but will&#xD;
      not delay treatment commencement), the investigators will aim to collect the following&#xD;
      samples from participants with positive diagnostic tests for TB:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) 1 or 2 Sputum samples (&gt;1ml each):&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 sample for biobanking&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. additional sample for smear (for participants randomised to the GeneXpert arm). 2)&#xD;
           ±35,5ml (±7 teaspoons) of whole blood for the following: Full blood count (3ml) HbA1c&#xD;
           (3ml) Genetic analysis (4ml) PAXGene (2,5ml) PBMC (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell)&#xD;
           isolation and storage (10ml) IGRA (interferon-Gamma release assay) (3ml) Whole blood for&#xD;
           biobanking (10ml) 3) A saliva sample (6ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be sent to the Central Bio-repository as part of the RePORT consortium&#xD;
      collected at the defined timepoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood (PAXgene RNA) Whole blood (IGRA) Whole blood (genetic analyses) PBMC Plasma&#xD;
      Saliva (genetic analyses) Urine Sputum Extracted host RNA Mtb isolate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household contacts of sputum culture-positive participants will be contacted and offered&#xD;
      screening by symptoms, chest X-ray and induced sputum (2 sputum samples for diagnostic&#xD;
      testing if symptomatic or HIV positive, and 1 sample for biobanking), regardless of CASS&#xD;
      status. This will enable quantification of infectivity and allow for modelling how early&#xD;
      detection of TB in the community could potentially affect transmission dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following samples will also be collected at baseline, and will be biobanked with the&#xD;
      sputum, for future studies of latent TB infection in close contacts of infectious&#xD;
      participants: Blood (26ml), Urine (15ml), Saliva (6ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-to-diagnosis and time-to treatment initiation will be recorded for all newly diagnosed&#xD;
      TB cases and these participants will be referred for anti-TB treatment at the clinic. All&#xD;
      smear and/or GeneXpert® negative participants with on-going TB symptoms will be reviewed by&#xD;
      the attending clinic doctor and investigated in a standardized way.&#xD;

          4. Plans to move from his/her current residence, which would interfere with the&#xD;
             participant's ability to complete all study visits (through the 6-Month Post-Treatment&#xD;
             Visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has an active psychiatric condition, or alcohol or drug dependence that, in the&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Is currently imprisoned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for Household contacts (HHC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult (&gt; 18 years old) with significant recent exposure (within the past 6 months) to&#xD;

          4. Agrees to the collection and storage of blood, urine, saliva and sputum specimens for&#xD;
             use for future research. (The participant may decline collection of specimens for&#xD;
             human genetic research and still be eligible for the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for Household contacts&#xD;
&#xD;
