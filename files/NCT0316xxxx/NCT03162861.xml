      History and current related studies Elderly patients after total hip arthroplasty often&#xD;
      experience postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and disorders of brain function, such&#xD;
      as memories, memory storage and concentration, perception and behavioral disorders. POCD is&#xD;
      often transient, can be effectively controlled if measures can be taken timely; otherwise,&#xD;
      POCD can become permanent, which may greatly affect the patient's quality of life. At&#xD;
      present, pathogenesis and therapeutic effect of POCD are not clear in elderly patients&#xD;
      undergoing total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the help of a nerve stimulator, lumbar plexus combined with sciatic nerve block achieves&#xD;
      the precise positioning of the nerve puncture site, and achieves unilateral limb complete&#xD;
      anesthesia. The scope of the block is limited, and it has little influence on circulation.&#xD;
      Lumbar plexus and sacral sciatic nerve block can effectively suppress stress response to&#xD;
      surgery and pain and improve cognitive dysfunction in patients after surgery. Basic&#xD;
      fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been shown to be associated with cognitive function. The&#xD;
      decreased bFGF expression can directly affect the function of nerve cells and cause a&#xD;
      decrease in cognitive ability. Sevoflurane can improve cognitive dysfunction after surgery.&#xD;
      However, whether sevoflurance can reduce the occurrence of POCD after hip arthroplasty has&#xD;
      not been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To record adverse events, including incision pain, waist-dorsal muscle pain, spinal cord&#xD;
           and nerve injury, hypotension, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, and bradycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If severe adverse events occur, investigators will report details including the date of&#xD;
           occurrence and measures taken to treat the adverse events to the principle investigator&#xD;
           and the institutional review board within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, management, analysis, open access&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data collection: Case report forms will be collected, processed using Epidata software&#xD;
           (Epidata Association, Odense, Denmark), collated, and then recorded electronically by&#xD;
           data managers using a double-data entry strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data management: The locked electronic database will be accessible and locked only by&#xD;
           the project manager. This arrangement will not be altered. The Affiliated Hospital of&#xD;
           Qinghai University, China will preserve all of the data regarding this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data analysis: A professional statistician will statistically analyze the electronic&#xD;
           database and will create an outcome analysis report that will be submitted to the lead&#xD;
           researchers. An independent data monitoring committee will supervise and manage the&#xD;
           trial data, ensuring a scientific and stringent trial that yields accurate and complete&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data open access: Anonymized trial data will be published at www.figshare.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS 19.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA)&#xD;
           and will follow the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement data will be normally distributed and expressed as the mean ± standard&#xD;
           deviation. Count data will be expressed as constituent ratio or rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. bFGF expression, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
           Assessment (MoCA) score in both groups will be compared using two-sample t-test. Above&#xD;
           indexes at three time points in the same group will be will be compared using repeated&#xD;
           measures analysis of variance. The incidence of adverse reactions in both groups will be&#xD;
           compared using Pearson X2 test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The correlation between serum bFGF expression and cognitive function will be analyzed&#xD;
           using Pearson correlation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The significance level will be α = 0.05.&#xD;
