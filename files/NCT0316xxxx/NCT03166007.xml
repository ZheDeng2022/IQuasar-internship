      The aim of the AMBER trial is to determine the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of&#xD;
      abdominal massage as part of the adjunct to bowel care in people with Multiple Sclerosis who&#xD;
      have problems with their bowel i.e. faecal incontinence and/or constipation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD: constipation and/or faecal incontinence) is common in&#xD;
      people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is rated as the most severe impact of their&#xD;
      disease/injury, above wheelchair dependence. Despite this, current treatment options are&#xD;
      limited, poorly evaluated and complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to find out whether abdominal massage can help improve the symptoms of NBD&#xD;
      in these patients. A small study has already shown that it is possible for patients or carers&#xD;
      to perform abdominal massage and in some cases this helped the patient with their symptoms. A&#xD;
      larger study is now required to confirm the results one way or another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Multiple Sclerosis who attend one of the participating study centres who are&#xD;
      bothered by constipation and or faecal incontinence will be asked to take part if they fit&#xD;
      the other requirements for the trial. Those who agree to take part will be allocated at&#xD;
      random to one of two groups, one will receive advice on the management of bowel dysfunction&#xD;
      (called optimised bowel care), and the other will receive the same advice and will be taught&#xD;
      how to do the abdominal massage (called abdominal massage and optimised bowel care). Both&#xD;
      groups will visit a specialist nurse for 1 additional hour after their normal clinical&#xD;
      appointment, or at an agreed time, to receive optimised bowel care advice. The patients in&#xD;
      the intervention group +/or their carers will receive training on abdominal massage and a&#xD;
      DVD/copy of demonstration of the massage for home use. All patients will also be called&#xD;
      weekly for 6 weeks to discuss their bowel care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure the results of treatment after 6 and 24 weeks. The&#xD;
      investigators are primarily interested in whether patients in the intervention group&#xD;
      (receiving optimized bowel care &amp; abdominal massage) have had more of an improvement in their&#xD;
      NBD score at 24 weeks after they start the study that the control group (receiving optimized&#xD;
      bowel care only). The investigators also want to find out how bad the constipation and bowel&#xD;
      symptoms are, how much this affects their life and if they have any problems with their&#xD;
      bladder. The investigators will also measure the costs of the treatments and any costs to the&#xD;
      patient and their family, and balance these against any benefits of the intervention&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial the investigators will assess how well the optimized bowel care and&#xD;
      abdominal massage training was delivered by speaking with nurses and listening to recordings&#xD;
      of some of the telephone calls. The investigators will talk to the patients to find how they&#xD;
      perceive the treatment they received and how they got on during the treatment period and once&#xD;
      the treatment finished. The investigators will explore how the treatment delivery and&#xD;
      patient's perceptions impact on the patients NBD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have worked out from previous research that if 200 patients take part and&#xD;
      most complete the trial, there will be enough data to successfully compare the treatments to&#xD;
      find out if one is better than the other. Individual participation will be entirely voluntary&#xD;
      and the investigators do not believe there are any risks associated with taking part.&#xD;

This will include viewing the massage DVD and the abdominal massage training booklet, as well as the demonstration of the technique on the participant by the Intervention Nurse.</description>

    <description>The participant should be supine and in a relaxed atmosphere, though this may depend on level of disability. The massage comprises 4 basic strokes (10minutes); Stroking from the small of the back over the iliac crest and down both sides of the pelvis towards the groin; Effleurage follows the direction of the ascending colon across the transverse colon and down the descending colon. This is repeated several times with increasing pressure; Palmar kneading tracks down the descending colon up the ascending colon and down the descending colon once again. Effleurage is repeated and continued with a relaxing transverse stroke over the abdomen; Vibration over the abdominal wall to relieve flatus concludes the massage session. The participants in this group will receive one telephone call per week for 6 weeks and again at 24 weeks to further discuss their bowel management.</description>
