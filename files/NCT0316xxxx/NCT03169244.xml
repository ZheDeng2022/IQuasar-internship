  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present proposal is an innovative and translational clinical trial derived from exciting&#xD;
      preclinical findings to test the hypothesis that treatment with the melanocortin activator&#xD;
      bupropion can reduce binge drinking in humans. Furthermore, pilot data on moderating effects&#xD;
      of coexisting nicotine use on the efficacy of bupropion for binge drinking population will be&#xD;
      obtained. Evidence for an efficacy signal with good tolerability with this FDA approved&#xD;
      medication would form the foundation to conduct a well-powered Phase II b trial. The&#xD;
      development of an effective pharmacotherapy for binge drinking would be a significant&#xD;
      clinical advance.&#xD;

      The design is a 1:1 random assignment to placebo or bupropion XL (extended release)&#xD;
      (300mg/d). The study biostatistician, will prepare the randomization schedule and include&#xD;
      blocking by gender and nicotine dependence. Randomization will be based on a stratified block&#xD;
      design, with gender and nicotine dependence as the stratification variables with&#xD;
      medication/placebo randomly assigned in blocks of four.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupropion XL will be initiated at 150 mg/d on Days 1-4 and increased to 300 mg/d for Days&#xD;
      5-84. The University of North Carolina (UNC) Hospital's Investigational Drug Services (IDS)&#xD;
      will prepare opaque capsules containing bupropion XL 150/300 mg and matching placebo.&#xD;
      Capsules will be inserted into blister packs with each pack containing 1 week of medication.&#xD;
      The IDS will receive the randomization schedule from our statistician and prepare the blister&#xD;
      packs according to the blocked schedule with blocking for gender/nicotine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment, Telephone Screen, and Full Eligibility Screening: Subjects will initially be&#xD;
      prescreened by phone and then at full screening read and sign the informed consent. A&#xD;
      breathalyzer test will be administered (must be 0.00 gms/dl to give informed consent),&#xD;
      height, weight and BMI recorded and a medical history and examination completed.&#xD;
      Over-the-counter and prescription medication use will be recorded and nicotine use&#xD;
      documented. Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential; serum bilirubin, Aspartate&#xD;
      Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT,)&#xD;
      sodium, potassium, chloride, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose; and urinalysis and&#xD;
      urine toxicology completed. Women will be given a urine pregnancy test (Ub-HCG) at screening&#xD;
      and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Trained interviewers will conduct the psychiatric screening&#xD;
      interview using the M.I.N.I. . The Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) Substance Use&#xD;
      Disorders Module to establish Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V) criteria for alcohol&#xD;
      use disorders will be administered by one of the study doctors. The study coordinator will&#xD;
      conduct the pretreatment 90-day Timeline Followback (TLFB) interview to identify amount of&#xD;
      alcohol consumed and timeframe of consumption. A binge drinking episode requires a minimum of&#xD;
      5/4 (men/women) standard drinks consumed over about a two hour period, i.e. consuming a&#xD;
      bottle of wine over five hours would not be coded as a binge drinking day. The Penn Alcohol&#xD;
      Craving Scale (PACS) and the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA) will be&#xD;
      completed and treatment goal-abstinence vs. reduction- recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Treatment Visit (within 21 days screening): Eligible individuals will not be required&#xD;
      to abstain from drinking alcohol prior to randomization. The study coordinator will&#xD;
      administer a breathalyzer test (BAC must be ≤0.04 gms/d) and complete assessments as outlined&#xD;
      in Table 1, Protection of Human Subjects. A salivary cotinine sample will be taken A 1-week&#xD;
      blister pack of bupropion-XL or placebo with written instructions will be dispensed from the&#xD;
      Investigational Drug Services according to the randomization block along with a 1-week&#xD;
      back-up blister pack in case of delayed appointments or lost doses. Bupropion-XL will be&#xD;
      titrated with 150 mg given daily for 4 days followed by 300 mg/d. Participants will be given&#xD;
      a calendar style diary to track pill taking, drinking quantity/timing, intoxication and any&#xD;
      side effects. Finally, participants will receive Medical Management from a trained clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent Treatment Visits: TLFB and PACS are gathered each visit, cotinine samples at weeks&#xD;
      4, 8 and 12 and URICA at week 8. Medical monitoring will be conducted by study physicians and&#xD;
      will consist of review of vital signs, concomitant medication use, and general inquiries into&#xD;
      side effects. The physician may recommend that medication be held for a period of time to&#xD;
      deal with an adverse event, e.g. nausea. One month and three months following the last visit&#xD;
      subjects will be contacted by phone to update drinking (TLFB), adverse effects and&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Management Intervention: The psychosocial support for the study will be Medical&#xD;
      Management (MM). MM sessions average 10-15 minutes and focus on three main areas: (1)&#xD;
      feedback on consequences of drinking; (2) encouraging compliance with medication/addressing&#xD;
      compliance problems and (3) encouraging progress towards drinking goal- reduction or&#xD;
      abstinence are acceptable. 10% of sessions will be audiotaped and reviewed to enhance&#xD;
      fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Compliance Monitoring: Participants will record their pill taking in&#xD;
      calendar-style diaries that will be provided and collected at each visit. Pills will be&#xD;
      distributed in blister packs that will be returned to the study coordinator to reconcile any&#xD;
      unused medication from the returned blister packs with participants' diary records.&#xD;
