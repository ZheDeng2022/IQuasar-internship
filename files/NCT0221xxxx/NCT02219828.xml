    <textblock>
      Recent findings suggest that recurrent pericarditis (RP) may be a previously unrecognized&#xD;
      autoinflammatory disease. The pivotal pathogenic role of interleukin (IL)-1 in RP has been&#xD;
      shown by the achievement of complete responses after treatment with the recombinant&#xD;
      IL-1-receptor antagonist, anakinra. Anakinra is the recombinant form of IL-1Ra. The proposed&#xD;
      study is designed to demonstarate the efficacy of anakinra in RP.&#xD;

      This is a 8-month, multicenter (3 Italian centers), randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, multicenter, medication-withdrawal study to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      tolerability, and safety of anakinra in adults and children with idiopathic recurrent&#xD;
      pericarditis (RP).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient's written informed consent for ≥ 18 years of age before any assessment is&#xD;
             performed. Parents' or legal guardian's written informed consent and child's assent,&#xD;
             if appropriate, are required before any assessment is performed for patients &lt; 18&#xD;
             years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age &gt; 2 years and &lt;70 years at screening visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Recurrent pericarditis defined as a first episode of acute pericarditis followed by&#xD;
             recurrences (Ann Intern Med. 2011;155:409-14) (at least two recurrences for this&#xD;
             study). First episode of pericarditis is diagnosed when at least two of the following&#xD;
             criteria were present: pericarditic typical chest pain (sharp and pleuritic, improved&#xD;
             by sitting up and leaning forward), pericardial friction rubs, widespread ST segment&#xD;
             elevation or PR depressions not previously reported, and new or worsening pericardial&#xD;
             effusion. Recurrence is diagnosed when chest pain recurs and one or more of the&#xD;
             following signs is present: fever, pericardial friction rub, ECG changes,&#xD;
             echocardiographic evidence of new or worsening pericardial effusion, and elevations in&#xD;
             the white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. To&#xD;
             be enrolled in this study, elevation of C-reactive protein is mandatory both in the&#xD;
             first attack and in the following recurrences. We differentiate recurrences from&#xD;
             incessant pericarditis, term used to define patients with continued activity of&#xD;
             pericarditis (with a symptom-free interval of &lt; 6 weeks) (Soler-Soler J,&#xD;
             Sagristà-Sauleda J, Permanyer-Miralda G. Relapsing pericarditis. Heart.&#xD;
             2004;90:1364-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Specific etiologies excluded, including tuberculous, neoplastic or purulent&#xD;
             etiologies, post-cardiac injury syndromes, and rheumatic autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Records to document the number of prior pericardial recurrences, the time interval&#xD;
             between them as well as prior treatments must be made available from the medical&#xD;
             charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Troponin values during at least one previous attack is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. QuantiFERON (QFT-TB G In-Tube) test or positive Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) test&#xD;
             has been previously made and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients will be enrolled at the time of a recurrent episode (at least the second&#xD;
             recurrence, i.e. third episode) or &quot;relapse&quot; of pericarditis documented by the&#xD;
             following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  recurrent pericardial pain (with a score of least 5 on the 21 circles VAS) AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  increase in CRP≥1 mg/dL (being normal value = 0 - 0.5 mg/dL ), AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  one or more of the following signs: fever (≥ 37°C), pericardial friction rub,&#xD;
                  pertinent ECG changes, echocardiographic evidence of of new or worsening&#xD;
                  pericardial effusion (see definition above)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Continuous treatment with CS, the dose of which must not have been increased in the&#xD;
             three days preceding enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Women of child bearing potentials (WCBP), defined as pre-menarche females aged 8 years&#xD;
             and above or all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, sexually active,&#xD;
             must use an effective form of contraception. Medically approved contraception (i.e.&#xD;
             one that results in a less than 1% per year failure rate when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, and some&#xD;
             intrauterine devices) could include total abstinence. Reliable contraception should be&#xD;
             maintained throughout the study and for 3 months after anakinra discontinuation. Women&#xD;
             are considered post-menopausal and not WCBP if they have had 12 months of natural&#xD;
             (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. appropriate age,&#xD;
             history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH&#xD;
             levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
             hysterectomy) at least six weeks prior to study entry. In the case of oophorectomy&#xD;
             alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up&#xD;
             hormone level assessment she considered a WCBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients fulfilling any of the following criteria are not eligible for enrollment in&#xD;
             this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of&#xD;
                  a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a&#xD;
                  positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. History of being immunocompromised, including a positive HIV at screening (ELISA&#xD;

                  Derivative (PPD) test (≥ 5 mm induration) performed after the first attack of&#xD;
                  pericarditis. Patients with a positive PPD test (≥ 5 mm induration) at screening&#xD;
                  may be enrolled only if they have either a negative chest X-ray or a negative&#xD;
                  QuantiFERON test.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Live vaccinations within three months prior to the start of the trial, during the&#xD;

                  carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless&#xD;
                  of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. History of significant other medical conditions, which in the Investigator's&#xD;
                  opinion would exclude the patient from participating in this trial including&#xD;
                  current pericarditis due to known diseases (e.g. tuberculosis, neoplastic or&#xD;
                  purulent causes, connective tissue diseases, acute rheumatic fever, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. History of recurrent and/or evidence of active bacterial, fungal, or viral&#xD;
                  infection(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. History of Type I hypersensitivity to anakinra.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. History of poor compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Use of any investigational drug (or biologic), or device within five half-lives&#xD;
