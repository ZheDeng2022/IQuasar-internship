        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pathologic or cytologic confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Recurrent, advanced or metastatic NSCLC that had progressed following 1 prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease. Patients could have received prior adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy as long as the disease free interval was longer than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Measurable disease by 1 or more techniques (CT, MRI) according to RECIST criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male or female aged 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Life expectancy of at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Written informed consent that was consistent with International Conference on&#xD;
             Harmonization (ICH) - Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Treatment with an investigational drug in another clinical study within the 28 days&#xD;
             prior to the start of therapy or concomitantly with this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Anti-cancer therapy for NSCLC (except radiotherapy for palliative reasons) within the&#xD;
             28 days prior to Day 1 of treatment period 1 of this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any persisting toxicities that were deemed to be clinically significant from the&#xD;
             previous therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Received more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease (not including&#xD;
             prior adjuvant therapy). Patients could have received prior epidermal growth factor&#xD;
             receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Unwilling or unable to take folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Active brain metastases (stable for &lt;28 days, symptomatic, or requiring concurrent&#xD;
             steroids). Patients who had received prior whole brain irradiation and whose brain&#xD;
             metastases were stable according to the criteria above were not excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Other active malignancy diagnosed within the past 3 years (other than non-melanomatous&#xD;
             skin cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Concomitant intercurrent illnesses including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness or social situation that would have limited&#xD;
             compliance with trial requirement or which were considered relevant for the evaluation&#xD;
             of the efficacy or safety of the trial drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Unable or unwilling to interrupt concomitant administration of NSAIDS 5 days prior to&#xD;
             the day of and up to 2 days after the administration of pemetrexed&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Received prior therapy with pemetrexed&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤1 500/μL, platelet count ≤100 000/μL, or haemoglobin&#xD;
             &lt;9 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 mg/dL (26 μmol/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or&#xD;
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), except in&#xD;
             cases of known liver metastasis where a maximum 5 x ULN was acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Serum creatinine level &gt;1.5 mg/dL and or creatinine clearance &lt;45 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Sexually active and unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Pregnancy or breast feeding&#xD;
