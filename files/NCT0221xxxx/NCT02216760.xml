  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heart beat is controlled by electrical signals. Following a heart attack, part of the&#xD;
      heart muscle dies and is later replaced by scar tissue. Within this area of scar, there often&#xD;
      remain &quot;channels&quot; of surviving tissue still able to transmit electrical signals. However, it&#xD;
      is well established that these &quot;conduction channels&quot; (CC) can form a short circuit around the&#xD;
      scar, leading to electrical disturbances (arrhythmias) that are potentially life threatening.&#xD;
      The commonest of these is ventricular tachycardia (VT), and is estimated to cause 300,000&#xD;
      deaths per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One recognised treatment option of VT involves burning (ablation) these &quot;conduction channels&quot;&#xD;
      (CC) within the scar. However, at present, the procedure is long and is far off 100%&#xD;
      effective. Consequently, current best practice does not rely on treating the VT, but rather&#xD;
      preventing it from causing sudden death - this is achieved with an Implantable Cardioverter&#xD;
      Defibrillator (ICD), a device which can recognise when a patient is in VT and deliver an&#xD;
      internal shock to restore the normal electrical conduction. Patients with defibrillators&#xD;
      subsequently are subject to recurrent painful and debilitating shocks which, although&#xD;
      lifesaving, significantly reduce their quality of life. The limitation with ablation at&#xD;
      present is due to the difficulty in visualising these CC's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators at Imperial College have created a novel electrogram visualisation program,&#xD;
      Ripple Mapping (RM), which they have already found to be superior to currently used&#xD;
      programmes in cases of arrhythmias in the upper chambers of the heart (the atria). During a&#xD;
      retrospective study in patients with scar related VT following a heart attack, when ablation&#xD;
      was delivered in areas associated with identified Ripple Mapping Conduction Channels, these&#xD;
      patients remained free of VT recurrence for &gt;2 year follow up interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that Ripple Mapping can identify all conduction channels within scar&#xD;
      tissue critical to the VT circuit, ablation of which will lead to long-term freedom from VT&#xD;
      and ICD therapies. The investigators now aim to perform a prospective randomised study&#xD;
      comparing Ripple Mapping guided VT ablation against conventional VT ablation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with a previous heart attack, the scar formed in the left ventricle (bottom&#xD;
      chamber of the heart) consists of dead tissue mixed with strands of live tissue which form&#xD;
      &quot;conduction channels&quot; (CC's). These Conduction channels can cause dangerous heart rhythms&#xD;
      such as Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath,&#xD;
      dizziness, blackouts, and, in some, sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at risk of sudden death receive special implanted devices called implantable&#xD;
      cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) and can present with recurrent painful and debilitating ICD&#xD;
      therapies consisting of internal shocks. Patients experiencing frequent ICD shocks due&#xD;
      recurrent VT usually undergo a procedure to burn (ablate) the area of scar within the heart&#xD;
      thought to be the source of the VT. This involves catheters (plastic tubes) inserted into the&#xD;
      heart via the groin vessels allowing the cardiac electrophysiologists to obtain information&#xD;
      about the scar. Scar tissue has low electrical voltage. By measuring the electrical voltage&#xD;
      of the tissue in the heart, areas of scar as well as areas of live, healthy tissue can be&#xD;
      identified and mapped. By burning (ablation) these abnormal channels of live tissue within&#xD;
      scar (conduction channels), this can effectively reduce the episodes of VT a patient&#xD;
      experiences, thereby reducing the frequency of shocks they experience and improve their&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any one patient, more than 1 conduction channel and hence source of VT can be found.&#xD;
      Current mapping technologies are incapable of providing electrophysiologists with the&#xD;
      information that is required to locate all these conduction channels. Therefore ablation&#xD;
      strategies have shifted from ablating in a single location in the scar, to extensive ablation&#xD;
      within the scar in the hope that ALL conduction channels will be burnt. However, this&#xD;
      extensive ablation strategy has no globally agreed consensus with several techniques used&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disadvantage of this extensive ablation strategy is that the potential regions which can&#xD;
      be responsible for VT can be large, requiring extensive ablation and therefore prolonged&#xD;
      procedure times in sick patients who are unable to tolerate such lengthy procedures. In its&#xD;
      current state, VT ablation by any strategy is technically challenging and time consuming with&#xD;
      procedural times as long as 8 hours. In addition, although acute procedural success ranges&#xD;
      from 77% to 95%, recurrence rates remain high - up to 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, identification of ALL conduction channels within scar is a desirable goal for&#xD;
      catheter ablation therapy in VT. Ripple Mapping (RM) is a novel mapping program which allows&#xD;
      simultaneous display of &quot;voltage&quot; and &quot;activation&quot; data of the underlying ventricular tissue.&#xD;
      RM therefore has the potential to display more detailed information of the functional&#xD;
      properties of the underlying scar including any interspersed live tissue channels.&#xD;
      Investigators at Imperial College have demonstrated the proof of concept of RM and validated&#xD;
      the program in a series of abnormal heart rhythms that arise within the upper heart chambers&#xD;
      (the atria) where RM was found to have a superior diagnostic yield as well as aiding the&#xD;
      operator in reaching a diagnosis in shorter time when compared with conventional mapping&#xD;
      systems. The Investigators subsequently performed a retrospective analysis of 21 patients&#xD;
      undergoing post infarct VT ablation. All documented locations with concealed entrainment or&#xD;
      perfect pace matches to the induced or clinical VT coincided with Ripple Mapping Conduction&#xD;
      Channels (RMCC). In patients where ablation lesions overlapped all identified RMCCs, these&#xD;
      patients remained free of VT recurrence for &gt;2 year follow up interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators therefore propose to study the hypothesis that Ripple Mapping can identify&#xD;
      all conduction channels within scar tissue critical to the VT circuit, ablation of which will&#xD;
      lead to long-term freedom from VT and ICD therapies. This will be determined via a&#xD;
      prospective randomised study comparing Ripple Mapping guided VT ablation against conventional&#xD;
      VT ablation.&#xD;
