      Purpose and aims The general aim of this project is to improve the diagnostic methods for&#xD;
      disease activity and identify predictive factors (clinical and radiographic factors, pro- and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory mediators in saliva and plasma) for temporomandibular joint (TMJ)&#xD;
      involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that self-reported pain and impaired jaw function together with clinical&#xD;
      findings correlates well with radiological signs of jaw involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: Self-reported pain, impaired jaw function and clinical findings do not&#xD;
      correlate with radiological signs of jaw involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1 The aim of this study is to investigate which findings from the patient history and&#xD;
      from clinical examination that is of significance for diagnostics of TMJ involvement in&#xD;
      patients with JIA both in a short- and long-term perspective. The patients will be&#xD;
      followed-up during two years. They will undergo a clinical examination according to Research&#xD;
      Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD; Dworkin and LeResche 1992) once&#xD;
      a year and a telephone follow-up sixth months after the clinical examination. Further, the&#xD;
      clinical findings from the orofacial regions will be compared to their general disease&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 The aim of the second study is to correlate radiological findings and clinical&#xD;
      findings in order to investigate any early radiological signs of disease activity and&#xD;
      progression but also to compare the radiographic examination using conventional panoramic&#xD;
      technique with computer tomography (CT).&#xD;

      One-hundred consecutive patients with active JIA, as diagnosed by the Department of Pediatric&#xD;
      Rheumatology, Astrid Lindgrens Barnsjukhus, Karolinska University Hospital will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age between 7 and 14 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a diagnosis of JIA according to the International League of Associations for&#xD;
           rheumatology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  current malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMJ surgery or trauma within two years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recent intra-articular glucocorticoid injection in TMJ (within 1 month)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  other conditions or diseases than JIA that may cause orofacial pain. The parents of the&#xD;
           patients and/or the patients will give their verbal and written informed consent to&#xD;
           participate in the study according to the permission from the regional ethical committee&#xD;
           2011/2:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination and follow-ups The patients will be examined clinically three times with&#xD;
      an interval of 12 months. The clinical examination will be performed according to the RDC-TMD&#xD;
      by calibrated investigators. Panoramic x-ray and CT scans will be performed at the inclusion&#xD;
      examination as well as at the end of the study after 24 months. Pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      will be recorded at every clinical examination and at telephone interviews. The patients will&#xD;
      also be examined by a pediatric rheumatologist regarding general disease activity according&#xD;
      to the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score 27 (JADAS-27), the Short Form (36) Health&#xD;
      Survey (SF-36), thrombocyte particle count, C-reactive protein and blood titer of rheumatoid&#xD;
      factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides. Information from the examination by the&#xD;
      pediatric rheumatologist will be drawn from the Swedish national register for children with&#xD;
      JIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone interview Six months after the first and second visit, a structured telephone&#xD;
      interview with the patients and/or their parents will be performed according to a&#xD;
      questionnaire. The objective is to estimate the degree of joint pain and functional&#xD;
      limitations in jaw function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological examination Conventional panoramic x-rays and bilateral TMJ images will be&#xD;
      obtained with the digital volume tomography (DVT, New Tom Model QR-DVT 9000, New Tom AG,&#xD;
      Marburg, Germany). The CT sections will be evaluated by a specialist in oral radiology for&#xD;
      presence of radiographic signs of cortical and subcortical erosions, flattening, sclerosis&#xD;
      and ramus height.&#xD;
