    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ibrutinib when given together&#xD;
      with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (combination chemotherapy) in treating&#xD;
      patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that has returned after a period of&#xD;
      improvement (relapsed) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Ibrutinib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as, rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ibrutinib together with combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy may be a better treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Safety of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab-ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide&#xD;
      (R-ICE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Establishment of maximum tolerated dose of ibrutinib with R-ICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of ibrutinib in combination with R-ICE. II. Clinical response&#xD;
      rate of ibrutinib+R-ICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, rituximab intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) on day 1, ifosfamide IV on day 3, carboplatin intravenously piggy back (IVPB) on day 3,&#xD;
      and etoposide IVPB on days 2-4. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 52 weeks.&#xD;
