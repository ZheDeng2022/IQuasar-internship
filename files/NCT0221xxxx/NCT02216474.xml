      Brain stimulation in movement disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will explore the effects of very gentle electrical stimulation of the brain in&#xD;
      patients with movement disorders. Other studies have already been carried out and have shown&#xD;
      that brain stimulation may help to improve mental abilities and the symptoms of conditions&#xD;
      such as depression and stroke. The investigators will show whether this method can help with&#xD;
      symptoms such as memory and concentration problems in patients with movement disorder who&#xD;
      have mild to moderate problems with these mental abilities. The investigators will also look&#xD;
      at the effects of brain stimulation on movement symptoms and mood. These people will be&#xD;
      compared to healthy people to help us understand whether brain stimulation works differently&#xD;
      in healthy people and people with brain disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is being carried out at one centre in Birmingham. It is scheduled to begin in&#xD;
      September 2014 and will last for up to five years. As the study commences it is being funded&#xD;
      by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust and University of Birmingham. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to recruit up to a maximum of 200 individuals in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The procedure does not involve any surgery or hair removal. We simply put a small amount of&#xD;
      electrode gel on your head and then hold two electrodes on the top of your head for a short&#xD;
      period of time (15-20 minutes) while they generate a small electrical current. It is quite&#xD;
      common for participants to feel a tingling or an itch near where the electrode is applied,&#xD;
      but if so, this usually wears off within a few minutes. Previous research has shown this&#xD;
      method can occasionally lead to mild side-effects (e.g. headache, nausea, fatigue,&#xD;
      exacerbation of scalp skin conditions). However, there are no known harmful long term&#xD;
      effects. The positive benefits of brain stimulation can include improving the functioning of&#xD;
      the brain for a short while after the stimulation session, in a way that may help with things&#xD;
      like memory problems. Some people may not notice any change, but an improvement may still be&#xD;
      detected using tests of complex mental skills including memory tasks. It is also possible&#xD;
      that mood symptoms (e.g. depressive thoughts) could improve. The study will explore these&#xD;
      possibilities. Looking at whether brain stimulation can help with health symptoms can help us&#xD;
      develop new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will include patients with two different movement disorders: Tourette syndrome and&#xD;
      Huntington's disease. In both of these conditions, changes deep within the brain can have a&#xD;
      knock on effect on higher brain areas important for complex mental abilities, as well as&#xD;
      brain areas involved in movement control. Participants will be male and female adults (aged&#xD;
      18-65). Patients will have either Tourette syndrome (as diagnosed according to current&#xD;
      medical criteria) or Huntington's disease (diagnosed by a genetic test). Patients will have&#xD;
      few (if any) signs of additional medical conditions. Healthy controls (who will be compared&#xD;
      to patients) will have no current significant medical or psychiatric diagnoses, history of&#xD;
      drug use or brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be least two separate appointments for you to attend the study center. We will&#xD;
      first assess your mental abilities (e.g. memory, attention) and interview you about current&#xD;
      mood or medical symptoms. Brain stimulation will be given to slightly different areas of the&#xD;
      outer part of the brain, near the top and front of the head, for each patient group. You may&#xD;
      be asked to take part in the trial where there is a no-treatment placebo condition, where the&#xD;
      procedure will feel similar to real brain stimulation, but real brain stimulation will not&#xD;
      take place. If you receive the placebo condition you will also receive real stimulation, but&#xD;
      you will not know which condition is which. This means the effects of expectations are less&#xD;
      likely to influence the results. After brain stimulation we will take measures of mental&#xD;
      abilities, and compare them to measures taken before brain stimulation, to show whether brain&#xD;
      stimulation has had a greater effect on mental abilities than expected by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be asked to complete a simple task (e.g. remembering numbers) while having the brain&#xD;
      stimulation, as it has been suggested that this could make the effects of stimulation more&#xD;
      effective in improving mental skills. As the trial continues, some participants will be&#xD;
      invited to have repeated sessions of stimulation over a few days (e.g. three appointments&#xD;
      over three days in a row) to look at whether this could make the effects last longer. We will&#xD;
      record the effects of brain stimulation on participant's mental skills, movement symptoms and&#xD;
      mood, as well as any side effects. We will collect data about your symptoms and health&#xD;
      conditions in order to look for relationships between these factors and the effects of brain&#xD;
      stimulation. Finally, you may be asked to have a brain scan straight after receiving brain&#xD;
      stimulation, so we can look for any changes in brain activity.&#xD;
