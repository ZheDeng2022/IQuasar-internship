      This study evaluates the response to oxidative stress in healthy men and women after taking a&#xD;
      blend of plant concentrate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how blends of plant concentrates impacts oxidative&#xD;
      stress in humans. Biomarkers of oxidative stress will be measured at three time points in 3&#xD;
      month intervention. Based on our proof of concept dose response study, it was shown that the&#xD;
      plant concentrate at the proposed dose can lower markers of oxidative damage and induce the&#xD;
      production of antioxidant enzymes. We would like to confirm these findings and further&#xD;
      evaluate the implication of increased antioxidative enzymes as seeing in our proof of concept&#xD;
      study. An acute oxidative stress will be induced by a high glycemic drink and short aerobic&#xD;
      exercise and the response during the induction of an acute oxidative stress as well as the&#xD;
      recovery from an acute oxidative stress. Since the induction of antioxidative enzymes not&#xD;
      only is linked to the protection of proteins and lipids from oxidative damage, it is also&#xD;
      linked to the protection of DNA damage. Therefore, in this study, comet assay will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate the integrity of DNA.&#xD;
