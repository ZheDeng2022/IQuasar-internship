  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumours (NETs) are gaining increasing recognition as a highly&#xD;
      prevalent disease, responsive to a number of therapies, some of which are proven in modern&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials, but many of which still require high quality clinical trial&#xD;
      evidence to confirm their effectiveness and guide their use in practice. This study is the&#xD;
      first prospective trial to evaluate modern combination chemotherapy. The study will determine&#xD;
      whether Carboplatin and Paclitaxel NAB is a suitable combination for comparison in a&#xD;
      subsequent randomised controlled phase III international trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the paucity of randomized studies in NETs, there are no clear evidence based&#xD;
      guidelines. Patients are treated according to guidelines established for small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer, incorporating platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) based doublet treatment with&#xD;
      etoposide. Although these tumors are initially highly chemosensitive, the natural history of&#xD;
      this disease is such that relapses occur early, which ultimately leads to a very poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Almost all clinical trials investigating cytotoxic chemotherapy in NETs are small&#xD;
      single arm studies and guidelines are derived from expert opinion and from extrapolating&#xD;
      results from small cell lung cancer studies. Prospective clinical trials in this group of&#xD;
      patients needs to be conducted to establish an evidence based standard of care and to improve&#xD;
      the prognosis of this highly aggressive group of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive albumin bound paclitaxel (ABRAXANE®) 100 mg/m2 administered as an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21 day cycle. Carboplatin&#xD;
      will be given at an Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 5 mg/min/mL on Day 1 only of each 21 day&#xD;
      cycle administered over 30 mins, beginning immediately after the completion of albumin bound&#xD;
      paclitaxel administration. Participants can continue treatment at the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion until disease progression, development of an unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent.&#xD;

      Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumours (NETs) are gaining increasing international&#xD;
      recognition as a highly prevalent disease, responsive to a number of therapies, some of which&#xD;
      are proven, but many of which still require high quality clinical trial evidence to confirm&#xD;
      their effectiveness and guide their use in practice. This study is the first prospective&#xD;
      trial to evaluate modern combination chemotherapy. Given the paucity of randomized studies in&#xD;
      neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), there are no clear evidence based guidelines. Patients are&#xD;
      treated according to guidelines established for small cell lung cancer. Although these tumors&#xD;
      are initially highly chemosensitive, the natural history of this disease is such that&#xD;
      relapses occur early, which ultimately leads to a very poor prognosis. Prospective clinical&#xD;
      trials in this group of patients needs to be conducted to establish an evidence based&#xD;
      standard of care and to improve prognosis. NETs are a heterogeneous group of malignancies&#xD;
      originating from cells of the neural. They have a variable and often long natural history.&#xD;
      They commonly arise from the gastrointestinal tract (58%), pancreas or lung (27%), and low&#xD;
      grade NETs can be associated with symptoms resulting from the secretion of hormones or&#xD;
      vasoactive peptides. NETs used to be thought of as rare but recently have been shown to be&#xD;
      more common with rising incidence rates (3.3/100,000 in Australia 2000-2006). Prevalence&#xD;
      (35/100, 000) is much higher than incidence resulting from five year survivorship of ~ 60%&#xD;
      resulting in NETs being more prevalent than either gastric, pancreatic, oesophageal or&#xD;
      hepatobiliary adenocarcinomas, or any 2 of these cancers combined. They can present multiple&#xD;
      complex clinical challenges, thereby significantly contributing to cancer related morbidity&#xD;
      and health costs in the Australian population. More recently, international interest groups&#xD;
      such as the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society have identified the need to establish a&#xD;
      framework promoting opportunities for research and ensuring that the available evidence is&#xD;
      incorporated into clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost all clinical trials investigating cytotoxic chemotherapy in NECs are small single arm&#xD;
      studies with guidelines derived from expert opinion and from extrapolating results from small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer studies. Most guidelines recommend the combination of a platinum compound&#xD;
      with etoposide. This combination is an established standard of care for small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer, another tumour with neuroendocrine differentiation. However, the data are less clear&#xD;
      for non-pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) and NECs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is striking that almost all published NEC chemotherapy studies are non randomized and&#xD;
      include relatively small numbers of patients often with heterogeneous pathology. Although&#xD;
      there are no prospective studies with carboplatin and etoposide for NECs, it is remarkable&#xD;
      that it is widely accepted as the standard chemotherapy for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase 2 multi-center trial evaluating the efficacy of chemotherapy with paclitaxel,&#xD;
      carboplatin and etoposide in advanced poorly differentiated NECs showed after 4 cycles of&#xD;
      this combination treatment, patients who achieved an objective response or stable disease&#xD;
      went on to have 24 weeks of weekly paclitaxel as maintenance treatment. Of the 78 patients&#xD;
      treated, 15% had a complete response and the overall response rate was 53%. Five patients&#xD;
      remained disease free from 18 to 66 months after therapy. The median survival was 14.5&#xD;
      months. However, the authors concluded that the 3 drug combination was moderately toxic and&#xD;
      had no obvious efficacy advantage over the standard platinum/etoposide regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This year (2013 ASCO) in an abstract a single European centre reported relative responses up&#xD;
      to 50% in a retrospective series of NECs using 3 weekly paclitaxel, carboplatin and&#xD;
      etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAB paclitaxel is suggested to achieve a higher intracellular tumour paclitaxel concentration&#xD;
      via the albumin mediated transendothelial transport system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABRAXANE®) 100 mg/m2 administered as an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. Carboplatin&#xD;
      will be given at an Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 5 mg/min/mL on Day 1 only of each 21-day&#xD;
      cycle administered over 30 mins, beginning immediately after the completion of albumin-bound&#xD;
      paclitaxel administration. Participants can continue treatment at the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion until disease progression, development of an unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent.&#xD;
