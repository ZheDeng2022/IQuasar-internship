  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spatial orientation is achieved through central integration of various sensory inputs and&#xD;
      prior knowledge in a statistically optimal way based on the reliability of the different&#xD;
      signals. When upright, the subjective visual vertical (SVV) is accurate and precise in&#xD;
      healthy human subjects. However, when roll-tilted, both systematic physiologic, roll-angle&#xD;
      dependent errors (termed A- und E-effect) and a decrease in precision of SVV estimates have&#xD;
      been described. In case of a sudden unilateral vestibular deficit (UVD) a significant&#xD;
      imbalance between the two vestibular organs occurs at the level of the vestibular nuclei,&#xD;
      disrupting the percept of vertical. The most frequent cause for such a unilateral vestibular&#xD;
      deficit is an inflammation of the vestibular nerve by viral infection, termed vestibular&#xD;
      neuritis (VN). While in the acute stage these patients are usually immobilized due to the&#xD;
      severity of symptoms, recovery is overall good and most patients return to their daily&#xD;
      activities within a few weeks. Central compensation is considered the most important&#xD;
      contributor to recovery in these patients, while recovery of the damaged vestibular nerve&#xD;
      occurs only in a minority of cases. While acute VN presents with sudden UVD, bilateral&#xD;
      vestibular deficits (BVD) typically evolve more slowly and re-sult in distinct complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percept of vertical can be quantified by assessing the subjective visual vertical or SVV,&#xD;
      which is usually done by letting subjects adjust a luminous line along perceived direction of&#xD;
      gravity. Modifications of this paradigm which are independent from retinal input are e.g.&#xD;
      adjustments of a rod along perceived vertical in complete darkness (termed subjective haptic&#xD;
      vertical or SHV) and self-alignments along perceived vertical (subjective postural vertical&#xD;
      or SPV) and perceived horizontal (subjective postural horizontal or SPH) in complete&#xD;
      darkness. Previous research has proposed no unified percept of vertical as errors assessed in&#xD;
      different domains (visual, haptic, postural) were diverging in patients with acute UVD. While&#xD;
      errors were profound for the SVV, the SPV remained accurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators aim to quantify verticality perception in patients with either acute&#xD;
      or chronic UVD and patients with BVD both in upright and roll-tilted positions. Specifically,&#xD;
      the investigators will use different paradigms to address the ques-tion whether there is a&#xD;
      unified percept of vertical and how a bias in this percept changes over time.&#xD;

    <description>The accuracy of verticality perception is defined as the individual median value of a series of line adjustments along perceived direction of gravity (units: degrees). this results in a report of the participants perceived direction of gravity relative to true earth-vertical. Repetitive adjustments will be collected while on the turntable, each adjustment lasting up to 15seconds.</description>

    <description>The precision of verticality perception is defined as the individual median absolute deviation of single line adjustments along perceived direction of vertical (units: degrees). Repetitive adjustments will be collected while on the turntable, each adjustment lasting up to 15seconds. The resulting value reflects the amount of trial-to-trial variability in a given subject, which is inverse correlated to the precision.</description>
