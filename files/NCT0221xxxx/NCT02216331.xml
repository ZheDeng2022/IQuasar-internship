  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label study, 2-treatment, 2-period, single sequence design. Period 1 will&#xD;
      examine the pharmacokinetics of TMC207 in the absence of rifapentine or rifampicin. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive a single 400-mg dose of TMC207 administered alone on Study Day 1. Period 2 will&#xD;
      examine the effects of repeated doses of either rifapentine or rifampicin on TMC207&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and will begin on Study Day 20. During Period 2, subjects will receive 22&#xD;
      daily doses of either 600 mg rifapentine or rifampicin from Study Day 20 through Study Day&#xD;
      41. A single 400-mg dose of TMC207 will be administered on Study Day 29. Subjects will be&#xD;
      confined to the clinic from Study Day-1 to Study Day 2 in the morning of Period 1, and Study&#xD;
      Day 19 to Study Day 30 in the morning of Period 2. The study hypothesis is to determine&#xD;
      whether Rifapentine affects the pharmacokinetics of TMC207 as measured by effects on Cmax and&#xD;
      AUC(0-t) to a lesser degree than rifampicin.&#xD;
