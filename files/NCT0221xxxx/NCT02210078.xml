    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well donor cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes&#xD;
      work in treating patients with a cytomegalovirus infection that has come back or has not&#xD;
      gotten better despite standard therapy. White blood cells from donors who have been exposed&#xD;
      to cytomegalovirus may be effective in treating patients with a cytomegalovirus infection.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy, feasibility and safety of administering most closely human&#xD;
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes&#xD;
      (HMC-CTLs) generated by &quot;gamma-catch&quot; to mediate antiviral activity in hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients with CMV infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the persistency of the administered HMC-CTLs generated by &quot;gamma-catch&quot; and&#xD;
      their contribution immune reconstitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive allogeneic cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes intravenously&#xD;
      (IV). Patients with partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease may receive an&#xD;
      additional dose of allogeneic cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes at a minimum&#xD;
      of 2 weeks from the first infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 12 months.&#xD;
