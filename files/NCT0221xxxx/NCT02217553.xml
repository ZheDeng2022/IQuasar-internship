  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelets play pivotal role in atherosclerosis and acute cardiovascular events. Platelet&#xD;
      hyperreactivity and increase platelet-monocyte aggregate (PMA) formation are found in HIV&#xD;
      infected patients, which may contribute to the excess cardiovascular risk. Low level of&#xD;
      vitamin D has been associated with the presence of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of our&#xD;
      study is to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on platelet activation,&#xD;
      platelet reactivity and platelet-leukocyte complex formation in asymptomatic HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients treated with ART&#xD;

      1. Study design A prospective intervention study. HIV-infected patients using ART and who&#xD;
           come for follow-up at the Teratai HIV clinic will be asked to participate in the study.&#xD;
           All study participants will receive vitamin D supplementation (soft gel capsule&#xD;
           containing cholecalciferol 400 IU) to be consumed 2 soft gel capsules daily for three&#xD;
           consecutive months. The effect on the platelet parameters specified above will be&#xD;
           determined before start cholecalciferol supplementation and after three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of study Usually, 150 HIV-infected patients are treated with ART every week at&#xD;
           the Teratai HIV clinic of the Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung Indonesia. Between half&#xD;
           January 2014 and end of February 2014, 50 patients will be enrolled in this study. We&#xD;
           hypothesize that this period is long enough to include 50 patients for the present&#xD;
           study. Supplementation will take place between March and May and analysis will be done&#xD;
           in June and July. A summary of duration of study is depicted in the study timeline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study population The study population consists of adult HIV-infected patients treated&#xD;
           with ART enrolled at HIV polyclinic at Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung,&#xD;
           Indonesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sample size calculation Our sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome,&#xD;
           which is the area under the curve (AUC) of the platelet reactivity curve with P-selectin&#xD;
           (CD62P) as platelet activation marker and ADP as platelet agonist. In a cohort of Dutch&#xD;
           HIV-infected patients we found a mean AUC of 2500 with an SD of 660. Assuming that a&#xD;
           decrease in AUC of 2500 to 2100 upon supplementation of vitamin D is clinically&#xD;
           relevant, a sample size of 23 would be sufficient using a paired design with α 0.05 and&#xD;
           a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Methods Study parameters/endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are two study parameters applied in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Platelet reactivity, expressed as the membrane expression of the platelet&#xD;
                activation markers CD62P (P-selectin) and fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbβ3, to&#xD;
                stimulation with increasing concentration of platelet agonists ADP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Platelet-monocyte complexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Enrolment of patients During a scheduled routine polyclinic visit, the treating&#xD;
           internist will identify patients fulfilling inclusion criteria. He/she will explain the&#xD;
           background and objectives of the study to the patient. In case patients opt to&#xD;
           participate, the patient will then be asked to read and undersign the informed consent&#xD;
           form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Venous blood (three tubes of 3 mL each) will then drawn for study purpose at enrolment&#xD;
           and after three months supplementation for:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (3 ml serum)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Platelet assays as specified above (3 ml CTAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Full blood count and CD4 cells (3 ml EDTA) In many instances, this will not require&#xD;
                an extra venepuncture as blood is usually collected for planned blood analysis for&#xD;
                routine clinical care during regular polyclinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurements and analysis consist of 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, platelet reactivity, and&#xD;
           platelet-monocyte complexes will be done when the patients participate in the study. The&#xD;
           study participants will receive 180 soft gel cholecalciferol capsules, to be taken 2&#xD;
           capsules once a day for 90 days as stated above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As stated above, the second blood analysis will take place three months later after&#xD;
           vitamin D supplementation is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Collection of blood samples for vitamin D level analysis As much as 3mL additional&#xD;
           blood is withdrawn while applying venepuncture for routine CD4+ measurement. Collected&#xD;
           blood is stored using red top serum tube without anticoagulant. This will take place at&#xD;
           enrolment (day 0) and after 3 months vitamin D supplementation. Each day of blood&#xD;
           withdrawal, the collected tubes are stored temporarily in wet-iced box prior transfer to&#xD;
           laboratory for vitamin D analysis. At the end of the policlinic day, all tubes are&#xD;
           transferred to the laboratory for serum separation. Then, separated serum is stored so&#xD;
           25-hydroxyvitamin D measurements can be done later. All samples are analysed for&#xD;
           25-hydroxyvitamin D measurements as well as other vitamin D metabolites such as free&#xD;
           25-hydroxyvitamin D measurements. Such analysis can not be done in Indonesia and&#xD;
           therefore samples will be shipped to the Netherlands for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. Collection of blood samples for platelet function analysis As specified under study&#xD;
           parameters above, platelet function analysis can be performed from one 3mL&#xD;
           citrate-anticoagulated blood tube. This will take place at enrolment (day 0) and after 3&#xD;
           months vitamin D supplementation. Each withdrawn blood from the patient, the tube is&#xD;
           directly transferred to the laboratory for platelet function within 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d. Full blood count and CD4 cell measurements These measurements are part of routine&#xD;
           care and will be done in the routine haematological laboratory using 3 ml EDTA blood.&#xD;
