             menstrual cycles of 21-35 days in length and resumption of at least one cycle with a&#xD;
             cycle length consistent with her past cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with the protocol, e.g. live within&#xD;
             the study site catchment area or within a reasonable distance from the study site&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Willing to use a non-hormonal method of contraception for one month prior to the&#xD;
             initial insertion of the NES/EE CVR and the one month washout period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to abstain from sexual intercourse during the miconazole nitrate treatment&#xD;
             period(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent prior to entry into the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             screening with a Chlamydia or gonococcus infection may be included in the trial&#xD;
             following treatment; partner treatment is also recommended. Investigators should make&#xD;
             a determination if subjects are at high risk for reinfection, e.g., multiple sex&#xD;
             partners, untreated partner, and whether such subjects can be included&#xD;
