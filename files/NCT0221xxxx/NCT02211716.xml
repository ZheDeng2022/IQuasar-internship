      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate, in a controlled setting, the&#xD;
      long-term (up to 12 months) safety and efficacy of the BeGraft Peripheral Stent Graft System&#xD;
      (Bentley InnoMed) in clincial settings post CE-certification when used according to the&#xD;
      indications of the IFU.&#xD;

      Endovascular techniques are well accepted in the treatment of iliac occlusive disease. It is&#xD;
      shown that in the iliac artery especially stenoses and short occlusions respond well to&#xD;
      percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with our without stenting. Although hard data are&#xD;
      lacking, with the technical developments and the introduction of new stent types, more&#xD;
      complex lesions have been treated with endovascular procedures. Although stents are often&#xD;
      used to improve the outcome of PTA, there is no general consensus whether stenting is&#xD;
      mandatory for chronic iliac arterial occlusion. The more, if we use stents, it is still&#xD;
      unclear if we should implant bare self-expandable stents, bare balloon-expandable stents or&#xD;
      covered stents. On one hand, the randomized controlled Dutch Iliac Stenting trial failed in&#xD;
      demonstrating superiority of primary stenting over PTA with additional stenting in short&#xD;
      lesions. On the other hand, while several papers advocate bare stenting, other trials&#xD;
      conclude better results with covered stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) working group has published in 2000 their&#xD;
      recommendations for the management of peripheral arterial disease. In order to better reflect&#xD;
      the developments in technology and techniques, the TASC working group has revised and updated&#xD;
      their recommendations in the TASC-II document in 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment recommendations between surgical or percutaneous intervention they propose&#xD;
      involve all peripheral arterial beds and are based upon several factors such as availability&#xD;
      of expertise in the percutaneous or conventional vascular surgical techniques, the patient's&#xD;
      preference and most importantly on the lesion's morphology. TASC classifies all lesions in&#xD;
      the different beds into types A to D. In general, endovascular therapy is the treatment of&#xD;
      choice for TASC A &amp; B-lesions and surgery is preferred for good-risk patients with TASC C&#xD;
      lesions and all TASC D lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For aorto-iliac lesions, the TASC-II classification is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type A lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unilateral or bilateral stenoses of the Common Iliac Artery (CIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Unilateral or bilateral single short (≤3 cm) stenosis of the External Iliac Artery&#xD;
           (EIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type B lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Short (≤3 cm) stenosis of infrarenal aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Unilateral CIA occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Single or multiple stenosis totaling 3-10 cm involving the EIA not extending into the&#xD;
           Common Femoral Artery (CFA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unilateral EIA occlusion not involving the origins of Internal Iliac Artery (IIA) or CFA&#xD;
           Type C lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Bilateral CIA occlusions 2. Bilateral EIA stenoses 3-10 cm long not extending into the CFA&#xD;
      3. Unilateral EIA stenosis extending into the CFA 4. Unilateral EIA occlusion that involves&#xD;
      the origins of IIA and/or CFA 5. Heavily calcified unilateral EIA occlusion with or without&#xD;
      involvement of origins of IIA and/or CFA Type D lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Infra-renal aortoiliac occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diffuse disease involving the aorta and both iliac arteries requiring treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diffuse multiple stenoses involving the unilateral CIA, EIA and CFA&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unilateral occlusions of both CIA and EIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Bilateral occlusions of EIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Iliac stenoses in patients with an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) requiring treatment&#xD;
           and not amenable to endograft placement or other lesions requiring open aortic or iliac&#xD;
           surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TASC working group has based their recommendations on the literature available to date&#xD;
      and are generally considered as the guidelines to be followed. Nevertheless it should be&#xD;
      stated that it is feasible to treat with good technical success and sustained durability TASC&#xD;
      type C and D lesions in an endovascular way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent publications finally start to show the excellent durability of iliac stenting in the&#xD;
      daily practice. Park et al, described their long term (up to 10 years) experience in their&#xD;
      total cohort of iliac patients (TASC type A-D lesions) and presented impressive primary&#xD;
      patency rates of 87%, 83%, 61% and 49% at respectively 3, 5, 7 and 10 years after the index&#xD;
      intervention. De Roeck et al. published their results after stenting of different types of&#xD;
      iliac occlusions (TASC type B-D), and showed primary patency rates of 94%, 89% and 77% after&#xD;
      respectively 1, 3 and 5 years follow up. They could also show that in their cohort of&#xD;
      patients with complex aorto-iliac lesions, stent-failures can always be endovascularly&#xD;
      rescued. They showed secondary patency rates of 100% after 1 year and 94% after both 3 and 5&#xD;
      years. Bosiers et al. concluded in their BRAVISSIMO trial primary patency rates at 12 months&#xD;
      for the TASC A, B, C and D lesions of respectively 94.0%, 96.5%, 91.3% and 90.2%. Leville et&#xD;
      al. questioned after the presentation of their outcome with stenting iliac occlusion (primary&#xD;
      patency rate of 76% and secondary patency rate of 90% after 3 years), whether the&#xD;
      endovascular treatment for iliac occlusive disease should be extended to Type C and D&#xD;
      lesions. Leville came to this conclusion as they could not detect any significant differences&#xD;
      in outcome for both primary and secondary patency rates stratifying for the TASC&#xD;
      classifications. They summarized the treatment of iliac artery occlusion can be accomplished&#xD;
      via endovascular means with little morbidity and acceptable patency rates. The COBEST trial&#xD;
      demonstrates that covered and bare-metal stents produce similar and acceptable results for&#xD;
      TASC B lesions. However, covered stents perform better for TASC C and D lesions than bare&#xD;
      stents in longer-term patency and clinical outcome. Sabri et al. concluded that the use of&#xD;
      covered balloon-expandable kissing stents for atherosclerotic aortic bifurcation occlusive&#xD;
      disease provides superior patency at 2 years as compared with bare metal balloon-expandable&#xD;
      stents. Bosiers et al. experienced that the implantation of the Advanta V12 PTFE-covered&#xD;
      stent for iliac occlusive disease shows to be safe and feasible with excellent clinical&#xD;
      results at 1 year in the investigated patient cohort. The TASC stratification is an important&#xD;
      tool in allowing us to assess the extent of lesion morphology, but extensive lesions do not&#xD;
      preclude successful endovascular treatment. They continued that the fate of the limb is&#xD;
      dictated by the infrainguinal disease that is often present in patients with complex iliac&#xD;
      occlusions and therefore believe that endovascular attempts should be exhausted before&#xD;
      attempting open surgical repair of iliac occlusions because of the decreased perioperative&#xD;
      morbidity and good mid-term durability.&#xD;
