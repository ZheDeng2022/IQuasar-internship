  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia in patients with cancer is a common problem associated with an impaired quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) allows an increase in hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels in 40-70% of patients and decreased transfusion requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute or functional iron deficiency is also common with about 30% of cancer patients with&#xD;
      all histologies combined iron deficiency and anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown the benefits of the combination of intravenous iron to&#xD;
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in improving hemoglobin. However, none of them, to the&#xD;
      investigators knowledge, has not been specifically performed on a population of patients with&#xD;
      functional iron deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in clinical practice, this association is not carried out in particular because&#xD;
      there is no dosage or consensus sequence for the administration of iron associated with ESAs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      - Iron Deficiency and Cancer The literature review therefore presents uncertainties do not&#xD;
      allow the routine application of intravenous iron associated with ESAs. The SOR also conclude&#xD;
      that IV iron is &quot;consider&quot; if iron deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These uncertainties are the heterogeneity of the study populations, contradictory results and&#xD;
      the use of patterns intravenous iron binding and non-standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators focus in this study in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia with&#xD;
      functional iron deficiency is a cause of lack of response to ESA. Indeed, patients with true&#xD;
      iron deficiency seems to justify a routine iron supplementation. In contrast, patients&#xD;
      without iron deficiency do not warrant formal way of initiating such treatment (although the&#xD;
      literature is contradictory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate, in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia and functional iron&#xD;
      deficiency, the efficacy and safety of the combination epoietin zeta + Iron in concomitant&#xD;
      intravenous or sequential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because data RCP (Summary of Product Characteristics), ease of use, its safety profile, the&#xD;
      ability to achieve higher doses of iron with a lower frequency and with better adherence, the&#xD;
      ferric carboxymaltose was chosen as an intravenous iron. One specialty is available, the&#xD;
      Ferinject ® (Laboratoires VIFOR Pharma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The erythropoiesis-stimulating agent chosen in this study is epoietin zeta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hepcidin and iron Hepcidin is a peptide hormone of 25 amino acids produced by the liver and&#xD;
      considered as the central regulator of iron homeostasis in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It works by controlling intestinal iron absorption and iron reuse by the reticuloendothelial&#xD;
      system. Hepcidin acts by preventing the export of iron enterocytes, intestinal site of&#xD;
      absorption of dietary iron, and macrophages, iron recycling site of hemoglobin, by binding to&#xD;
      ferroportin present at the membrane these cells and by inducing its internalization and&#xD;
      degradation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, hepcidin can be considered a hyposidérémiante hormone. The hepcidin rate is&#xD;
      increased by the iron thereby limiting its accumulation and tissue damage associated with&#xD;
      iron overload. Inversely, the rate is reduced hepcidin during increased iron as anemia needs,&#xD;
      hypoxia, pregnancy or other situations of iron deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, hepcidin is strongly induced by inflammation. Thus, in pathological situations such&#xD;
      as cancer, high levels of hepcidin explain well enough inflammatory anemia characterized by&#xD;
      anemia, iron retention at storage proteins such as ferritin but also at the level of the&#xD;
      reticuloendothelial system endothelial and a decrease in intestinal iron absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its importance in the pathophysiology of anemia of inflammation and a fortiori with&#xD;
      iron deficiency anemia functional hepcidin is not measured in clinical routine. There is not,&#xD;
      to the investigators knowledge, prospective data on its blood levels in situations of iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia in cancer patients functional and data on changes in hepcidin levels&#xD;
      induced by treatment with intravenous iron or with erythropoietin.&#xD;
