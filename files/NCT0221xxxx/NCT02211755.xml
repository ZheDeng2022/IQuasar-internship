      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers want to develop better ways to treat cancer. In this study, they will give&#xD;
      people with cancer two drugs. These drugs have been used on their own to treat some blood&#xD;
      cell cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and efficacy of the drug combination of bortezomib and clofarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults age 18 and over with advanced cancer that has progressed after receiving standard&#xD;
      treatment or that has no effective therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and scans to measure&#xD;
           their tumors. They will also have heart, blood, and urine tests. All of these may be&#xD;
           done by their regular doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get the study drugs in 21-day cyles. They will stay at the clinic for&#xD;
           week 1 of every cycle, then have 2 weeks off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Bortezomib will be injected under the skin on days 1 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Clofarabine will be injected in a vein for days 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During cycle 1 only, participants will go to the clinic or their doctor to have a&#xD;
           physical exam and blood tests at the start of the second and third week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have clinical evaluations throughout the study, including before&#xD;
           receiving treatment and then before the start of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may stay in the study as long as they are tolerating the drugs and their&#xD;
           tumor is not getting worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have follow-up for 30 days after the last dose of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first part of this study tests the safety of different doses of clofarabine and&#xD;
           bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second part of this study involves a separate group of participants who will undergo&#xD;
           mandatory research biopsies to learn more about the effects of clofarabine and&#xD;
           bortezomib on cancer cells.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and purine nucleoside metabolic inhibitor clofarabine&#xD;
      demonstrated greater than additive activity in combination in preclinical xenograft models,&#xD;
      justifying the clinical evaluation of this combination for its antitumor activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib&#xD;
           and clofarabine in patients with refractory solid tumors, lymphomas, or myelodysplastic&#xD;
           syndromes (MDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the molecular effects of the clofarabine-bortezomib combination on&#xD;
           biomarkers of cell death and DNA damage in tumor biopsy tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the mechanism of action of the bortezomib and clofarabine combination by&#xD;
&#xD;
      examining markers of DNA damage and apoptosis in tumor cells before and after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To characterize the changes in MDS residual disease burden that occur with bortezomib&#xD;
&#xD;
      and clofarabine treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants must have histologically confirmed solid tumors or lymphomas or&#xD;
           myelodysplastic syndromes that have progressed on standard therapy known to prolong&#xD;
           survival or for which no standard treatment options exist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open-label Phase I trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The starting dose of clofarabine will be 1 mg/m2 administered intravenously on days 1&#xD;
           through 5 of a 21-day cycle; bortezomib will be administered at 0.8 mg/m2 subcutaneously&#xD;
           on days 1 and 4 of a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design, with dose limiting toxicities defined during&#xD;
           cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalation will proceed in cohorts comprised of two separate groups of patients&#xD;
           (one group of patients with solid tumor/lymphoma and one group of patients with MDS),&#xD;
           with at least 1 from each group, until hematologic DLT or the second grade 2 hematologic&#xD;
           toxicity is observed, at which point, dose escalation will proceed separately for two&#xD;
           cohorts: (1) patients with solid tumors/lymphoma and (2) patients with MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 33 patients will be accrued to a PD expansi n cohort at the MTD to further assess&#xD;
           pharmacodynamic endpoints in tumor and blood.&#xD;

        FDA. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
        contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
        entry and for the duration of study participation and for at least 3 months after dosing&#xD;
        with study drugs ceases. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
        she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
        immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate&#xD;
        contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 months&#xD;
        after completion of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.1.7 Patients must have completed any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biologic therapy&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 3 weeks (or greather than or equal to 5 half-lives, whichever is&#xD;
        shorter) prior to entering the study. Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks&#xD;
        since any prior administration of a study drug in a Phase 0 or equivalent study and be&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 1 week from palliative radiation therapy (patients on study may be&#xD;
        eligible for palliative radiotherapy to non-targeted lesions after 2 cycles of therapy at&#xD;
        the PI s discretion). Patients must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior&#xD;

        willingness to undergo tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.1 Sensory/motor neuropathy greater than or equal to Grade 2&#xD;

        entry; history of congenital long QT syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.3 Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.4 Patients with active brain metastases, CNS disease, or carcinomatous meningitis are&#xD;
        excluded from this clinical trial. Patients with treated brain metastases, whose brain&#xD;
        metastatic disease has remained stable for greater than or equal to 4 weeks without&#xD;
        requiring steroid and anti-seizure medication, are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.5 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
        composition to study drugs. Patients who have previously received either clofarabine or&#xD;
        bortezomib will be excluded as this may affect accurate determination of the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.6 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, serious untreated&#xD;
        infection, symptomatic respiratory failure/congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
        pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
        compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.7 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bortezomib and clofarabine have&#xD;
        been assigned to pregnancy category D by the FDA. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
