  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism of Osteoarthritis (OA) is complex, however the investigators know that&#xD;
      cartilage breakdown follows changes in certain cells in the cartilage called chondrocytes,&#xD;
      leading to proteases that break down cartilage. There is a protein in the human blood called&#xD;
      alpha-2-macroglobulin that can trap these proteases and prevent the breakdown of cartilage.&#xD;
      Cytonics developed a device that use the patient's own blood to remove all cells and&#xD;
      concentrate alpha-2-macroglobulin to be injected in the painful knee due to osteoarthritis.&#xD;
