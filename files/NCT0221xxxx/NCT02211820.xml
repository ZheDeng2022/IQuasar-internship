      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a brain disease caused in part by head injury.&#xD;
      The brain changes from CTE can only be seen at autopsy. Researchers want to test a new brain&#xD;
      scan to help diagnose CTE in living patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine if a new type of brain scan can detect changes that occur in chronic traumatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults age 18 60 with previous head injury or participation in certain sports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of thinking, mood, and memory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30-minute magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. A magnetic field and radio waves&#xD;
           take pictures of the brain. Participants will lie on a table that slides into a metal&#xD;
           cylinder. They will get earplugs for the loud knocking sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: Participants will have a 70-minute PET scan of the brain with a small amount of&#xD;
           a radioactive chemical. That will be injected through an intravenous tube (catheter) in&#xD;
           each arm. A catheter will also be put into an artery at the wrist or elbow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of a donut-shaped scanner. A&#xD;
           plastic mask may be molded to their face and head. Vital signs and heart activity will&#xD;
           be checked before and during the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine will be taken before and after the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be checked on by phone the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: Participants will repeat Visit 1 with a different chemical and no artery&#xD;
           catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: Participants may have a spinal tap. Some fluid will be removed by needle&#xD;
           between the bones in the back.&#xD;

      Objective: To determine if the PET radioligand [11C]PBB3 can detect aggregates of tau protein&#xD;
      in the brains of patients with history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and suspected chronic&#xD;
      traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The proposed study will include 40 subjects. Twenty will be patients with&#xD;
      history of TBI and suspected CTE and 20 will be healthy cognitively normal volunteers without&#xD;
      history of TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Subjects will undergo medical screening and have brain MRI and neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing performed. Subjects will undergo one brain PET scan with [11C]PBB3 to detect&#xD;
      aggregates of tau protein. Subjects will also have one brain PET scan with [11C]Pittsburgh&#xD;
      compound B (PIB) to detect amyloid plaques. Subjects will be asked to have a lumbar puncture&#xD;
      to measure CSF tau concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure will be the amount of [11C]PBB3 binding in the&#xD;
      brain. We will quantify the radioligand s brain uptake, washout, plasma clearance, and&#xD;
      distribution volume using compartmental modeling. Distribution volume of [11C]PBB3 is&#xD;
      proportional to the density of insoluble paired helical filaments of tau and is equal to the&#xD;
      ratio at equilibrium of uptake in brain to the concentration of parent radiotracer in plasma.&#xD;
      As an exploratory measure, we will determine if there is a relationship between [11C]PBB3&#xD;
      binding in brain and gray matter loss on MRI. We will also measure the amount of [11C]PIB&#xD;
      binding in the brain using the Logan reference tissue method with cerebellum as reference.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of head injury resulting from past or current participation in one or&#xD;
                  more contact sports (hockey, football, or boxing). Patients may have history of&#xD;
                  structural brain injury (i.e., injury accompanying abnormality on MRI or CT&#xD;
                  scan), concussion without structural injury (mild TBI), or repetitive&#xD;
                  sub-concussive injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Meets DMS-V criteria for Major Neurocognitive Disorder or Mild Neurocognitive&#xD;
                  Disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age 18 to 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ambulatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients unable to provide informed consent must have a surrogate decision maker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For healthy controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Healthy without past or present history of brain disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age 18 to 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past or present history of a brain disorder other than TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients: Subjects with abnormal brain imaging findings that suggest a diagnosis&#xD;
             other than TBI or a second lesion such as brain tumor in addition to the changes&#xD;
             consistent with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For controls: past or present history of either a single concussion or more severe&#xD;
             TBI, or of repetitive sub-concussive injury due to contact sport participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical conditions, which make study procedures of the current study unsafe.&#xD;
             Such serious medical conditions include uncontrolled epilepsy and multiple serious&#xD;
             injuries. The Principal Investigator of this protocol will determine whether the&#xD;
             subject needs to be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The DSM-V criteria for Major Neurocognitive Disorder are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             --Evidence of significant cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in&#xD;
             one or more cognitive domains (complex attention, executive function, learning and&#xD;
             memory, perceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, of the clinician that there&#xD;
                  has been a significant decline in cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A substantial impairment in cognitive performance, preferably documented by&#xD;
                  standardized neuropsychological testing, or, in its absence, another qualified&#xD;
                  clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cognitive deficits interfere with independence in everyday activities (i.e. at a&#xD;
             minimum, requiring assistance with complex instrumental activities of daily living&#xD;
             such as paying bills or managing medications)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context of delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cognitive disorder is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g. major&#xD;
             depressive disorder, schizophrenia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Criteria for Mild Neurocognitive Disorder are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There is evidence of modest cognitive decline from a previous level of&#xD;
                  performance in one or more of the domains outlined above based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Decline in neurocognitive performance, preferably documented by standardized&#xD;
                       neuropsychological testing, or, in its absence, another qualified clinical&#xD;
                       assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The cognitive deficits are insufficient to interfere with independence (eg,&#xD;
                  instrumental activities of daily living, like more complex tasks such as paying&#xD;
                  bills or managing medications,&#xD;
&#xD;
        are preserved), but greater effort, compensatory strategies, or accommodation may be&#xD;
        required to maintain independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context of a delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cognitive deficits are not primarily attributable to another mental disorder (eg,&#xD;
             major depressive disorder, schizophrenia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are no restrictions on medications. Since disease modifying therapy for tauopathies&#xD;
        (including CTE and Alzheimer s disease) do not currently exist, no currently available&#xD;
        medications, either prescribed or over-the-counter, are expected to confound the results of&#xD;
        this study. Anti-inflammatory medications, including NSAIDs, are not expected to&#xD;
        significantly reduce tau aggregation in CTE patients, based on the failure of these&#xD;
        medications to prevent disease progression in Alzheimer s disease.&#xD;
