  <brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Profile of Four Formulations of Fluticasone Furoate (FF) Using Unit Dose Dry Powder Inhaler (UD-DPI) Compared With FF ELLIPTAÂ® Presentation</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, five- period, cross-over, randomized, single dose, single centre study&#xD;
      in healthy subjects. This is the second clinical study for the UD-DPI. This study will&#xD;
      ascertain whether the Pharmacokinetics (PK) systemic exposure [in terms of area under the&#xD;
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)] of FF&#xD;
      delivered via the UD-DPI is comparable to the systemic exposure of FF delivered via the&#xD;
      ELLIPTA Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI). For this reason four treatment doses consisting of three&#xD;
      dose strengths and 2 percentage blends will be assessed when delivered via the UD-DPI. This&#xD;
      study is designed to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of various doses and blends of FF&#xD;
      administered via UD-DPI and relative to FF administered via ELLIPTA DPI. Subjects will be&#xD;
      screened 28 days prior to study initiation. During each treatment period, subjects will be at&#xD;
      study site from evening prior to dosing until completion of the 48 hour post-dose PK sample&#xD;
      collection on Day 3. Minimum 7 days washout will be between treatments after completion of&#xD;
      all five treatments and the follow-up visit will be conducted 7-14 days post last dose.&#xD;
      Duration of study is 13 weeks. ELLIPTA is a registered trademark of the GSK group of&#xD;
      companies.&#xD;

             review medication on a case by case basis to determine if its use would compromise&#xD;
             subject safety or interfere with the study procedures or data interpretation&#xD;
