      In this dose-escalation study, the safety and tolerability of escalating dose levels of&#xD;
      RRx-001 administered intravenously twice a week in subjects with brain metastases receiving&#xD;
      whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) will be assessed. Once a maximum tolerated dose is&#xD;
      identified, further (up to approximately 30) participants will be recruited. The study will&#xD;
      use MRI to monitor changes in tumor blood flow associated with RRx-001.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and activity of whole brain&#xD;
      radiation therapy with RRx-001, an experimental radiation sensitizer, in participants with&#xD;
      brain metastases. As a radiation sensitizer, RRx-001 may increase the effect of whole brain&#xD;
      radiation, the standard of care for brain metastases, on cancer cells in a specific target&#xD;
      area while reducing damage to normal healthy cells. The ability to sensitize the cancer cells&#xD;
      to radiation sets off a 'domino effect' of free radical damage in the tumor from a given&#xD;
      amount or dose of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, which is called BRAINSTORM, since RRx-001 is associated with the development of a&#xD;
      &quot;free radical storm&quot; in the brain tumors, is divided into two stages. In the first stage,&#xD;
      approximately 3 participants at a time will be entered at a particular dose level of RRx-001&#xD;
      and then observed in order to see whether that dose results in side effects with radiation.&#xD;
      If no bad side effects are observed, a second group of approximately 3 subjects will be given&#xD;
      a slightly higher dose of RRx-001 and also monitored for side effects with radiation. This&#xD;
      process will be repeated until a dose is reached, which has the most activity against the&#xD;
      cancer cells without unacceptable side effects. At this point, more participants will be&#xD;
      entered at this dose level until a maximum enrollment of approximately 30 participants has&#xD;
      been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RRx-001 releases a gas called nitric oxide, which widens the diameter of blood vessels, and&#xD;
      allows the delivery of more oxygen to tumors. The presence of oxygen in tumors is critical&#xD;
      for the effectiveness of radiation therapy, since cancer cells are about two to three times&#xD;
      more vulnerable to radiation when oxygen is present. The reason that cancer cells are so much&#xD;
      more vulnerable to the effects of radiation when oxygen is present is that radiation relies&#xD;
      on the formation of harmful molecules known as free radicals that damage proteins and genetic&#xD;
      material (DNA); without oxygen lower levels of free radicals are produced. Changes in the&#xD;
      diameter go blood vessels will be studied by magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike chemotherapies or other radiation sensitizers, RRx-001 does not have to enter the&#xD;
      tumor to be effective because nitric oxide, as a gas, is able to spread or diffuse from the&#xD;
      bloodstream into cancer cells.&#xD;
