      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the short- and long-term (up to&#xD;
      24 months) outcome of treatment by means of dilation with the Passeo-18 Lux drug releasing&#xD;
      balloon and by Pulsar-18 stent implantation in symptomatic (Rutherford 2-4) femoro-popliteal&#xD;
      arterial stenotic or occlusive lesions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ever since its introduction, one of the major limitations of endovascular therapy is the&#xD;
      occurrence of restenosis after treatment. Factors contributing to loss of primary patency&#xD;
      after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) due to balloon injury are negative arterial&#xD;
      remodeling, excessive neointimal proliferation and elastic recoil. In order to increase&#xD;
      sustained vessel patency, systemic medication administration and brachytherapy have been&#xD;
      proposed, but have not led to any success. With the introduction of stents, patency rates&#xD;
      have been optimized also on longer term. However, neointimal hyperplasia after endovascular&#xD;
      stent placement in infra-inguinal arteries remains a major limiting issue. Stents themselves&#xD;
      contribute to this excessive intimal formation because of the vascular response to the&#xD;
      metallic prosthesis. In order to find a solution to overcome this limitation, the&#xD;
      possibilities of drug-eluting technologies are being examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current concepts include drug-eluting stents (DES), which provide sustained release of&#xD;
      anti-proliferative medication into the vessel wall. The application of a drug coating on a&#xD;
      stent surface inhibits the inflammatory response and smooth muscle cell proliferation in the&#xD;
      vessel wall during a certain period and delays the process of intimal hyperplasia. Thus, DES&#xD;
      technology was developed to prevent early restenosis and late luminal loss to potentially&#xD;
      improve long-term patency rates. Because DES with active stent coatings have shown to be&#xD;
      beneficial in the treatment of coronary artery disease, the technique of active stent&#xD;
      coatings (sirolimus or paclitaxel) as commonly used in coronary interventions was transferred&#xD;
      to the infrainguinal vascular bed. However, an active stent coating (sirolimus or paclitaxel)&#xD;
      only inhibits the inflammatory response and smooth muscle cell proliferation in the vessel&#xD;
      wall for a certain period; in fact, it merely delays the process of intimal hyperplasia as&#xD;
      demonstrated by the 2-year results of the SIROCCO study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another novel way of inhibiting restenosis after PTA is the use of drug-coated balloons&#xD;
      (DCB), which inhibit restenosis by an immediate local release of medication during the&#xD;
      intervention. The rationale behind the use of DCBs is based on the finding that sustained&#xD;
      drug elution is not a necessary to obtain a sustained inhibition of restenosis. The concept&#xD;
      of using a balloon with medication to treat vascular disease was introduced in 2003 by&#xD;
      Scheller et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most commonly used drugs for arterial applications is the anti-proliferative&#xD;
      paclitaxel (Taxol), which impedes cell division in the cell cycle. Paclitaxel has certain&#xD;
      characteristics which make it a promising candidate for treatment of peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease. Because it is hydrophobic, paclitaxel does not require the use of a polymer to&#xD;
      prevent wash-off during tracking or implantation. Adequate drug delivery to the vessel wall&#xD;
      is possible because of its lipophilic characteristic, which enables paclitaxel to interact&#xD;
      with the high concentrations of lipids present in the vessel wall and avoids the need for a&#xD;
      polymer. Results of preclinical and clinical studies have shown that short-term exposure to&#xD;
      Paclitaxel may suffice to obtain a sustained reduction in late lumen loss and avoid&#xD;
      restenosis in both coronary and peripheral arteries: in contrast to stents, DCBs do not leave&#xD;
      any residual material in the artery lumen that could trigger neointimal proliferation, thus&#xD;
      making DCBs an attractive alternative to stents, especially in challenging arterial&#xD;
      anatomies. Further investigation is warranted in order to obtain conclusive data.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the benefit of treating in-stent restenosis (ISR) in the peripheral arteries&#xD;
      with DCBs has yet to be investigated, although limited data is already available to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical value of these drug-eluting technologies has been proven repeatedly in the&#xD;
      coronary arteries, and evidence of therapeutic applications to peripheral artery disease is&#xD;
      starting to build. It is the intent of this prospective study to evaluate the treatment of a&#xD;
      drug-coated balloon followed by stent implant and comparing this to the results of the 4EVER&#xD;
      trial and results in the literature.&#xD;
