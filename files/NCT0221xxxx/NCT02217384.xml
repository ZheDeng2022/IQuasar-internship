      Background. Anorexia nervosa (AN) still carries the highest fatality rate of any psychiatric&#xD;
      disease, and less than half of the patients recover, completely refractory to any treatment.&#xD;
      The etiology remains unknown and evidence for treatment is lacking. The intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      and its microbiome provide humans with additional gene products which may be regarded as an&#xD;
      organ, which contributes to multiple host metabolic pathways. Recent advances in microbial&#xD;
      DNA sequencing technologies have resulted in metagenomic DNA analysis of whole ecosystems&#xD;
      such as the human gut. Altered intestinal microbiota has been related to obesity and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. Hypothetically, the intestinal microbiota could play a role in the generation&#xD;
      and/or maintenance of the emaciation in AN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether gut microbiota is altered in&#xD;
      patients with AN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and methods. A cross sectional study of the gut microbiome profiles in 75 clinical,&#xD;
      psychometric and biochemical well characterized treatment seeking females with AN. The&#xD;
      microbiome profiles are compared with 75 age- matched healthy Danish control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives. Clarifying whether the intestinal flora is implicated in the susceptibility to&#xD;
      or maintenance of AN may provide the basis for development of new highly required treatments.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex disorder characterized by disturbed body image,&#xD;
      ego-syntonic neglect, ambivalence, self-starvation, loss of body weight, obsessive thoughts&#xD;
      of food, ritualistic patterns of food intake, elevated physical activity, depression, anxiety&#xD;
      and emotional rigidity. The evidence base for the treatment is very limited, considering the&#xD;
      extent to which this disorder erodes quality of life and still carries the highest fatality&#xD;
      rate of any psychiatric diseases. In fact, there is no evidence that the prognosis has&#xD;
      improved throughout the 20th century.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AN remains a syndrome, i.e. collections of symptoms, as it is not defined by etiology. Twin&#xD;
      studies have consistently demonstrated that AN is strongly familial predominantly due to&#xD;
      genetic factors. However, neither candidate gene nor genome-wide studies have identified&#xD;
      truly validated genes for AN. AN is associated with multiple, profound endocrine&#xD;
      disturbances. However, so far the extensive research has not led to any breakthrough&#xD;
      discovery. There is a need for new thinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonization of the human gut begins at birth with bacteria from the mother's vagina and&#xD;
      labor-released maternal feces. In adults the human digestive tract contains complex&#xD;
      assemblies of microorganisms which actually outnumber the number of the host cells 10:1. This&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota and its microbiome provide humans with additional gene products, which&#xD;
      may be regarded as an organ, which contributes to multiple host metabolic pathways. Thus, a&#xD;
      whole range of substances are produced which are not yet identified. Potentially some of&#xD;
      these substances may affect functions in the brain, such as appetite and emotion regulations.&#xD;
      Recent advances in microbial DNA sequencing technologies have resulted in metagenomics DNA&#xD;
      analysis of whole ecosystems such as the human gut. An important step forward in&#xD;
      investigating the bacterial composition of the human microbiome was taken with the Metagenome&#xD;
      of the Human Intestinal Tract consortium reporting the first complete microbial gene atlas of&#xD;
      the human distal gut, using deep next generation metagenome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM To investigate whether gut microbiota is altered in patients with AN. If confirmed, this&#xD;
      potentially may play a role in the pathogenesis, promoting susceptibility to development&#xD;
      and/or maintenance of AN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Patients with AN harbor an altered gut microbiota composition and functional&#xD;
      potential as determined by quantitative metagenomic analyses of microbial DNA isolated from&#xD;
      stool samples and sequenced applying a combination of deep and untargeted shotgun sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN A cross sectional multicenter study where the gut microbiome profiles in women&#xD;
      with AN are compared with age matched healthy, normal weight women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS The patients are characterized according to the national guidelines. The following&#xD;
      data will be extracted from the medical files and included in the descriptive and&#xD;
      multivariate analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical variables: Age, disease duration, BMI, %weight change during the last 4 weeks,&#xD;
      in/out patient status, medication, somatic and psychiatric comorbidity, smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychometric variables: Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI)-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects: The control subjects will be matched as described, and allocated from&#xD;
      siblings of patients, local health workers, or if necessary, from announcement at an official&#xD;
      Danish website for participation in clinical trials. The age matched women fill in a 17 items&#xD;
      health related questionnaire. Any chronic disease, medication or a history of psychiatric&#xD;
      illness results in their exclusion from participation. They are, however, allowed to use oral&#xD;
      contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FECAL SAMPLING Fecal samples are collected in order to characterize the composition of the&#xD;
      gut microbiome. A sample of about 5 g is collected with the help of a collection tray.&#xD;
      Participants are instructed in immediately storing the sample in their freezer at -18°C.&#xD;
      Transportation is done at cold temperatures in an isolated box containing frozen elements,&#xD;
      and handed over to study personnel maximal 24 hours after delivery where it is stored at -80&#xD;
      C until DNA extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MORNING FASTING URINE 5 ml morning fasting urine is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYZING FOR DIFFERENCES IN GUT MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION The feces specimens are processed and&#xD;
      analyzed as follows: Bacterial DNA extraction, shotgun illumine DNA sequencing, microbial&#xD;
      gene analyses, taxonomy analyses including entero types, known species and unknown&#xD;
      meta-species (=quantitative metagenomics) as well as functional gene annotation. The DNA&#xD;
      purification and the shotgun sequencing is done at Unité MetaGenoPolis - Centre de recherche&#xD;
      de Jouy-en-Josas, MGP-INRA, JOUY en JOSAS, FRANCE. Quantitative metagenomics as outlined&#xD;
      above is performed by the unit of Bioinformatics and Computational Metagenomics at CBMR&#xD;
      applying established state-of-the art methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOCHEMICAL VARIABLES Basic parameters: The following analyses are performed as an integral&#xD;
      part of diagnosis and treatment in specialist units, and will be extracted from the medical&#xD;
      files: Na, K, creatinine, carbamide, bicarbonate, Ca-ion, phosphate, Hemoglobin, C-reactive&#xD;
      protein, leukocytes, mean cell volume, mean cell hemoglobin concentrate, alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, pancreatic amylase, Mg, Zn, thyroxine,&#xD;
      triiodothyronine, thyrotropin, cobalamine, folate, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing&#xD;
      hormone, prolactin, estradiol, and vitamin D. Values will be adjusted and expressed as ratio&#xD;
      relative to the normal value on the basis of average standard values for each centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLES&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples are stored at -80 C:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Faeces 4 x 5 g.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum 20 x 500 microliter serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma 20 x 500 microliter plasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Buffy coat x 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morning urine 2 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical analyses: From the sampled serum/plasma, following analyses are performed:&#xD;
      Insulin, Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF-1 binding protein-3, leptin, and&#xD;
      adiponectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOBANK The fecal samples and the above mentioned materials will be stored in a biobank in up&#xD;
      to 30 years. If a microbiome genotype for AN is disclosed, further genomic analyses, mass&#xD;
      spectroscopy for metabolites and maybe inoculation studies will be performed (followed by new&#xD;
      applications to the Ethical Committee).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS Power calculation. There is no data available regarding microbiota in AN. The&#xD;
      number of participants is based on ongoing studies of gut microbiome in pregnant women and&#xD;
      patients with multiple sclerosis where a population size of 50 was estimated to be&#xD;
      appropriate for providing a power greater than 80% and a significance of 5% for observing&#xD;
      differences in the present quantitative metagenomics approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate analyze. Statistical methods will build upon previously developed methods and&#xD;
      multivariate statistical approaches applied within the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal&#xD;
      Tract (MetaHIT) consortium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS The study is approved and registered at The Regional Scientific Ethical Committee for&#xD;
      Southern Denmark (file no 42053 S-20140040).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be asked whether they are willing to donate the material (feces, blood,&#xD;
      urine) to a biobank for later analysis, and will only be used in related future studies, for&#xD;
      which approval will first be obtained from the Scientific Ethical Committee. The biobank&#xD;
      samples are stored up to 30 years. Clinical, psychometric and biochemical variables mentioned&#xD;
      above are extracted from medical files. Patients from the three participating centres will&#xD;
      receive an invitation to an information meeting with one of the health workers, who are one&#xD;
      of the local investigators. For subjects below age of 18 years (15 - 18 y) one or both&#xD;
      parents must participate and must provide written informed consent. Subjects above age 18&#xD;
      years are allowed to bring a friend or family member as an observer. It will be emphasized&#xD;
      that it is voluntary to participate. During the information meeting an official document&#xD;
      published by The National Committee on Health Research Ethics 2012 is handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The invitation of siblings is motivated by the fact that future studies of biobank material&#xD;
      can prove to be of particular interest, if there is a high level of genetic relatedness&#xD;
      between the test patients and the control subjects. However, the patient inclusion in the&#xD;
      present project will not depend on whether there are siblings who wish to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of patients down to the age of 15 are motivated by the fact that the highest&#xD;
      prevalence of AN is in this age group. The older the patient, the greater is the likelihood&#xD;
      for psychiatric co-morbidity. It therefore will be important for the validity of the results&#xD;
      that the age spectrum also covers 15 - 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HANDLING AND ARCHIVING DATA The current protocol are approved by The Danish Data Protection&#xD;
      Agency (case files 1429534, 2008-58-035) and all the documents and materials related to the&#xD;
      clinical study will be stored according to the Act on Processing of Personal Data. All&#xD;
      sensitive information of personal, physical or biological origin related to the individual&#xD;
      participants will be treated confidentially according to the Danish legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINANCE This is a non-profit study, completely independent from commercial interests. There&#xD;
      will be applied for public and private grants to finance this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERSPECTIVES If the present study identifies an altered gut flora in AN, it provides the&#xD;
      basis for several important new studies of gen products in faces and blood in AN, and also&#xD;
      inoculation experiments with gnotobiotic mice. Clarifying whether the intestinal flora is&#xD;
      implicated in the susceptibility to or maintenance of AN may provide the basis for&#xD;
      development of new highly required treatments of AN and potentially also obesity.&#xD;
