      The purpose of this Phase 1, prospective, uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter,&#xD;
      dose-escalation study is to evaluate the safety, including immunogenicity, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of BAX930 (rADAMTS13) in a total of 14 evaluable subjects diagnosed with&#xD;
      severe hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (plasma ADAMTS13 activity &lt;6%)&#xD;

    <description>The study is comprised of 3 dose cohorts and two dose escalation steps [Cohort 1: 3 subjects; Cohort 2: 3 subjects; Cohort 3: 8 subjects]. Subjects will be enrolled and dosed sequentially. Subjects will be recruited to the next dose level only after short-term safety has been demonstrated and reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) at the preceding dose level. The first 2 subjects in any cohort will be ≥ 18 years of age. The effects of the investigational product on vital signs, hematology, and clinical chemistry parameters (up to 96 ± 2 hrs blood sampling timepoint) will determine short-term safety. The DMC will recommend whether to proceed with the study or in case of a safety concern recommend remedial actions and/or to discontinue the study. Subject participation will continue until 28 ± 3 days after infusion of the investigational product. Subject participation in one Dose Cohort (1-3) is expected to be approximately 6-8 weeks.</description>

    <description>rADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) is a lyophilized formulation for intravenous injection. The lyophilized rADAMTS13 is reconstituted with sterile water for injection.&#xD;
Subjects will receive an intravenous injection with rADAMTS13 at a dose of either 5 U/kg bodyweight (Cohort 1), or 20 U/kg bodyweight (Cohort 2), or 40 U/kg bodyweight (Cohort 3).</description>
