    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients &gt;65 years unfit and unsuitable, according to the investigator's opinion, to&#xD;
             receive approved first line treatments for newly diagnosed MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the&#xD;
             protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any&#xD;
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that&#xD;
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future&#xD;
             medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic MM based on standard CRAB criteria (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has measurable disease, defined as follows: any quantifiable serum monoclonal&#xD;
             protein value (generally, but not necessarily, â‰¥ 0.5 g/dL of M-protein) and, where&#xD;
             applicable, urine light-chain excretion of &gt;200 mg/24 hours. For patients with oligo&#xD;
             or non-secretory MM, it is required that they have measurable plasmacytoma &gt; 2 cm as&#xD;
             determined by clinical examination or applicable radiographs (i.e. MRI, CT-Scan) or an&#xD;
             abnormal free light chain ratio (n.v.: 0.26-1.65). We anticipate that less than 10% of&#xD;
             patients admitted to this study will be oligo- or non-secretory MM with free light&#xD;
             chains only in order to maximize interpretation of benefit results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All randomized patients will be selected based on the use of 3 geriatric scales: IADL,&#xD;
             ADL, Charlson. Unfit patients with clinical sign of frailty (mild, moderate or severe&#xD;
             frailty), including need help for household tasks and personal care can be enrolled in&#xD;
             this trial (2,4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In order to include patients who normally are not select for clinical trials, also&#xD;
             patients with the following abnormal laboratory values can be considered:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. platelet count &lt; 80 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. haemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. aspartate transaminase (AST): &lt; 5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. alanine transaminase (ALT): &lt; 5 x the ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. total bilirubin: &gt; 1.5 x the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. calculated or measured creatinine clearance: &lt;30 mL/minute&#xD;
&#xD;
        The geriatric assessment evaluations will select unfit patients to be randomized regardless&#xD;
        of possible abnormal laboratory values at the study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients not agreeing to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom&#xD;
             or abstinence) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential not agreeing to use two acceptable methods for&#xD;
             contraception (e.g. a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with anti-myeloma therapy (does not include radiotherapy,&#xD;
             bisphosphonates, or a single short course of steroid &lt; to the equivalent of&#xD;
             dexamethasone 40 mg/day for 4 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant medical disease or conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, may&#xD;
             interfere with protocol adherence or subject's ability to give informed consent or&#xD;
             could place the subject at unacceptable risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinical active infectious hepatitis type B or C, classified into&#xD;
             Child-Pugh class C (see Appendix V) and HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of acute active infection requiring antibiotics or infiltrative pulmonary&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to any of the required drugs or supportive treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of prior history of malignancies, other than multiple myeloma, with a life&#xD;
             expectancy &lt; 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the&#xD;
             various formulations.&#xD;
