      The aims of the cohort study is to describe the rates of 30-day surgical complication,&#xD;
      functional decline, frailty and one-year mortality for patients experienced cardiac surgery&#xD;
      and to delineate the trajectory of functional capacity 1 year after surgery for the patients.&#xD;
      It also will test whether the trajectory of functional varied significantly according to&#xD;
      delirium status and its type over the follow-up period and examine the patients' postsurgical&#xD;
      actual caloric/protein/fluid intake in relation to the functional capacity within 3 months&#xD;
      after surgery as well as evaluate whether activity levels, dietary diversity, and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms at 3,6, and 12 months affect patient outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Taiwan, 54.2% of cardiac surgical procedures in 2010 were performed on older patients (≧65&#xD;
      years) with higher rates of surgical complications, functional decline, and even death&#xD;
      reported. Despite the large number of older patients undergoing cardiac surgery with the goal&#xD;
      of improving functional capacity, the literature in this area is limited. Specifically, there&#xD;
      is little information about the functional outcomes 1 year after cardiac surgery for older&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, longitudinal cohort study will be conducted to assess and follow patients aged&#xD;
      65 years and older who undergoing elective or non-elective cardiac surgery for one year after&#xD;
      surgery. All patients on the cardio-surgical wards of 5A, 5B, and 5CVI at National Taiwan&#xD;
      University Hospital will be screened for eligibility. Every patient ≧65 years admitted for&#xD;
      cardiac surgery will be approached and invited to participate. This cohort study aims to&#xD;
      1)describe the rates of 30-day surgical complication, functional decline, frailty, and&#xD;
      one-year mortality for older patients underwent cardiac surgery; 2) delineate the rajectory&#xD;
      of functional capacity 1 year after surgery for these patients; 3) test whether the&#xD;
      trajectory of functional capacity varied significantly according to delirium status and its&#xD;
      type over the one-year follow-up period; 4)examine patients' postsurgical actual&#xD;
      caloric/protein/fluid intake in relation to the functional capacity within 3 months after&#xD;
      surgery; and 5) evaluate hether activity levels, dietary diversity, and depressive symptoms&#xD;
      at 3, 6, and 12 months affect patient outcomes. Estimated 236 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      to ensure the power of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using the SAS package. The Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) will&#xD;
      be performed to identify the risk factors and to delineate the trajectory of functional&#xD;
      capacity 1 year after cardiac surgery for older patients. The findings will add to the&#xD;
      development of nursing intervention program to promote functional recovery for older patients&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery&#xD;
