      Obesity is a growing problem in East London and every other woman who enters pregnancy is&#xD;
      obese or overweight. In addition to obesity, other metabolic risk factors such as raised&#xD;
      lipids, high blood pressure and diabetes increase pregnancy related complications such as&#xD;
      preeclampsia and long term problems such as heart diseases, stroke and death. Preeclampsia,&#xD;
      presenting as hypertension and proteinuria is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity. Interventions that reduce cardiovascular events by modifying risk factors also&#xD;
      have the potential to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. The investigators work funded by the&#xD;
      National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) in the UK showed that dietary interventions in&#xD;
      obese pregnant women may reduce the risk of preeclampsia. The investigators propose to show&#xD;
      that pregnant women with metabolic risk factors derive the most benefit from a simple,&#xD;
      targeted intervention based on Mediterranean dietary pattern to reduce the risk of maternal&#xD;
      and fetal complications . Women with the risk factors (1230 women) will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      to dietary intervention or usual antenatal dietary advice and the risk of maternal and fetal&#xD;
      complications will be evaluated. The remaining eligible women who are consented for lipid&#xD;
      tests, but do not have metabolic risk factors, will be followed up for outcome data only.&#xD;
      Diet based interventions, especially those based on a Mediterranean dietary pattern has a&#xD;
      potential to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. In the investigators study, pregnant mothers&#xD;
      with risk factors will be randomly allocated to either a dietary invention or usual antenatal&#xD;
      care and they will assess their composite maternal (pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes)&#xD;
      and fetal (stillbirth, small for gestational age or admission to neonatal intensive care&#xD;
      unit) outcomes. The investigators will tailor the intervention to suit the individual needs&#xD;
      of the mother and provide nuts and olive oil to improve compliance. The study will be&#xD;
      undertaken across the three maternity units at Barts Health NHS Trust, which delivers 17,000&#xD;
      women/year and two other maternity units in England. The study is supported by the office of&#xD;
      the Mayor of Tower Hamlets which will facilitate the involvement of grassroots workers to&#xD;
      promote recruitment and uptake of the intervention.&#xD;

      Obesity is a growing problem in east London with a fifth of women entering pregnancy as&#xD;
      obese. In addition to obesity, other metabolic risk factors such as raised lipids, high blood&#xD;
      pressure and insulin resistance are increasingly prevalent. With a large proportion of ethnic&#xD;
      minority mothers in east London, dietary habits and underlying genetic predisposition are&#xD;
      major contributors to this phenomenon. Obesity and raised serum lipids, especially&#xD;
      triglycerides increase the risk of complications such as preeclampsia in pregnancy and&#xD;
      cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke and death in the long term.&#xD;
      Preeclampsia, a condition in pregnancy, with raised blood pressure and increased protein in&#xD;
      the urine is a leading cause of maternal and fetal deaths. Its treatment gives rise to large&#xD;
      health care costs. Preeclampsia contributes to preterm birth, one of the leading causes of&#xD;
      perinatal deaths in east London. It accounts for 65% of neonatal deaths and 50% of&#xD;
      neurological disability in childhood. Around £900 million in extra costs for care of preterm&#xD;
      babies per year in the NHS are linked to neonatal care. Preeclampsia, characterised by&#xD;
      insulin resistance, widespread endothelial damage and dysfunction, coagulation defects and&#xD;
      increased systemic inflammatory response, shares metabolic risk factors with cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension are independent risk factors for&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia. Interventions that reduce cardiovascular events by modifying metabolic risk&#xD;
      factors also have the potential to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early identification of mothers at risk of preeclampsia will allow clinicians to deliver&#xD;
      these targeted interventions in pregnancy, with the potential to prevent preeclampsia and&#xD;
      modify cardiovascular risk in the long-term. Currently, low dose aspirin, recommended as a&#xD;
      prophylactic measure reduces preeclampsia risk by only 10%. Simple, low-cost and effective&#xD;
      acceptable interventions are required to reduce this risk further. Dietary interventions in&#xD;
      pregnant women with metabolic risk factors such as obesity and insulin resistance are shown&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. But the existing studies are of poor quality and do not&#xD;
      evaluate preeclampsia as the primary outcome. Furthermore, they focus on specific components&#xD;
      of the diet, rather than modifying the overall dietary pattern. Mediterranean diet with high&#xD;
      consumption of vegetables and fruits, olive oil and nuts and low consumption of red meat and&#xD;
      processed food significantly reduces lipid levels and cardiovascular adverse events in&#xD;
      non-pregnant high risk population. In pregnancy, the beneficial effect of the Mediterranean&#xD;
      dietary pattern was observed in a large prospective study of nulliparous pregnant women with&#xD;
      a 28% reduction in the risk of preeclampsia (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.62, 0.85). These results need&#xD;
      confirmation in a sound experimental study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for an adequately powered randomised trial to evaluate the beneficial effect&#xD;
      of lipid modifying diet in pregnancy that is simple, accessible and acceptable. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesis is that pregnant women with metabolic risk factors will derive&#xD;
      benefit from dietary intervention in preventing maternal and fetal complications.&#xD;
