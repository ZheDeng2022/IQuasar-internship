  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing anesthesia for non-cardiac surgery will be randomized to either having&#xD;
      their anesthesia team alerted or kept blinded to extended periods of less than normal blood&#xD;
      pressure with the goal of studying if providing these alerts leads to improved outcome after&#xD;
      surgery (lower risk of death or complication in the days and weeks following surgery).&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently identified a significant association of postoperative morbidity and 30-day&#xD;
      mortality with the concept of &quot;hypotensive exposures&quot; during anaesthesia. Specifically, we&#xD;
      found in approximately 160,000 patients from 3 institutions (Cleveland Clinic, Vanderbilt&#xD;
      University and Saint Louis University) that roughly every third adult patient undergoing a&#xD;
      non-cardiac procedure under anaesthesia experienced twice the 30-day all-cause mortality&#xD;
      portended by extended cumulative periods of less than normal intraoperative blood pressure.&#xD;
      This association was independent of co-morbidity (Charlson Co-morbidity index), causing the&#xD;
      same relative increase in mortality in &quot;healthy&quot; as in &quot;sick&quot; patients. A new method was&#xD;
      introduced to quantify hypotensive exposures in form of a novel risk score called the&#xD;
      SLUScore™, a score with values from ranging from 0 (no hypotensive exposure) to a maximum of&#xD;
      31 (the maximal number of exposures exceeded of a certain risk-based set of limits for time&#xD;
      accumulated at a mean arterial blood pressure below thresholds between 75 and 45 mm Hg), with&#xD;
      each increment of the SLUScore™ portending an equivalent 5% increase in 30-day postoperative&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We test the hypothesis that alerting the anaesthesia care team to progressive hypotensive&#xD;
      exposures (a progressive increase in their SLUScore™) improves 30-day survival. This will be&#xD;
      tested in a prospective, randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel Clinical Decision Support System (ACG-Anesthesia by Talis Clinical, LLC) will be used&#xD;
      to alert anaesthesia care team members to patients' SLUScores™ in near real time (within 1&#xD;
      minute of documented exposures). At the time of transition from a SLUScore™ of 0 to 1&#xD;
      (occurring in approximately every third anaesthetic), patients will be automatically&#xD;
      randomized by the ACG-Anesthesia system to either alert or no alert (blinded) status with the&#xD;
      intent of raising awareness on the part of the anaesthesia care team in the alert group of&#xD;
      the occurrence of extended hypotensive exposures and their associated risk, allowing the team&#xD;
      to render its best clinical judgment to initiate interventions aimed at bringing patients out&#xD;
      of progressive hypotensive states. With one interim analysis planned after two years, a total&#xD;
      of 56,248 patients are projected to be enrolled over a 4-year period for this trial to be&#xD;
      powered to detect a 0.3% absolute reduction in 30-day mortality, by saving at least 50 lives&#xD;
      in the alert group after two years (two-sided p&lt;0.016) or at least 70 lives (two-sided&#xD;
      p&lt;0.019) at the conclusion of the trial.&#xD;
