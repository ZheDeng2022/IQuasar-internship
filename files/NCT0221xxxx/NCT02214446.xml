      The purpose in this study was to investigate the current status, changes, correlation, and&#xD;
      predictive factors of the truth telling, hope, care burden, and quality of life during&#xD;
      treatment in primary caregivers of newly diagnosed children with cancer.&#xD;

      Background: Over the last 50 years, telling truth in adult with cancer was direct. However,&#xD;
      studies of truth telling in newly diagnosed children with cancer were seldom. Explore the&#xD;
      factors and experiences related to truth telling in primary caregivers of children newly&#xD;
      diagnosis with cancer were seldom too. Therefore, we could not estimate the current status of&#xD;
      truth telling in primary caregivers of newly diagnosed children with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The purpose in this study was to investigate the current status, changes,&#xD;
      correlation, and predictive factors of the truth telling, hope, care burden, and quality of&#xD;
      life during treatment in primary caregivers of newly diagnosed children with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Purposive sampling structured questionnaire, used longitudinal resistance, repeated&#xD;
      measurements, correlational design. SAS 9.3 for Windows was used for data entry and analyze.&#xD;
      By using the frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation to describe demographic&#xD;
      information and current status of truth telling. By using the mean, standard deviation,&#xD;
      maximum and minimum to analyze hope, care burden, and quality of life. Demographic&#xD;
      information, medical information data, truth telling, Herth Hope Index, caregiver burden&#xD;
      scale, and quality of life index were tested by Pearson correlation coefficients; the change&#xD;
      and predictors about truth telling, Herth Hope Index, caregiver burden scale, and quality of&#xD;
      life index were tested by Generalized estimating equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitation: Studying in one medical center in Taipei, it could not estimate the country's&#xD;
      primary caregivers of newly diagnosed children with cancer in conclusions. Because of the&#xD;
      limitation of the manpower, time and case numbers, study tracked only six month, could not be&#xD;
      assessed the long-term change of the Herth Hope Index, caregiver burden scale, truth telling&#xD;
      and quality of life in primary caregivers of newly diagnosed children with cancer.&#xD;

    <description>The scores of primary caregivers' Herth Hope Index change from baseline at family meeting at 3 months, and at 6 months.&#xD;
We use Herth Hope Index(HHI) to evaluate the hope that the primary caregivers' care their child during treatment.&#xD;
There are twelve questions in the Herth Hope Index. The total score is from 12 to 48. Cronbach's α is .89. Retest is .80. Two weeks retest is .86.&#xD;
The higher the score is, the greater the hope is.</description>

    <description>The scores of primary caregivers' quality of life index change from baseline at family meeting at 3 months, and at 6 months.&#xD;
We use quality of life index(Q.L.I) to evaluate the quality of life that the primary caregivers' care their child during treatment.&#xD;
There are 66 questions in the quality of life index. The total score is from 66 to 264. Cronbach's α is .95. Two weeks retest is .87.</description>

Asking the primary caregivers' about that if you tell your child that he/she got the cancer, if you tell your child that he/she the treatment in future, and if you tell your child that he/she the rate of survival.</description>

    <description>The scores of primary caregivers' care burden change from baseline at family meeting at 3 months, and at 6 months.&#xD;
We use Questionnaire of care burden to evaluate the care burde that the primary caregivers' care their child during treatment.&#xD;
There are 20 questions in the quality of life index. The total score is from 0 to 60. Cronbach's α is .91.&#xD;
The higher the score is, the heavier the care burden is.</description>
