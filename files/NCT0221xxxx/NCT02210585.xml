  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the level of spontaneous physical activity at 3 months after re-entrainment by&#xD;
      multi-site electrical stimulation (m-ES), measured by actigraphy over 7 days, compared to&#xD;
      conventional care (lifestyle and dietary advice and placebo (simulated) electrostimulation)&#xD;
      (control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the metabolic, inflammatory, cardiovascular and functional parameters, physical&#xD;
      activity, quality of life and quality of sleep, at 3 months and at 2 years in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a multicenter controlled study vs. reference care with randomization into two&#xD;
      parallel groups and double-blind (placebo electrostimulation). Patients will have the ES&#xD;
      material available at home and will be supervised by monthly visits over 3 months and by&#xD;
      telephone follow-up for two years. The study size calculation is based on physical activity,&#xD;
      the percentage of lean body mass and arterial stiffness measured in the OBEX study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will determine whether the training strategy is effective for increasing&#xD;
      physical activity and/or in inducing significant metabolic and cardiovascular effects in&#xD;
      these patients after 2 years. In addition, it provides a solid base of investigation for the&#xD;
      study of the interactions between muscle contraction and cardio-metabolic health with greater&#xD;
      precision.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and sleep apnea syndrome lead to metabolic troubles and increasing cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk. Furthermore, both diseases are associated with reduced exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many patients with morbid obesity, the implementation of physical activity programs&#xD;
      remains difficult for several reasons including the level of disability and psychosocial&#xD;
      causes (the scrutiny of others, depression and poorly adapted equipment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis: Neuromuscular electrostimulation is a way to increase spontaneous physical&#xD;
      activity (PA) in treated apneic obese patients with low spontaneous physical activity&#xD;
