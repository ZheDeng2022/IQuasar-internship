  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research trial studies using genomic profiling to recommend anticancer treatment to&#xD;
      patients with cancer that has spread beyond the original site of the tumor (metastatic&#xD;
      cancer). Genomic profiling studies the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a tumor to detect&#xD;
      genetic changes or abnormalities. This information can then be used to recommend treatments&#xD;
      that may be more likely to result in a beneficial response. It is not yet known whether&#xD;
      genomic profiling will detect abnormalities that can be used to make treatment&#xD;
      recommendations and whether treatment based on genomic profiling is more effective than&#xD;
      standard treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the feasibility of integrating tumor genomic profiling in the adult oncology clinic&#xD;
      at the Stanford Cancer Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the percentage of tumors that harbor &quot;actionable&quot; genomic changes. II. Explore&#xD;
      effects of individual molecular profiling including the percent of time that profiling&#xD;
      changes the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the number of cases in which a genomically identified targeted therapy is&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the clinical benefit of genomic based therapy, as defined by: response rate&#xD;
      (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 response criteria);&#xD;
      the percent of patients with non-progression at 4 months, and overall survival, in patients&#xD;
      whose therapy is selected based on profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine if circulating free tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood stream (liquid biopsy) yields&#xD;
      similar genomic results as the metastatic tumor analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine if ctDNA analysis during treatment correlates with RECIST 1.1 criteria in&#xD;
      predicting response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue samples are collected at baseline and blood for liquid biopsy is collected at baseline&#xD;
      and every 6-8 weeks during active treatment. Tissue samples are analyzed via sequencing for&#xD;
      tumor genomic profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of active treatment, participants are followed up at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <description>An actionable alteration is defined as availability of targeted therapy, scored as: A) an FDA-approved drug, B) an FDA-approved drug in another tumor type, or C) a drug that is not yet approved but has a clinical trial open. The percentage of patients in the &quot;profile&quot; arm with successful profiling will be calculated and further characterized by availability category.</description>
