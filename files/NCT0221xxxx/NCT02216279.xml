    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension or elevation of the pressure in the pulmonary vessels, results from&#xD;
      various clinical conditions. It may be idiopathic (of unknown cause) or associated with&#xD;
      numerous diseases including cardiovascular and lung disorders. Affected individuals suffer&#xD;
      from progressive shortness of breath and, in its most sever forms; pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      carries a worse prognosis than many types of cancer. There is no test currently that can&#xD;
      easily and non-invasively detect abnormalities of the pulmonary circulation. Presently there&#xD;
      is no cure for pulmonary hypertension and substantial research efforts are dedicated to the&#xD;
      development of new drugs that will stop progression or better yet, reverse the disease&#xD;
      process. The investigators do not know if any of the drugs currently commercialized for&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension directly improve the status of the pulmonary vessels since no test&#xD;
      currently provides this information. Direct earlier detection of lung vessel abnormalities&#xD;
      associated with pulmonary hypertension using a sensitive and non-invasive test would allow&#xD;
      not only earlier testing of these and of new drugs, but would provide a much better surrogate&#xD;
      of disease severity allowing more efficient pre-clinical drug testing. The aim of this phase&#xD;
      II study is to evaluate the safety of PulmoBind in participants with pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      and its potential to detect abnormal pulmonary circulation associated within pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;

      Currently there is only one radiopharmaceutical agent approved in Canada (and the world) for&#xD;
      clinical imaging of the pulmonary circulation, metastable isotope 99 of technetium. This&#xD;
      agent is exclusively used for the diagnosis of physical defects of the circulation due to&#xD;
      pulmonary embolus. There is imperative need for new lung tracers that will provide a greater&#xD;
      safety profile while enabling functional as well as anatomical imaging of the pulmonary&#xD;
      circulation. A novel adrenomedullin derivative has been developed, for molecular imaging of&#xD;
      the pulmonary circulation. PulmoBind is labelled with metastable isotope 99 of technetium,&#xD;
      the most commonly used imaging isotope in clinical nuclear medicine. PulmoBind is a&#xD;
      adrenomedullin derivative specifically designed to bind to the adrenomedullin receptor while&#xD;
      avoiding any hemodynamic effects. This novel tracer has the potential to help in the&#xD;
      diagnosis and follow-up of various disorders of the pulmonary circulation for which there is&#xD;
      currently no alternative. In PulmoBind I three escalating doses were administered and safety&#xD;
      was assessed. The product was well tolerated and there were no safety concerns. Imaging&#xD;
      revealed predominant lung uptake.&#xD;
