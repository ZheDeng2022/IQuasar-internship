      â€¢ Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CENTER-TBI (Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI)&#xD;
      (www.center-tbi.eu) is a project embedded within the International Initiative on TBI Research&#xD;
      (InTBIR) (http://intbir.nih.gov/), as a collaboration between the European Commission (EC),&#xD;
      the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NIH-NINDS) and the Canadian&#xD;
      Institute of Health Research (CIHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic concept of this project is to exploit the existing heterogeneity in biology, care&#xD;
      and outcome of TBI patients to discover underlying pathophysiology, to refine&#xD;
      characterisation, and to identify effective clinical interventions. The key driver of our&#xD;
      research plan is to collect data from a large number of European centres and sufficiently&#xD;
      large cohort to enable 'Comparative effectiveness research' (CER) analyses of differences in&#xD;
      clinical care and management pathways in TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improved disease characterization will aid Precision Medicine, a concept recently enunciated&#xD;
      by the US National Academy of Science. Such improved characterization and stratification will&#xD;
      allow for more targeted therapies. Further, CER provides a promising framework to identify&#xD;
      best practices and improve outcome after TBI. CER is the generation and synthesis of evidence&#xD;
      that compares the benefits and harms of alternative methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and&#xD;
      monitor a clinical condition or to improve the delivery of care. The purpose of CER is to&#xD;
      assist consumers, clinicians, purchasers, and policy makers to make informed decisions that&#xD;
      will improve health care at both the individual and population levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large core cohort of patients across the severity spectrum in TBI will be recruited at&#xD;
      approximately 77 sites in Europe and Israel (the CENTER-TBI Core Study): 5400 patients&#xD;
      differentiated into 3 equal strata of approximately 1800:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ER stratum: patients seen and discharged from the ER;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission stratum: patients admitted to the hospital but not to the ICU;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ICU stratum: patients admitted directly to the ICU. Balance in numbers between the&#xD;
           strata will be aimed for, but sites will be allowed to arrange recruitment strategies to&#xD;
           best suit their local requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The core cohort will be underpinned by comparison with a larger registry (the CENTER-TBI&#xD;
      registry) based on pragmatic data collection of all patients with TBI seen in participating&#xD;
      centres (to establish the internal generalizability of our study), and by comparison with&#xD;
      national trauma registries (to establish the external generalizability of our findings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the core cohort, detailed data will be collected on clinical parameters, neuroimaging&#xD;
      studies, biomarker analyses, DNA analyses, and longitudinal outcome assessments. In selected&#xD;
      centres, extended studies will additionally focus on advanced magnetic resonance (MR)&#xD;
      imaging, detailed coagulation profiling and high resolution ICU monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size estimate (n=5400) was based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Practical logistic considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Power calculations for the different strata, targeting comparative effectiveness&#xD;
           analyses, assuming a between-centre and between-country heterogeneity as identified in&#xD;
           previous research (expressed by variance parameter from a random effects model, Tau^2 of&#xD;
           0.431)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postulated odds ratios for intervention effects of approximately 5% improvement in&#xD;
           outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, these calculations provided a statistical power to detect odds ratios of ~1.2&#xD;
      associated with differences in process or intervention variables across the core dataset with&#xD;
      a power of 80%; and require somewhat larger odds ratios in each of the three individual&#xD;
      strata. In the registry we expect to be able to detect differences (predominantly in&#xD;
      organizational or system variables) with an odds ratio of 1.2 with a power of 82%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality control and assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous monitoring of enrolment and completeness of data will be performed by ICON as&#xD;
      contract research organization (CRO). Source data verification (SDV) will be performed in 10%&#xD;
      of subjects by the CRO. The quality of data collection will be further enhanced by&#xD;
      implementing automated data entry checks for impossible/implausible values and implementing&#xD;
      data checks for consistency between variables. A task force of study personnel will evaluate&#xD;
      the completeness, consistency and validity of submitted data and function as support desk for&#xD;
      participating sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to upload to the study database, all acquired data will be stored locally. All patients&#xD;
      will be allocated a random Global Unique Personal Identification number (GUPI) which will be&#xD;
      linked locally to hospital identifiers. All uploaded data will be de-identified and images&#xD;
      will be defaced prior to upload. While blood samples and clinical data will be linked, both&#xD;
      sets of data will be kept confidential and anonymised beyond the initial stage of correlation&#xD;
      for analysis. All imaging and electronic data will be kept on individually password protected&#xD;
      servers. All clinical data will be entered into electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) and&#xD;
      managed by the 'QuesGen data management platform' (http://www.quesgen.com/) which will be&#xD;
      developed in collaboration with Karolinska Institutet International Neuroinformatics&#xD;
      Coordinating Faculty (KI-INCF). As data is entered into each form, the system will run data&#xD;
      validation checks that include conditionally required data, validation across fields, and&#xD;
      validation requirements based on subject type. If any validation check fails, the user is&#xD;
      alerted immediately that the data does not meet Quality Assurance (QA) criteria and the issue&#xD;
      can be addressed and corrected at that point. All de-identified electronic study data in the&#xD;
      CENTER-TBI database will be stored securely in the European data space under supervision of&#xD;
      KI-INCF for the duration of subject enrolment and follow-up and for a period afterwards for&#xD;
      data analysis and preparation of publications. We estimate that the analysis and publication&#xD;
      period will last for several years after the conclusion of subject enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together with QuesGen Systems, KI-INCF will ensure that data standards are established for&#xD;
      the data model e.g. conformity of field formats, field codes and names to ensure consistency&#xD;
      across all datasets. Any approved changes will be fully documented with dataset updates to&#xD;
      maintain data quality and accuracy. KI-INCF will be responsible for importing cleaned&#xD;
      datasets to other analytic platforms as determined by the coordinators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where applicable, information relevant to the patient's care will be made available to the&#xD;
      physician responsible. Data, including blood samples collected as part of this study will be&#xD;
      shared in an anonymised form with collaborators from other European states (this is part of a&#xD;
      European Commission Framework7 funded program), and with selected collaborators in other&#xD;
      countries who form part of an emerging International Traumatic Brain Injury Research&#xD;
      initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computing platform and Neuroinformatics Resource:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The KI-INCF will coordinate the establishment of an informatics platform for acquisition,&#xD;
      storage and analysis of CDE-based clinical data. The goal is to develop a next generation&#xD;
      open standards-based platform to support advanced large-scale analytics and model building.&#xD;
      Such a platform also provides a model for future clinical studies on brain diseases and&#xD;
      disorders. This development will receive additional support from One Mind for Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses for the Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) questions will&#xD;
      primarily apply random effects modelling, in which center is included at the higher level,&#xD;
      and patients are considered clustered within centers. In some analyses, higher levels of&#xD;
      clustering will also be considered, e.g. country, or European region; or lower levels, e.g.&#xD;
      physicians within hospitals. Confounding factors as measured at the individual patient and/or&#xD;
      center level, will be considered extensively, and will be targeted to the specific research&#xD;
      question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses for better characterization of TBI will be exploratory, aiming to better&#xD;
      understand the complexity of the disease and to discover new associations. In addition to&#xD;
      standard statistical descriptive and inferential techniques, we will also employ novel&#xD;
      machine learning techniques as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic analyses will consider a range of variables, including genetic, demographic and&#xD;
      clinical data, physiological signals, imaging results, and biomarkers as predictors of early&#xD;
      endpoints and physiologic derangement (e.g. raised ICP), and late outcome, including&#xD;
      mortality, functional outcome, quality of life and neuropsychological performance. Previously&#xD;
      and newly developed prediction models will be validated by comparison of observed to&#xD;
      predicted outcome risks, with predictive performance summarized by measures for model fit,&#xD;
      discrimination, and calibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every effort will be made to limit the number of missing data in the CENTER-TBI study.&#xD;
      Missing values are, however, inherent to any clinical study. Missing values may confound the&#xD;
      descriptive, prognostic and CER analyses. Thus, appropriate techniques for dealing with&#xD;
      missing values are required. First, we will evaluate the various reasons for missingness per&#xD;
      centre. Next, we will explore the use of alternative statistical approaches, including&#xD;
      inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation. We will consider missing values in&#xD;
      baseline characteristics as well as in short and long term outcomes. Based on simulation&#xD;
      studies and practical considerations we will develop standard operating procedures towards&#xD;
      the analyses with missing values, respecting the differences in multiple research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent procedures will follow local and national requirements in all cases. We&#xD;
      anticipate that many potential patients will not be able to consent themselves to participate&#xD;
      in this project. The nature of TBI means that some patients may lack capacity to decide to&#xD;
      participate in this study especially at the earliest time point. It is important to try and&#xD;
      include these patients to ensure that representative samples of patients are included to&#xD;
      avoid bias in the study findings. Every step will be taken to ensure that a test of capacity&#xD;
      is undertaken before a decision on a person's capacity to consent or not to consent to&#xD;
      participation in research is taken. If the subject is not capable of self-consent, all&#xD;
      efforts will be made to locate a legally acceptable representative to act on behalf of the&#xD;
      subject. When a legally acceptable representative (e.g. consultee/proxy) is identified, their&#xD;
      opinion will be sought about the potential participant's wishes and feelings in relation to&#xD;
      the project, and whether he or she would have wanted to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are free to withdraw, or be withdrawn by their consultee/proxy if appropriate, at&#xD;
      any point in the study, and they need not state a reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CENTER-TBI project will contribute towards the overall goals of InTBIR, by identifying&#xD;
      more effective and efficient treatment provision, thus improving outcome and reducing costs.&#xD;
      The science in the project will provide novel information on disease processes, treatment,&#xD;
      outcome, and prognosis in TBI, identifying new therapeutic targets and therapies; while the&#xD;
      CENTER-TBI repositories will ensure opportunities for legacy research. Thus, the project has&#xD;
      the potential to improve current health care and its delivery at both population and&#xD;
      individual levels, deliver early scientific advances that could improve the care of patients&#xD;
      with TBI, and provide a rich investment for future biomedical research.&#xD;
