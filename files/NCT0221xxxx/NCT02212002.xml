  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The colonization of the neonatal gastro-intestinal (GI) tract begins at birth and is&#xD;
      influenced by several factors, such as mode of delivery, gestational age, maternal intestinal&#xD;
      and vaginal microbiota, type of feeding, hospitalization after birth and use of antibiotics&#xD;
      and probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut microbiota of term infants, vaginally delivered and exclusively breastfed, shows a low&#xD;
      count of C. difficile and E. coli and a high number of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, which&#xD;
      positively influence the host's immunity processes; hence, is considered to be ideally&#xD;
      healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B Streptococcus (GBS) represents one of the most important causes of neonatal&#xD;
      infections and sepsis. Infants vaginally delivered may acquire GBS during the birth process&#xD;
      from maternal vagina, cervix or rectum, where it resides in 10-20% of pregnant women. In the&#xD;
      last decade, the incidence of early-onset GBS sepsis is significantly reduced, due to the&#xD;
      introduction of GBS universal screening during late pregnancy and consequent intrapartum&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) in GBS-positive women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of antibiotics in early life is shown to alter the commensal gut microbiota, thereby&#xD;
      impairing the balance between health and disease later in life. The effect of IAP on&#xD;
      bacterial colonization of the infant's gut, however, has not been largely investigated. The&#xD;
      investigators have previously evaluated the effect of IAP in a relatively small sample of&#xD;
      exclusively breast-fed term infants vaginally delivered by means of molecular techniques; at&#xD;
      7 days of life there were several differences in microbiota composition between infants&#xD;
      IAP-exposed and not exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational prospective study thus aims to evaluate these differences in further&#xD;
      detail, expanding the initial sample to formula-fed term infants and following up infants&#xD;
      until one month of age. By including formula-fed infants, the investigators additionally aim&#xD;
      to evaluate the influence of feeding type on the neonatal microbiota composition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At birth, the neonatal gastro-intestinal (GI) tract is rapidly colonized by maternal and&#xD;
      environmental bacteria; the first colonizers are generally aerobes and facultative anaerobes,&#xD;
      followed by strict anaerobes (e.g. Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., and Clostridium&#xD;
      spp.). The composition of gut microbiota is influenced by several factors, such as mode of&#xD;
      delivery, gestational age, maternal intestinal and vaginal microbiota, type of feeding,&#xD;
      hospitalization after birth and use of antibiotics and probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut microbiota of term infants, vaginally delivered and exclusively breastfed, is considered&#xD;
      to be ideally healthy, with a low count of C. difficile and E. coli and a high number of&#xD;
      Bidifobacteria and Lactobacilli, which positively influence the host's health by activating&#xD;
      immunocompetent cells in the GI tract, promoting the production of secretory IgA and&#xD;
      increasing the bactericidal activity of neutrophils and cell-mediated immunity such as NK&#xD;
      cell activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is one of the most important causes of neonatal infections and&#xD;
      sepsis. Infants vaginally delivered may acquire GBS during the birth process from maternal&#xD;
      vagina, cervix or rectum, where it resides in approximately 10-20% of pregnant women. Since&#xD;
      the mid-90s, the incidence of early-onset GBS sepsis is significantly reduced, due to the&#xD;
      introduction of GBS universal screening during late pregnancy and consequent intrapartum&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) in GBS-positive women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data suggest that the use of antibiotics in early life could alter the commensal gut&#xD;
      microbiota, thereby impairing the balance between health and disease later in life. The&#xD;
      effect of IAP on bacterial colonization of the infant's gut has not been largely&#xD;
      investigated. Moreover, currently available data on this issue largely derive from studies&#xD;
      performed using culture-based techniques; however, accurate culture-based results are&#xD;
      influenced by the selection of the correct media, temperature, oxygen content and time for&#xD;
      growth, and for this reason as little as 10-50% of the entire gut bacteria are easily&#xD;
      cultured. Molecular techniques, based on the amplification of the 16S ribosomal bacterial RNA&#xD;
      gene to differentiate prokaryotic taxa, have been recently developed for the study of gut&#xD;
      microbiota, thus enabling a more detailed characterization of bacterial communities than&#xD;
      standard culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously evaluated the effect of IAP in a relatively small sample of exclusively&#xD;
      breast-fed term infants vaginally delivered by means of molecular techniques; at 7 days of&#xD;
      life there were several differences in microbiota composition between infants IAP-exposed and&#xD;
      not exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present paper is thus to evaluate these differences in further detail,&#xD;
      expanding the initial sample and following up infants until one month of age. Influences of&#xD;
      type of feeding on microbiota composition are also explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy term infants, vaginally delivered, with birth weight adequate for gestational age,&#xD;
      and whose mothers had been screened for GBS at 35-37 weeks gestation, are enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants are excluded if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  preterm or small/large for gestational age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  born by caesarean section&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the mother has received any antibiotic in the 4 weeks before delivery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maternal IAP is performed for reasons other than GBS positivity (i.e. prolonged rupture&#xD;
           of membranes in GBS-negative women);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maternal IAP is inadequate;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maternal IAP is performed with antibiotics other than ampicillin, such as erythromycin;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the infant has major congenital malformations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the infant develops signs of infection and/or received any antibiotic treatment after&#xD;
           birth;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the infant has any serious clinical conditions that contraindicated his/her&#xD;
           participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants are allocated into two groups according to maternal GBS status and IAP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IAP group: infants born to GBS-positive mothers who have received adequate IAP.&#xD;
           According to the Institutional treatment protocol for GBS prophylaxis (derived from CDC&#xD;
           guidelines), iv ampicillin is given every 4 hours until delivery (first dose 2 g,&#xD;
           following doses 1 g each). IAP is considered adequate if the mother has received at&#xD;
           least two doses of ampicillin before delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: infants born to GBS-negative mothers, who do not receive any antibiotic&#xD;
           treatment before/at delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent is obtained from each infant's parent/legal guardian when the infant&#xD;
      is about to be discharged from the nursery (48-72 hours of life). Patients' characteristics,&#xD;
      including gestational age, birth weight, gender, and Apgar score at 1' and 5' after birth,&#xD;
      are summarized in a specific case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two faecal samples from each infant are collected during follow up visits at 7 and 30 days of&#xD;
      life. At each visit, information on weight gain, clinical conditions, feeding, and on-going&#xD;
      treatments (i.e. use of prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics), are collected from the infants'&#xD;
      parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collection, faecal samples are put into numbered screw-capped sterile plastic&#xD;
      containers and immediately frozen at -80 °C, until they are processed for bacterial DNA&#xD;
      extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological analyses are performed at the Department of Agricultural Sciences, University&#xD;
      of Bologna. Investigators who perform the analyses are blind to group identity of the infants&#xD;
      (IAP or control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred milligrams of faeces are used for bacterial DNA extraction using the QIAamp DNA&#xD;
      Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, West Sussex, UK). Extracted DNA is stored at -80 °C. The purity and&#xD;
      concentration of extracted DNA are determined by measuring the ratio of the absorbance at 260&#xD;
      and 280 nm (Infinite® 200 PRO NanoQuant, Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantification of selected microbial groups (Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp.,&#xD;
      Bacteroides fragilis) is performed with real-time PCR. Data obtained from amplification are&#xD;
      transformed to obtain the number of bacterial cells per gram of faeces, expressed as log&#xD;
      colony forming unit (CFU)/g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obtained data are analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistic version 20.0.0 (IBM Corporation, IBM&#xD;
      Corporation Armonk, New York, United States). Baseline characteristics in the IAP and control&#xD;
      groups are compared using the independent-samples Mann-Whitney U test for continuous&#xD;
      variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. The influence of IAP on faecal&#xD;
      bacterial count at 7 and 30 days of life will is evaluated using the independent-samples&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis is performed in order to&#xD;
      estimate the effect of IAP on faecal bacterial count after controlling for type of infant&#xD;
      feeding (coded as a binary categorical variable: exclusive breastfeeding vs. any formula&#xD;
      feeding). A p value &lt;0.05 is considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
