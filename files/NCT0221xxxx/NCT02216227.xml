    <textblock>
      The goals of this project are 1) to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      checklist to prevent MRSA SSIs among Veterans undergoing TJA or cardiac surgery, and 2) to&#xD;
      assess barriers and facilitators to checklist implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The SSI checklist will be effective at reducing MRSA SSIs among total joint arthroplasty&#xD;
           and cardiac surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implementation of the checklist will be associated with an overall reduction in SSIs&#xD;
           caused by all pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The SSI Checklist will be cost-saving since it will prevent many expensive SSIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Preoperative MRSA testing will be a modifiable barrier to implementing the SSI&#xD;
           checklist.&#xD;

      Aims and Design: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), accounts for an&#xD;
      estimated 94,000 invasive infections and 19,000 deaths annually in the U.S. In order to&#xD;
      prevent MRSA infections among Veterans, the VA successfully implemented the VA MRSA&#xD;
      Prevention Initiative that has reduced patient-to-patient transmission of MRSA. However, this&#xD;
      Initiative does not prevent most MRSA surgical site infections (SSIs) because MRSA SSIs are&#xD;
      usually caused by MRSA transferring from a patient's nose to their own surgical incision&#xD;
      site. Cardiac surgery and total joint arthroplasty (TJA; e.g. hip or knee surgery) are among&#xD;
      the most common operations performed by the VA and are associated with particularly high&#xD;
      clinical and economic impact. In order to eliminate MRSA SSIs in the VA, the study group&#xD;
      developed a checklist based on a meta-analysis of studies that assessed methods to prevent&#xD;
      gram-positive SSIs among TJA and cardiac surgery patients. This SSI Checklist includes&#xD;
      preoperatively testing a surgical patient's nose for asymptomatic MRSA colonization. If the&#xD;
      patient is MRSA colonized, s/he will be treated with prophylactic nasal mupirocin ointment,&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate baths, and antibiotic prophylaxis with both cefazolin and vancomycin.&#xD;
      The SSI Checklist will be implemented in 10 VA Medical Centers (VAMCs). A high-quality&#xD;
      quasi-experimental study, with a qualitative process evaluation will be performed to assess&#xD;
      the SSI Checklist. The goals of this project are 1) to assess the effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the checklist to prevent MRSA SSIs among Veterans undergoing TJA or&#xD;
      cardiac surgery, and 2) to assess barriers and facilitators to checklist implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study includes both quantitative and qualitative components. In the&#xD;
      quantitative component, the SSI Checklist will be implemented in 10 VAMCs for 3 years and&#xD;
      outcomes will be compared between the intervention group and two control groups: 1) 5 years&#xD;
      of historic data from the same 10 VAMCs, 2) 8 years (5 historic year and 3 intervention&#xD;
      years) of concurrent data from other VAMCs that did not implement the SSI Checklist. Study&#xD;
      endpoints will include: 1) MRSA SSIs as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention (CDC); 2) SSIs caused by other pathogens; 3) cost per SSI prevented, cost per&#xD;
      life-saved, cost per MRSA SSI prevented and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved.&#xD;
      VA databases including VA National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP), VA Decision&#xD;
      Support System, VA Inpatient Evaluation Center (IPEC) and Veterans' Informatics &amp; Computing&#xD;
      Infrastructure (VINCI) will be used to collect data. Time series analysis and linear mixed&#xD;
      effects models will be used for the statistical analysis. In the qualitative component, a&#xD;
      process evaluation will be conducted at 6 different VAMCs, which includes collecting data&#xD;
      before, during and after implementation, to examine the contextual factors and stakeholder&#xD;
      perspectives that influence adoption of the SSI Checklist. Observations and semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted in Years 1 and 3, along with thematic content analysis, to&#xD;
      examine facilitators and barriers to the implementation at the different study sites. The&#xD;
      Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research will be used to guide the process&#xD;
      evaluation and provide the foundation for a systematic evaluation of local contextual factors&#xD;
      that influence implementation of the SSI Checklist. The products of this study include a&#xD;
      validated SSI Checklist, a business-case analysis, an implementation toolkit, and a team&#xD;
      experienced in checklist implementation for prevention of infections. At the end of this&#xD;
      study period, the study team will meet with operational partners including National&#xD;
      Infectious Disease Program Office (NIDS) and the MRSA / Multidrug-resistant Program Office&#xD;
      (MDRO), and the National Center for Occupational Health and Infection Control (COHIC) to&#xD;
      discuss implementing this checklist nationwide as part of the VA MRSA Prevention Initiative.&#xD;
      This study has high potential to significantly decrease SSI, and in turn morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality due to SSIs, in our Nation's Veterans.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators chose 90-days rather than 1 year for the primary outcome measure since not all patients in the study will be able to be followed for 1 year due to the timing of the study. However, since the investigators will be able to follow 83% of the cohort for 1-year post-operatively, the investigators will perform this secondary analysis in which the investigators will include only patients who were followed for one year. However, it is unlikely that the 90-day analysis and 1 year analysis will differ significantly because over 75% of SSIs are detected within 30 days, in fact most SSI manifest within 22 days.</description>

    <description>The investigators will test bacterial isolates from MRSA positive patients at the 10 interventions sites. The VA is mandated to take nasal swabs from each patient preoperatively. For those patients who are MRSA positive, the investigators will have the bacterial isolates sent to the Iowa City site to be tested for resistance to mupirocin and CHG. The investigators will also collect bacterial isolates from patients who experience surgical site infections during the study. These isolates will also be tested for mupirocin and CHG resistance.&#xD;
The purpose of this testing is to a) ensure the investigators' study checklist does not cause mupirocin or CHG resistance by b) determining if resistance was present at the initial nasal swab, or if resistance occurred after performance of study checklist.</description>

    <description>The purpose of this research is to evaluate a SSI checklist. This checklist includes decolonizing a patient's nose and skin and optimizing antibiotics prior to surgery. At the time that we wrote it, the predominate product to decolonize patient's noses was mupirocin. However, in 2017, an FDA final monograph stated that nasal povidone-iodine may be used for pre-surgical decolonization. Nasal povidone-iodine should be able to overcome barriers to checklist implementation that we identified in Aim 3. We now plan to replace the nasal agent mupirocin with the nasal agent povidone-iodine at 3 participating medical centers (Iowa City VA, Minneapolis VA and Portland VA) to assess whether this overcomes the barriers to our SSI checklist.</description>
