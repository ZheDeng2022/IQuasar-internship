  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4 cohort prospective, open, national, multicentre study that collects data on&#xD;
      history of patients treated chronically with anticoagulant drugs, including the novel direct&#xD;
      oral anticoagulants (DOACs). The Registry is designed solely for observational purposes and&#xD;
      is not intended to have any influence on the treatment of the single patients included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are included when they start the anticoagulant treatment, whatever the drug used, or&#xD;
      when they shift from a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) drug to one of the novel direct oral&#xD;
      anticoagulants, provided that the therapy is expected to last at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aims of the study are to provide a better evaluation of efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      different treatment options, and to improve our understanding of the risks/benefits of the&#xD;
      various anticoagulant drugs and the different therapy options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registry is open to the participation of clinical centres or individual professionals&#xD;
      (now called Participants) that are involved with management of anticoagulated patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants can include patients with 18 years or more who satisfy the following preset&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants should included patients consecutively to avoid selection bias; criteria to&#xD;
           avoid selection bias are proposed to Participants, which should decide the one they want&#xD;
           to adopt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients should have been receiving anticoagulation therapy for no more than 30 days at&#xD;
           the time of inclusion, regardless of age, clinical indication for treatment, therapeutic&#xD;
           range expected (in cases of treatment with VKAs) and expected duration of the treatment&#xD;
           (providing a duration of at least 3 months is foreseen). Patients who have already been&#xD;
           receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy for some time may be included if they are&#xD;
           switched from VKAs to DOACs or to low molecular weight heparin or to fondaparinux&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients not prepared to undergo constant monitoring at their enrolling centres or who&#xD;
           take part in phase II or III clinical studies should not be included. Patients who&#xD;
           participate in other observational or phase IV studies can be included in the Register.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients must give their informed written consent -- following procedures laid down&#xD;
           by local Ethical Committees - for the compilation and conservation on the Register's&#xD;
           central database of data regarding their personal clinical histories and anticoagulation&#xD;
           treatment patterns and for use of said data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the patients inserted must be followed for at least 1 year, even though an&#xD;
           indefinite follow-up of all patients continuing anticoagulation therapy is highly&#xD;
           recommended. If in single patients anticoagulation treatment is discontinued within 1&#xD;
           year of inclusion, active participating members should nonetheless keep on compiling&#xD;
           (telephonically too) information regarding the possible onset of complications&#xD;
           (thrombotic, bleeding clinical events of another nature) till 1 year -follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Participants of the Register must use a computer programme as database - for all the&#xD;
           information to be collected. The computer programme must meet the features requested by&#xD;
           the Executive Committee of the Registry and must be able to send the information to the&#xD;
           centralised database via internet and connection to the web site. By way of alternative&#xD;
           the Participants can use the &quot;Simple-START&quot; software provided free by the Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As criterion for safeguarding the privacy of patients, every patient inserted in the&#xD;
           Registry is identified by a &quot;Patient log&quot; which includes the identification code of the&#xD;
           enrolling Participant and the identification code of each single patient, using the&#xD;
           computer database programme used by the Participant. The enrolling Participant is&#xD;
           committed to keeping for the whole duration of the Register the whole demographic data&#xD;
           of each patient associated with the Patient log&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are excluded patients who: have &lt; 18 years age, are not willing to sign informed&#xD;
           consent, are not ready to submit to constant monitoring, participate in phase II or III&#xD;
           clinical studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-Up All the patients inserted must be followed for at least 1 year even though an&#xD;
           indefinite follow up of all patients continuing anticoagulation therapy is strongly&#xD;
           recommended. If anticoagulation therapy is interrupted in single patients within 1 year&#xD;
           of insertion the Participants must still continue to collect (even telephonically) data&#xD;
           regarding the possible onset of complications (thrombotic, bleeding or other clinical&#xD;
           events) for 1 year of follow-up.&#xD;

        inclusion for VKA treated patients: one week per month, or one day per week (always the&#xD;
        same), etc. For patients treated with DOACs (low number in our country) it is recommended&#xD;
        to include all patients progressively&#xD;
