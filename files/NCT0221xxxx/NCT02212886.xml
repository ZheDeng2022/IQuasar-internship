  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  This is a phase IIa study in which GA Depot 80 or 40mg is administered as an IM&#xD;
           injection to subjects with RRMS at 4 week intervals for 52 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The purpose of the study is to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a monthly&#xD;
           long-acting IM injection of 80 or 40mg GA Depot in subjects with RRMS. The study will&#xD;
           include subjects switching from daily or thrice weekly administration of 20 mg or 40mg&#xD;
           respectively of glatiramer acetate (GA, i.e., Copaxone®) injection&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  25 Subjects with a diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who are&#xD;
           treated with daily or thrice weekly subcutaneous injections of 20 mg or 40 mg&#xD;
           respectively of GA (Copaxone®) during the previous 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study product is GA long-acting injection (GA Depot) which is a combination of&#xD;
           extended-release microspheres for injection and diluent (water for injection) for&#xD;
           parenteral use. GA Depot will be administered intramuscularly (IM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study duration for an individual subject in the core study will be 60 weeks,&#xD;
           consisting of 4 weeks of screening evaluation (weeks -4 to 0), followed by a 52-week&#xD;
           open-label treatment period, and a 4 weeks follow up period: through a total of 17&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For both arms, subjects who completed 13 injections and who consented (by signing an&#xD;
           informed consent) are able to enter the optional 8 years extension period. During the&#xD;
           extension period subjects will receive 40 mg of GA Depot IM once every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical, vital signs and safety assessment - will be performed at each visit during the&#xD;
           whole study. Physical examination will be performed quarterly during the extension&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI at visit 1 (screenings), at week 24, week 52 (end of core study) and every 6 months&#xD;
           during the extension period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological and safety laboratory tests at screening visit, on visits in weeks 4, 12,&#xD;
           24, 36, 52 (end of core study) and every 6 months during the extension period.&#xD;
