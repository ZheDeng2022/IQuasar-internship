  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a new group therapy&#xD;
      program for adolescents with Type 1 diabetes and compromised metabolic control (high A1c).&#xD;
      This intervention is aimed at addressing issues frequently found to be associated with poor&#xD;
      control: knowledge deficits, parental supervision, parent-teen communication and psychosocial&#xD;
      barriers. In order to test this new group therapy program, adolescents' HA1c and psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning will be monitored pre- and post-intervention. It is hypothesized that individuals&#xD;
      who participate in the group therapy program will show an improvement in their HA1c levels&#xD;
      and quality of life, self-efficacy, supportive behaviors from family members, readiness to&#xD;
      make improvements in their diabetes care and decrease symptoms of depression.&#xD;

      Basic Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will pilot a group therapy intervention for adolescents seen in the diabetes&#xD;
      clinic who have had elevated HA1c's for at least 3 months. This group will be offered in fall&#xD;
      of 2014. Group therapy sessions will include 8 teen sessions that cover the following topics:&#xD;
      acceptance of diabetes, family issues, division of diabetes management, communication and&#xD;
      facilitating motivation and skill development to improve diabetes care. Motivational&#xD;
      interviewing and cognitive behavioral techniques will be the therapeutic modalities used in&#xD;
      sessions. Parents will be involved in 3 therapy sessions that cover topics regarding family&#xD;
      functioning, division of responsibility and parenting strategies. Participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires measuring self-efficacy, family support, quality of life, readiness to change&#xD;
      and symptoms of depression. Questionnaires will be administered at an initial assessment&#xD;
      prior to participation in the group, at completion of the 8 week program, at a follow-up&#xD;
      visit 2 months following the completion of the group and 1 year post-intervention.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will take approximately 45 minutes to complete. HA1c levels will be evaluated&#xD;
      for participants every 3 months as per regular clinic care. This intervention program will be&#xD;
      offered to teens upon an elevated HA1c result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HA1c levels will be tested every three months as per regular clinic care. Basic demographic&#xD;
      information will be obtained from participants during the initial assessment for the group&#xD;
      (age, family size, and date of diagnosis of diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial functioning will be evaluated pre- and post-intervention by having participants&#xD;
      and their parents fill out the following questionnaires: Self-efficacy for Diabetes Scale&#xD;
      (SED); Diabetes Quality of Life for Youths; Diabetes Family Behavior Scale; Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory for Youth (BDI-Y); Diabetes Management Questionnaire; Child Behavior Checklist&#xD;
      (Parent form); Low Blood Sugar Survey, and Children's Hope Scale.&#xD;
