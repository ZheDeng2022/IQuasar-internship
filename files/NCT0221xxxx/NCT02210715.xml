  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People infected with HIV are living longer thanks to the use of antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (cART). In aging HIV persons, other factors are associated with early death. One of the major&#xD;
      factors is liver disease, which can be due to liver infections or reasons such as fatty&#xD;
      liver. Fatty liver in the general population is a serious problem, affecting 30% of Canadian&#xD;
      population. A specific type of fatty liver characterized by much inflammation, named&#xD;
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can lead to cirrhosis and death. Persons living with HIV&#xD;
      can be at increased risk of NASH because of toxic effect of certain types of cART on the&#xD;
      liver, obesity and other metabolic factors (for example diabetes). Some scientific data&#xD;
      suggest that newer cART are associated with less fatty liver and liver damage. However, NASH&#xD;
      has not been studied in detail in persons living with HIV. One reason for the lack of&#xD;
      research is one of the only ways to detect liver disease is to undergo liver biopsy which can&#xD;
      be painful and has complications. Recently, a new non-invasive technology (Fibroscan) has&#xD;
      been developed which can tell doctors how much a liver is damaged and how much fat it&#xD;
      contains without pain or complications. Moreover, a simple test measuring a specific protein&#xD;
      in the blood, the cytokeratin 18 (CK-18), can help the diagnosis of NASH. We will study the&#xD;
      effect of switching cART to newer types of HIV medication in patients with a non-invasive&#xD;
      diagnosis of NASH done by Fibroscan and cytokeratin 18. We expect that switching older cART&#xD;
      to less hepatotoxic drugs will lead to improvement of liver damage, fatty liver and NASH&#xD;
      diagnosed by Fibroscan and cytokeratin 18. To evaluate this approach we plan to recruit 58&#xD;
      consenting HIV mono infected patients with non-invasive diagnosis of NASH and/or fatty liver&#xD;
      with liver damage. Participants will undergo Fibroscan, a blood test for cytokeratin 18, a&#xD;
      complete physical examination and laboratory tests every 3 months for 12 months, then at 18&#xD;
      and 24 months. The effect of the switching of HIV medications will be recorded. We anticipate&#xD;
      that the current study will provide evidence for reduction of inflammation and liver damage&#xD;
      with newer cART for treatment of HIV infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current Non-invasive tools for liver fibrosis and fatty liver/NASH, including Fibroscan/CAP&#xD;
      and serum cytokeratin 18 (CK-18), are accurate and ideal for screening and monitoring. To&#xD;
      date, there has been no study using these accurate non-invasive tools to prospectively&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of switching cART to raltegravir in HIV mono-infected patients with&#xD;
      suppressed HIV RNA who have evidence of fatty liver and/or significant liver fibrosis in&#xD;
      order to determine whether such a strategy may slow fibrosis and steatosis progression rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a candidate for screening has been identified, study details will be carefully discussed&#xD;
      with the subject. The subject will be asked to read and sign the approved informed consent&#xD;
      form prior to any assessments being performed. Self-administered questionnaires will collect&#xD;
      information on Alcohol use and Disorders Identification Test (audit C), drug use. chart&#xD;
      review, (demographics, medication medical history).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be obtained for clinical laboratory evaluations (as per standard of care)&#xD;
      at baseline, and all follow-up visits, plus serum CK-18 that will be obtained at all&#xD;
      follow-up visits. Routine hematology and chemistry evaluations will include: complete blood&#xD;
      count (CBC) with differential, CD4 and CD8 cell counts, viral load, C-reactive Protein,&#xD;
      D-dimer, and measurements of hepatic, pancreatic and renal function, fasting insulin,&#xD;
      creatine kinase, glucose and lipid profiles. Plasma HIV RNA levels will be measured with a&#xD;
      lower limit of detection of 50 copies/mL. Clinical laboratory evaluations for hematology,&#xD;
      biochemistry, CD4/CD8, viral load and serology will be performed at the chest institute as&#xD;
      per local practices. Fibroscan will be performed on a fasting patient. The probe transducer&#xD;
      will be placed on the skin, between the rib bones at the level of the right lobe of the&#xD;
      liver. An experienced operator (&gt; 500 examinations before the study), will perform the&#xD;
      Fibroscan and the software will calculate the median . The standard M probe will be used in&#xD;
      all patients. The XL probe will be used in obese patients (BMI&gt;30 Kg/m2) or if the M probe&#xD;
      fails to provide accurate results. CAP examination will be performed at the same time to&#xD;
      diagnose fatty liver. A valid Fibroscan result will be defined by 10 validated measures and&#xD;
      IQR &lt; 30% of the median. The following cut-off values will be applied to diagnose fibrosis by&#xD;
      Fibroscan: 1) 8 kilopascal (kPa) for significant liver fibrosis; 2) 13 kPa for cirrhosis.&#xD;
      Fatty liver by CAP will be diagnosed with the following cut-off values: 1) 237.8 dB/m for&#xD;
      mild steatosis; 2) 260 dB/m for moderate steatosis; 3) 292.3 dB/m for severe steatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Identification (ID) numbers will be assigned sequentially to each subject who is&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the study. The Subject ID Number will consist of a three digit&#xD;
      centre number and a three digit number according to chronological order of entry. If a&#xD;
      patient discontinues from the study the Subject ID Number will not be reused. The Subject ID&#xD;
      Numbers will be used for identification of subjects in the source documentation, and&#xD;
      laboratory samples. This will ensure that subject data and laboratory samples leaving the&#xD;
      study sites will be identified and tracked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization to study groups will be done using a computer-generated random allocation with&#xD;
      stratification by gender. Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile&#xD;
      range) will be obtained for clinical and demographic data collected between baseline and&#xD;
      study conclusion. The fatty liver and liver fibrosis scores by CAP and Fibroscan,&#xD;
      respectively, at month 24 will be expressed as a function of exposure group, adjusting for&#xD;
      baseline values of each outcome using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The average&#xD;
      difference in change of steatosis and fibrosis scores between the two groups and associated&#xD;
      hypothesis tests will be obtained from the ANCOVA model. All analyses will be based on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat basis, that is, patients' data will be analyzed as randomized. To assess&#xD;
      the sensitivity of inferences to missing data, we will generate plausible values for missing&#xD;
      observations using multiple imputations (MI), which is a relatively objective methodology for&#xD;
      handling missing data in longitudinal studies. In MI, multiple plausible values are generated&#xD;
      for each missing item from the joint distribution of observed data using a Bayesian&#xD;
      framework, and the results are pooled using established rules while simultaneously accounting&#xD;
      for uncertainty in the imputation process. Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be&#xD;
      used to explore factors associated with non-invasive diagnosis of fatty liver/NASH and&#xD;
      significant liver fibrosis, including patient-related (age, gender, BMI), drug-induced (time&#xD;
      on and type of cART), metabolic (diabetes, insulin resistance, lipid profile, hypertension),&#xD;
      HIV-related (HIV viral load, CD4/CD8). Pearson correlation coefficient will be used to&#xD;
      measure the association between CK-18 and Fibroscan/CAP values, BMI, transaminases. All&#xD;
      hypotheses tests will be conducted at 5% level of significance (2-sided). Analyses will be&#xD;
      performed using R program for Windows Release 2.13.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be monitored for safety and efficacy by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)&#xD;
      composed of clinicians, statisticians/methodologists and a lay member appointed by the McGill&#xD;
      University Health center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject which does&#xD;
      not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study medication/intervention. An AE can&#xD;
      therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding),&#xD;
      symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug/intervention, whether or&#xD;
      not it is related to the medication/intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stable chronic conditions which are present prior to clinical study entry and do not worsen&#xD;
      are not considered adverse events and will be accounted for in the subject's medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have an adverse event should be followed and treated by the Investigator until&#xD;
      the abnormal parameter or symptom has resolved or stabilized. It is up to the clinician to&#xD;
      determine that the AE is either resolved or that is has reached a stable state, after which&#xD;
      no further follow-up is necessary. There should also be source documentation to support this&#xD;
      determination. At each contact with the subject, information regarding adverse events will be&#xD;
      elicited by appropriate questioning and examinations, and will be recorded immediately on a&#xD;
      source document (e.g., progress notes, laboratory reports, survey tools, and data collection&#xD;
      tools). The start date, stop date, severity of each reportable event, and the PI's judgment&#xD;
      of the AE's relationship to the study, medication/intervention will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any AE that occurs between baseline and 30 days following Week 24 (or at the time of early&#xD;
      discontinuation of the subject from the study for any reason) is to be recorded in the source&#xD;
      documentation (patient will be called). Surveillance for AEs will end at 30 days following&#xD;
      Week 24. If an serious adverse event (SAE) is ongoing at the time a subject&#xD;
      discontinues/completes the trial the SAE will be followed until the Investigator agrees that&#xD;
      the event is satisfactorily resolved or that no further follow-up is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virologic failure must be considered for any patient with plasma HIV RNA ≥50 c/mL at any time&#xD;
      following randomization. For the purposes of clinical management in this study, virologic&#xD;
      failure is defined as: Two consecutive plasma HIV RNA ≥50 c/mL within four weeks of the&#xD;
      initial suspected virologic failure. Cases of confirmed virologic failure will trigger&#xD;
      genotypic virologic resistance testing, including integrase resistance testing, when plasma&#xD;
      HIV RNA &gt;400c/mL. The virologic failure definition is intended for guidance and Investigators&#xD;
      should use their discretion as to the most appropriate clinical management of their patients.&#xD;
      Due to the risk of developing integrase resistance in the setting of replicating HIV, change&#xD;
      of antiretroviral therapy for subjects randomized to raltegravir is indicated for those with&#xD;
      confirmed virologic failure. The choice of antiretroviral therapy will be left to the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conduct of this study will conform to the International Conference for Harmonization and&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) regulations and guidelines and the current revision of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki A copy of the protocol (including protocol amendments), all versions&#xD;
      of the informed consents, other information to be completed by subjects such as&#xD;
      questionnaires, and any proposed advertising/ recruitment materials must be reviewed and&#xD;
      approved by the research ethics board (REB) of each participating centre prior to&#xD;
      implementation of the study. The investigator will be responsible for obtaining REB approval&#xD;
      of the annual Continuing Review throughout the duration of the study. The investigator will&#xD;
      notify the REB of violations from the protocol and SAEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be given detailed oral and written information about the study. Consent&#xD;
      forms describing in detail the study medications/intervention(s), study procedures,&#xD;
      anticipated benefits and potential risks will be given to each participant and written&#xD;
      documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting the study. Subjects must&#xD;
      voluntarily sign and date an informed consent document that has been approved by the REB&#xD;
      prior to any procedures being done specifically for the trial. Each subject should have&#xD;
      sufficient opportunity to discuss the study and consider the information in the consent&#xD;
      process prior to agreeing to participate. Subjects may withdraw consent at any time during&#xD;
      the course of the trial. The informed consent will be signed and dated by the subject, the&#xD;
      person who conducted the informed consent discussion and the investigator. The original&#xD;
      signed informed consent form will be retained in the subject's study files and a copy will be&#xD;
      provided to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subject related information including the case report forms (CRFs), laboratory samples,&#xD;
      evaluation forms, reports, etc. will be kept strictly confidential. All records will be kept&#xD;
      in a secure, locked location and only research staff will have access to the records.&#xD;
      Subjects will be identified only by means of a coded number specific to each subject, and a&#xD;
      subject letter code. All computerized databases will identify subjects by numeric codes only,&#xD;
      and will be password protected. Upon request, clinical information may be reviewed by or&#xD;
      released to study monitors, auditors, Canadian Institutes of Health Research or regulatory&#xD;
      agencies. The REB or other government organizations, as part of their duties to ensure that&#xD;
      research subjects are protected may discontinue the study at any time. Regulatory authorities&#xD;
      and the study Sponsor retain the authority to suspend additional enrollment for the entire&#xD;
      study as applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and study documents at all sites will be stored securely for 25 years, after which they&#xD;
      will be destroyed in keeping with the privacy and confidentiality regulations and guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate medical and research records for this study and regulatory/ institutional&#xD;
      requirements must be maintained for the protection of confidentiality of study subjects. The&#xD;
      Principal Investigator is responsible for assuring that the data collected are complete,&#xD;
