    <textblock>
      Evaluate the impact of a 12-week behavioral weight management program on body weight and&#xD;
      quality of life. We hypothesize that participants will lose body weight and see improved&#xD;
      quality of life after program completion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate weight change and quality of life among individuals after completion&#xD;
      of a 12-week comprehensive group weight management program. Findings from this study will&#xD;
      also help with program development and improvement within our center. The already established&#xD;
      weight management program is called Healthy Habits for Life (HHL) and includes a total of 14&#xD;
      visits (one individual visit both before and after the 12 group sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are enrolled in the Healthy Habits for Life group program at the Weight&#xD;
      Center have an individual visit with a registered dietitian prior to beginning the group as&#xD;
      part of standard care. At this visit the dietitian will obtain informed consent for&#xD;
      participation in the research study and provide subjects consenting to participate in the&#xD;
      study with the IWQOL-lite quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the 12 HHL group sessions, all patients at the Weight Center have another&#xD;
      individual visit with the dietitian to review weight and behavior changes since the initial&#xD;
      evaluation. At this visit, subjects participating in the research study will again be&#xD;
      provided with the IWQOL-lite questionnaire to fill out.&#xD;
