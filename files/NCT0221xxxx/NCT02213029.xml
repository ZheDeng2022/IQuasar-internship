  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-cohort phase I study is designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of oxytocin and to evaluate epelsiban (GSK557296) potential to reduce&#xD;
      subendometrial contractractility induced by oxytocin in healthy female subjects. Additionally&#xD;
      tissues concentrations of epelsiban will be determined from endometrial tissue biopsies. Data&#xD;
      from this study will inform the identification of the doses of epelsiban to be used in future&#xD;
      in-vitro fertilization (IVF) clinical studies. Expected number of subjects to be randomized&#xD;
      are: Cohort 1- 10 subjects, Cohort 2a- 10 subjects for each epelsiban arm 25 milligrams (mg),&#xD;
      200mg, 5 for placebo, Cohort 2b- 10 subjects per arm with dose to be determined, cohort 3- 6&#xD;
      subjects. Cohorts 1 and 2 will be double blind (sponsor unblinded) placebo controlled&#xD;
      cohorts. Cohort 3 will be an open label cohort, cohort 4 will be a double blind (sponsor&#xD;
      unblinded) placebo controlled cohort.&#xD;
