    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate whether a behavioral modification intervention&#xD;
      in the form of either a 6-month supervised training program or a 6-month financial incentive&#xD;
      weight loss program, results in improvement of diabetes outcome such as overall sugar control&#xD;
      and lipid control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, unblinded, randomized, controlled, clinical trial of&#xD;
      200 subjects randomized to either a Supervised Training Program (STP), Incentivized Weight&#xD;
      Loss (IWL) or Standard of Care (SoC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to the SoC group will be asked to return for regular 3-monthly clinic&#xD;
      visits and for diet and exercise recommendations.The STP group will be offered once-weekly&#xD;
      one hour supervised training sessions at no charge for a period of six months in the&#xD;
      bcdiabetes.ca fitness center (located in the Vancouver General Hospital Employee Centre gym).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IWL group will receive a financial reward for achieving monthly weight loss targets.&#xD;
      Those who fail to meet their monthly goals will receive no financial reward. Such financial&#xD;
      incentives have been considered in previous research. Due to the nature of the intervention,&#xD;
      none of the investigative staff, trainers or subjects will be blinded to randomized&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether a behavioral modification&#xD;
      intervention in the form of either a 6-month supervised training program or a 6-month&#xD;
      financial incentive program, results in overall superior clinical outcomes in comparison to&#xD;
      standard of care. Specifically, improvement in glucose control, measured by A1c, will be&#xD;
      considered. Given the objective nature of the Primary Outcome, there is little possibility of&#xD;
      assessment bias of the primary or clinical outcomes.The secondary objective is to investigate&#xD;
      the impact of a supervised training program and an incentivized weight loss program on&#xD;
      weight-loss, LDL (apoB), blood pressure, waist-hip circumference, and diabetes-specific&#xD;
      quality of life measures including behavioral and emotional impact (refer to Secondary&#xD;
      Outcomes section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending BCDiabetes ( Diabetes Clinic at Diamond Center )will be approached by one&#xD;
      of their diabetes caregivers who will describe the study and determine whether they have&#xD;
      interest in participating. If the patient expresses an interest, they will be provided&#xD;
      additional information and a study consent form and be free to ask questions about the study.&#xD;
      They may choose to provide consent at the time or to leave with the consent form and return&#xD;
      at a later time to ask further questions. A research nurse, coordinator and/or co/principal&#xD;
      investigator will be available to answer any questions the patient may have. When consent is&#xD;
      provided, confirmation of the eligibility criteria will be completed and the subject will&#xD;
      receive their randomized group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1:1 fashion to the SoC, STP and IWL and groups&#xD;
      respectively. Randomization will be stratified by age (≤ 50 vs &gt; 50 years of age) to ensure&#xD;
      balance in age groups in all three treatment arms; enrollment will not be stratified and the&#xD;
      number of participants in the two age groups will not be restricted. Randomization within&#xD;
      strata will be done in a permuted complete block design with random block sizes (blocks no&#xD;
      smaller than 6 and no larger than 15). Randomization will be completed in advance and&#xD;
      assignments will be kept in individual, separate sealed, sequentially labeled envelopes&#xD;
      opened at the time of randomization of each individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal from Study or Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although they should be encouraged to continue participation in their randomized group,&#xD;
      subjects can choose to withdraw from the study, or to withdraw from the intervention at any&#xD;
      time. Subjects who choose to withdraw from the STP and IWL arms should continue to receive&#xD;
      standard of care and will be considered cross-overs to SoC arm; these subjects are not&#xD;
      necessarily withdrawing from the study and should be encouraged to continue to return for&#xD;
      their scheduled 3 and 6 month study visits so study outcomes can be measured. If a subject&#xD;
      chooses to withdraw from the study entirely, all attempts should be made to have them&#xD;
      complete an exit visit where all study outcomes can be captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who experience any adverse event related to the STP arm (eg: physical injury while&#xD;
      training) or experience the onset or worsening of an signs or symptoms related to a medical&#xD;
      condition (eg: shortness of breath, dizziness, vomiting nausea, etc) persisting the day&#xD;
      following a supervised training session, or who experience a worsening of a physical&#xD;
      condition (eg: degenerative disc disorder, knee or hip pain, plantar fasciitis, etc) will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the STP intervention. As above, these subjects will be asked to return for&#xD;
      their scheduled 3 and 6 month clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any point more than 15% of subjects in the STP arm are withdrawn from the intervention&#xD;
      arm due to an adverse event, worsening medical or physical condition, the study will be&#xD;
      stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be collected as part of the subject's electronic medical record at&#xD;
      bcdiabetes.ca. Identifiable study data will be housed exclusively on bcdiabetes.ca; if&#xD;
      removed from bcdiabetes.ca servers, subjects will be identified only with a study&#xD;
      registration number different from their BC CareID number. Remote monitoring by EMMES using&#xD;
      confidential authenticated automatically scheduled direct database queries. EMMES Canada will&#xD;
      also provide oversight of quality assurance &amp; monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the percent of subjects who achieve target for A1c. The null&#xD;
      and research hypothesis supporting the primary objective of investigating the impact of&#xD;
      whether a behavioral modification intervention in the form of either a 6-month supervised&#xD;
      training program or a 6-month incentivized weight loss program, results in overall superior&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in comparison to standard of care is then:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: pSoC ≥ pIWL and pSoC ≥ pSTP vs. H1: pSoC &lt; pIWL or pSoC &lt; pSTP&#xD;
&#xD;
      where pSoC , pSTP and pIWL are the proportion of subjects achieving the target for all three&#xD;
      disease measures. Here, rejecting the null hypothesis implies that the percent of patients&#xD;
      achieving targets is higher in either of the STP arm or the IWL arm than in the SoC arm. A&#xD;
      one-sided, 0.05 alpha-level simultaneous test for multiple contrasts of binomial proportions&#xD;
      with an &quot;Add-2&quot; adjustment will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis cohort will be an ITT cohort including all randomized subjects and&#xD;
      considering the arm to which they were originally randomized regardless of adherence to the&#xD;
      regimen or the study protocol. Subjects who cross-over to the other intervention prior to&#xD;
      Month 3 (ie: complete less than 3 of the required 6 months) will be considered failures in&#xD;
      the arm to which they were originally randomized. Clinical data from the last, or exit visit&#xD;
      will be used to construct the primary outcome for subjects who withdraw from the study, or&#xD;
      from the intervention, subsequent to Month 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To corroborate the primary, unadjusted analysis, a logistic regression model will be fit with&#xD;
      baseline clinical and demographic data as well as measures of compliance to intervention to&#xD;
      adjust for possible imbalance of important variables. Also, the primary analysis will be&#xD;
      repeated on a per-protocol cohort of subjects who completed the study according to the&#xD;
      protocol and did not cross-over or withdraw from therapy. Graphical techniques and summary&#xD;
      statistics for the two randomized groups at baseline and months 3 and 6 will also be&#xD;
      presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary statistics and graphical presentations will be used to summarize data for all&#xD;
      secondary outcomes. All hypothesis tests will be 2-sided and with a 5% Type I error&#xD;
      probability. There will be no adjustment for multiple comparisons among the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes with the exception that multiple domains within a single psychosocial instrument&#xD;
      (eg: emotional burden, physician-related distress, regimen-related distress, and&#xD;
      diabetes-related interpersonal distress domains within the DDS) will be subject to a&#xD;
      Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparison adjustment. Analyses will be conducted on the ITT&#xD;
      cohort and corroborated by analysis on the per-protocol cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each clinical outcome measure is captured as a continuous and dichotomized variable (eg: A1c&#xD;
      absolute level and those &lt; 7.0%). Dichotomized variables will be analyzed as described in the&#xD;
      Primary Analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be analyzed in three ways. First, summary statistics and graphical&#xD;
      presentation of results will be performed for each of baseline and months 3 and 6. Second,&#xD;
      change from baseline to month 6 will be compared using a paired t-test, or a Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      test if distributional assumptions do not hold. A subject's last available, or exit visit,&#xD;
      will be used if their month 6 visit is not available. Third, longitudinal random-effects&#xD;
      models will be used to model the trajectory of each outcome over time and to determine the&#xD;
      influence of randomized intervention group on that trajectory. Variables may be transformed&#xD;
      to satisfy the assumptions of normally distributed random effects, but results will be&#xD;
      presented on the original scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary null hypothesis compares the probability of a patient being in control in either&#xD;
      experimental group to the Standard of Care group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: pSoC ≥ pIWL and pSoC ≥ pSTP vs. H1: pSoC &lt; pIWL or pSoC &lt; pSTP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data observed within the clinic from which cases are to be recruited, the success&#xD;
      rate for Standard of Care patients is estimated to about 75%. A sample size of 200 subjects&#xD;
      in a 2:1:1 randomization to the SoC, STP and IWL and groups respectively will provide a power&#xD;
      of over 95% to reject the null hypothesis if the true difference between SoC and either&#xD;
      experimental arm is 25% or greater (eg: 37.5% compared to 62.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this sample size provides a power of more than 74% to reject the null hypothesis&#xD;
      in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the percent of patients achieving control is&#xD;
      greater among both the STP and IWL than among the SoC, if the true difference between arms is&#xD;
      25% or greater.&#xD;
