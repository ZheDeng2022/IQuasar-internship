      Immunologically evaluation of myeloperoxidase level as indicator for inflammatory reactions&#xD;
      on modified surface abutments compared to machined surface abutments.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One study abutment per patient will be placed. After healing for 6 to 7 weeks, patients will&#xD;
      be asked to stop oral hygiene at the study site for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sulcus fluid and plaque samples will be taken at the abutment site at several visits before&#xD;
      and during abdication of oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study finishes with biopsy visit. Afterwards a regular abutment will be placed and the&#xD;
      patients will be treated according to the standard protocol of the clinic to obtain their&#xD;
      final restoration&#xD;
