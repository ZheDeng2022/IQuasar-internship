    <textblock>
      Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or FTC/TDF) is a type of antiretroviral&#xD;
      (ARV) medicine that is commonly used to treat HIV. Truvada is also used as pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection in HIV-negative adults. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the acceptability, safety, and use of daily Truvada PrEP as part of a&#xD;
      comprehensive HIV prevention package in healthy, HIV-uninfected adolescents 15 to 19 years of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Truvada PrEP is an approach used to protect HIV-uninfected adults against possible infection&#xD;
      with HIV. The approach involves taking Truvada every day to prevent HIV infection in case the&#xD;
      person is exposed to HIV (for example, through sex with an HIV-infected person). The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the acceptability, safety, and use of daily Truvada PrEP as part&#xD;
      of a comprehensive HIV prevention package in healthy, HIV-uninfected adolescents 15 to 19&#xD;
      years old. In addition to Truvada PrEP, the HIV prevention package will include HIV testing,&#xD;
      management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), risk reduction counseling, access to&#xD;
      condoms, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and circumcision counseling and referral for male&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 150 healthy, HIV-uninfected adolescents 15 to 19 years of age. The&#xD;
      study will last for 12 months (52 weeks) and involve scheduled clinic visits at study entry&#xD;
      (Week 0) and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first 12 weeks of the study, all participants will be provided with a supply of&#xD;
      Truvada tablets to take once daily as part of the comprehensive HIV prevention package. At&#xD;
      Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48, participants will be offered the following options: to continue&#xD;
      with the full HIV prevention package plus Truvada PrEP, to stop Truvada PrEP and continue&#xD;
      with rest of the HIV prevention package, or to re-start Truvada PrEP if previously stopped.&#xD;
      After Week 12 of the study, Truvada tablets will be given only to those participants who&#xD;
      decide to take PrEP and who do not have any medical reasons not to do so. Regardless whether&#xD;
      they choose to use Truvada PrEP after Week 12, all study participants will be followed&#xD;
      through Week 52 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits will include blood collection, counseling before and after HIV testing,&#xD;
      urine collection for pregnancy testing (female participants only), completion of a sexual&#xD;
      risk behavior questionnaire, receipt of a supply of condoms, contraceptive counseling, a&#xD;
      medical history review, and disclosure of available test results. Select study visits may&#xD;
      include a physical exam, blood and urine collection, testing and treatment of STIs, adherence&#xD;
      counseling, and an acceptability assessment. Between Months 11 and 12 of the study, some&#xD;
      participants will be randomly selected to participate in focus groups to discuss their&#xD;
      experiences while taking Truvada PrEP.&#xD;
