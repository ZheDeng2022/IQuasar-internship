      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HAL- RAR causes a lower immediate postoperative pain compared with erxcision&#xD;
           hemorrhoidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HAL - RAR achieves similar immediate and long term results compared to the excision&#xD;
           hemorrhoidectomy in the control of hemorrhoidal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The complication rate of HAL- RAR is low and similar to excision hemorrhoidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare postoperative pain of both techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the short and long-term control of hemorrhoidal symptoms by HAL- RAR technique,&#xD;
           and compare the results with those of the excision hemorrhoidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate and compare the rate of complications of both techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the quality of life of patients before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was subjected to evaluation and accepted by the Ethics Committee of the Fundació&#xD;
      Unió Catalana d'Hospitals (Catalonian Union of Hospitals Foundation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with grade III and IV hemorrhoids that are eligible for surgical treatment with&#xD;
      both methods who agree to participate in the study, will be included in the prospective&#xD;
      randomized trial. All patients will be required to sign the specific informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are suitable for treatment with both techniques will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      surgical technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Patients with symptomatic grade III or IV hemorrhoids (bleeding, pain, itching, soiling or&#xD;
      prolapse) that are eligible for surgical treatment with both methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Associated recto-anal pathology such as acute thrombosed hemorrhoid, anal fissure,&#xD;
           perianal fistula, perianal abscess, rectal prolapse, fecal incontinence or anal&#xD;
           stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prior anorectal surgery .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Systemic pathology that could alter the outcome of the surgery as coagulopathies,&#xD;
           chronic pain with continued consumption of analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Age younger than 18 or older than 80 years, socio-pathology or inability to understand&#xD;
           the study objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeries are performed on an outpatient basis under regional anesthesia and sedation for&#xD;
      the same team of three surgeons. Preoperative preparation consists of a cleansing enema and&#xD;
      no prophylactic antibiotics will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both techniques will be performed in &quot;Jack -Knife&quot; position. The open hemorrhoidectomy may&#xD;
      include one to three anal cushions and made according to the Milligan-Morgan technique, with&#xD;
      resection of the anal cushion and the external hemorrhoidal epidermal component using&#xD;
      electrocautery and ligation of the hemorroidal base with absorbable suture. Once completed&#xD;
      hemorrhoidectomy a perianal block is performed with bupivacaine/epinephrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhoidal artery ligation and rectoanal repair will be performed with the AMI minimally&#xD;
      invasive surgery device HAL/RAR, and consist in the ligation of the terminal branches of the&#xD;
      superior rectal artery with 2-0 absorbable polyglycolic acid suture after identifying the&#xD;
      blood flow approximately 3 cm above the dentate line by using Doppler guidance. Subsequently,&#xD;
      a running suture was added from the suture point to 5 mm above the dentate line to lift the&#xD;
      prolapsing hemorroid. Other procedures will not be associated, if necessary, the patient will&#xD;
      be excluded from the study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be discharged if adequate pain control, oral tolerance and spontaneous&#xD;
      diuresis is achieved, and after examination by the surgeon in order to discard immediate&#xD;
      complications. The ambulatory treatment consists of an osmotic laxative (magnesium hydroxide&#xD;
      ), oral analgesia with paracetamol/tramadol ( 325mg/37.5mg ) every 6 hours and Dexketoprofen&#xD;
      (25 mg) every 8 hours, metamizol (575 mg) may be associated every 8 hours if pain. In case of&#xD;
      persistent pain, the patient will be examinated in emergency room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATION OF RESULTS A power analysis was performed to assess the study sample size.&#xD;
      Choosing a power of 0.8 and a confidence interval of 95% α-error of 0.05, we calculated that&#xD;
      26 patients were needed in each arm. We increased this number up to 30 to increase&#xD;
      reliability of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated with a validated questionnaire of 36 questions on quality of&#xD;
      life ( SF-36 ) and specific questions about specific symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease (pain,&#xD;
      itching , bleeding, soiling and hemorrhoidal prolapse reduction ). The questionnaire will be&#xD;
      answered before the intervention, after six and twelve months of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will complete a diary testing global postoperative pain every day, measured on a&#xD;
      numerical scale from 0 to 10 during the first 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be assessed on the day of discharge and at 7, 14, and 30 postoperative&#xD;
      days. The patients will be evaluated at 6, 12 and 24 postoperative months in the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The classic surgical treatment of hemorrhoidal disease is the excisional hemorrhoidectomy,&#xD;
      that consist in the surgical removal of one or more hemorrhoidal cushion, it is considered a&#xD;
      safe, radical and definitive treatment; however, it is not exempt of complications and the&#xD;
      postoperative pain is considerable. During the last two decades the concept of treatment has&#xD;
      evolved to control hemorrhoidal symptoms with less invasive techniques, such as hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      bands, arterial ligation Doppler guided hemorrhoidal and more recently, the association of&#xD;
      anorectal repair or mucopexia for treating hemorrhoidal mucosal prolapse .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the doppler guided transanal dearterialization and rectoanal repair (HAL-RAR)&#xD;
      in the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease, show good control of symptoms, less postoperative&#xD;
      pain and low rates of complications in the treatment of grade II, III and IV hemorrhoids.1&#xD;
      -10&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of the HAL- RAR could be more limited in advanced hemorrhoidal disease (stage&#xD;
      IV), in this stage have been reported a recurrence rate of up to 38 % 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies with more patients treated with HAL- RAR are those of Faucheron et al3 (100&#xD;
      patients) and Roka et al6 (77 patients). These studies reported good results in the treatment&#xD;
      of grade IV hemorrhoids with a high rate of outpatient treatment, good control of symptoms&#xD;
      (89 %) and a low rate of complications. Te complications presented 9% in the immediate&#xD;
      postoperative period and 4% in the long term, all were treated conservatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are few prospective randomized studies that demonstrate the results of HAL-&#xD;
      RAR compared with open hemorrhoidectomy, the long-term results remain to be demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature there are two prospective randomized studies comparing the HAL- RAR with&#xD;
      excision hemorrhoidectomy1 -2. In both studies, good results were observed with these&#xD;
      techniques with regard to symptom control; postoperative pain and long-term results were&#xD;
      similar with both techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The publication of more randomized prospective studies to allow proper evaluation of the&#xD;
      results in patients who underwent HAL- RAR is required.&#xD;
