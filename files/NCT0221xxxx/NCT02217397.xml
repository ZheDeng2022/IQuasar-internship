  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a situation of repetitive upper airway obstruction during&#xD;
      sleep. For patients with severe OSA, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy was&#xD;
      the standard therapy, especially those with daytime sleepiness and cardiovascular&#xD;
      comorbidities. Although CPAP is effective in OSA treatment, the poor adherence due to high&#xD;
      pressure was often reported. Instead, oral appliance (OA) was the alternative for those who&#xD;
      could not tolerance CPAP or mild to moderate OSA. Oral appliance was less effective in&#xD;
      compared with CPAP, but OA is more tolerable and acceptable in OSA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one observation study addressed the effects of the combinations of OA and CPAP in OSA&#xD;
      patients . The pilot study displayed combination therapy of CPAP and OA is effective in OSA&#xD;
      patients and could decrease CPAP pressure. However, the study enrolled the patients with CPAP&#xD;
      intolerance according to the subjective chief complaint, not the objective CPAP pressure&#xD;
      data. In the present study, we studied the effects of combinations of CPAP and OA for&#xD;
      patients with severe OSA who could not tolerate CPAP with high-pressure setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study in a tertiary teaching hospital, National Taiwan University&#xD;
      Hospital. Patients are eligible with age ≧ 20 years old, severe OSA [apnea-hyponea index&#xD;
      (AHI) &gt;= 30/hr] who could not tolerate CPAP pressure &gt;15 cmH2O, determined by manual&#xD;
      titration (first titration) and willing to use OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study designed was found out the patients with severe OSA (AHI &gt;= 30/hr ). With first&#xD;
      titration, the investigators excluded the severe OSA patients using CPAP (CPAP pressure &lt; 15&#xD;
      cmH2O) and could tolerate CPAP. Those patients who could not tolerance CPAP high pressure&#xD;
      setting started a three-month oral appliance trial. Then, the investigators repeated the&#xD;
      full-channel polysomnography (PSG) with second titration on those with residual AHI ≧ 10/hr&#xD;
      while patients were on OA. Therefore, those patients treated with combinations of OA and CPAP&#xD;
      for three months and then repeated the PSG. The washout period in each therapy was two weeks.&#xD;
      The total follow-up period is about 6 months after enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators collected the demographic data from medical records and PSG data, including&#xD;
      age, gender, body mass index (BMI), CPAP titration, AHI, total sleep time, oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation, and arousal index…et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary end point is the changes in AHI compared with combination therapy, and OA use.&#xD;
      The secondary end points are the difference in titrated CPAP pressure, BMI, blood pressure,&#xD;
      and daytime sleepiness compared with combination therapy and OA use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics analysis Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Continuous&#xD;
      variables were tested by paired Student's t test in group comparisons. Statistical&#xD;
      significance was assumed when a null hypothesis could be rejected at p&lt;0.05. The&#xD;
      investigators compared the difference between combination therapy, OA, and baseline by ANOVA,&#xD;
      repeated measure. Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS 22.0 for Windows.&#xD;
