  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the performance characteristics for the collection,&#xD;
      fixation and transportation of clinical nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) specimens of the ForeCYTE&#xD;
      Breast Aspirator across 3 independent labs and the National Reference Laboratory for Breast&#xD;
      Health (NRLBH). The study hypothesis is that each lab will have a specimen acceptability rate&#xD;
      of at least 90%. If it is assumed that the true level of acceptability testing is&#xD;
      approximately 96%, then the lower bound of a one-sided 95% confidence interval is expected to&#xD;
      be at least 90%.&#xD;

      A) NAF Collection at physician's office: The Principle Investigator identified and qualified&#xD;
      the study subjects. He and the assigned study coordinator from his clinic completed all&#xD;
      entries in the Study Case Report Form related to the collection site. He collected the NAF&#xD;
      specimens at the Physician Office Collection Sites in accordance with the Instructions for&#xD;
      Use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) NAF Processing at physician's office: The Principle Investigator's designate processed the&#xD;
      NAF specimens for shipment to the selected laboratories in accordance with the Instructions&#xD;
      for Use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) NAF Transport from physician's office to laboratory: The patient specimen collection&#xD;
      membranes were placed in resealable pouches, packed in shipping boxes (provided) and&#xD;
      transported by Federal Express to the participating Independent Clinical Laboratories. The&#xD;
      Federal Express packaging was pre-labeled for the PI within each of the four laboratories and&#xD;
      the specimens were sent in the order in which they were collected to each of the&#xD;
      laboratories. Left and right breast specimen from the same subject were sent to the same lab,&#xD;
      but in a subject based sequence. The shipments will be shipped serially to lab ABCD, ABCD,&#xD;
      ABCD, ABCD, etc. So specimens from subject 1 went to laboratory A, specimens from subject 2&#xD;
      to lab B, specimens from subject 3 to lab C, specimens from subject 4 to lab D, specimens&#xD;
      from subject 5 to lab A, etc. The PI completed the Testing Facility Shipping and Receiving&#xD;
      Tracking Form for all specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) NAF Processing at laboratory: The NAF was processed at the clinical cytology laboratories&#xD;
      in accordance with the Instructions for Use that accompanied each patient kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E) NAF Cytology Classification: A trained, board-certified pathologist read the slides. The&#xD;
      data was reported in the Case Report Form according to the format recommended by the College&#xD;
      of American Pathologists. The criteria for reading and interpreting the slides are contained&#xD;
      in Table 2 and were adapted from King, et al. The laboratory portion of the Case Report Form&#xD;
      was completed for each patient.&#xD;
