    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to determine the safety, efficacy, length of stay and parental&#xD;
      satisfaction of the NoseFrida in comparison to a suction device used in the hospital setting&#xD;
      in patients with bronchiolitis admitted under observation status.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is a viral illness and a common cause for admission to the hospital. Most&#xD;
      patients with bronchiolitis are managed at home. The indications of hospitalization are poor&#xD;
      feeding (due to increased mucus production) and respiratory distress with and without&#xD;
      hypoxia. The acute care setting is a common destination of patients with bronchiolitis.&#xD;
      Patients are admitted to the acute care setting for respiratory monitoring, suctioning and&#xD;
      poor oral intake. The management of bronchiolitis is mostly supportive which includes&#xD;
      frequent feedings, nasal suctioning, intravenous fluids and oxygen if necessary. The patients&#xD;
      admitted to the acute care setting receive frequent nasal suctioning by a suction device&#xD;
      (NeoSucker) and deep suctioning as needed. Since young infants are &quot;nose breathers,&quot; the use&#xD;
      of nasal suctioning helps to relieve nasal congestion/upper airway obstruction and assists&#xD;
      with their ability to breathe and feed. Suctioning can be accomplished by the use of the bulb&#xD;
      suction, nasal aspirators and/or suction catheters connected to pressure devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of the type of suctioning device in the management of bronchiolitis has not been&#xD;
      studied extensively. In our study, a nasal aspirator (developed in Sweden by an Ear, Nose and&#xD;
      Throat specialist) by the brand name of NoseFrida will be compared to the NeoSucker, a&#xD;
      suction catheter currently used in our hospital setting which requires both a nurse and a&#xD;
      pressure device. Nasal suctioning is less traumatic and does not cause the discomfort,&#xD;
      bleeding and rebound swelling that deep suctioning can. Upon admission, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the NoseFrida or NeoSucker group. After consent is obtained for agreed&#xD;
      participation, the patients parents randomized to the NoseFrida group will be given a&#xD;
      NoseFrida/filters and instructions on usage (instructional video/postcard). The parents will&#xD;
      be encouraged to use the NoseFrida suction device as often as they want, especially before&#xD;
      feeds and sleep. The patients randomized to the NeoSucker group will be given the current&#xD;
      standard of care and nasal suctioned by a nurse. Both groups will be deep suctioned as&#xD;
      clinically needed.&#xD;

    <description>A study specific survey was developed to measure parental satisfaction of the NoseFrida device. The parental satisfaction question responses were on a 5 point Likert Scale as follows: 1=&quot;Strongly Disagree&quot;, 2=&quot;Disagree&quot;, 3=&quot;Neutral&quot;, 4=&quot;Agree&quot; and 5=&quot;Strongly Agree.&quot; The minimum value is strongly disagree and maximum is strongly agree. The likert scale assessed parental satisfaction with the use of the device.</description>

          <title>NoseFrida</title>
          <description>If randomized to the NoseFrida group, the NoseFrida/filters will be given along with educational instruction of its use to the parents of patients admitted with bronchiolitis. The NoseFrida will be used by the parent to suction the nares of their infants/toddlers.&#xD;
NoseFrida: The NoseFrida has four components, the collection container, an interchangeable filter, flexible tubing and a mouth piece. The end of the collection devise is placed on the patient's nostril, a tight seal is made via the vacuum created from suctioning of the mouth piece and secretions are easily aspirated. This device disassembles for quick disinfecting and cleaning.</description>

          <title>NeoSucker</title>
          <description>The NeoSucker (used for nasal suctioning) is part of the current standard of care for patients with bronchiolitis. The NeoSucker is used for removing nasal secretions by a nurse or respiratory therapist. The NeoSucker is a plastic tube which is used to suction the secretions. The bedside nurse will continue to use the NeoSucker as needed. NoseFrida will not be used for this sub group of patients.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The sample size was small and was a convenience sample. Not all parents participated in the satisfaction survey. The lack of documentation of nose bleeds and nasal swelling does not suggest the absence of these minor side effects.</limitations_and_caveats>
