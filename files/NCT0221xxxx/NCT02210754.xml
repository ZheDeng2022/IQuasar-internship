  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was the initial characterization of the blu™ products being studied, with the&#xD;
      purpose of gaining an understanding of the exposure to nicotine and craving reduction&#xD;
      attained following use of blu™ e-cigarettes by adult smokers. Two types of exposures were&#xD;
      utilized: a single controlled administration and a short-term ad lib use. As smoking&#xD;
      behaviors vary from smoker to smoker, a controlled administration allows for some&#xD;
      standardization of nicotine &quot;dose&quot; for each of the study products to better understand their&#xD;
      uptake characteristics as well as urge reduction achieved under controlled conditions.&#xD;
      Further evaluation under ad lib product use conditions provides insight into product&#xD;
      self-administration behaviors that will allow subjects to achieve acceptable levels of urge&#xD;
      reduction. Comparisons were made to evaluate differences between blu™ formulations as well as&#xD;
      to the market-leading conventional cigarette, Marlboro Gold King Size (&quot;Marlboro cigarette').&#xD;

      This was a randomized, partially single-blinded, 6-period crossover study of 24 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study were to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. characterize the rate and extent of nicotine exposure following a single controlled&#xD;
           administration and ad lib use of blu™ e-cigarettes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. characterize smoking urge following a single controlled administration and ad lib use of&#xD;
           blu™ e cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study were to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of nicotine between selected blu™ formulations&#xD;
           and between the blu™ products and Marlboro cigarettes following a single controlled&#xD;
           administration and ad lib use of each study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare changes in smoking urge within and between selected blu™ formulations and&#xD;
           between the blu™ products and Marlboro cigarettes following a single controlled&#xD;
           administration and ad lib use of each study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the changes in exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) within and between selected blu™&#xD;
           formulations and between the blu™ products and Marlboro cigarettes following use of each&#xD;
           study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the tolerability of each study product following short-term use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were provided blu™ Classic Tobacco and Magnificent Menthol products containing 2.4%&#xD;
      nicotine, glycerin vehicle for 1 week prior to participation in the study to familiarize&#xD;
      themselves with the use of the products. Subjects were confined to the clinic for the entire&#xD;
      study duration and abstained from use of nicotine containing products for a period of at&#xD;
      least 36 hours prior to each product administration. Each product administration included a&#xD;
      controlled product administration and a 1 hour ad lib use of the study products. The&#xD;
      controlled product administration consisted of 50 inhalations of the assigned e-cigarette&#xD;
      product (5-second inhalations at 30-second intervals) or smoking one Marlboro cigarette&#xD;
      (30-second intervals with the subjects' normal inhalation duration) with inhalations&#xD;
      monitored by the clinical staff. The start of the ad lib product use was 30 minutes following&#xD;
      the start of the controlled product use. During ad lib use, subjects were allowed to&#xD;
      self-administer the e-cigarette product as desired for the entire hour and were responsible&#xD;
      for maintaining their own inhalation counts. During the ad lib cigarette product use,&#xD;
      subjects requested the product from the staff as desired and maintained their own inhalation&#xD;
      counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics: Blood samples for the measurement of plasma nicotine concentrations were&#xD;
      taken by direct venipuncture at 10 minutes prior to, and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 75,&#xD;
      and 90 minutes following the start of the controlled product administration.&#xD;
      Non-compartmental PK parameters such as Peak Plasma Concentration and Area under the Plasma&#xD;
      Concentration versus time curve were calculated from the plasma nicotine concentration-time&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamics: Smoking urge was assessed using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS).&#xD;
      Assessments occurred within 1 minute prior to the -10 (pre-product administration), 5, 15,&#xD;
      25, 30, 60, and 90-minute PK blood draws. The following non-compartmental Pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      parameters were calculated from the smoking urge change-from-baseline data: Emax0-30,&#xD;
      Emaxreduction0-30, AUEC0-30, tEmax0-30, AUEC30-90, and E90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Measurements: Exhaled CO measurements occurred at approximately 20 minutes prior to the&#xD;
      start of the controlled product use and at approximately 15 minutes following the end of the&#xD;
      ad lib product use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability: Adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, and laboratory safety&#xD;
      tests were assessed to evaluate enrolment criteria and subject safety during the study.&#xD;

    <description>Smoking urge was assessed using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). Assessments occurred within 1 minute prior to the -10 (pre-product administration), 5, 15, 25, 30, 60, and 90-minute PK blood draws on Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. The 30-minute assessment was intended to coincide with the start of the ad lib product use. The following non-compartmental pharmacodynamic parameters were calculated from the smoking urge change-from-baseline data: Maximum smoking urge reduction and change-from-baseline from time zero to 30 minutes, area under the effect curve (smoking urge change-from-baseline) from time 0 to 30 minutes and 30 to 90 minutes,time of the maximum (positive or negative) smoking urge change-from-baseline from time 0 to 30 minutes and Observed smoking urge change-from-baseline at 90 minutes.</description>
