      Objectives: To evaluate and compare the Efficacy and Safety, of extra-corporeal irradiation&#xD;
      of circulating blood by extra-corporeal electro-magnetic irradiation with Selenium containing&#xD;
      food supplement herbal tablets in the treatment of non-cirrhotic subjects with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Rationale: As many as 150 million persons are chronically infected with the&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide, and more than 350,000 die annually from liver disease&#xD;
      caused by HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Egypt is confronted with an HCV disease burden of historical proportions that distinguishes&#xD;
      this nation from others. It has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the&#xD;
      world, estimated nationally at 14.7% . Approximately, there are 10 million Egyptians carry&#xD;
      the virus. Due to its chronic debilitating nature, it has tremendous social and financial&#xD;
      impacts on our community. Hence, this trial aims to find a logic rational and effective&#xD;
      treatment for Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extra-corporeal electro-magnetic irradiation: The wavelength of UV irradiation (UVI) lies in&#xD;
      the range of 100-400 nm, and is further subdivided into UVA (315-400 nm), UVB (280-315 nm),&#xD;
      and UVC (100-280 nm).UVC and UVB are directly absorbed by DNA bases causing serious DNA&#xD;
      damages. On the other hand, DNA damage by UVA is indirect through the formation of Reactive&#xD;
      Oxygen Species (ROS) that are formed when other cellular chromophores act as endogenous photo&#xD;
      sensitizers. ROS can then react with and damage DNA, or interact with other cell structures&#xD;
      such as membranes (lipids) and proteins. All of these different types of damage may hamper&#xD;
      cell metabolic processes, such as protein synthesis and cell cycle progression, or induce&#xD;
      mutations and cell death . Both Selenium itself and various selenoproteins are proposed to&#xD;
      have antioxidant effects, reducing the biological impact of ROS on human cells .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultraviolet blood irradiation (UBI) was first used on humans in the early 1930s. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of UBI in treating infections was studied extensively in the 1940s and it was&#xD;
      found that UBI was extremely successful in treating such infections as peritonitis, pyelitis,&#xD;
      sinusitis, puerperal sepsis and wound infections in all but the most advanced cases.Later&#xD;
      studies showed UBI helped a number of patients with acute viral hepatitis .Recently, Energex&#xD;
      Systems, a developer of advanced UBI technology, studied the effects of UBI therapy on viral&#xD;
      loads in 13 patients with the infection and it showed some effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical and physical characteristics of electro-magnetic irradiation is the narrow band of&#xD;
      ultraviolet A radiation with a peak at 365 nm with an average power about 18 ÂµW/cm2 during&#xD;
      the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For irradiation in the UVA region (315 nm- 400nm) the measured average irradiance was 0.12&#xD;
      mW/cm2in the place of circulating blood at any time of each session(40 sec).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time integral of irradiance (prescribed exposure dose) is 0.144 J/cm2(1440 J/m2)for total&#xD;
      radiant exposure time of 1200 sec (20 min) in all therapeutic sessions (up to maximum of 30&#xD;
      sessions in some particular cases).&#xD;
&#xD;

      lamps:&#xD;

      Detailed Description A Randomized, Open-Label, Study to investigate the Efficacy and Safety&#xD;
      of extra-corporeal irradiation of circulating blood with and Selenium containing herbal food&#xD;
      supplement tablets in the treatment of non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis: There is no difference in outcomes and cure rate of patients with&#xD;
      Hepatitis C when using electromagnetic device or herbal tablets containing selenium are used&#xD;
      with aim of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was submitted for ethical approval via the relevant Minister of health and Medical&#xD;
      military sector Research Ethics Approval Committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arm (s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions (arm 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty four daily one hour sessions using Extra-corporeal electro-magnetic irradiation device&#xD;
      combined with Herbal Food Supplement Selenium containing tables as an Anti Oxidant (Tablet A)&#xD;
      starting 10 days before the radiation sessions and to continue for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (arm 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily Herbal Food Supplement Selenium containing tablets for 24 weeks. What will happen to&#xD;
      patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Invitation to participate:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with hepatitis C virus infection will be identified from the attendee of the&#xD;
           hepatology and tropical diseases clinics at our institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. First Contact:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each patient will then receive a phone call from the Research Nurse, to request an&#xD;
           indication of whether they would like to participate in the study. If the patient would&#xD;
           like to meet face-to-face, in which case arrangement would be made during the&#xD;
           investigation tests or outpatient clinic appointments. Otherwise, questions will be&#xD;
           answered over the telephone. This phone call is anticipated to last 10 minutes on&#xD;
           average.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Initial Assessment Meeting and Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
           An initial meeting will then take place at which patients will be asked to give their&#xD;
           informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, demographics, past medical history and baseline observations will be noted.&#xD;
           Up-to-date base line investigations will be performed including: FBC, renal functions,&#xD;
           liver profile, Viral load PCR. The patients will then be informed of which group they&#xD;
           have been randomized into (electromagnetic or herbal tablets). Patients in each group&#xD;
           will have a detailed explanation of their corresponding management and booklet will be&#xD;
           given to patients to take home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The Electromagnetic Device group:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Those participants in the intervention group will be invited to attend the treatment&#xD;
           cubicles to see the device. They will receive 20 minutes presentation about the theory&#xD;
           of the device and how it functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Repeated Assessment Meetings:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Assessments performed in 3 above, will be repeated:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  On discharge (-24hrs to +48hrs) with additional returning to normal activities&#xD;
                questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  4-week out-patient appointment in research team clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  8-week out-patient appointment in research team clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  12-week out-patient appointment in research team clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  24-week out-patient appointment in research team clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Monitoring and Supportive Meetings:&#xD;
&#xD;
           â¢ The research nurse will be available on the study mobile phone which will be supported&#xD;
           by other members of the research team during periods of leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. End of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final assessment meeting will take place six month after completion of treatment.&#xD;
      Participants will be discharged back to the hepatology clinic for long term management.&#xD;
      Research team will be notified of any long term adverse effects of either treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last follow up date: 48 weeks from baseline. Recruitment Status: Currently recruiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervision:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Management and Monitoring Group (MMG). The study will be managed by a 'Management&#xD;
           and Monitoring Group' (MMG) which will meet regularly, throughout the study, to manage&#xD;
           it and to monitor progress. A Gantt chart showing the points at which MMG meetings are&#xD;
           proposed is provided within the appendices. The study management will also comprise 5&#xD;
           sub-groups (involving specialized experts) who will interact with the MMG. A schematic&#xD;
           showing all of these study management groups is given in the appendices of this&#xD;
           document.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The MMG will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient Representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Professor Doctor: Tayseer Abdulaal, M.D., Internal medicine, Clinical Immunology&#xD;
                Consultant, Egyptian Military Armed Forces&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Professor Doctor: Mostafa El-Awady, M.D.,Molecular Biology Consultant, Egyptian&#xD;
                National Research Center&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Professor Doctor: Mostafa El-Nakib, M.D., Virology Consultant, Egyptian Military&#xD;
                Armed Forces&#xD;
&#xD;

                Military Armed ForcesDr&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Patient Experience Sub-group The principal sub-group of the MMG will be one who will&#xD;
           take responsibility for managing and monitoring the experiences of all patients during&#xD;
           the study. This group will comprise Dr Tayseer Abdulaal and the Research Nurses and the&#xD;
           Administrator. Therefore, it will be based within the hospital. This group will also be&#xD;
           responsible for patient recruitment and for patient data entry onto an appropriate&#xD;
           database. This group will make a significant contribution to the overall management of&#xD;
           the study (which is done by the MMG) by raising awareness, within that group, of issues&#xD;
           relating to all aspects of patient experience that arise as the study progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Critical side effects Sub-group A team of researchers, based at Egyptian military&#xD;
           hospital, Ain Shams and Cairo University hospitals will meet within 24 hours of&#xD;
           admission of any patients involved in the trial to any of the designated hospital. An&#xD;
           action plan will include a thorough evaluation of the patient condition. Ife there is&#xD;
           any concern regarding patient safety; the trial will be suspended for further&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
