  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to develop new tools to guide patients, caregivers,&#xD;
      and clinicians in making individualized decisions regarding colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      surveillance. As part of a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded contract,&#xD;
      investigator will analyze surveillance data to determine the effectiveness of CRC&#xD;
      surveillance and recurrence risk taking into account different patient and tumor&#xD;
      characteristics; identify key issues about CRC surveillance important to patients,&#xD;
      caregivers, and clinicians; and integrate the recurrence risk and patient priorities into a&#xD;
      patient-centered, risk stratified surveillance strategy by creating an interactive decision&#xD;
      aid for use by patients and clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol addresses a formative step in the creation of the interactive decision aid&#xD;
      where patients' information needs and preferences are assessed regarding decisions about&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this protocol are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - To interview patients and their caregivers to determine their concerns, preferences&#xD;
      and key priorities regarding surveillance after curative resection of colorectal cancer, and&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - To refine the key priorities identified in phase 1 through focus groups and surveys&#xD;
      with patients and caregivers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this research study which is conducted at The University&#xD;
      of Texas MD Anderson (&quot;MD Anderson&quot;) and the Harris Health System because you (or someone you&#xD;
      act as a caregiver for) are undergoing follow-up after curative resection of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to find out the key priorities for patients and their caregivers&#xD;
      when it comes to surveillance after curative resection of colorectal cancer. Your responses&#xD;
      will help develop decision aids to help future colorectal cancer patients make more informed&#xD;
      decisions about surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to participate in this study, you will take part in an interview or focus group&#xD;
      in person at MD Anderson, the Harris Health System, or the Alliance. The interview or focus&#xD;
      group is expected to take between 30 minutes and 1 hour. The interview or focus group will be&#xD;
      audiorecorded. Your name or other identifying information will not appear in the transcript.&#xD;
      Adept Word Management, a transcription service that has been approved by the institution, may&#xD;
      transcribe the interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked questions about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  your priorities and concerns about colorectal cancer surveillance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what you know about colorectal cancer and surveillance,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  your cancer and treatment (or the patients'),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the impact or inconvenience that surveillance causes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  who you think should make decisions about surveillance,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  your thoughts about different surveillance scenarios,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and general questions about your age, race, sex, education, and income level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about you will be collected from the medical records and existing data in a&#xD;
      database of colorectal patients that is used to organize existing information about&#xD;
      colorectal patients to better understand the disease. Information collected will include&#xD;
      things like age, gender, marital status, information about the tumor, type of surgery, and&#xD;
      what treatment was done before and after surgery. There are no other plans to share your&#xD;
      information with others outside the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation will be over when the interview is complete. If you are undergoing&#xD;
      follow-up for colorectal cancer, research staff will look at your medical record after the&#xD;
      interview for information about your cancer including tumor characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation is completely voluntary. Whether you say yes or no will not change your&#xD;
      medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 220 patients and their caregivers will participate in this multicenter study. Up to 190&#xD;
      patients and their caregivers will be enrolled at MD Anderson. Up to 10 patients and their&#xD;
      caregivers will be enrolled at the Harris Health System.&#xD;
