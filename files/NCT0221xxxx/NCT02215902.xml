      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the safety of the Aethlon Hemopurifier® when used in extracorporeal blood&#xD;
      purification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To quantify the number of viral copies captured by the Aethlon Hemopurifier® during the first&#xD;
      and last Hemopurifier treatments using elution methods developed by Aethlon Medical Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure changes in viral load in patients before and after treatment with the Aethlon&#xD;
      Hemopurifier®.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-arm, sequential, controlled feasibility/safety study in which each&#xD;
      subject will serve as his/her own control. The control period will be the week immediately&#xD;
      preceding the use of the investigational device during which eligible subjects will undergo&#xD;
      and be monitored during three standard intermittent dialysis sessions. Vital signs, blood&#xD;
      chemistries, hematology, liver function and adverse events will be measured. On weeks two and&#xD;
      three, patients will receive treatment with the Hemopurifier® three times per week coincident&#xD;
      with their ongoing standard intermittent hemodialysis treatments. During these two weeks,&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed for the same clinical parameters but with the addition of viral&#xD;
      load determination by quantitative PCR before and after each treatment with the&#xD;
      Hemopurifier®. Viral load will also be measured at follow-up prior to the start of a given&#xD;
      subject's hemodialysis treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Stable clinical condition, including stable hemoglobin which has not fluctuated more&#xD;
             than 1.5 -2.0 gm/dl within 28 days prior to enrollment into study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must have the following minimum hematologic, biochemical, and serologic criteria&#xD;
             documented within 28 days prior to enrollment into study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Hemoglobin values of ≥ 9.5 gm/dL for males and females&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Bilirubin &lt; 4 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Albumin stable and not less than 3.5 g/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of child-bearing potential must be practicing barrier or oral contraception for&#xD;
             the duration of the study or documented as surgically sterile or one year&#xD;
             post-menopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. If female, be non-nursing, non-pregnant and have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test within two weeks of starting study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and written&#xD;
             informed consent obtained prior to enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The subject must be able to comprehend the study description and its nature as only a&#xD;
             feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Administration of Pegasys-ribavirin or ANY anti-viral drug therapy within 90 days&#xD;
             prior to enrollment into study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Administration of any other investigational drugs within 90 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
             into study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinically significant infection, other than HCV, defined as any acute or chronic&#xD;
             viral, bacterial, or fungal infection, which requires specific therapy&#xD;
             (Anti-infectious therapy must have been completed at least 14-days before entry into&#xD;
             study) in order to make entry into the study possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus or has AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A history of hypotensive episodes during dialysis which lead to early termination of&#xD;
             the treatment in the 2 treatments prior to the start of study treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have received an ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitor within the&#xD;
             last 24 hours should not be treated. Patients receiving an ACE inhibitor may&#xD;
             experience an anaphylactoid-like reaction, including hypotension associated with&#xD;
             flushing, dyspnea, and bradycardia. Such reactions, if left untreated, may be&#xD;
             life-threatening. The administration of ACE inhibitors also has been associated with&#xD;
             the occurrence of tachycardia. Risk of an anaphylactoid-like reaction or tachycardia&#xD;
             may be minimized by the temporary cessation of the administration of ACE inhibitors&#xD;
             for 6 days or longer before initiating the treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any known pre-existing medical condition that could interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation in the entire protocol, including serious psychiatric disorders, CNS&#xD;
             trauma or active seizure disorders requiring medication, poorly-controlled diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus as indicated by an Hb-A1c &gt; 8% within the two weeks prior to protocol&#xD;
             initiation, significant cardiovascular dysfunction within the past 6 months (e.g.,&#xD;
             angina, congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, severe interdialytic&#xD;
             hypotension, or significant arrhythmia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with ECG showing clinically significant abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Dementia or other cognitively-limiting disease processes which would make it difficult&#xD;
             for the patient to articulate their clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Prior blood transfusion for any reason within 3 months prior to enrollment into study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Recent history of bleeding or bleeding disorders that would likely require the&#xD;
             restriction in use of heparin during study treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Active immunologically mediated disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease [Crohn's&#xD;
             disease, ulcerative colitis], rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia&#xD;
             purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune or inherited hemolytic anemia,&#xD;
             scleroderma, severe psoriasis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any medical condition requiring, or likely to require during the course of the study,&#xD;
             chronic systemic administration of steroids or other immunoregulatory medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Substance abuse, such as alcohol (~80 gm/day), IV drugs, and inhaled drugs (If the&#xD;
             subject has a history of substance abuse, to be considered for inclusion into the&#xD;
             protocol, the subject must have abstained from using the abused substance for at least&#xD;
             2 months. Subjects receiving methadone within the past year are also excluded.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any cancer requiring systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigators, would make&#xD;
             the subject unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with the subject&#xD;
             participating in and completing the protocol.&#xD;
