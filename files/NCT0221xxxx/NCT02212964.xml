      Using a multi-echo gradient echo sequence to calculate R2* and quantitative susceptibility&#xD;
      maps and well as susceptibility-weighted imaging post processing the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the investigators would be able to distinguish between pseudoprogression and&#xD;
      true progression with the use of an easily implementable sequence on clinical MRI scanners.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-treatment radiographic imaging change (PTRIC) is seen in approximately 50% of patients&#xD;
      who are treated for brain neoplasms using chemotherapy and radiotherapy. PTRIC can be&#xD;
      attributed to true disease progression or a form of benign radiographic enhancement, known in&#xD;
      literature as pseudoprogression. Of these patients, 50% of them have benign radiographic&#xD;
      enhancement that is usually spontaneously resolved and required no intervention. The other&#xD;
      50% require immediate medical intervention, or more aggressive treatment for true&#xD;
      progression. Currently standard medical practise is to administer a prophylactic treatment of&#xD;
      chemotherapy to all patients with PTRIC with a follow up scan 3-6 months after initial PTRIC&#xD;
      diagnosis, leading to up to 50% of patients receiving an unneeded dose of chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to take advantage of the differentiation in tissue types and&#xD;
      vascularization between true progression tumour and pseudoprogression to be able to identify&#xD;
      patients who would not need to be administered a prophylactic dose of chemotherapy.&#xD;
