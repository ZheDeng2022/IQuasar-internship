      VISTA is looking to see if vitamin D supplements before bariatric surgery might improve&#xD;
      vitamin D stores, which may help to prevent some complications like infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who can join this research study?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approved to undergo bariatric surgery-Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass or Vertical Sleeve&#xD;
           Gastrectomy-at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 to 64 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI of 35 to 49.9 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VitD insufficient or deficient prior to having surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      What will happen if a participant chooses to participate in this research study?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be randomly assigned (by chance) to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard care plus vitamin D supplements or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard care plus a placebo (contains no vitamin D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Either would be provided at no cost to the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will ask the participant to complete a survey on the day of surgery&#xD;
           regarding supplement use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will follow the participants medical record through the 12 month&#xD;
           follow up clinic visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 2 in 3 American adults are either overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2) or obese (BMI&#xD;
      30-39.9 kg/m2). The prevalence of obesity, morbid obesity (BMI 40-44.9 kg/m2), and even super&#xD;
      obesity (BMI â‰¥ 45 kg/m2) are increasing. Obesity is a leading contributor to global mortality&#xD;
      and contributes to the burden of disease associated with diabetes, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis, and some cancers. Morbid obesity reduces&#xD;
      life expectancy by 8 to 10 years, similar to the effect of being a regular cigarette smoker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated that most obese adults are vitamin D (VitD) insufficient&#xD;
      (&lt;75 nmol/L, 30 ng/ml) or deficient (&lt;50 nmol/L, 20 ng/ml). The inverse relationship between&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) or body fat mass and VitD status is hypothesized to be due to&#xD;
      sequestration of VitD by adipose tissue, reducing the bioavailability of VitD. The classical&#xD;
      role of VitD is in the maintenance of bone calcification, but more recent research has&#xD;
      elucidated a more varied role for this hormone. Lack of VitD has been associated with&#xD;
      increased susceptibility to infection, autoimmunity, cancer, and chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery is currently the most successful means of long-term weight loss. Since&#xD;
      deficiency in fat-soluble vitamins, such as VitD, is considered a metabolic complication of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery, determining the VitD status of these individuals and perhaps correcting it&#xD;
      prior to surgery may prove greatly beneficial. Potential complications relating to VitD&#xD;
      insufficiency and deficiency include adverse surgical outcomes such as improper wound&#xD;
      healing, infection of the surgical incision, and atrial fibrillation. Since the indications&#xD;
      for bariatric surgery are obesity and obesity-related comorbidities, bariatric surgery&#xD;
      patients are at an increased risk of having an adverse surgical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Johns Hopkins Center for Bariatric Surgery (JHCBS) is designated as a Center of&#xD;
      Excellence by the American College of Surgeons. To comply with this designation, the center&#xD;
      must maintain a certain standard of care (SoC) and minimize complication rates. Given the&#xD;
      potential relationship between VitD status and adverse surgical outcomes, the investigators&#xD;
      are currently reviewing pre-operative VitD status (serum 25(OH)D concentration) collected as&#xD;
      routine SoC and investigating the relationship with surgical outcomes under an Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board (IRB) approved protocol (NA_00087502). The investigators findings reveal that&#xD;
      most of bariatric surgery patients are VitD insufficient and deficient pre-operatively. To&#xD;
      date, there is no standard regarding treating these deficiencies pre-operatively and as such&#xD;
      the center does not intervene prior to surgery. A randomized, double-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled pilot trial is needed to assess the causality of the relationship between&#xD;
      pre-operative VitD status and adverse surgical outcomes in the bariatric surgical patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to identify new patients approved for bariatric surgery at the JHCBS.&#xD;
      These patients will be randomized consecutively in a 1:1 ratio to either 30 days of 10,000&#xD;
      International Units (IU) of VitD3 plus SoC or 30 days of placebo plus SoC immediately prior&#xD;
      to surgery. The investigators will monitor these patients for any adverse surgical outcomes,&#xD;
      including wound infection, dehiscence, and prolonged length of hospital stay. The&#xD;
      investigators will also monitor their long-term clinical outcomes such as malnutrition,&#xD;
      weight loss, and resolution of comorbidities at their routine clinic care visit: 2 weeks, 6&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-operatively. At these visits the patients are&#xD;
      assessed for wound healing, weight loss, nutritional status, and other key markers of health,&#xD;
      such as vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to determine if 10,000 IU of VitD3 daily for 30 days prior to bariatric&#xD;
      surgery (Roux-en Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) or Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG)) will&#xD;
      significantly increase the VitD status (serum 25(OH)D concentration) and whether the&#xD;
      associated change in VitD status leads to decrease risk of adverse surgical outcomes and/or&#xD;
      improved clinical outcomes.&#xD;
