      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving CD4+T cells&#xD;
      with ipilimumab and cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD4+T cells are a type of white blood cell. Researchers grow the T cells in the laboratory,&#xD;
      and they are designed to find cancer cells and may kill them.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. The first 3 or 6 participants will receive a lower&#xD;
      dose of ipilimumab. If there are no intolerable side effects, then the second group of 6&#xD;
      participants will receive a higher dose of ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will receive the same dose level of cyclophosphamide and the CD4+T&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Day -2 (2 days before&#xD;
      you receive the CD4+T cells). If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will be given standard&#xD;
      drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information&#xD;
      about how the drugs are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0, you will receive the CD4+T cells by vein over about 30-60 minutes. You will stay in&#xD;
      the hospital overnight after the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 22, 43, and 64, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over about 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2-4 weeks before you receive the CD4+T cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and&#xD;
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a computed tomography (CT) scan or x-rays to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw will&#xD;
           include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 0, 7, 14, 22, 28, 35, 43, 49, and 56:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and&#xD;
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 3, blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests,&#xD;
      and tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between Day 35 and 42 and again between Day 77 and 84, you will have a CT scan or x-rays to&#xD;
      check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study tests may be repeated or you may have additional tests performed anytime the doctor&#xD;
      thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the study tests may be done at your local clinic if you cannot return to MD Anderson.&#xD;
      The study staff will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Drug Dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your last study drug dose will be on Day 64. You will no longer be able to take the study&#xD;
      drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to&#xD;
      follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study-Drug-Dosing Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 64:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and&#xD;
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 70, 77, 84, 105, 126, 147, and 168:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and&#xD;
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months after Day 84, unless the disease gets worse or you start another cancer&#xD;
      therapy, you will have a CT scan or x-rays to check the status of the disease. Every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 5 years, the study staff will call you or ask your doctor how you are doing. If you&#xD;
      are called, the calls should last about 10-15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed to confirm the status of the disease, blood (about 1½&#xD;
      tablespoons) will be drawn every 3 months for up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will return to the clinic every 4-6 weeks starting&#xD;
      after Day 168 or as often as the doctor thinks is needed. These visits will stop if the&#xD;
      T-cells disappear or if the disease gets worse. Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn&#xD;
      for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in your&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. CD4+T cells are not FDA approved or commercially available.&#xD;
      They are currently being used for research purposes only. Cyclophosphamide is FDA approved&#xD;
      and commercially available for the way it is being used in this study. Ipilimumab is FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma, but not for sarcoma. The&#xD;
      study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 12 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
