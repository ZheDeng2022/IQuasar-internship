    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) are chronic systemic&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases that have been reported to affect the ocular surface of patients [1,2].&#xD;
      However, the nature of the disturbances of the ocular surface immunity and their relationship&#xD;
      to systemic disease severity are poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to profile the ocular surface inflammation of RA and SLE patients by a.,&#xD;
      analysing levels of tear cytokine, and b., investigating conjunctival cells, and c. clinical&#xD;
      imaging for conjunctival redness and tear stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 consecutive RA patients and 20 consecutive SLE patients will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Singapore General Hospital Rheumatology clinic. 20 age matched controls for SLE and another&#xD;
      20 age matched controls for RA will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tear collection with Schirmer strips&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EyePRIMTM (Opia Technologies) Impression Cytology Device for conjunctival sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical ocular surface assessment with Oculus Keratograph 5M&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Collection of blood via venipuncture (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Retrieval of Clinical Information of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association of cytokines in the tears with various cellular and immune markers, as well&#xD;
      as clinical signs of inflammation and tear stability will be investigated. This will be&#xD;
      useful for further longitudinal studies of treatment in autoimmmune disease patients.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory autoimmune disease and eye involvement Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Systemic&#xD;
      Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) are chronic systemic autoimmune diseases of unknown etiology [2].&#xD;
      Ocular manifestations may range from conditions which cause distressing symptoms of&#xD;
      discomfort, such as dry eye syndrome, to potentially sight-threatening conditions such as&#xD;
      retinal vasculitis. The ocular surface is agreed to be the site most commonly affected by&#xD;
      systemic autoimmune diseases, manifesting as dry eye syndrome. However, its related&#xD;
      complications are poorly addressed [1,2]. The severity of ocular surface inflammation may be&#xD;
      related to systemic immunology since systemic treatment will alter the signs of ocular&#xD;
      surface disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EyePRIMTM (Opia Technologies) Impression Cytology Device Studies have shown that this method&#xD;
      of combining flow cytometry with OSIC is useful to phenotype recovered cells from the&#xD;
      superficial layers of the ocular surface [3]. There has been recent advances in clinical&#xD;
      techniques for obtaining conjunctival cells for reseach studies. An example of an award&#xD;
      winning device is the EyePRIMTM (Opia Technologies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that EyePRIMTM is able to obtain sufficient cells for flow&#xD;
      cytometry for immune markers [4]. In the study, the ocular surface of three healthy patients&#xD;
      were analysed using EyePRIMTM and conventional semi-circular Supor PES filters for flow&#xD;
      cytometry. One EyePRIMTM was used to impression the lateral bulbar conjunctiva and a second,&#xD;
      the medial bulbar conjunctiva of the same eye. Cells were recovered from both EyePRIMTM using&#xD;
      gentle agitation with a pipette tip for one minute, and then stained with antibody markers&#xD;
      for leukocytes (CD45), CD16, epCAM, HLA-DR and a dead cell exclusion dye. Results have shown&#xD;
      that the mean corrected total cell count collected using EyePRIMTM was greater than&#xD;
      conventional methods (475,544 cells vs 335,226 cells). Out of the total cells collected, the&#xD;
      mean corrected number of lymphocytes found via staining with CD45 antibody was around 1000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in clinical phenotyping Dry eye is a common ocular surface disease mediated by&#xD;
      inflammation. It is postulated that dry eye in the context of systemic autoimmune diseases is&#xD;
      caused by the infiltration of activated T lymphocytes into the bulbar conjunctiva, beginning&#xD;
      a vicious cycle of chronic inflammation of the ocular surface [5]. In the dry eye database at&#xD;
      SNEC/SERI (unpublished data), we found higher levels of fluorescein corneal staining,&#xD;
      indicating presence of punctate epithelial erosions in patients with RA compared to dry eye&#xD;
      patients without systemic autoimmune diseases. While we have not personally conducted studies&#xD;
      on SLE patients, it is documented in existing literature that significant signs of dry eye&#xD;
      have been detected in SLE patients using older assessment modalities such as the Schirmer's&#xD;
      test and Rose Bengal staining [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, the availability of new phenotyping equipment such as the Oculus Keratograph 5M&#xD;
      provides the opportunity for clinical parameters such as conjunctival redness and&#xD;
      non-invasive tear break up time (NIBUT) to be assessed objectively, accurately and&#xD;
      non-invasively [7]. To the best of the investigators' knowledge, these standardised tools&#xD;
      have not been used in the context of rheumatological disease or its effect on the ocular&#xD;
      surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research experience at SERI In SERI there is significant experience with clinical and imaging&#xD;
      studies of the ocular surface. The clinical profile of the ocular surface inflammation can be&#xD;
      objectively measured or documented using newly available imaging techniques as described. In&#xD;
      addition, a TCR grant will be jointly applied for in the coming months to examine systemic as&#xD;
      well as ocular immune events during treatment of rheumatology patients including RA and SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data Our research team has experience with extraction of tear proteins from&#xD;
      schirmer strips in a longitudinal trial and analysing after each patient's visit, tear&#xD;
      cytokine concentrations for IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN , TNFa , IL-12, IL-13,&#xD;
      IL-17a, MCP, MIP1a, MMP9, IP10, RANTES using the BioPlex technique (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other studies (unpublished data), our research group has successfully performed flow&#xD;
      cytometry, and evaluated the proportion of various immune cell types by staining for cell&#xD;
      surface markers. This study was performed on pterygium tissues. We were able to perform&#xD;
      intracytoplasmic staining for cytokines after Phorbol Myristate Acetate (PMA) stimulation.&#xD;
      This was performed for Th1 (eg. TNFα and IFN γ) and Th17 (eg. IL-17a) cytokines, from&#xD;
      populations of T lymphocytes as few as 300-500.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and specific aims This study thus aims to profile the ocular surface inflammation&#xD;
      of RA and SLE patients by a., analysing levels of tear cytokine, and b., investigating&#xD;
      conjunctival cells, and c. clinical imaging for conjunctival redness and tear stability. In&#xD;
      the conjunctiva of the patients, we expect to find conjunctival epithelial cells, stromal&#xD;
      fibroblasts as well as various immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A primary purpose of the study is to profile A. tear cytokine levels and B. the&#xD;
           proportion of various immune cells (eg., lymphocyte, dendritic cell and neutrophil&#xD;
           subsets) in the conjunctival impressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary aim is to further profile the immune response, either by examining the&#xD;
           possible Th1 and Th17 responses of T cells to stimulation, or by the levels of&#xD;
           inflammatory gene transcripts, ie., pattern of immune gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A third aim is to study the correlation between the activity of systemic disease, ocular&#xD;
           surface status, and tear cytokine and immune cell levels of RA and SLE patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes 1. Tear cytokine levels 2. Conjunctival immune cell profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proportion of T lymphocytes and other immune cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immune gene expression 3. Clinical parameters for ocular surface: Conjunctival redness,&#xD;
           tear meniscus height and NIBUT 4. Rheumatological disease activity indices of the&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tear cytokine levels and conjunctival immune cell profile of RA and SLE patients in&#xD;
           comparison to healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. EXPECTED RIKS AND BENEFITS Expected risks No potential problems are expected for this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Potential benefits With greater understanding of the presence of various inflammatory&#xD;
           mediators, we can gain further insight into the complex process taking place. It is also&#xD;
           possible that some markers like tear proteins can be biomarkers that warn individuals of&#xD;
           systemic flares. We have jointly filed a provisional patent on such tear biomarkers in&#xD;
           SLE flares. (Date of Filing: 11 September 2013 Singapore Provisional Patent Application&#xD;
           No.: 201306892-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. STUDY POPULATION 3.1. List the number and nature of subjects to be enrolled.&#xD;
           Participants and target sample size 20 consecutive RA patients and 20 consecutive SLE&#xD;
           patients, aged 21 to 99, will be recruited from the Singapore General Hospital, under&#xD;
           three settings a., SGH Rheumatology outpatients b., Rheumatology patients from the&#xD;
           wards, c., Patients from pilot project under Dr Tan (CIRB REF: 2013/152/E).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Permission would be sought from the attending doctors before subjects are being&#xD;
           recruited. Eligible subjects will be counselled on the study by the study coordinator.&#xD;
           If the subject is interested, the study coordinator will then accompany the subject to&#xD;
           SERI for the relevant assessments. Informed written consent will be obtained from all&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, we will recruit 20 age matched controls for SLE and similarly another 20&#xD;
           controls for RA. If older controls are required, they will be from the pre-cataract&#xD;
           patients, and younger ones from volunteers and other students. They will undergo the&#xD;
           same assessments as the patients in the other groups. Publicity for the study will be&#xD;
           carried out via posters or word of mouth (draft of poster is submitted for approval).&#xD;
&#xD;

           4. STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES/METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
           No. of visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
           There will only be 1 study visit in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Duration of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           11 months (Apr 2014 to Mar 2015). Recruitment of patients and collection of data will&#xD;
           take place from 22nd May 2014 to 31 July 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The different procedures proposed in this small study are summarized below, and&#xD;
           elaborated upon in subsequent paragraphs:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Tear collection with Schirmer strips&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. EyePRIMTM (Opia Technologies) Impression Cytology Device for conjunctival sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Clinical ocular surface assessment with Oculus Keratograph 5M&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Collection of blood via venipuncture (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Retrieval of Clinical Information of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. a. Schirmer's I test This will be done with the standard strips currently used at&#xD;
                SERI (5 mm wide with a notch for folding) (Schirmer Tear Test Strips, Clement&#xD;
                Clarke International, UK). No prior anaesthetic will be used. The strips will be&#xD;
                positioned over the temporal half of the lower lid margin in both eyes at the same&#xD;
                time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study participant will be asked to close their eyes. Any excessive irritation signs&#xD;
           will be noted. The extent of the wetting in each strip will be recorded after 5 minutes&#xD;
           of testing. The strip will be collected and stored in 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes at -80˚C&#xD;
           until further cytokine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1b. Tear cytokine level measurement with BioPlex Human Cytokine Assay We propose&#xD;
           analyzing tear cytokine levels from tears collected on Schirmer strips. In previous&#xD;
           studies on dry eye patients being treated with punctal occlusion, we were able to elute&#xD;
           proteins from Schirmer strips and determine levels of 15 cytokines. Tear proteins will&#xD;
           be extracted as in previous protocols at SERI [8]. Briefly, we will cut out the wetted&#xD;
           portions of the strips and vortex after adding phosphate buffered saline in protease&#xD;
           inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The assay will be using a commercially available bead based indirect sandwich&#xD;
           immunofluorescence assay (Beadlyte Kit). The readout will be performed with the Bioplex&#xD;
           (BIO-RAD) platform. Cytokine standard provided with the kit will be used to plot&#xD;
           standard curves. The levels of cytokines in tears are normalised to per mm of Schirmer&#xD;
           and further analysed. We believe this same method of tear-sample collection will be just&#xD;
           as effective in assessing patients with RA/SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Impression cytology Impression cytology will be performed to collect the superficial&#xD;
           conjunctiva cells for analysis. Conjunctiva impression specimen of the upper bulbar&#xD;
           conjunctiva will be collected with the EyePRIMTM device.&#xD;
&#xD;
           One drop of topical anaesthesia (eg. alcaine) is instilled. The eyelid will be held open&#xD;
           with the thumb and forefinger. The distal end of the device will be positioned on the&#xD;
           conjunctiva of the participant. The inner radius can be positioned adjacent to the&#xD;
           limbus. The push-button will be pressed until the membrane is in contact with the&#xD;
           temporal bulbar conjunctiva, holding for 2 to 3 seconds. It will then be removed from&#xD;
           the conjunctiva with a peeling motion after 2-3 seconds. The membrane will subsequently&#xD;
           be placed in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum..&#xD;
           This will be carried out over the temporal bulbar conjunctiva of both eyes. Each&#xD;
           participant will then be given a single-use container of Refresh Plus ® artificial tears&#xD;
           for self-application in case any ocular irritation is felt after impression cytology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The cells can then be processed after the patient's visit. Cells will be recovered from&#xD;
           the EyePRIMTM filters using gentle agitation with a pipette tip for one minute, and then&#xD;
           stained with antibody markers for dendritic cells (lymphoid and myeloid), NK cells, B&#xD;
           cells, T cells , neutrophils and monocytes. Specifically, CD123, CD16, CD45, CD56, CD3,&#xD;
           CD4, CD8, CD66b, CD11b, CD11c markers will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cells harvested from impression cytology will be counted and undergo flow cytometry and&#xD;
           depending on numbers, determination of the proportion of immune cells of various types,&#xD;
           and even staining for Intracytoplasmic cytokines in lymphocytes after Phorbol Myristate&#xD;
           Acetate stimulation. One modification of flow cytometry is the Amnis or microscopy&#xD;
           coupled flow cytometry which can be performed at the SingHealth Immunology and&#xD;
           Inflammation center. Amnis and microscopy couples flow cytometry can handle even less&#xD;
           cells than conventional flow cytometry. If the cells from impression cytology are not&#xD;
           sufficient for these purposes, nano-string transcript levels of various immune markers&#xD;
           will be performed instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Oculus K 5M imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Non-Invasive Tear Break-Up Time (Oculus K5M) Non-Invasive Tear Break-Up Time is measured&#xD;
      non-invasively and fully automatically using Oculus K5M. The new infrared illumination is not&#xD;
      visible to the human eye. This prevents glare during the examination. Patient will sit&#xD;
      comfortably in front of the instrument and blink freely while fixing on a target directly&#xD;
      ahead. Once the participant is ready, they will be instructed to blink twice and refrain from&#xD;
      blinking. Keratograph 5M is fully automated and it will capture any break or distortion in&#xD;
      the image and the time of the break will be noted. Three readings will be taken for each eye&#xD;
      to get the average value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Tear Meniscus Height (Oculus K5M) This can be measured non-invasively by the Oculus K5M to&#xD;
      the nearest mm. Patient will sit comfortably in front of the instrument while fixing on a&#xD;
      target directly ahead. Tear meniscus will be captured by the machine and tear meniscus height&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Conjunctival redness (Oculus K5M) Conjunctival redness will be assessed using Oculus K5M.&#xD;
      Patient will sit comfortably in front of the instrument while fixing on a target directly&#xD;
      ahead. Imaged will be captured and an overview display of conjunctival redness will be&#xD;
      evaluated by &quot;JENVIS Grading Scale&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Collection of blood via venipuncture (optional) 5-10ml of blood will be collected from&#xD;
      patients via venipuncture. This is optional based on participant preference. Two different&#xD;
      Participant Information Sheets have been prepared based on their choice of having&#xD;
      venipuncture and disclosing its results. This will be taken on a non-study visit or when it&#xD;
      is concurrent with a clinically indicated blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Retrieval of Clinical Information of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three areas of clinical information of the rheumatic status in our participants will be&#xD;
      collected retrospectively. These areas are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Most recent serology results for autoantibody titres and other blood test results such&#xD;
           as erythrocyte sedimentation rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. History of drug prescriptions&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Disease activity index and other relevant clinical information&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose obtaining the data in 1) and 2) from the patient's electronic medical records via&#xD;
      the Citrix XenApp portal. Disease activity index and other clinical information may be&#xD;
      obtained from the case files of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Small volumes of fluid can be used in a multiplex way to determine more than one&#xD;
      cytokine in the Beadlyte assay, compared to ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EyePRIMTM technique is used because of prior studies that showed a high cellular yield&#xD;
      and success in immune profiling with 3 healthy people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RA and SLE patients should have elevated tear cytokine levels and increased inflammatory&#xD;
           cell population in their conjunctival samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RA and SLE patients should have greater signs of ocular surface inflammation than the&#xD;
           healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The signs of ocular surface inflammation should correlate with disease activity, tear&#xD;
           cytokines profiles and conjunctival inflammatory cell profiles.&#xD;
