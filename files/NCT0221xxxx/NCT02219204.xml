    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a major, common medical condition with significant health and economic burden in&#xD;
      Singapore and worldwide. It is a holistic problem affected by living habits, nutrition and&#xD;
      underlying systemic disease, inducing a significant decrease in quality-of-life. The hallmark&#xD;
      of this disease is raised tear osmolarity and inflammation. There is no definitive cure for&#xD;
      this condition, as treatment in the form of lubricants is only symptomatic and treatment with&#xD;
      cyclosporine eyedrops is expensive and may not be well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the rise in international interest in complementary medicine, randomized-controlled&#xD;
      studies in dry eye using Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) have been published, with mixed&#xD;
      results. However, the major limitation of these studies is the lack of objective assessment&#xD;
      for inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to collaborate with an academically-trained Singapore TCM physician who has&#xD;
      conducted dry eye trials, and synergistically exploit the existing state-of-the-art dry eye&#xD;
      monitoring technologies available at Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI). This proposal&#xD;
      is cost-effective, building on previous government grants and expertise to provide definitive&#xD;
      scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety of TCM in dry eye. SERI has an international&#xD;
      reputation for interventional studies, and the PI has a good academic relationship with the&#xD;
      above TCM physician. We propose to screen, recruit and treat 150 patients with a herbal&#xD;
      preparation and acupuncture, and evaluate over 4 weeks in a randomized-controlled study.&#xD;
      Tests to be performed will include tear imaging and osmolarity, as well as protein and&#xD;
      cytokine assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Singapore is uniquely positioned at the crossroads of the East and the West to take the lead&#xD;
      in this field. Given that there is an increasing patient interest in holistic care in&#xD;
      Singapore and the rise of scientifically trained TCM practitioners, a study like this one is&#xD;
      very timely, and will have tremendous impact to healthcare delivery in Singapore.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a major, common medical condition with significant health burden in Singapore and&#xD;
      worldwide. As much as one third of the adult population in Asian countries are affected by&#xD;
      dry eye. It has been shown that dry eye affects quality of life, including the performing of&#xD;
      daily activities such as reading and driving a car. Moderate severity of dry eye affects some&#xD;
      patients like moderate angina. The direct and indirect cost of treating dry eye is high and&#xD;
      increasing. For example, it costs individuals about US$800 per year to treat dry eye, but the&#xD;
      cost to society for managing such a patient is US$12000 per year. (1-29)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry eye is a holistic problem affected by living habits such as working long hours on the&#xD;
      computer and in a dry, air-conditioned environment. It is also associated with poor nutrition&#xD;
      and intake of dietary supplements such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may help to treat&#xD;
      dry eye. Dry eye is also a systemic immune mediated disease, and aggravated by those with&#xD;
      autoimmune Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosis, Steven Johnson syndrome and chronic graft versus host disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent international workshop, international experts in dry eye agree that the hallmark&#xD;
      of this disease is raised tear osmolarity and ocular surface inflammation. Traditionally, dry&#xD;
      eye is diagnosed by a reduced Schirmer's test and/or reduced tear break up time or the&#xD;
      presence of dry eye symptoms. In addition to these traditional tests, it would be&#xD;
      advantageous to incorporate measurements of osmolarity and inflammation in clinical studies.&#xD;
      There is no definitive cure for this condition, as treatment in the form of lubricants is&#xD;
      only symptomatic and treatment with cyclosporine eye drops is expensive and may not be well&#xD;
      tolerated. Treatment with steroids can be effective but associated with adverse effects such&#xD;
      as sight threatening glaucoma. In summary there is a definite medical need for alternative&#xD;
      therapies in dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is involved in restoring the natural balance of the body,&#xD;
      which results in disease like dry eye when this is disturbed. In TCM philosophy, dry eye may&#xD;
      result from syndromes such as yin deficiency in the liver or kidney. Modalities such as&#xD;
      acupuncture or herbs can be used judiciously to restore the balance in specific patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently there have been randomized controlled studies in dry eye using acupuncture and&#xD;
      herbs, with mixed results, refer to attachment (Table 1). The major limitation of these&#xD;
      studies is that objective tear film evaluation such as tear osmolarity, and tear cytokines&#xD;
      and proteins, which are indicative of ocular surface inflammation, have not been evaluated.&#xD;
      In addition, some studies suffer from lack of proper controls or randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the mainstream practitioners of evidence based medicine are convinced that TCM can&#xD;
      fundamentally alter the pathological processes in dry eye, they will be more receptive to&#xD;
      this form of treatment. At the same time, regulatory bodies need to be reassured that TCM is&#xD;
      safe in dry eye, so that more education and promotion of such treatment can benefit more&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI runs a dry eye clinic twice a week at the Singapore National Eye Centre since 2006. He&#xD;
      is aware that many dry eye patients in Singapore have experienced a host of more conventional&#xD;
      therapies and are eager to attempt alternative forms of therapy. This trend towards TCM and&#xD;
      holistic medicine will continue regardless of the attitudes of 'western' medical&#xD;
      practitioners. This study, when completed, will present an opportunity for bridging the gaps&#xD;
      between the two health care communities who do not normally interact. Since latest scientific&#xD;
      tools in terms of protein science and imaging will be employed in the study, it will&#xD;
      definitely increase the evidence based medicine for TCM in the dry eye field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI has published 67 peer reviewed papers in dry eyes and related ocular surface&#xD;
      processes, including review articles,(30-34) international expert panel report,(35)&#xD;
      epidemiological studies,(36-37) PI initiated and industry sponsored interventional drugs&#xD;
      including randomized controlled drug trials.(38-40) In one pharmacy in Singapore alone, the&#xD;
      cost of dry eye medications amounted to US$1.5 million in one year.(3) He has also found in&#xD;
      an epidemiological study in Singapore people that dry eye impairs visual associated function&#xD;
      related activities of daily living.(41) He established the only dedicated dry eye service in&#xD;
      the region and has produced many papers relating to the assessment of these patients,(42-46)&#xD;
      including one that found dry eye being related to the amount exposure to stressful activities&#xD;
      and conditions.(46) The PI has experience in the biochemical evaluation of patient tears and&#xD;
      materials in dry eye(47-51) and clinical imaging related to dry eye.(52-54) Lastly, he has&#xD;
      also appeared in mass media educational articles including press releases and articles/talks&#xD;
      for layperson and general practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survey was conducted among registered TCM practitioners in Singapore and published in a&#xD;
      peer reviewed journal.(55) This showed that a significant proportion of these institutional&#xD;
      practitioners are keen to practice in dry eye. This study was also chosen to be presented as&#xD;
      an oral presentation at the 10th Asean Congress of TCM cum 3rd Asia Advanced Forum on&#xD;
      Acupuncture and Moxibustion. At the same time, the full article has been translated into&#xD;
      Chinese in the congress proceedings page 192-197 to appeal to the audience of TCM physicians.&#xD;
      The PI has also participated in discussion on data analysis in TCM trials. (56-57) In&#xD;
      addition, acupuncture in rabbits had shown to induce changed in tear proteins, although this&#xD;
      has not been evaluated in humans. (58)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           The overall hypothesis is that traditional Chinese medicine modalities of acupuncture&#xD;
           and herbs can improve the symptoms and signs of dry eye, and objectively, these&#xD;
           improvements are associated with reduction of tear osmolarity and reduction of&#xD;
           inflammatory markers such as tear cytokines and proinflammatory proteins. There is also&#xD;
           a long term objective of integrating TCM and mainstream medical care and having a&#xD;
           cost-effective approach to eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Change in SPEED score (Week4-Week0)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in Tear Evaporimetry&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in TCM score (Lung-Kidney Yin deficiency)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in NIBUT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in Schirmers I&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in Corneal fluorescein staining (5 zones)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in Tear osmolarity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in Tear meniscus height&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in Tear protein/ cytokine levels&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           We aim to show that dry eye patients treated with acupuncture is efficacious (can&#xD;
           improve symptoms and signs of dry eye) and safe (no ocular and systemic side effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           We aim to show that dry eye patients treated with a herbal preparation is efficacious&#xD;
           (can result in reduction of symptoms and signs of dry eye) and safe (no ocular and&#xD;
           systemic side effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
           We also aim to show that objective, definitive hallmarks of dry eye disease, ie. Tear&#xD;
           osmolarity and surrogates of ocular surface inflammation, such as tear cytokines and&#xD;
           proinflammatory proteins, are reduced after treatment by acupuncture and herbal&#xD;
           treatment, compared to control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Potential Risks and Benefits: 1.3.1 Potential Risks We will anticipate minimal risk&#xD;
           and discomfort involve in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  It is possible that eyelid bruising and swelling may occur from acupuncture needles&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Some slight discomfort from Schirmers I test&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nausea, insomnia, headache, loss of appetite, malaise, diarrhoea and abdominal&#xD;
                cramps may occur after herbal consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
           Relatively few complications have been reported from the use of acupuncture. However,&#xD;
           acupuncture can cause potentially serious side effects if not delivered properly by a&#xD;
           qualified practitioner. The most common side effects after acupuncture include soreness,&#xD;
           bruises, fatigue, lightheadedness and involuntary twitching of muscle. Should this event&#xD;
           occur, increased frequency of visits to the eye clinic may be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3.2 Potential Benefits There is no assurance participants will benefit from this&#xD;
           study. However, their participation may contribute to the medical knowledge whether TCM&#xD;
           medicine can fundamentally alter the pathological processes in dry eye. At the same&#xD;
           time, regulatory bodies need to be reassured that TCM is safe in dry eye, so that more&#xD;
           education and promotion of such treatment can benefit more people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY POPULATION 3.1 List The Number and Nature of Subjects to be Enrolled. One hundred&#xD;

&#xD;
      4 STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized observer masked parallel group three arm interventional&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment arms&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 trial arms in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control: Systane Ultra Eye drop (n=50)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systane Ultra Eye Drop and Acupuncture treatment (n=50)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systane Ultra Eye Drop and Herbs treatment (n=50)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 5 Weeks Recruitment duration: 1 Year&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Randomisation and Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomisation procedure used will entail:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presence of two witnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Drawing of lots&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization codes for the 3 groups will be noted. For e.g. 001A, 002B, 003C etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study information related to randomisation will be filed and kept at SCHMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Only unblinded personnel have access to the randomization code file&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be done at SCHMI. Study members at SCHMI will be unblinded as they will be&#xD;
      delivering TCM treatments to the subjects. However, study members at SERI will all be blinded&#xD;
      so as to prevent unintentional biases when assessing and monitoring of ocular surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a situation of a serious event, a decision on whether to open (break) the code for the&#xD;
      specific patient is necessary. Although it is advantageous to retain the blind for all&#xD;
      patients prior to final study analysis, when a serious adverse reaction is judged reportable&#xD;
      on an expedited basis, it is recommended that the blind be broken only for that specific&#xD;
      patient by the designated investigator who is unblind. It is also recommended that, when&#xD;
      possible and appropriate, the blind be maintained for those persons, such as biometrics&#xD;
      personnel, responsible for analysis and interpretation of results at the study's conclusion.&#xD;
