  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a feasibility trial that was designed to provide preliminary observations and&#xD;
      generate hypotheses for future studies. The aim of the study is to estimate the difference of&#xD;
      arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation rate between ticagrelor mono-therapy and&#xD;
      aspirin/ticagrelor dual-therapy after 14 days of treatment in patients with stable coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. The potential hypothesis is that the arachidonic acid (AA) induced platelet&#xD;
      aggregation rate after 2 weeks of ticagrelor mono-therapy is comparable to that of&#xD;
      aspirin/ticagrelor dual-therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open labeled, active-controlled pilot study to estimate the difference&#xD;
      of arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation rate between ticagrelor monotherapy and&#xD;
      aspirin/ticagrelor dual-therapy in patients with stable coronary heart disease. The&#xD;
      anticipated duration of the study is approximately 9 months, including an anticipated&#xD;
      enrolment period of 8 months and follow-up period of 4weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with documented coronary heart disease and currently receiving dual-antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy with standard dose aspirin and clopidogrel will be enrolled from the study site. For&#xD;
      patients post acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), they&#xD;
      must be on dual-antiplatelet therapy for at least 12 months to be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plan, including enrolment/randomization and follow-up visits, is outlined in Table&#xD;
      1. Eligible patients will enter a washout phase with ticagrelor for 2 weeks. Then they will&#xD;
      be randomized to take either ticagrelor alone or aspirin/ticagrelor for 14 days. The efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation will be done at 7 and 14days after randomization. The primary efficacy parameter&#xD;
      is the rate of arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation after 14 days of treatment. All&#xD;
      patients will be treated to standards of care for coronary heart disease secondary&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 0 (Screening and Enrollment, 0 day) All potentially eligible patients will undergo a&#xD;
      screening visit following their signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an 8-hour fast, the patients will have screening evaluations performed. Demography,&#xD;
      medical history, and concomitant medication will be recorded. A physical examination and&#xD;
      vital signs(pulse and BP), height and weight, as well as blood sampling for laboratory&#xD;
      assessments of complete blood count (CBC) with differential, serum creatinine, alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and AA, adenosine diphosphate&#xD;
      (ADP) and collagen induced platelet aggregation rate will be done. Standard 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) readings will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting all inclusion criteria and with no exclusion criteria will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Patients will receive ticagrelor mono-therapy from the evening for 14 days. IP will be&#xD;
      dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Randomization, 14 days) Suspected adverse events (AEs) will be recorded. A physical&#xD;
      examination and vital signs (pulse and BP), as well as blood sampling for laboratory&#xD;
      assessments of AA, ADP and collagen induced platelet aggregation rate and serum thromboxane&#xD;
      B2 concentration will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should be told to take ticagrelor in the morning of Visit 1. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ticagrelor mono-therapy or aspirin/ticagrelor&#xD;
      dual-therapy. Investigational product (IP) will be returned and compliance assessed and new&#xD;
      bottles of IP will be dispensed according to randomized groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (21 days) Suspected AEs will be recorded. Vital signs (pulse and BP) as well as blood&#xD;
      sampling for laboratory assessments of AA, ADP and collagen induced platelet aggregation rate&#xD;
      will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (End of treatment, 28 days) Suspected AEs will be recorded. Vital signs (pulse and&#xD;
      BP) as well as blood sampling for laboratory assessments of CBC with differential, Scr, ALT&#xD;
      and AST, AA, ADP and collagen induced platelet aggregation rate will be done. IP will be&#xD;
      returned and compliance assessed. Instructions for medication after study will be given to&#xD;
      patients at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who prematurely discontinued the randomized treatment, a complete end of&#xD;
      treatment visit will be preferred.&#xD;
