  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corifollitropin alfa, single dose administered sustains multiple follicular development for 7&#xD;
      days. However, It may induce ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), especially in high&#xD;
      responder women such as patients of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In GnRH antagonist&#xD;
      protocol with agonist triggering of final oocyte maturation, following embryo&#xD;
      cryopreservation can almost eliminate the risk of OHSS. To decrease the injection burden and&#xD;
      prevent OHSS in PCOS patients undergoing IVF treatment, ovarian hyperstimulation with&#xD;
      Corifollitropin alfa in GnRH antagonist protocol and GnRH agonist triggering of final oocyte&#xD;
      maturation, following elective embryo cryopreservation was designed in this study. The&#xD;
      purpose of this trial was conducted to confirmed whether this novel protocol could prevent&#xD;
      OHSS, decreased the injection burden of PCOS patients and single dose corifollitropin alfa&#xD;
      could support multiple follicular growth for 7 days.&#xD;

      BACKGROUNG: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is the most serious complication of&#xD;
      ovulation induction. Therefore, Corifollitropin alfa, long acting recombinant follicular&#xD;
      stimulation hormone (rFSH) application in PCOS women is warning. However, corifollitropin&#xD;
      alfa could decrease the injection burden of patients undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment. In&#xD;
      previous studies, embryo cryopreservation following GnRH agonist triggering final oocyte&#xD;
      maturation in GnRH antagonist protocol can almost eliminate the risk of OHSS. This study was&#xD;
      designed to analyze whether ovarian hyperstimulation in PCOS women with Corifollitropin alfa&#xD;
      in GnRH antagonist protocol and GnRH agonist triggering, following freezing all embryos can&#xD;
      decrease the injection burden without OHSS complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: To assess whether single dose Corifollitropin alfa sustains multiple follicular&#xD;
      growth for seven days in GnRH antagonist protocol application in PCOS women, following embryo&#xD;
      cryopreservation after GnRH agonist triggering can decrease injection benefit without OHSS&#xD;
      complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This prospective ,single center, observational study, thirty to fifty PCOS women&#xD;
      aged 20-38 years old, In GnRH antagonist protocol, a single dose corifollitropin alfa was&#xD;
      administered for ovarian stimulation (S1, stimulation D1). Seven days later, rFSH was daily&#xD;
      injected to stimulate follicle development according to the ovarian response. GnRH antagonist&#xD;
      was administered daily from S5 until the day of final oocyte maturation. GnRH agonist was&#xD;
      given to replace hCG to trigger final oocyte maturation when three follicles reached 17 mm in&#xD;
      size. The IVF or ICSI was planned then all embryos were elective cryopreservation. Transfer&#xD;
      of embryos was performed in a subsequent frozen-thawed ET cycles. Primary outcome measure was&#xD;
      the incidence of OHSS. The secondary outcome measures were numbers of oocytes retrieval,&#xD;
      numbers of embryos frozen and pregnancy rate of subsequent FET cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Decreasing the injection burden and maximal oocytes were retrieved&#xD;
      without severe OHSS complication.&#xD;
