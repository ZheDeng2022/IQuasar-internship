  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, multi-national, open label, single arm Phase II study of&#xD;
      single-agent cabozantinib. The objective of the study is to assess the safety and activity of&#xD;
      cabozantinib in patients with metastatic GIST who have previously progressed on imatinib and&#xD;
      sunitinib and have not been exposed yet to other KIT- or PDGFR-directed tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will receive cabozantinib until they experience no further benefit from the&#xD;
      treatment, becoming intolerant to the drug or wishing to discontinue the treatment. Treatment&#xD;
      beyond RECIST 1.1 progression is allowed in patients deriving clinical benefit upon&#xD;
      investigator's discretion, provided no other criteria for treatment withdrawal are met.&#xD;

        becoming pregnant (ie, females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months,&#xD;
        with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been&#xD;
        amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if&#xD;

             least 4 months after the last study treatment. A highly effective method of birth&#xD;
             control is defined as a method which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1%&#xD;
