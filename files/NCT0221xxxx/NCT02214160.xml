    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of UX007&#xD;
      in LC-FAOD subjects. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      UX007 on energy metabolism in LC-FAOD and evaluate the impact of UX007 on clinical events&#xD;
      associated with LC-FAOD.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, 6 months of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior participation in a clinical study assessing UX007/triheptanoin treatment for LC&#xD;
             FAOD. Study Sponsors/Collaborators include: Oregon Health &amp; Science University,&#xD;
             University of Pittsburgh, and Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
             Identifiers: NCT01379625, NCT01461304, and NCT01886378). Patients who received&#xD;
             UX007/triheptanoin treatment as part of other clinical studies; investigator sponsored&#xD;
             trials (IST); expanded access/compassionate use treatment programs; or patients who&#xD;
             are treatment naïve (i.e., naïve to both UX007 and food-grade triheptanoin), have&#xD;
             failed conventional therapy and, in the opinion of the Investigator and Sponsor, have&#xD;
             documented clear unmet need, may also be eligible at the discretion of the Sponsor&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Confirmed diagnosis of LC-FAOD including: carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT I or CPT&#xD;
             II) deficiency, very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency, long chain&#xD;
             3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency, trifunctional protein (TFP)&#xD;
             deficiency, or carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency. Information on&#xD;
             diagnosis will be obtained from medical records and should include confirmed diagnosis&#xD;
             by results of acylcarnitine profiles, fatty acid oxidation probe studies in cultured&#xD;
             fibroblasts, and/or mutation analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willing and able to complete all aspects of the study through the end of the study,&#xD;
             including visits and tests, documentation of symptoms and diet, and administration of&#xD;
             study medications. If a minor, have a caregiver(s) willing and able to assist in all&#xD;
             applicable study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Provide written informed consent (subjects aged ≥ 18 years), or provide written assent&#xD;
             (where appropriate) and have a legally authorized representative willing and able to&#xD;
             provide written informed consent, after the nature of the study has been explained and&#xD;
             prior to any research-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at&#xD;
             Baseline and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females&#xD;
             considered not of child-bearing potential include those who have not experienced&#xD;
             menarche, are post-menopausal (defined as having no menses for at least 12 months&#xD;
             without an alternative medical cause), or are permanently sterile due to total&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants of child-bearing potential or fertile males with partners of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential who are sexually active must consent to use a highly effective&#xD;
             method of contraception as determined by the Investigator from the period following&#xD;
             the signing of the informed consent through 30 days after last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of medium-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, short- or&#xD;
             medium-chain FAOD, ketone body metabolism defect, propionic acidemia or methylmalonic&#xD;
             acidemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient qualifies for any other clinical trial designed to progressively evaluate the&#xD;
             safety and efficacy of triheptanoin in LC-FAOD&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any known hypersensitivity to triheptanoin that, in the judgment of the Investigator,&#xD;
             places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding an infant at Screening or planning to become pregnant&#xD;
             (self or partner) at any time during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have any co-morbid conditions, including unstable major organ-system disease(s) that&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Investigator, places the subject at increased risk of&#xD;
             complications, interferes with study participation or compliance, or confounds study&#xD;
             objectives, or unwilling to discontinue prohibited medications&#xD;
