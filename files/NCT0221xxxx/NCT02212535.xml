    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerance and efficacy of mobilizing hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cells after a single injection of plerixafor (0.24mg/kg) in 3 adult patients (or 5, if&#xD;
      results of the first 3 patients are not reproducible) affected by sickle cell disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder caused by a point mutation in the coding region of&#xD;
      the gene of beta-globin with the consequence the production of an abnormal (betas-globin).&#xD;
      This mutation is responsible for the polymerization of deoxygenated HbS chains. Polymers make&#xD;
      red blood cells (RBC) rigid, and change their shapes and are responsible of structural&#xD;
      lesions of the membrane, altering the rheological properties of the RBC and altering blood&#xD;
      flow of microcirculation. The two ultimate consequences of all these changes are&#xD;
      intravascular haemolysis and the occurrence of vaso-occlusive episodes. Allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) transplantation is the only curative treatment for these&#xD;
      patients, but only 25% of them have a HLA-genoidentical family donor. In the absence of a&#xD;
      compatible donor, gene therapy with model autograft could be a valid alternative. However,&#xD;
      gene therapy for the curative treatment of sickle cell disease requires an optimal number of&#xD;
      genetically modified HSC to reinject the patient. In contrast to beta-thalassemia patients,&#xD;
      the mobilization of HSC in peripheral blood by growth factors such as G-CSF in patients with&#xD;
      sickle cell can trigger a vaso-occlusive crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset of action of plerixafor is very fast. In pharmacodynamic studies in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, mobilization peak of CD34 + cells was observed between 6 and 9 hours after&#xD;
      administration of plerixafor. One injection per day for 1 to 2 days should be sufficient to&#xD;
      achieve an optimal collection (unlike the 5-6 days required for mobilization of HSC in G-CSF&#xD;
      used as the only growth factor). The duration of exposure to risk is thereby theoretically&#xD;
      reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose an drug test - Phase I/II trial - monocenter- non-comparative - not randomized -&#xD;
      uncontrolled - Open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, we propose to assess the safety and efficacy of peripheral HSC mobilization&#xD;
      in three major sickle cell patients (SS or Sbeta thalassemia) (or five, if results of the&#xD;
      first 3 patients are not reproducible) by a single injection of plerixafor after significant&#xD;
      decrease of HbS rate. Adequate number of CD34 + cells collected will be a key point in the&#xD;
      success of possible and subsequent autologous graft of genetically modified HSC; a dose&gt;&#xD;
      3.106 cells / kg CD34 + is necessary. Mobilized and collected cells will be stored for a&#xD;
      possible future gene therapy or as not handled backup graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These three patients will be included sequentially; new inclusion will take place only if no&#xD;
      serious adverse events have occurred in patients being participated in the trial. Recruitment&#xD;
      will take place during the consultation in Apheresis Therapeutic Unit / Department of&#xD;
      Biotherapy at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital. Patients being recruited from the cohort&#xD;
      of adults with sickle cell disease at the Hospital Necker-Enfants Malades, the principal&#xD;
      investigator will have seen the patient in consultation in the weeks preceding the decision&#xD;
      to propose him to take part in research. This consultation will constitute within the&#xD;
      framework of this protocol, prior medical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before plerixafor injection, the patient will be subjected to one or more red cell exchange&#xD;
      order to reduce the post-transfusion HbS rate to less than 30% and if possible around 15%. If&#xD;
      the patient is under treatment with hydroxyurea, it will be stopped 3 months before&#xD;
      collecting peripheral HSC and replaced by an exchange transfusion to the rhythm of once per&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is not under treatment with hydroxyurea, he will have only 2 or 3 exchange&#xD;
      transfusions during the month before collecting peripheral HSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with plerixafor will be administered in the Adult Intensive Care Unit of the Necker&#xD;
      - Enfants malades Hospital. He/She will be under scope, will receive oxygen therapy and&#xD;
      hyperhydration (physiological saline per day); his/her ionogram and phosphatemia will be&#xD;
      monitored. The procedures of mobilization and collection by apheresis peripheral HSC will be&#xD;
      performed by the haematologist doctor and a specialist nurse. The HSC's collection will be&#xD;
      made in Apheresis Therapeutic Unit. A member of the LTCG team will retrieve samples in&#xD;
      intensive care and will provide their transport to the laboratory for possible&#xD;
      transformation. The patient will remain hospitalized after collection of peripheral HSC under&#xD;
      the same conditions of treatment and monitoring (scope, oxygen, hyperhydration) until the&#xD;
      number of White Blood Cells remain lower than 10x10^9 / L or new income at their count base.&#xD;
      HSB's collection and related hospitalisation will be performed according to JACIE (Joint&#xD;
      Accreditation Committee of ISCT-EBMT) program and subsequent Standard Operating Procedures in&#xD;
      force both at Clinical Unit and Laboratory of Cell and Gene Therapy (LTCG) of the Department&#xD;
      of Biotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dispensation of treatment will be performed by the Internal Use Pharmacy (PUI) of the&#xD;
      Necker-Enfants malades Hospital. Specific prescriptions of plerixafor from the study will be&#xD;
      made available to the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 15 visits for patients with hydroxyurea at screening, and 12 visits for patients&#xD;
      without hydroxyurea (including final visit) are scheduled for this trial. The total study&#xD;
      duration is 24 months, the duration of inclusion is 14 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data required for the analysis of the study will be reported in a paper case report&#xD;
      forms.&#xD;
