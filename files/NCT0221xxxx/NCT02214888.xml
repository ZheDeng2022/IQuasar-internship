&#xD;
          -  Patient belonging to functional class I, II, or III&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure of at least one DMARD due to lack of efficacy or tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2 out of the 3 following RA activity criteria: If this criterion is not met at visit&#xD;
             1, the whole set of RA activity criteria can be repeated at visit 2 (Repeated&#xD;
             screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  documentation of ≥ 9 swollen joints in a 66 joint count&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  documentation of ≥ 9 tender joints in a 68 joint count&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 1.5 mg/dl or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ≥ 28&#xD;
                  mm/hr (or equivalent of ≥ 24mm/hr according to Panchenkov method)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local&#xD;
             legislation given prior to any study procedures, including washout of prohibited&#xD;
             medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only for centres participating in the pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy: Written informed&#xD;
             consent in accordance with GCP and local legislation for participation in the PK&#xD;
             substudy. Refusal to participate in the PK substudy is not an exclusion criterion for&#xD;
             participation in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inflammatory rheumatic disease other than RA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment failure to a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-blocking agent. Treatment failure&#xD;
             is defined as not achieving at least an ACR 20 response (e.g. in a clinical trial) or&#xD;
             - in clinical practice - having the TNF-blocking agent discontinued due to&#xD;
             ineffectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of vasculitis (characterised by e.g. nail bed hemorrhages or infarcts,&#xD;
             vasculitic purpura, ulcers or gangrene, multisensory neuropathy, vasculitic&#xD;
             retinopathy or scleritis of eyes). Isolated rheumatoid nodules of the skin are not a&#xD;
             criterion for exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serologic evidence of active hepatitis B and/or C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-infection&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of cardiovascular, renal, neurologic, psychiatric, liver, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             immunologic or endocrine dysfunction if they are clinically significant. A clinically&#xD;
             significant disease is defined as one which in the opinion of the investigator may&#xD;
             either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease&#xD;
             which may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate&#xD;
             in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent history of heart failure (i.e. three years or less) or myocardial infarction&#xD;
             (i.e. one year or less) or patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignant disease in the last 5 years or suspicion of active malignant&#xD;
             disease except successfully treated squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening ECG results outside of the reference range of clinical relevance including,&#xD;
             but not limited to QTcB &gt; 480 msec, PR interval &gt; 240 msec, QRS interval &gt; 110 msec&#xD;
             according to central ECG evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis if&#xD;
             the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion or any of the&#xD;
             following specific laboratory abnormalities: If this criterion is not met at visit 1,&#xD;
             the laboratory assessments can be selectively repeated at visit 2 (Repeated screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or total&#xD;
                  bilirubin greater than upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  alkaline phosphatase, creatinine or white blood cell count greater than 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the past two years or active drug or alcohol&#xD;

&#xD;
        To be assessed at visit 3 (Baseline):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (to be excluded by serum and urine beta human chorion-gonadotropin&#xD;
             (βHCG)-test in women of childbearing potential) or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active vasculitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection or serious infectious diseases resulting in hospitalisation or&#xD;
