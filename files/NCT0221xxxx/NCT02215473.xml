  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacteremia represents the presence of live germs in the blood stream. Patients with gum&#xD;
      disease show damaged tissues and seem to be more susceptible to bacteremia. In fact, daily&#xD;
      activities such as mastication can induce bacteremia in these patients. Dental procedures&#xD;
      related to bleeding also induce bacteremia. However, there are many questions that should be&#xD;
      clarified. Among them, clinical strategies that are able to reduce the levels of germs in&#xD;
      blood should be determined. This desirable effect could be particularly important for some&#xD;
      patients, for example, for those at higher risk for endocarditis. Therefore, this study&#xD;
      tested if 0.12% chlorhexidine solution used as a single mouth rinse before dental&#xD;
      instrumentation could reduce the levels of bacteria in the blood. In addition, the occurrence&#xD;
      and magnitude of bacteremia in patients with gum disease were investigated by two different&#xD;
      laboratorial techniques. After receiving verbal and written explanations and after signed the&#xD;
      informed consent form, 80 systemically healthy volunteers diagnosed with gum disease having&#xD;
      dental plaque and tartar were randomly allocated in one the following groups: a) mouth-rinse&#xD;
      use and dental instrumentation and b) dental instrumentation with no mouth rinse. In a&#xD;
      preliminary visit volunteers underwent a complete periodontal examination which included&#xD;
      clinical measurements (inflammatory and debris accumulation indicators), microbial (tongue&#xD;
      and dental plaque samples collected with paper points), saliva (to determine volume and&#xD;
      biological indicators) and gingival crevicular fluid sampling (to monitor gingival&#xD;
      inflammation profile). In the next visit, dental instrumentation was performed under local&#xD;
      anesthesia, after the mouth rinse single use in the most diseased periodontal teeth/quadrant.&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected before any dental procedure, 2 and 6 minutes after dental&#xD;
      instrumentation. Oral hygiene instructions and periodontal treatment were performed in&#xD;
      additional visits according to individual needs. Finally, the relation between bacteremia and&#xD;
      several indicators of periodontal status was investigated.&#xD;

    <description>To check a possible antimicrobial effect after a single mouth rinse use, the levels of viable anaerobic and aerobic bacterial cels were compared between 0 and 2 minutes, 0 and 6 minutes and between 2 and 6 minutes. Blood samples were collected and spread out onto agar plates to determine total levels of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial levels at 2 and 6 minutes were compared between volunteers who performed the pre-procedural rinse and who not.</description>

    <description>To check a possible antimicrobial effect after a single mouth rinse use, the levels of bacterial DNA in blood samples were compared between 0 and 2 minutes, 0 and 6 minutes and between 2 and 6 minutes. Blood samples were collected and analyzed by real time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to determine total bacterial load and levels of target periodontal pathogens. Bacterial levels at 2 and 6 minutes were compared between volunteers who performed the pre-procedural rinse and who not.</description>
