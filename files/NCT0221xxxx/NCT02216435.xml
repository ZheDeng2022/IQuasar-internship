  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a movement disorder causing either uncontrolled movement,&#xD;
      slowness of movement, slowness of initiation of movement or rigidity of muscles. Deep Brain&#xD;
      Stimulation (DBS) is the FDA-approved method for patients who no longer get effective&#xD;
      treatment from the best available medication. The location in the brain where the electrode&#xD;
      is placed during DBS surgery for PD is called the Subthalamic Nucleus or STN. This study aims&#xD;
      to investigate another location in the brain, the Substantia nigra pars reticulata or SNr.&#xD;
      The SNr is also known to be involved in motor control of muscles and may be involved in the&#xD;
      process by which the initiation of movement occurs.&#xD;

      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a movement disorder causing either uncontrolled movement,&#xD;
      slowness of movement, slowness of initiation of movement or rigidity of muscles. One method&#xD;
      of easing PD symptoms is the FDA-approved method of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for patients&#xD;
      who no longer get effective treatment from the best available medication. The location in the&#xD;
      brain where the electrode is placed during DBS surgery for PD is called the Subthalamic&#xD;
      Nucleus or STN. During placement of the DBS electrode, the patient is awake and is asked to&#xD;
      do motor tasks to determine the correct placement in the STN and proper functioning of the&#xD;
      DBS electrode. This study aims to investigate another location in the brain, the Substantia&#xD;
      nigra pars reticulata or SNr, during the normal placement of the DBS electrode. This location&#xD;
      is also known to be involved in motor control of muscles and may be involved in the process&#xD;
      by which the initiation of movement occurs. The path through the brain to the STN used for&#xD;
      DBS surgery goes into the SNr but currently, no testing of the SNr is performed. We will&#xD;
      conduct a simple and well documented visual motor test to document the patient's stimulus&#xD;
      perception and motor intention both at rest and during neural stimulation of the SNr.&#xD;
