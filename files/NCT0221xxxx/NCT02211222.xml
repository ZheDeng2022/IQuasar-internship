    <textblock>
      This Expanded Access Program (EAP) consists of a Prerandomization Phase and a Randomization&#xD;
      Phase. Only subjects with radioiodine-refractory DTC who fulfill the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be treated. These subjects will be treated until progression of disease or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>Lenvatinib at starting doses of 24-mg, 20-mg, or 14-mg will be administered as a combination of 10-mg capsules and 4-mg capsules to be taken once a day (QD) (recommended to be taken the same time each day). Subjects will receive one of three starting doses of lenvatinib, 24-mg/day, 20-mg/day, or 14-mg/day. Dose reductions occur in succession based on the previous dose level (24, 20, 14, and 10 mg/day). Any dose reduction below 10 mg/day must be discussed with the sponsor. Once the dose has been reduced, it cannot be increased at a later date.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnoses of one of the&#xD;
             following DTC subtypes: a. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) i. Follicular variant ii.&#xD;
             Variants (including but not limited to: tall cell, columnar cell, cribriform-morular,&#xD;
             solid, oxyphil, Warthin's-like, trabecular, tumor with nodular fasciitis-like stroma,&#xD;
             Hurthle cell variant of papillary carcinoma, poorly differentiated); b.Follicular&#xD;
             thyroid cancer (FTC) i. Hurthle cell ii. Clear cell iii.Insular&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be radioiodine-refractory or resistant within 12 months of radioiodine&#xD;
             therapy and have one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. One or more lesions that do not demonstrate iodine uptake on any radioiodine scan&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. One or more lesions that have substantially increased in size within 12 months of&#xD;
                  radioiodine therapy, despite demonstration of radioiodine activity at the time of&#xD;
                  that treatment by pre- or posttreatment scanning&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Cumulative activity of radioiodine of greater than 600 mCi or 22 gigabecquerels&#xD;
                  (GBq), with the last dose administered at least 6 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have received and failed treatment with sorafenib for RR-DTC. This&#xD;
             criterion will not apply outside the United States if sorafenib is not commercially&#xD;
             available in the country where the subject resides.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Blood pressure (BP) less than or equal to 150/90 mmHg at screening with or without&#xD;
             antihypertensive medications and no change in antihypertensive medications within 1&#xD;
             week prior to Cycle 1 Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL/min according to the Cockcroft and&#xD;
             Gault formula&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate bone marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL (can be corrected by growth factor&#xD;
                  or transfusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) except for&#xD;
                  unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia or Gilbert's syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate&#xD;
                  aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 3 x ULN (less than or equal to 5 x&#xD;
                  ULN if subject has liver metastases). If ALP is greater than 3 x ULN (in the&#xD;
                  absence of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in the presence of liver&#xD;
                  metastases) AND subjects are also known to have bone metastases, the&#xD;
                  liver-specific ALP must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver&#xD;
                  function instead of the total ALP&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Males and females age greater than or equal to 18 years at the time of informed&#xD;
             consent&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. All females must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test. Females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential and male subjects who are partners of women of childbearing&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects having greater than 1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick at screening testing&#xD;
             will undergo 24 h urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria.&#xD;
             Subjects with urine protein greater than or equal to 1 g/24 h will be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association (NYHA)&#xD;
             Classification greater than II, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, serious&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or stroke within the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT interval (QTc) interval greater than or equal to 480&#xD;
             msec&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Existing anti-cancer therapy-related toxicities of grade greater than or equal to 2,&#xD;
             except alopecia and infertility&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of intolerance to or progression on prior treatment with lenvatinib that led&#xD;
             to the discontinuation of lenvatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any history of or concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would compromise subject's ability to safely complete the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females who are pregnant (positive B-hCG test) or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Eligible for any other lenvatinib study that is open for recruitment.&#xD;
