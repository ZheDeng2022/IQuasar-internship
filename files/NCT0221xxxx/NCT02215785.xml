  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a symptom suffered by a large number of people, due to multifactorial causes.&#xD;
      Some studies have proven that modifying lifestyle reduces the risk of constipation, with&#xD;
      high-fibre diets being less prone to constipation. Kiwifruit consumption, improves functional&#xD;
      constipation and some studies consistently report an increase in the frequency and ease of&#xD;
      defecation, stool volume and softness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although literature suggests kiwifruit consumption improves constipation symptoms, no studies&#xD;
      have been carried out in adults and in Mediterranean patient populations, characteristic for&#xD;
      its differential nutritional habits. The aim of the present study was to test the effect of&#xD;
      kiwifruit consumption on functional constipation in a Spanish adult population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide general population prevalence of constipation ranges from 0.7% to 79% (median 16%).&#xD;
      Some factors associated with constipation are sex, with higher prevalence in females&#xD;
      (especially during pregnancy, and age; in general it becomes gradually more prevalent after&#xD;
      the 70 years of age, in women the increase is considerable from a young age (18-23 years old)&#xD;
      to middle age (45-50 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constipation is characterized by difficult or infrequent deposition, often accompanied by&#xD;
      excessive straining during bowel movement or sensation of incomplete evacuation. In most&#xD;
      cases, there is no underlying organic cause, and constipation is labelled as chronic&#xD;
      idiopathic constipation and as a functional digestive disorder. The Rome III criteria is a&#xD;
      useful tool for the diagnosis of constipation that highlights the chronic nature of the&#xD;
      disorder and the importance of symptoms beyond the infrequency of bowel movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding its causes, prevention, and treatment will help most people find constipation&#xD;
      relief. An individual's medical history is very important in determining a constipation&#xD;
      diagnosis. Primary healthcare professionals should enquire about dietary habits and&#xD;
      lifestyle, pharmacological and toxic habits, complementary and alternative medicine,&#xD;
      physiological bowel habits, use of laxatives and past disease history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the effect of kiwifruit consumption on functional constipation in a Spanish adult&#xD;
      population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design :Open non-controlled and non-randomized longitudinal study, of the effect of kiwifruit&#xD;
      consumption in adult patients with diagnosed constipation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The study was conducted in five primary healthcare centres in Barcelona, Catalonia,&#xD;
      Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period Study: Between April and August 2013&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Fifteen participating Primary Care Professionals selected patients from the&#xD;
      electronic medical records (e-HCAP) following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each&#xD;
      professional could include a maximum of 4 patients. Forty-six subjects were selected for the&#xD;
      study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: It was calculated to detect a change in the proportion of individuals with 3 or&#xD;
      more defecations per week from 56% to 86% (evolution from an average of 3.2 to 4.4 -stable&#xD;
      Standard Deviation (SD) of 1.3- in a normal distribution). Assuming a bilateral contrast for&#xD;
      paired data, with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 0.8, a sample of 44 individuals&#xD;
      was required (covering a 10% of dropout rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The duration of the study was five weeks. During the first two weeks no&#xD;
      kiwifruit patients were asked to follow their normal diet. The next three weeks they were&#xD;
      asked to consume three Zespri green kiwifruits (Actinidia deliciosa var Hayward) per day, one&#xD;
      at each main meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner). Throughout the five-week study period the&#xD;
      patient had to continue their normal eating habits and exercise regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tools and instructions: Primary Care Professionals asked patients to participate in the study&#xD;
      and explained it to them. Patients who voluntarily agreed to participate signed the informed&#xD;
      consent, accepting all study procedures. Each participant in the study attended three&#xD;
      consultations: the first one before starting the study, the second one after two weeks and&#xD;
      the third one after five weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect the information patients used a questionnaire designed for this purpose. His/her&#xD;
      Primary Care Professional provided instructions on the recording of faecal characteristics.&#xD;
      The French original version of the diary was translated into Spanish and Catalan. Patients&#xD;
      chose their own language to respond. Professionals collected data from diaries in a Google&#xD;
      Docs form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were supplied kiwifruits in a heterogeneous manner. Some patients in the study&#xD;
      bought the prescribed product. In other cases it was the professional who provided the&#xD;
      kiwifruits. In one of the Primary Care Centres, the neighbourhood shopkeeper was the&#xD;
      responsible for delivering the kiwifruits to the patients. Patients who bought their own&#xD;
      Zespri kiwifruit were refunded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Demographics for patients were summarized calculating medians&#xD;
      [InterQuartile Range (IQR)] for continuous variables and proportions for categorical&#xD;
      variables. Categorical variables were compared from baseline (second week) to last week using&#xD;
      the Bhapkar test. For some analyses, Facility and Volume categorical variables were treated&#xD;
      as continuous in order to provide results easy to interpret and taking into account&#xD;
      individuals' correlations; in these cases, one unit of gain should be interpreted as an&#xD;
      improvement in one response category. Functional data methodology was used for some graphical&#xD;
      representations. Stacked barplots over time will be presented for categorical variables. To&#xD;
      analyse week changes in daily variables Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models were&#xD;
      adjusted (treating variables as continuous).&#xD;
