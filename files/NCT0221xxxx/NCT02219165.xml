  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes produce many virulence factors. Some of them&#xD;
      are responsible for severe infections in humans. Superantigen toxins synthesized by S. aureus&#xD;
      or by S. pyogenes, are responsible for toxic shock syndromes (TSS) which lethality can attain&#xD;
      25% in children with validated criteria of septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies, performed in vitro and in vivo in animals, have shown that Intravenous&#xD;
      immunoglobulins [IVIG] contain antibodies [Ab] against these toxins and, when used at high&#xD;
      concentration, IVIG are able to neutralize their toxicity. However, in all these studies,&#xD;
      IVIG administration has been preventive and there is no reliable data demonstrating their&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy in vitro or in vivo in humans or in animals, once the disease is&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of IVIG is established in other pathologies for which the role of the&#xD;
      superantigens [superAg] is suspected, like Kawasaki disease in children. The mechanism of&#xD;
      action, although not perfectly known, involves at the same time a direct effect on superAg&#xD;
      (Ag-Ab complex) and indirect effects like the neutralisation of superAg within the network of&#xD;
      anti-idiotype Ab or the neutralisation of the T-cells receptors. Staphylococcal and&#xD;
      streptococcal toxic shocks imply bacterial exotoxins that are superAg. It seems thus&#xD;
      consistent to imagine a same type of treatment with IVIG. However, there is currently no&#xD;
      evidence of the efficacy of IVIG in this indication. One of the explanations relies on the&#xD;
      lack of statistical power of previous adult studies, which principal objective was to show a&#xD;
      reduction of the mortality. Taking into account the low prevalence of TSS, it has been hard&#xD;
      to recruit enough patients to have the required statistical power. Moreover, some works have&#xD;
      been extracted from larger studies on septic shock and the definitions of the TSS were nor&#xD;
      always very reliable. Lastly, if the investigators consider the definition of the TSS as&#xD;
      mentioned by the &quot; Centre for Disease Control &quot; [CDC], for which any hypotension, even a&#xD;
      simple orthostatic hypotension, serves the diagnosis of TSS as long as the other symptoms are&#xD;
      present, it is obvious that many patients are likely to be recruited in a study although it&#xD;
      is highly probable that their health will get better with a &quot; standard &quot; treatment. The&#xD;
      definition of a &quot; real &quot; TSS can be refined, keeping the CDC criteria, but changing the&#xD;
      hypotension criterion in a more accurate criterion as described in the &quot; surviving sepsis&#xD;
      campaign &quot;, internationally accepted and based on norms adapted to the age for paediatric&#xD;
      forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVIG therapy is very expensive and TSS is not recognized as indication of IVIG according to&#xD;
      their marketing authorization. The feasibility of a randomized controlled study with this&#xD;
      treatment needs to be assessed as it would be hazardous to conduct a large prospective RCT&#xD;
      without having first assessed this feasibility in terms of recruitment rates, consent rates&#xD;
      or compliance rates. Inclusion, randomisation and collect of inform consent in the context of&#xD;
      severe shock are challenging and require evaluation of feasibility. The sample size&#xD;
      calculation of the large study on mortality required estimations of the event in the specific&#xD;
      population of children with criteria of septic shock. Surrogates markers of outcome need to&#xD;
      be better defined. For example it would be useful to determine the evolution of organ&#xD;
      dysfunctions with and without IVIG treatment in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various organ failure scores, used upon admission and later on, have been validated in adults&#xD;
      and in children. The absence of improvement of the Paediatric logistic organ dysfunction&#xD;
      (Pelod) score over time is a good indicator of mortality in Paediatric intensive care unit&#xD;
      (PICU). It could be used as surrogate marker to evaluate the efficacy of IVIG.&#xD;
