  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of DTP348. DTP 348 is an&#xD;
      oral dual drug with two mechanisms of action:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. carbonic anhydrase IX inhibitor which acidifies the intracellular pH through the&#xD;
           sulfamide components&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. radio sensitizer of hypoxic cells through its 5-nitroimidazole moiety&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts. The phase I trials will be on the standard 3+3 design&#xD;
      first as single agent then combined with radiotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A single agent dose-escalation phase in patients with solid tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A dose-escalation phase in patients with HNSCC in combination with radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to determine the recommended phase II dose of DTP348 in combination&#xD;
      with radiotherapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the single agent Phase I dose-escalation phase patients will be enrolled and assigned to a&#xD;
      dose level cohort. The starting dose will be 750 mg/m2, which equals to 1/10 of the human&#xD;
      equivalent dose of the LD10 of DTP348 in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A &quot;3+3&quot; dose-escalation design will be used. The study will investigate sequential cohorts&#xD;
      consisting of 3-6 patients to be enrolled and treated at the applicable dose level. Planned&#xD;
      dose levels for subsequent cohorts are 1000, 1250 mg/m2 and steps of 250 mg/m2 thereafter.&#xD;
      There will be no intra-patient dose escalation. The treatment cycle in the dose-escalation&#xD;
      part of the study will consist of 7 weeks (reflecting the typical duration of the course of&#xD;
      radiotherapy). Patients will receive a continuous oral dose of DTP348 for 7 days per week.&#xD;
      Food intake is not allowed one hour before and after the intake of the study drug. After the&#xD;
      cycle of treatment, the patient will be followed until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic properties (PK) will be obtained on day 1 during the first&#xD;
      8 hours after oral administration and then daily on day 2, 3, 4 and 5, before the&#xD;
      administration of the daily dosage. A patient will stay on treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason. The dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period for each dose level will be day 1 until the end of&#xD;
      week 7. Patients who do not complete the DLT observation period for other reasons than a DLT&#xD;
      will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity that can be expected from DTP348 is related to the nitro-imidazole compound and&#xD;
      includes nausea, vomiting flushing, dizziness, skin rash, and neurotoxicity. Related to the&#xD;
      sulfamide component in the study drug, the side-effects may include nausea and vomiting. In&#xD;
      the experimental mice study, no toxicity was observed using a dose of 10 mg/kg i.v. 3 and up&#xD;
      to 400 mg/kg per os, which corresponds to the Human Equivalent Dose (HED) of 1.2 g/m2 of&#xD;
      nimorazole. Once the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of DTP348 has been established, 3&#xD;
      additional patients will be included in that dose-level. These patients will receive crushed&#xD;
      tablets and undergo blood sampling for PK to investigate whether the administration of&#xD;
      crushed tablets affects uptake and plasma levels of the study drug. This group of patients is&#xD;
      added because of the frequent occurrence of swallowing problems in the HNSCC patient&#xD;
      population and the use of tube feeding with the need of crushing tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD of DTP348 as single agent has been determined, the study will continue to the&#xD;
      combination phase: In the DTP348 in combination with radiotherapy dose-escalation phase,&#xD;
      again a 3+3 dose-escalation design will be used. The starting dose of DT348 will be the MTD&#xD;
      minus two dose levels. DTP348 will be given continuously 7 days a week, starting 2 weeks&#xD;
      before and during the whole course of radiation until and including the last day. The&#xD;
      rationale to start the study drug 2 weeks before the start of radiotherapy is to have a&#xD;
      similar design as in the phase II trial which will be performed following this study. The&#xD;
      drug will be given orally 1-2 hours before the daily delivery of radiotherapy. Food intake is&#xD;
      not allowed one hour before and after the intake of the study drug. The dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) observation period for each dose level will be from day 1 of combined therapy&#xD;
      until 4 weeks after the end of therapy. Patients who do not complete the DLT observation&#xD;
      period for other reasons than a DLT will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiation treatment in the DTP348 in combination with radiotherapy dose-escalation phase&#xD;
      will be either conventional standard fractionated radiotherapy to a total dose of 70 Gy in 35&#xD;
      fractions over 7 weeks with a concomitant boost technique, 5 fractions a week or accelerated&#xD;
      radiotherapy delivering a total dose to 68-70 Gy in a shortened overall treatment time (5.5 -&#xD;
      6 weeks). The 95% isodose of the prescribed dose should encompass at least 99% of the&#xD;
      planning target and homogeneity will be according to ICRU guidelines. There is no restriction&#xD;
      of the treatment techniques that may be used: multiple static conformal or intensity&#xD;
      modulated beams, intensity modulated arc treatments, or robotic, non-isocentric treatments.&#xD;
      Dummy run on virtual patients will need to be performed before inclusion. Subsequently,&#xD;
      patients are allowed to be included in the trial.&#xD;
