  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to investigate how well Bright White Light Therapy will work in the acute&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation units for people whom have experienced a traumatic brain injury for&#xD;
      the purpose of treating sleep disruption. Participants will be assessed based on sleep&#xD;
      efficiency, thinking abilities, therapy participation, and perception of fatigue/sleepiness.&#xD;
      In previous studies dim red light has not had the same effects on function as bright white&#xD;
      light, and will be chosen for use as a placebo. Each subject will be randomized to receive 30&#xD;
      minutes of either Bright White Light Therapy or Red Light Treatment each morning for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the effect of this treatment, the investigators will measure the each participants&#xD;
      sleep daily by using an actigraph watch. This watch will record movement continuously. The&#xD;
      investigators will also measure the subjects' report of how well they slept, whether fatigue&#xD;
      is present, and how attentive they are before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In persons with TBI, prospectively compare overnight sleep in a cohort exposed to morning&#xD;
      Bright White Light with a comparison group exposed to Red Light in an acute inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)&#xD;
      on admission to intensive rehabilitation units. Consented participants (who meet all&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria) will wear an actigraphy watch for 2 nights to obtain a&#xD;
      baseline for sleep pattern identification. Prior to treatment, baseline measures (detailed&#xD;
      below) will be obtained. Participants will be randomized to receive either Bright White Light&#xD;
      (BWL) or Red Light (RL) treatment. Light therapy treatments will be given for 30 minutes&#xD;
      daily in the morning for 10 days, and an Actiwatch will be worn continuously during that&#xD;
      period. At the end of 10 days, outcome measures will be obtained (as below). The specific&#xD;
      period of treatment may be affected by the length of stay on the rehabilitation unit. For&#xD;
      lengths of stay less than the 10 days, subjects will receive the intervention until the day&#xD;
      of discharge at which time the outcome measures will be administered. The investigators&#xD;
      primary outcome measure with be the actigraphic measurement of sleep efficiency. Other&#xD;
      secondary measures will be participation in therapy, sleepiness, and attention. The&#xD;
      investigators will also evaluate the anticipated device costs and clinical staff burden&#xD;
      involved in utilizing light therapy exposure in an inpatient rehabilitation clinical setting.&#xD;

    <description>Sleep efficiency scores derived from actigraphy data will be the primary outcome. We will set the Actiwatch to record activity data in 60-second intervals. Actigraphy data will be automatically scored with Actiware software (Respironics, Philips Healthcare), which uses validated algorithms to determine whether an epoch of activity is &quot;sleep&quot; or &quot;wake&quot; (Cole RJ, 1992). Typically there is a lack of a consistent sleep/wake cycle in the study population, therefore we will be using sleep efficiency and total sleep time scores obtained during a set night-time interval (2200 to 0600) as the primary index of sleep function, as has been used in previous publications[39, 40]. We will be comparing average between group differences between the BWL and RL groups at baseline and after 10 days of light therapy.</description>

    <measure>Barrow Neurological Institute Fatigue Scale (BNI-FS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and After 10 Days of Light Exposure</time_frame>
    <description>The Barrow Neurological Institute Fatigue Scale (BNI-FS; Fatigue Outcome) is an 11-point scale that examines fatigue during acute recovery from TBI. Scores on items 1-10 may range from 1 (rarely a problem), 2-3 (occasional problem but not frequent), 4-5 (a frequent problem), 6-7 (a problem most of the time). The last item is a general rating of fatigue from 0 (not a problem) to 10 (a severe problem). The total BNI-FS is a sum of the first 10 items (0-70), where higher scores indicate worse outcome.&#xD;
The BNI-FS is a scale that was designed to examine fatigue during acute recovery from TBI. The clinical staff involved in the care of these subjects were asked to rate the phototherapy intervention for ease of use, perceived relevance to rehabilitation care, and impression of effectiveness.</description>

    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM) - Motor</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at baseline (admission to unit) and after Day 10 of intervention (or at the day of discharge from the rehabilitation unit)</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community. The FIM is an 18-item ordinal scale, used with all diagnoses within a rehabilitation population. Each item is scored on a 7 point ordinal scale, ranging from a score of 1 to a score of 7. The higher the score, the more independent the patient is in performing the task associated with that item. Motor subscale (the sum of the individual motor subscale items) will be a value between 13 and 91.</description>

    <measure>Symbol Digit Modalities Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at Baseline and After 10 Days of Light Exposure</time_frame>
    <description>The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a pencil and paper test for attention that takes approximately five minutes to administer and is frequently used in evaluations after TBI. The SDMT was administered at enrollment and after intervention. The Interagency Workgroup on TBI Outcomes selected the SDMT as CORE common data elements in TBI outcomes research. The SDMT measures attention and speed of processing (the test-taker substitutes a number for random presentations of geometric figures). Scoring involves summing the number of correct substitutions within the 90 second interval (min=0, max = 110), with higher scores representing better attention/speed of processing.</description>

        <description>Sleep efficiency scores derived from actigraphy data will be the primary outcome. We will set the Actiwatch to record activity data in 60-second intervals. Actigraphy data will be automatically scored with Actiware software (Respironics, Philips Healthcare), which uses validated algorithms to determine whether an epoch of activity is &quot;sleep&quot; or &quot;wake&quot; (Cole RJ, 1992). Typically there is a lack of a consistent sleep/wake cycle in the study population, therefore we will be using sleep efficiency and total sleep time scores obtained during a set night-time interval (2200 to 0600) as the primary index of sleep function, as has been used in previous publications[39, 40]. We will be comparing average between group differences between the BWL and RL groups at baseline and after 10 days of light therapy.</description>
        <time_frame>Average percent sleep efficiency (0-100) at baseline and after 10 days of light exposure</time_frame>

          <title>Actigraphy Data</title>
          <description>Sleep efficiency scores derived from actigraphy data will be the primary outcome. We will set the Actiwatch to record activity data in 60-second intervals. Actigraphy data will be automatically scored with Actiware software (Respironics, Philips Healthcare), which uses validated algorithms to determine whether an epoch of activity is &quot;sleep&quot; or &quot;wake&quot; (Cole RJ, 1992). Typically there is a lack of a consistent sleep/wake cycle in the study population, therefore we will be using sleep efficiency and total sleep time scores obtained during a set night-time interval (2200 to 0600) as the primary index of sleep function, as has been used in previous publications[39, 40]. We will be comparing average between group differences between the BWL and RL groups at baseline and after 10 days of light therapy.</description>

        <title>Barrow Neurological Institute Fatigue Scale (BNI-FS)</title>
        <description>The Barrow Neurological Institute Fatigue Scale (BNI-FS; Fatigue Outcome) is an 11-point scale that examines fatigue during acute recovery from TBI. Scores on items 1-10 may range from 1 (rarely a problem), 2-3 (occasional problem but not frequent), 4-5 (a frequent problem), 6-7 (a problem most of the time). The last item is a general rating of fatigue from 0 (not a problem) to 10 (a severe problem). The total BNI-FS is a sum of the first 10 items (0-70), where higher scores indicate worse outcome.&#xD;
The BNI-FS is a scale that was designed to examine fatigue during acute recovery from TBI. The clinical staff involved in the care of these subjects were asked to rate the phototherapy intervention for ease of use, perceived relevance to rehabilitation care, and impression of effectiveness.</description>

        <title>Functional Independence Measure (FIM) - Motor</title>
        <description>Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community. The FIM is an 18-item ordinal scale, used with all diagnoses within a rehabilitation population. Each item is scored on a 7 point ordinal scale, ranging from a score of 1 to a score of 7. The higher the score, the more independent the patient is in performing the task associated with that item. Motor subscale (the sum of the individual motor subscale items) will be a value between 13 and 91.</description>

        <title>Symbol Digit Modalities Test</title>
        <description>The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a pencil and paper test for attention that takes approximately five minutes to administer and is frequently used in evaluations after TBI. The SDMT was administered at enrollment and after intervention. The Interagency Workgroup on TBI Outcomes selected the SDMT as CORE common data elements in TBI outcomes research. The SDMT measures attention and speed of processing (the test-taker substitutes a number for random presentations of geometric figures). Scoring involves summing the number of correct substitutions within the 90 second interval (min=0, max = 110), with higher scores representing better attention/speed of processing.</description>

        <title>Functional Independence Measure (FIM) - Cognitive</title>
        <description>Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community. The FIM is an 18-item ordinal scale, used with all diagnoses within a rehabilitation population. Each item is scored on a 7 point ordinal scale, ranging from a score of 1 to a score of 7. The higher the score, the more independent the patient is in performing the task associated with that item. Cognition subscale (the sum of the individual cognition subscale items) will be a value between 5 and 35.</description>
