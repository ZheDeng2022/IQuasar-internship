      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, there is sometimes a discrepancy between&#xD;
           actual clinical outcome and TNM stages because it is an anatomy-based system in which&#xD;
           functional factors are not concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hemoglobin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and platelet count were proved to improve&#xD;
           prognosis prediction of TNM staging system in our previous retrospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE To validate that the prognostic index based on complete blood count and TNM system&#xD;
      had higher prediction efficiency on survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma than TNM system&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Totally 720 patients with non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be include and will be&#xD;
      divided into 3 groups (Low Risk, Intermediate Risk and High Risk Groups) according to their&#xD;
      prognostic index, which is on basis of blood cell count indexes and TNM stage. The 3 groups&#xD;
      of patients will undergo a radical radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy and be followed until&#xD;
      death or the end of the study. Comparison on survivals of the 3 groups will be made to&#xD;
      validate the accuracy of the prognostic index. And comparison on prediction efficacy between&#xD;
      prognostic index and TNM staging system will be made.&#xD;
