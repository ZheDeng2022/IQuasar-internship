  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that increase a patient's likelihood for heart&#xD;
      attack, stroke and diabetes. Our research is aimed at understanding whether a drug,&#xD;
      resveratrol, commonly found in grapes and red wine, would have any benefit in reducing risk&#xD;
      factors in patients that have metabolic syndrome. Despite the use of aspirin and cholesterol&#xD;
      reducing medications, patients with metabolic syndrome still often have sticky platelets and&#xD;
      dysfunctional lipid profile. This is likely due to inflammation and high oxidative state. In&#xD;
      animal studies, this drug has reduced platelet stickiness and reduced oxidative stress.&#xD;
      However, the effects of this drug have not been researched in patients with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are interested in studying whether the benefits of resveratrol described in animal models&#xD;
      can be translated to patients with metabolic syndrome who display high markers of oxidative&#xD;
      stress. We plan to give a short intervention of drug to patients and then determine if the&#xD;
      drug successfully:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Decreases the stickiness of platelets. This is important because sticky platelets are&#xD;
           more likely to form clot and contribute to plaque formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduce the circulating dysfunctional HDL. HDL and its protein and lipid constituents&#xD;
           help to inhibit oxidation, inflammation, activation of the blood vessel wall,&#xD;
           coagulation, and platelet aggregation. Dysfunctional HDL, as occurs in metabolic&#xD;
           syndrome patients, cannot properly protect against atherosclerosis.&#xD;

      Patients with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk of thrombotic complications, including&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. A meta-analysis of the studies assessing&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk in metabolic syndrome found a pooled relative risk for incident&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and death of 1.78. This propensity for thrombotic vascular events is in&#xD;
      the context of an increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome, which in the 2003-2006 NHANES&#xD;
      Survey was found in 34% of the US population over the age of 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two important contributors to the development of myocardial infarction and stroke are lipid&#xD;
      rich atheromatous plaques and concomitant platelet aggregation in response to the fissuring&#xD;
      of these plaques. A growing body of evidence implicates oxidative modification of lipoprotein&#xD;
      lipids and apolipoproteins in the genesis of plaques. Platelet hyperactivity and the variable&#xD;
      response to antiplatelet therapy are features of the metabolic syndrome. Oxidative&#xD;
      modifications of LDL enhance activation of platelets, which themselves are oxidatively&#xD;
      stressed. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) initiates lipid peroxidation leading to dysfunctional HDL&#xD;
      production. Therefore, the hypotheses for the proposed investigations will address the&#xD;
      effects of resveratrol on platelet hyperactivity and HDL protein modifications in patients&#xD;
      with metabolic syndrome. Resveratrol, as predicted from its structure, is an electron rich&#xD;
      molecule that can reduce free radicals. It has distinctive actions, however, that differ from&#xD;
      compounds that are conventionally referred to as &quot;anti-oxidants&quot;. It has particular potency&#xD;
      as an inhibitor of radical formation by a number of peroxidases that likely participate in&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome. These include MPO, the peroxidase site of&#xD;
      prostaglandin H synthase-1 (PGHS-1; cyclooxygenase-1(COX-1)) and cytochrome c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the hypothesis that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. resveratrol reduces platelet activation in patients with metabolic syndrome. and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. that resveratrol reduces the oxidative modification of HDL proteins in patients with&#xD;
           metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
