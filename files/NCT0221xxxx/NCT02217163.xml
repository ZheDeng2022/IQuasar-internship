    <textblock>
      Patients with high risk multiple myeloma have shorter remission periods and reduced overall&#xD;
      survival. Prognostic significance of minimal residual disease negative remission is being&#xD;
      highlighted in many of the newer studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current phase 2 study investigates the combination of carfilzomib together with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in patients with high risk multiple myeloma in younger&#xD;
      transplant-eligible patients.&#xD;

      Carfilzomib is administered over 30 minutes as an infusion. For cycle 1 only, Carfilzomib is&#xD;
      administered at 20mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 2, followed by escalation to 36 mg/m2 on days 8,9,15&#xD;
      and 16 on a 28 day cycle. Patients who tolerate 36 mg/m2 dose are kept at this dose for the&#xD;
      subsequent cycles on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16 on a 28 day cycle. Dose and schedule&#xD;
      modifications for intolerable side effects are detailed in the protocol. Additionally&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide is given a fixed dose of 500mg once per week orally, along with&#xD;
      dexamethasone, given on the days of Carfilzomib administration, 30 minutes to 4 hours prior&#xD;
      to Carfilzomib. Patients will undergo blood tests weekly and serum protein electrophoresis&#xD;
      every 4 weeks during treatment. Within completion of 5 cycles of treatment, patients would&#xD;
      undergo stem cell collection using chemotherapy and GCSF mobilization. After completion of 6&#xD;
      cycles of treatment, autologous bone marrow transplantation will be performed. Three months&#xD;
      following bone marrow transplantation, subjects will undergo further 2 consolidation cycles.&#xD;
      After consolidation, subjects will undergo disease assessment by blood and subjects who are&#xD;
      in CR will undergo bone marrow investigations and MRD analysis MPFC. Patients who achieve MRD&#xD;
      negativity by MPFC will be managed expectantly by watch and wait. Patients who are MRD&#xD;
      positive at this stage will receive maintenance for 2 years or till disease progression.&#xD;
      Follow up would extend till a minimum of 2 years from completion of the study. At the end of&#xD;
      2 years post maintenance or expectant monitoring, subjects who are in CR will undergo disease&#xD;
      assessment by blood and bone marrow investigations and MRD analysis MPFC.&#xD;
