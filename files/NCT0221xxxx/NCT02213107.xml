      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of enzalutamide and&#xD;
      dutasteride on the time to prostatic-specific antigen progression in patients aged 65 or&#xD;
      older receiving this combination as first line treatment for systemic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and toxicities of the study drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the time to prostatic-specific antigen nadir from the start of study treatment&#xD;
      and to evaluate the absolute prostatic-specific antigen nadir as a result of the study drug&#xD;
      combination&#xD;

        Patients with systemic prostate cancer as defined by either a) hormonal naïve metastatic&#xD;
        prostate cancer with radiographic evidence of visceral or osseous metastasis or b)&#xD;
        biochemical recurrence prostate cancer that fulfills all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A minimum of three rising prostatic-specific antigen levels with an interval of =/&gt; 1 week&#xD;
        between each test, The prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) value at the screening visit should&#xD;
        be =/&gt; 2 ng/ml prostatic-specific antigen doubling time ≤ 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should be 65 years or older. Patients who are deemed &quot;not fit&quot; by comprehensive&#xD;
        geriatric assessment or at high risk for side effects as determined by the treating&#xD;
        physician. A case report form will be used to document the specifics of why each eligible&#xD;
        patient is not considered an ideal candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serum testosterone level &gt; 1.7 nmol/L (50 ng/dL) at the screening visit (non- castrate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients could have received hormonal therapy as part of definitive treatment for previous&#xD;
        localized prostate cancer. However, they should be off any hormonal therapy for greater&#xD;
        than six months prior to entry to clinical trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Severe concurrent disease or infection that, in the judgment of the investigator, would&#xD;
        make the patient inappropriate for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known brain metastases. Brain imaging studies are not required for eligibility if the&#xD;
        patient has no neurologic signs or symptoms suggestive of brain metastasis. However, if&#xD;
        brain imaging studies are performed, they must be negative for disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is receiving treatment for another active malignancy excluding localized cutaneous&#xD;
        squamous or basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
