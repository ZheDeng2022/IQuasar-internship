    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test the value of immediate post-operative intravesical&#xD;
      instillation of epirubicin in patients with intermediate and high risk non muscle invasive&#xD;
      bladder cancer (NMIBC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative evaluation will be carried out in the form of routine laboratory investigations,&#xD;
      abdominal and pelvic US and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      abdomen and pelvis if necessary. Then, the patients will be subjected to complete TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be transferred to the recovery room, careful monitoring of the patients&#xD;
      will be carried out for the 1st 30 min, and then after confirming the patient eligibility for&#xD;
      enrollment in the study by exclusion of cases with hematuria and suspicious bladder&#xD;
      perforation, patients will be enrolled randomly into one of the two groups. The randomization&#xD;
      process will be performed using computer-generated simple random tables in a 1:1 ratio or by&#xD;
      the method of closed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1st group will not receive intravesical instillation of epirubicin -Placebo-(control&#xD;
      group), and, the 2nd group will receive intravesical instillation of epirubicin 50 mg in 50&#xD;
      ml saline 0.9% (study group) with clamping of the urethral catheter for 1 hour after&#xD;
      instillation and during this period the patients are monitored for local or systemic adverse&#xD;
      events (acute abdomen, chills, fever, hot flushes, abdominal rigidity, hematuria after&#xD;
      de-clamping of the catheter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative and early postoperative parameters of interest will be recorded and compared&#xD;
      between the two groups like EUA findings, tumor characteristics during cystoscopy as the&#xD;
      tumor size, site, shape, number, suspicion of CIS, post instillation adverse events, cytology&#xD;
      and biopsy results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be discharged after removal of urethral catheter. They will be stratified&#xD;
      into either intermediate or high risk histopathologically confirmed NMIBC, followed up at the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic (OPC) and will receive adjuvant intravesical instillation of chemotherapy&#xD;
      or immunotherapy according to the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for each&#xD;
      risk group. The patients will be evaluated by office cystoscopy and urine cytology at the OPC&#xD;
      after 12 weeks, and thereafter every 3 months during the first 2 years and then every 3 to 6&#xD;
      months according to the risk category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up period, all histopathologically confirmed tumors will be classified as&#xD;
      recurrences. Time to first recurrence will be the primary end point of the study, and the&#xD;
      length of follow-up will be defined as the time from inclusion to the last cystoscopy&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of evaluation and follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be evaluated on entry and at follow-up intervals. On study entry&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated by urinalysis, urine culture, serum creatinine, fasting blood&#xD;
      sugar level, complete blood count, chest X-ray, excretory urography (IVU) and or CT urography&#xD;
      and bladder wash for cytology. CT with contrast will be performed annually in cases of high&#xD;
      risk tumor category and when otherwise indicated. Complete TURBT of all visible tumors will&#xD;
      be conducted in all patients and the stage and grade will be determined according to the 1987&#xD;
      staging classification and World Health Organization (WHO) grading system in 1973+ 2004 WHO&#xD;
      grading system.&#xD;
