  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Galactosaemia is an inherited condition caused by a lack of an enzyme (catalyst) which&#xD;
      normally breaks down galactose (the sugar found in milk products). This affects 1:19,000&#xD;
      births annually in Ireland (the highest incidence worldwide) and is screened for by the&#xD;
      National Newborn Screening Programme. When an affected infant is diagnosed, galactose is&#xD;
      immediately restricted from the diet. This prevents often fatal liver disease and other&#xD;
      immediate complications. However, despite early treatment the majority of affected patients&#xD;
      go on to develop long-term complications such as intellectual impairment, neurological&#xD;
      complications, speech difficulties and infertility in females. The underlying mechanisms for&#xD;
      these complications are unclear. The investigators have shown in detailed biochemical and&#xD;
      gene analysis studies that major abnormalities affecting the function of complex molecules in&#xD;
      the body, particularly glycoproteins, (consisting of sugar chains attached to proteins)&#xD;
      persist in treated individuals which may lead to disturbances of the body's intrinsic&#xD;
      cellular machinery and relate to the complications seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research the investigators expand on from their earlier studies to see if they can&#xD;
      identify biomarkers and parts of the galactose/glycosylation pathways which could be modified&#xD;
      or changed with new treatments to improve outcomes for this condition (i.e., IgG N glycans).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In more detail, the investigators test the use of the most abundant glycoprotein in human&#xD;
      plasma (IgG) as an improved clinical test for monitoring the galactose control needed in&#xD;
      patients and also to see if some patients (including children aged 5-12 yrs) might have a&#xD;
      better predicted outcome with moderate increases of galactose in the diet. The investigators&#xD;
      believe that these studies greatly improve the understanding of Galactosaemia with a view to&#xD;
      improving current treatment options and future outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Classical Galactosaemia is an inherited disorder of galactose metabolism caused by profound&#xD;
      deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT: EC 2.7.712). This results in a&#xD;
      systemic accumulation of toxic galactose intermediates and a decrease in the level of&#xD;
      UDP-galactose, a required sugar for glycosylation. Galactosaemia has a relatively high&#xD;
      incidence in Ireland, (1:19,000 births) presenting a particular public health problem. The&#xD;
      neonatal life-threatening phenotype (liver disease, coagulopathy and sepsis) is rescued by&#xD;
      restriction of dietary galactose. However, outcomes of treatment are disappointing beyond the&#xD;
      neonatal period (even after successful newborn screening, early treatment and long term&#xD;
      compliance). The majority of Irish patients harbour the severe Q188R Galt mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      56.5% of Irish patients ≥ 6yrs have IQs ≤ 79; and 91.2% of Irish female patients ≥ 13yrs have&#xD;
      Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI). Unfortunately, the basic pathophysiology of this&#xD;
      condition remains enigmatic with limited treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In their earlier work, the investigators reported very considerable variation in patient&#xD;
      outcomes, even among siblings. The investigators have proposed that these differences are&#xD;
      determined by variation in galactose accessory pathways (beyond the GALT deficiency). This&#xD;
      may result in variable galactose tolerance in patients with linked variation in glycosylation&#xD;
      pathways which could allow for enhanced UDP-galactose bioavailability essential for&#xD;
      glycosylation. In their previous and current work the investigators have identified ongoing&#xD;
      dysregulation of glycoprotein formation and expression of genes involved in glycan&#xD;
      biosynthesis and cell signalling pathways in treated Galactosaemia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present proposal, which builds on published previous work, enables the investigators to&#xD;
      establish that Galactosaemia is a modifiable, multi-systemic glycosylation defect. The&#xD;
      overall objectives of the work are to progress the development of biochemical markers (IgG&#xD;
      N-glycan analysis) as prognostic indices for potentially modifiable relevant pathways. The&#xD;
      investigators consider how the phenotype could be relaxed in some patients with Classical&#xD;
      Galactosaemia, initially by studies of modification of exogenous galactose requirements to&#xD;
      identify if the ongoing glycan processing defects identified may be improved reflecting&#xD;
      accessory pathways of galactose disposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim: Expand previous and published work using IgG N-glycan analysis to examine the&#xD;
      glycosylation status of treated adult Galactosaemia patients in a larger study and develop&#xD;
      this test as a reliable diagnostic tool. The investigators also carry out a pilot study to&#xD;
      examine the effects of diet relaxation in paediatric patients (5-12 yrs) aiming to determine&#xD;
      optimum galactose intake levels for this cohort with the hope of preventing long-term&#xD;
      complications later in life. The investigators propose that this research offers new insights&#xD;
      into the ongoing pathophysiology of this rare disorder with the possibility of developing new&#xD;
      treatment targets, which over time could be cost-effective by preventing major disability.&#xD;
