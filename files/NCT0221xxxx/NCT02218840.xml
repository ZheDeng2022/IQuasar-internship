  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lovelace Scientific Resources is conducting clinical research study for cigar smokers. This&#xD;
      study will be evaluating the behaviors of cigar smokers and the short term effects of cigar&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cigar is defined as a cylinder of tobacco wrapped in a tobacco leaf for smoking. There are&#xD;
      small cigars with filters that resemble cigarettes and large cigars that do not have filters.&#xD;
      Because cigars come in so many shapes and sizes, the nicotine content varies as well. The way&#xD;
      that a cigar smoker consumes the cigar can also have an effect on how much nicotine is&#xD;
      absorbed. This study seeks to understand nicotine consumption and addiction in cigar smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation will last 1 to 4 weeks and will include 2 study-related visits. Your&#xD;
      visits may include a physical exam, medical history review, questionnaires, blood&#xD;
      collections, providing a urine sample, an exhaled breath test, having your vital signs&#xD;
      collected and smoking a cigar. You will be videotaped while you smoke your cigar so that we&#xD;
      can review the technique you use while smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant reductions in craving and withdrawal will be reported after ad libitum&#xD;
           smoking of a cigar compared to self-report prior to cigar smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cigar smokers will show a range of nicotine dependence, with a subset of users exceeding&#xD;
           minimal criteria for nicotine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Levels of nicotine, cotinine, Carbon Monoxide (CO), and&#xD;
           4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) will increase significantly from&#xD;
           pre- to post-cigar smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small cigar/cigarillo users will demonstrate greater levels of dependence and greater&#xD;
           relief from craving and withdrawal compared to large cigar users.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to better understand dependence behaviors in small and large cigar smokers.&#xD;
      All recruited cigar smokers will be self-defined as users on ≥ 1 day(s) per week for the past&#xD;
      6 months. They will not be currently using any other type of tobacco product for the past 6&#xD;
      months. Study subjects will smoke their own type and brand of cigar upon at least 24 hours of&#xD;
      abstinence from all tobacco products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependence (both real and perceived), withdrawal relief, and craving will be measured with&#xD;
      existing and modified behavioral scales and assessments. In addition, smoking topography&#xD;
      (including latency to first puff, puff number, interpuff interval, and smoking duration),&#xD;
      self-reported inhalation behaviors, and exhaled CO will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, un-blinded study seeking to better understand dependence behaviors&#xD;
      in small and large cigar smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be videotaped while smoking their cigar using a digital camcorder, and the&#xD;
      video will immediately be burned to DVD for subsequent smoking topography scoring by two&#xD;
      separate raters. These raters will directly observe the subject during the cigar smoking&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples and serial blood samples will be collected to measure biomarkers of exposure&#xD;
      (including nicotine, cotinine, and total NNAL) before, during, and after subjects' smoking of&#xD;
      their usual type and brand of cigar. A urine creatinine lab test will be collected pre and&#xD;
      post exposure to correct for excreted cotinine levels. Subjects will be instructed to empty&#xD;
      their bladders pre cigar exposure. They will then be instructed to rehydrate based on their&#xD;
      BMI prior to the initiation of cigar smoke exposure and after 60 minutes post cigar&#xD;
      initiation. Hepatic and renal function will be assessed at screening to determine any&#xD;
      metabolism problems. Subjects will be asked to bring two (2) cigars of their usual type and&#xD;
      brand. One cigar will be used to smoke; the 2nd cigar will be used to measure total nicotine&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cigars will be stored at ambient temperature (59º - 86º F), away from light and moisture,&#xD;
      until analysis. Nicotine concentrations will be determined from the 2nd cigar using an&#xD;
      analytical approach developed by Lovelace Biomedical Environmental Research Institute&#xD;
      (LBERI). Briefly, the cigar weight will be recorded, cigar broken apart, and mixed using a&#xD;
      mortar and pestle to create a homogenous mixture of the entire cigar. 100 mg of the cigar&#xD;
      mixture will be weighted and nicotine extracted from the tobacco using 1mL of 50/50&#xD;
      dichloromethane:dichloroethane repeated twice. The extract will be evaporated and&#xD;
      re-dissolved in 1 mL of methanol for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry&#xD;
      (LC-MS/MS) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma concentrations for nicotine and cotinine will be determined using LC-MS/MS and values&#xD;
      exported to Phoenix WinNonlin for pharmacokinetic analysis. Plasma Tmax and Cmax will be&#xD;
      reported using a table in a word document and in figures generated using WinNonlin. The&#xD;
      amount of cotinine and total NNAL excreted will be reported by determining the urinary&#xD;
      concentration of each compound by LC-MS/MS analysis and multiplying the determined&#xD;
      concentration by the total volume of urine recovered. Individual data along with grouped&#xD;
      results will be reported. The pharmacokinetic data will be provided to the sponsor after&#xD;
      uploading to SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be cigar smokers who are not seeking treatment for smoking cessation and&#xD;
      who are not currently using any other type of tobacco, but may be former users. They must&#xD;
      agree to abstain from smoking for at least 24 hours prior to the exposure day and will be&#xD;
      informed that they must remain abstinent from all forms of tobacco including nicotine&#xD;
      patches, gum, etc. Abstinence will be verified at the beginning of the test day through&#xD;
      expired CO and self-report. While it could be desirable to use urinary cotinine levels as a&#xD;
      further marker of abstinence, urinary cotinine levels do not appear to reach undetectable&#xD;
      levels in smokers after 24 hours. Instead, in regular smokers, negligent levels are reached&#xD;
      only after abstinence of 7-8 days, which would place significant burden on subjects for this&#xD;
      study. All subjects should be healthy males and females, 18 years of age or older, with no&#xD;
      self-reported psychiatric illnesses that would interfere with the subjects ability to&#xD;
      complete the session (i.e. schizophrenia, severe depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are pregnant (as verified by a urine pregnancy test at Visit 1 and 2) or&#xD;
      breastfeeding will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked questions concerning the type and quantity of prescribed and&#xD;
      non-prescribed drugs that they are currently using. If, as a result of the screening, the&#xD;
      subject is determined to be ineligible to continue participation in the study, he/she will be&#xD;
      excused from further participation. A target of sixty four (64) completed subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited to ensure sufficient statistical power to test main effects across the following&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary vs. secondary cigar users&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-reported inhaling behavior vs. self-reported non-inhaling behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Small cigar (including cigarillos) vs. large cigar (including premium) users&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. White vs. non-white adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Male vs. Female adults A power analysis was conducted to determine the overall sample&#xD;
           size needed to test the main effects above. According to this power analysis (see&#xD;
           below), the study will require 64 subjects assuming a balanced design across each of the&#xD;
           above factors (i.e. subjects are stratified across the 5 factors for a total of 32&#xD;
           groups). However, given the potential difficulty in filling each group of the above&#xD;
           design, we may recruit up to 50% more subjects (i.e. 96), which will ensure that each of&#xD;
           the above groups are sufficiently represented in the final sample. Finally, assuming a&#xD;
           10% dropout rate, an additional 10 subjects may be enrolled for a total sample size of&#xD;
           106.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored for adverse events (AEs) throughout the study.&#xD;
