      This pilot study is, in this new and original approach in cancer pathology, measure and&#xD;
      explain the correspondence between perceived cognitive impairment (cognitive complaint) by&#xD;
      cancer patients and their cognitive scores goals with tasks metamemory while controlling the&#xD;
      anxiety and depression and fatigue factors of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between performance from neuropsychological tests and subjective complaints&#xD;
      of cancer patients treated with chemotherapy or adjuvant hormone therapy is not clear, many&#xD;
      studies have reported no significant correlation between these two measures: the perception&#xD;
      of patients' their cognitive deficits is generally increased relative to that which is&#xD;
      measured by neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason for this lack of association found is probably multifactorial. 1) It can be&#xD;
      explained in part by methodological limitations in some studies (lack of sensitivity tests,&#xD;
      experimental design). 2) psycho-order factors and fatigue are also an explanatory variable in&#xD;
      the sense that literature data often show that cognitive complaints are correlated with&#xD;
      levels of anxiety and depression and fatigue. 3) Finally, metacognition, often assessed in&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases or even in normal aging to better understand its impact on&#xD;
      cognitive disorders, including memory impairment, and the complaint has never been explored&#xD;
      in patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metacognition is a complex but highly sensitive to measure and understand the patient's&#xD;
      complaint and correspondence or disagree with the actual performance concept. Metacognition&#xD;
      refers A) metacognitive knowledge, ie knowledge of an individual's own cognitive processes;&#xD;
      This is a non-dependent activity during which, upstream of the performance of any task,&#xD;
      implement an appropriate strategy, anticipate and plan cognitive steps that would be&#xD;
      necessary for its success general knowledge; and B) metacognitive experiences, ie knowledge&#xD;
      that is based on a cognitive activity in progress, which allows to monitor and control the&#xD;
      task in order to maintain or otherwise modify the cognitive processes involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While metacognitive knowledge (A) are assessed by multiple choice questionnaires,&#xD;
      metacognitive experiences (B) allow targeted and precise fine measures of correspondence&#xD;
      between the prediction performance by the patient himself and his actual performance a&#xD;
      mnemonic task (for JOL and FOK Judgment of Learning for Feeling Of Knowing). Studies&#xD;
      exploring the effects of age on metamemory usually show a deficit of these metacognitive&#xD;
      experiences in normal aging compared to young subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected at the time of learning, JOL is a prediction of future performance for information&#xD;
      that have just been learned. More specifically, when learning words, the subject must judge&#xD;
      its ability to further free recall for each item (quantitative data). This prediction is then&#xD;
      compared to the actual memory performance found in the free recall task. This comparison&#xD;
      allows to judge the accuracy of the prediction and therefore the accuracy of metamemory&#xD;
      judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FOK corresponds to a prediction of performance information that could not be provided in&#xD;
      free recall recognition. In practice, when an item is not recovered in free recall, the&#xD;
      subject must judge its ability to recognize the correct answer among distractor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metacognitive processes can refer to the field of memory (metamemory) or attention&#xD;
      (métaattention), but for now metamemory was much valued neuropsychological tests and the&#xD;
      testing and are most successful and many more.&#xD;
