  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PREHAB study is a clinical trial where frail patients waiting for heart surgery are&#xD;
      randomly chosen to either receive the current standard of care or to participate in an 8-week&#xD;
      exercise/education program at a community-based cardiac rehabilitation facility. Patients can&#xD;
      wait for elective heart surgery for as long as 3-4 months. During this time, individuals are&#xD;
      often fearful of making things worse, causing them to stop being active and further&#xD;
      deteriorate their physical condition. This wait period presents a potential opportunity for&#xD;
      health care providers to engage the patient to take control of their self-managed care prior&#xD;
      to surgery with the intent of improving post-surgical outcomes. Patients randomized to the&#xD;
      PREHAB intervention group will participate in supervised exercise twice per week in a program&#xD;
      designed to improve physical functioning and exercise capacity. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the PREHAB program for frail elderly patients awaiting an elective cardiac surgery will&#xD;
      reduce frailty, improve exercise capacity, improve physical activity behaviour, improve&#xD;
      in-hospital outcomes, improve clinical outcomes 3 months and 1 year postoperatively, and&#xD;
      improve overall quality of life.&#xD;

      PREHAB will be a three centre prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint (PROBE)&#xD;
      controlled trial using assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at three academic, tertiary care hospitals (St. Boniface Hospital, Winnipeg, MB,&#xD;
      Montreal Heart Institute. Montreal QC and Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax,&#xD;
      NS) and one non-academic hospital (Saint John Regional Health Centre, Saint John, NB) that&#xD;
      perform cardiac surgery. These sites were chosen based on similar patient populations and&#xD;
      surgical waitlist times. Additionally, each of these sites are partnered with one or more&#xD;
      community-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) centres, which are certified medical fitness&#xD;
      facilities dedicated to improving the health of the community through health promotion,&#xD;
      disease prevention and rehabilitation services. These facilities offer expert guidance from&#xD;
      certified professionals, innovative health enhancement programs, and provide integrated&#xD;
      medical, rehabilitative and fitness services. The investigators intend to recruit a total of&#xD;
      244 participants to the study (122 per study arm), anticipating a 20% dropout rate to achieve&#xD;
      an eventual sample size of 194 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the PREHAB group will receive, in addition to standard of care, an eight-week&#xD;
      comprehensive exercise therapy and education program at a community-based CR facility. This&#xD;
      program will target both the physical and psycho-social-cognitive aspects of cardiac disease&#xD;
      and frailty. In brief, participants will be required to complete an intake health status&#xD;
      assessment by the CR team including a physiotherapist, cardiovascular nurse, and dietitian&#xD;
      and complete a symptom-limited graded exercise stress test according to the American College&#xD;
      of Sports Medicine Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription 7th Edition. Patients&#xD;
      will be asked to complete at least two sessions of supervised, structured exercise class plus&#xD;
      have the option to attend one additional exercise class per week for eight-weeks, with&#xD;
      progression to a moderate to high-intensity interval program based on the supervised&#xD;
      assessment of the patient's capabilities. This has been shown to be safe and effective in&#xD;
      unrepaired heart failure and elderly patients. PREHAB participants will also attend four&#xD;
      education sessions on topics such as risk factor reduction, medication use, cardiovascular&#xD;
      physiology, smoking cessation, healthy eating, exercise, and stress management and promotion&#xD;
      of self-managed care.&#xD;

    <baseline>
      <population>the baseline analysis was based on the completion of the primary outcome of hospital length of stay. Consented participants and participants in the analysis does differ. 8 participants were not involved in the analysis as they did not have surgery or had emergent surgery prior to intervention start.</population>

          <title>Standard Care</title>
          <description>Patients in the standard care group will receive care as is currently delivered to patients awaiting cardiac surgery at each site. At present, patients are advised to rest and participate in very light intensity physical activity while awaiting surgery. At 1-2 weeks prior to their scheduled surgical date, the patient attends a single three hour cardiac pre-assessment with a nurse practitioner and cardiac anesthesiologist. In addition, a cardiac nurse counsels each patient on healthy behaviors (e.g. smoking cessation, diet, exercise).</description>

          <title>Prehab Intervention</title>
          <description>Patients in the Prehab group will receive, in addition to the standard of care, an eight-week comprehensive exercise therapy and education program at a community-based CR facility. Patients will be asked to complete at least two sessions of supervised, structured exercise class plus have the option to attend one additional exercise class per week for eight-weeks, with progression to a moderate to high-intensity interval program based on the supervised assessment of the patient's capabilities. Prehab participants will also attend four education sessions on topics such as risk factor reduction, medication use, cardiovascular physiology, smoking cessation, healthy eating, exercise, and stress management and promotion of self-managed care.&#xD;

Patients will be asked to complete at least two sessions of supervised, structured exercise class plus have the option to attend one additional exercise class per week for eight-weeks, with progression to a moderate to high-intensity interval program based on the supervised assessment of the patient's capabilities. Prehab participants will also attend four education sessions on topics such as risk factor reduction, medication use, cardiovascular physiology, smoking cessation, healthy eating, exercise, and stress management and promotion of self-managed care.&#xD;
