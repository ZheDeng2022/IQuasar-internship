      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The National Cancer Institute has been studying health risks to people in New Mexico at the&#xD;
      time of the first nuclear bomb test. This was called the Trinity nuclear test. It took place&#xD;
      in 1945. Researchers want to also learn about Native Americans and Hispanics at that time.&#xD;
      They want to learn about their way of life and their diets. This will give a more complete&#xD;
      picture of the health risks to people in New Mexico in 1945.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn about the activities and eating habits of Hispanic and tribal communities&#xD;
           during the 1940s.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see if a group of Hispanic and Native Americans who were living in New Mexico in 1945&#xD;
           can be gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Native American or Hispanic adults who were alive in 1945. They must know firsthand about&#xD;
      the lifestyle and diet in New Mexico at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 1 visit. They will be interviewed at a place like a library or&#xD;
           office. They will answer questions about their lifestyle and diet around 1945. This will&#xD;
           take up 60 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may agree to have their interviews taped. Their names will not be kept with&#xD;
           their answers from the interviews.&#xD;

      The evaluation of health risks among the public as a consequence of exposure to radioactive&#xD;
      fallout from nuclear testing has been an important area of research for many years by&#xD;
      investigators in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB). As a result of the reputation of&#xD;
      this group in the field of dose and risk assessment related to radioactive fallout, and the&#xD;
      expertise of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in cancer research, in 2007, U.S. Senator&#xD;
      Jeff Bingaman (D, NM) sent a request to the NCI to evaluate the health risks to New Mexico&#xD;
      residents from the first nuclear bomb test (named Trinity) that was conducted in 1945 in&#xD;
      south-central New Mexico. The NCI responded in early 2008 with a preliminary evaluation of&#xD;
      the radiation doses received by the residents of New Mexico. However, the evaluation made no&#xD;
      special provisions for lifestyles and diets of tribal community members or Hispanics\Latinos&#xD;
      which were a significant part of the population. Little is known about Native American and&#xD;
      Hispanic\Latino lifestyles and diets in the mid-twentieth century, yet such data are&#xD;
      necessary to produce a credible assessment of health risks to the state s population. For&#xD;
      this reason, REB investigators did not publish the initial dose assessment in the&#xD;
      peer-reviewed literature. Additionally, since statewide health records cannot be&#xD;
      reconstructed in a meaningful way to determine excess disease rates, estimation of health&#xD;
      risks in this population can only be projected (i.e., estimated) based on the magnitude and&#xD;
      distribution of radiation doses received and the relationships between radiation dose and&#xD;
      cancer risks observed in other populations. Since the preparation of the 2008 report, the REB&#xD;
      exposure assessment models used to assess doses from radioactive fallout from other nuclear&#xD;
      test sites have been improved and published in the peer-reviewed literature. The required&#xD;
      improvements in the 2008 Trinity assessment that would support publication of the projected&#xD;
      health risks includes sex- and age-dependent diet and lifestyle models for Native Americans&#xD;
      and Hispanics\Latinos in New Mexico in the mid-1940s. We are proposing a pilot study to&#xD;
      collect, via individual interviews, information on lifestyle and diet from up to 9 key&#xD;
      informants of Native Americans and Hispanics\Latinos living in New Mexico who were alive at&#xD;
      the time of the bomb (currently greater than or equal to 69 years old). This data will inform&#xD;
      the design of a larger study, which will collect lifestyle and diet information from a series&#xD;
      of targeted focus groups. The information acquired from these 9 individual interviews will be&#xD;
      used to 1) determine the feasibility of assembling focus groups of members of tribal and&#xD;
      Hispanic\Latino communities in New Mexico who were alive in 1945 at the time of the bomb and&#xD;
      2) provide lifestyle and diet information to be used for refining focus group interviewing&#xD;
      tools.&#xD;
