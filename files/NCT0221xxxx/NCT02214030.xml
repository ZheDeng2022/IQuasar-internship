  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a locally designed Assiut&#xD;
      Femoral Compression Device (AFCD) versus manual compression (MC). Femoral compression devices&#xD;
      have been developed thorough the past decades without being strongly implemented in the&#xD;
      catheterization laboratory. Their limited adoption reflects concerns of high cost and&#xD;
      conflicting data regarding their safety&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intra-arterial sheaths were removed 6 hours after PCI in the MC group according to the&#xD;
      standard local protocols. However for AFCD group, the sheaths were removed 2 hours after PCI&#xD;
      instead of conventional 6 hours. To standardize compression times, AFCD were applied to&#xD;
      patient and complete femoral artery compression were applied for 5 minutes, followed by a&#xD;
      gradual release of pressure till distal pulse is palpated. Each patient received a minimum of&#xD;
      13 minutes of compression, with further compression applied only if full hemostasis had not&#xD;
      been achieved at that point with maximum of 30 minutes.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time-To-Ambulation (TTA), measured in hours</measure>
    <time_frame>TTA was measured from the time the introducer sheath was removed (2 hr in AFCD group and 6 hours in MC group after end of PCI) to time of ambulation</time_frame>
    <description>Ambulation was defined as patient standing and walking at least 6 meters (20 feet) without re-bleeding or significant oozing requiring manual compression</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the absence of major adverse events on discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>24 post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>major adverse event (MAE) was defined as symptomatic bleeding associated with hemoglobin drop â‰¥5 g/dL requiring blood transfusion, fatal bleeding that directly results in death, a pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula, distal arterial embolism, infections requiring administration of IV antibiotics or debridement, and the need for vascular surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device success:</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes during application</time_frame>
    <description>This was defined as easy application of the device with good fixation and stability and achieving final hemostasis. Device Stability was defined as absence of tilt and/or mobility after application of the device on top of the patient groin. Assessment of the device application was performed using a questionnaire with a scale of three grades; &quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;Difficult&quot; and &quot;Requires Improvement&quot;. Assessment of stability and fixation of the device was performed on a scale defined as &quot;Very Good&quot;, &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Procedure success</measure>
    <time_frame>24 h post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>This was defined as hemostasis achieved by the assigned method, without the occurrence of a closure-related major adverse event (MAE).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Time-To-Hemostasis (TTH), measured in minutes.</measure>
    <time_frame>TTH was measured from the time the introducer sheath was removed (2 hr in AFCD group and 6 hours in MC group after end of PCI) to the time hemostasis was achieved</time_frame>
    <description>Hemostasis was defined as no or minimal subcutaneous oozing and the absence of expanding or developing hematoma</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Minor complications:</measure>
    <time_frame>24h post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Any oozing (leakage of blood from the puncture site requiring digital pressure), ecchymosis (bleeding into subcutaneous tissue planes causing bluish-purple discoloration &gt; 4cm in diameter), hematoma (non pulsatile mass &gt; 1 cm in diameter), and infections treatable with oral antibiotics</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient discomfort:</measure>
    <time_frame>within 10 minutes of device application</time_frame>
    <description>was assessed based on a short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire using a Present Pain Intensity (PPI) scale that rated pain from 0 (no pain) to 5 (excruciating).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Vasovagal manifestations</measure>
    <time_frame>within 10 minutes of device application</time_frame>
    <description>(sweating, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting) were recorded.</description>

    <measure>Time the patient is deemed eligible for hospital discharge</measure>

To standardize compression times, AFCD were applied to patient and complete femoral artery compression were applied for 5 minutes, followed by a gradual release of pressure over the ensuing 8 minutes. Therefore each patient received a minimum of 13 minutes of compression, with further compression applied only if full hemostasis had not been achieved at that point with maximum of 30 minutes.</description>
