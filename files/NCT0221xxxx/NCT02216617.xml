      The purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of afatinib&#xD;
      administrated in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere®) and cisplatin in induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy of locally advanced head and neck carcinoma in order to move to a phase II,&#xD;
      allowing the comparison with standard induction chemotherapy TPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a multicentric, national, opened, not-randomized phase Ib. Three doses of afatinib (20,&#xD;
      30 and 40 Mg per day) will be studied in combination with the fixed standard doses of&#xD;
      docetaxel and cisplatin. For each dose level, beginning with smallest (20 Mg per day of&#xD;
      afatinib), 3 to 6 patients will be treated at maximum, i.e. 3 cycles of three weeks treatment&#xD;
      each one (9 weeks on the whole). The next dose level will be studied only if the previous&#xD;
      dose is well tolerated for the period of the first 4 weeks observation of the treatment (1st&#xD;
      cycle more first week of the 2nd cycle). Once the MTD is determined, four additional patients&#xD;
      will be treated with this dose. A maximum of 22 patients should be included in this study.&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is estimated at 18 months. In case of major safety problems,&#xD;
      the study may be stopped earlier. In short, the preclinical data, pharmacological and&#xD;
      clinical on afatinib indicate that the benefit-risk ratio can be regarded as positive and&#xD;
      that the association of afatinib with cisplatin and docetaxel could be effective in patients&#xD;
      with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma potentially resulting in an extension of time to&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract correspond in the Western countries about 5% of&#xD;
      cancers. They are treated by surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Although progress in&#xD;
      radio chemotherapy have reduced mortality and increase the rates of organ preservation in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers, they have metastatic risk or&#xD;
      particularly high local recurrence. The induction chemotherapy is a first-line treatment of&#xD;
      cancer in which the patient receives doses of chemotherapy allowing to obtain a significant&#xD;
      reduction in tumor size, and thus to avoid the surgery and to treat the tumor then by&#xD;
      radiotherapy alone or combine by certain drugs. The standard treatment of induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy currently used for the carcinoma of aerodigestive tract is TPF compose of 3&#xD;
      drugs: the docetaxel (or Taxotere®, T), the cisplatin (P) and the 5-fluorouracil (or 5FU, F).&#xD;
      Despite of the relative efficacy of this treatment, which provides a survival benefit, it is&#xD;
      necessary to find a combination of induction to be more effective and less toxic. That is why&#xD;
      this study intended to check if a new combination called TPA in which the fluorouracil (F) is&#xD;
      replaced by the afatinib (A), will be more beneficial. The afatinib is a powerful and&#xD;
      irreversible inhibitor of the EGFR (human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor type 1), HER2 and&#xD;
      HER 4. The EGFR is associated with a pejorative prognosis and resistance to the treatments&#xD;
      through its role in the proliferation (multiplication of tumoral cells), the cell survival&#xD;
      and replication and angiogenesis (process of growth of new blood-vessels, vital in the growth&#xD;
      of the malignant tumors). Afatinib has proved effective in patients in with local recurrence&#xD;
      or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after first line cisplatin based&#xD;
      and tolerance is correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rational of this study is based on the following elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cisplatin and docetaxel on the one hand and the afatinib on the other hand have proved&#xD;
           effectiveness in head and neck cancers. The tolerance of their association is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, several broad randomized trials have shown that it is possible to improve&#xD;
           the effectiveness of induction chemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck carcinoma&#xD;
           by the addition of Taxotere® to the cisplatin-5FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Independently, it has been shown in carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract with&#xD;
           recurrence or metastatic, that an anti-EGFR targeted therapy by cetuximab could improve&#xD;
           the effectiveness of chemotherapy with cisplatin-5FU More recently, Taxotere® and&#xD;
           Cisplatin + Cetuximab (or Erbitux®) combination for the treatment of head and neck&#xD;
           squamous cell carcinoma has been tested in a broad study of phase II showing the good&#xD;
           feasibility of this combination and a particularly high rate of tumoral response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally a comparative study of cetuximab versus afatinib showed an advantage in terms of&#xD;
           tumoral response in support of afatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From all these observations, the investigators can hypothesize that the addition of afatinib&#xD;
      to the docetaxel and the cisplatin could be an induction treatment for locally advanced&#xD;
      carcinoma both innovating and promising. Indeed, this regimen appears optimized in terms of&#xD;
      efficiency, incorporating both the combination of the most active cytotoxic agents, Taxotere®&#xD;
      and the cisplatin, but also potentially more effective than Erbitux®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of afatinib&#xD;
      administrated in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere®) and cisplatin in induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy of locally advanced head and neck carcinoma in order to move to a phase II,&#xD;
      allowing the comparison with standard induction chemotherapy TPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a multicentric, national, opened, not-randomized phase Ib. Three doses of the afatinib&#xD;
      (20, 30 and 40 Mg per day) will be studied in combination with the fixed standard doses of&#xD;
      the docetaxel and the cisplatin. For each dose level, beginning with smallest (20 Mg per day&#xD;
      of afatinib), 3 to 6 patients will be treated at maximum, i.e. 3 cycles of three weeks&#xD;
      treatment each one (9 weeks on the whole). The next dose level will be studied only if the&#xD;
      previous dose is well tolerated for the period of the first 4 weeks observation of the&#xD;
      treatment (1st cycle and first week of the 2nd cycle). Once the MTD is determine, four&#xD;
      additional patients will be treated with this dose. A maximum of 22 patients should be&#xD;
      included in this study. The total duration of the study is estimated at 18 months. In case of&#xD;
      major safety problems, the study may be stopped earlier. In short, the preclinical data,&#xD;
      pharmacological and clinical on afatinib indicate that the benefit-risk ratio can be regarded&#xD;
      as positive and that the association of afatinib with cisplatin and docetaxel could be&#xD;
      effective in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma potentially resulting in an&#xD;
      extension of time to progression.&#xD;
