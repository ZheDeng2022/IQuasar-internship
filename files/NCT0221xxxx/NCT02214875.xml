      This study aims to address the research question: Will continuous quality improvement, using&#xD;
      a Break Through Series approach, increase uptake of PMTCT services and retention-in-care of&#xD;
      HIV-infected pregnant women and mothers at six and 12 months postpartum?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) is a health systems intervention to assist programs to&#xD;
      systematically improve services and health outcomes. The Break Through Series (BTS) is a&#xD;
      specific CQI approach is a short-term (6- to 15-month) learning system that brings together&#xD;
      teams from several hospitals or clinics (&quot;collaboratives&quot;) to seek improvement in a focused&#xD;
      topic area through a common process of data sharing and review Primary Objective To assess&#xD;
      whether retention-in-care of HIV-infected women at six (6) months postpartum is higher at&#xD;
      health facilities implementing CQI-BTS approaches than at health facilities not implementing&#xD;
      CQI-BTS approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether implementation of CQI-BTS initiatives at health facilities increases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Uptake of PMTCT services by HIV-infected pregnant women;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Retention-in-care of HIV-infected women at twelve (12) months postpartum;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Retention-in-care of HIV-exposed babies at six (6) and twelve (12) months of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Uptake of a pre-defined, minimum set of integrated RH/PMTCT services by HIV-infected&#xD;
           women in health facilities.&#xD;

      Methods/ Study design/ Population/ Interventions Study Design: A cluster randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in which 32 public primary and secondary health care facilities are&#xD;
      randomized into 16 intervention and 16 control sites. The control sites will receive routine&#xD;
      CIHP support, while the intervention sites will receive structured CQI-BTS interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites Based on pre-set site selection criteria, 32 sites were selected from a total of&#xD;
      241 eligible sites supported by the Centre for Integrated Healthcare Programs (CIHP), to&#xD;
      provide comprehensive HIV care and treatment programs. These sites are at higher levels of&#xD;
      standardized care compared to Government of Nigeria sites where there is minimal&#xD;
      standardization of care. The following criteria were used to select health facilities for the&#xD;
      study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Facility supports ANC/PMTCT services and has capacity to provide ART until 12-18 months&#xD;
           post-partum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onsite delivery of HIV+ women by the facility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provision of postpartum care follow-up for HIV+ women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ANC attendance with at least 2 HIV+ women per month for general hospitals and at least 1&#xD;
           per month for primary health care (PHCs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Availability of, at least, two trained community health extension workers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Facilities providing PMTCT services for more than six months prior to onset of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are HIV-infected pregnant women presenting at study sites for 1st booking at&#xD;
      antenatal clinics with gestational age of 34 weeks or less, ART naive, accept ARV and agree&#xD;
      to remain in care for at least six months post-partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control and Intervention arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual pregnant women and mothers attending facilities in the control and intervention&#xD;
      arms receive the same routine care that includes a &quot;test and treat&quot; protocol i.e. same day&#xD;
      HIV testing and initiation of triple ARVs (option B) of HIV+ pregnant women. Clients eligible&#xD;
      for lifelong ART based on CD4 count, and/or WHO staging, continue ARVs indefinitely for their&#xD;
      own health, while those not eligible continue ARV prophylaxis according to the National&#xD;
      guidelines. For the purpose of this study, antenatal clients are seen for their ARV drug&#xD;
      refills until delivery according to the National ANC schedule of appointments. Postpartum,&#xD;
      visits follow the immunization schedule i.e. 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks and thereafter 2&#xD;
      monthly until 12 months. Facilities in the control arm continue to receive routine health&#xD;
      system support from CIHP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention package:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CQI interventions employ rapid cycles of data collection, testing of solutions and review of&#xD;
      changes will be implemented. At each site a Quality Improvement Team (QIT) will be&#xD;
      established from among the local staff. Local Government and State level QI teams will also&#xD;
      be set up to provide oversight function of the health facilities' QI initiatives. The BTS is&#xD;
      a collaborative learning approach conducted quarterly in each study state at a central&#xD;
      location with participants from the intervention sites. The sessions provide opportunity for&#xD;
      teams to learn from each other and to adapt and implement changes using the Plan-Do-Study-Act&#xD;
      (PDSA) model. Driver diagrams will be developed to understand the primary and secondary&#xD;
      drivers for low retention of HIV positive mothers and formulate action plans and indicator&#xD;
      sets to address these. Between the collaborative sessions, specific designated improvement&#xD;
      coaches will follow up site teams at regular intervals via physical site visits and telephone&#xD;
      calls to guide implementation of change ideas. Different site teams will also be encouraged&#xD;
      to communicate with each other through telephone calls and cross-site visits to strengthen&#xD;
      learning and exchange of ideas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated using the windows programme for epidemiologists. The CQI-BTS&#xD;
      approach tested within the study would be deemed worthwhile if there is a 20% absolute&#xD;
      increase in retention of mothers at 6 months (e.g. expected retention rate in the control&#xD;
      arm: 40%; expected retention rate in the control arm: 60%). First, the minimum sample size&#xD;
      needed under individual randomization was calculated to detect the desirable difference of&#xD;
      proportions with a level of significance set at 95% (two-sided) and at 80% power. We found&#xD;
      that 94 mother-infant pairs would be needed in each arm under individual randomization.&#xD;
      Second, bearing in mind that this trial will randomize the intervention package under several&#xD;
      clusters, the sample size from a non-cluster randomized trial was inflated by an Inflation&#xD;
      Factor (IF). The IF is calculated as follows: IF = 1 + (m - 1) ro, where m is the size of&#xD;
      each cluster, and ro the internal variability which represents how strongly individuals&#xD;
      within clusters are related to each other. In our case, it is difficult to estimate a priori&#xD;
      this internal variability due to lack of primary data: it is possible that the standardized&#xD;
      structure of the intervention tested within the trial will lead to a relatively low cluster&#xD;
      internal variability; alternatively, because the intervention package depends on the&#xD;
      individual capacity/will of health-care personnel, this may increase the internal variability&#xD;
      across clusters. Hence, we believe it is reasonable to assume a ro value of 0.10, as&#xD;
      recommended by most authors. We set the size of cluster at 20, which gave an inflation factor&#xD;
      of 2.9. Additionally, since this research is being carried out in an operational context, we&#xD;
      allowed for up to 20% of routine data to be incomplete or maternal mortality in pregnancy and&#xD;
      therefore data on retention in care not available for analysis. As a conclusion, a total of&#xD;
      327 mother-infant pairs are needed in each arm. There will be 16 clusters in each arm with a&#xD;
      minimum number of 20 HIV-infected pregnant women per site. A total of 640 pregnant&#xD;
      HIV-infected women will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome data is sourced from the local health registers -Data collection and entry&#xD;
      occur weekly in both study arms by research assistants. A monthly review of these data is&#xD;
      conducted by the LJM study team. In addition, process measures are routinely collected to&#xD;
      assess the integrity of implementation of the CQI-BTS intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: Proportion of HIV+ pregnant women in care 6 months postpartum Source&#xD;
      Document: PMTCT ARV register&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome 1: Proportion of HIV+ pregnant women initiating ARV prophylaxis or&#xD;
      treatment within 2 weeks of enrolment Source Document: PMTCT HCT register, PMTCT ARV register&#xD;
      and Mother Child Care Form&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome 2: Proportion of HIV+ pregnant women care 12 months postpartum Source&#xD;
      Document: PMTCT ARV register, Mother and Child Care Form&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome 3: Proportion of HIV exposed infants with Dry Blood Spot (DBS) samples&#xD;
      taken at 8 weeks of life Source Document: Child follow up register and Mother Child Care Form&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses will be conducted to outline participants' and clusters' baseline&#xD;
      characteristics and outcomes by study arms using frequency tabulations and summary&#xD;
      statistics. Bi-variate analysis will be done to identify potential prognostic factors&#xD;
      confounding the distribution of baseline characteristics among the arms that require&#xD;
      adjustment.&#xD;
