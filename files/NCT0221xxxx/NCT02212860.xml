  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy after surgery to remove breast cancer improves control of the breast&#xD;
      cancer. Standard therapy after breast conservation surgery is five to six weeks of radiation&#xD;
      to the entire breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness of conformal radiation therapy delivered&#xD;
      only to the area in the breast where the lumpectomy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine if radiation therapy delivered in this manner will prevent the&#xD;
      cancer from coming back and eliminate the need for five to six weeks of radiation. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to one of two arms; Arm 1 which is comprised of one&#xD;
      neoadjuvant radiation treatment, or Arm 2 which is comprised of three neoadjuvant radiation&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also gather information about the safety and effects (good and bad) this&#xD;
      radiation has, the immune priming effects of this radiation, and on patient satisfaction with&#xD;
      the appearance of the breast.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our proposal represents the convergence of several recent developments in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with low-risk carcinoma of the breast. For the selected subset of patients with&#xD;
      low-risk disease, it appears that intra-operative radiotherapy with a single fraction leads&#xD;
      to acceptable clinical outcomes in terms of local control, overall survival and toxicity.&#xD;
      There have also been a few Phase I dose escalation trials demonstrating safety with single&#xD;
      fraction breast radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we propose the delivery of radiotherapy using stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy in two different regimens; a single 21 Gy fraction, or 3 10Gy fractions. Radiation&#xD;
      will be delivered using Volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), planned on coregistered MRI&#xD;
      (with a subset having a 3T PET-MRI) and CT imaging, and delivered prone. Our approach will&#xD;
      potentially have numerous benefits, including significantly shortened treatment time,&#xD;
      convenience and potentially reduced health care costs. It would significantly improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also provide a unique opportunity for pathologic assessment of the impact of&#xD;
      radiation at a microscopic level and on tumour and immune markers without the confounding&#xD;
      impact of systemic treatments, comparing pre- to post-radiation biopsy specimens for imaging&#xD;
      and histologic predictors of radiation sensitivity.&#xD;
