    <textblock>
      The Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol combination (FSC) at a dose of 100/50 micrograms (mcg)&#xD;
      twice daily in DISKUS inhaler (also known as ACCUHALER速, Ddpi) inhaler is a recognised and&#xD;
      licensed therapy for the treatment of asthma. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is developing the&#xD;
      ROTAHALER/ ROTACAPS速 (Rdpi) inhaler as an alternative treatment option for asthmatic&#xD;
      patients. This study is a Phase I, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, two- treatment,&#xD;
      four-way cross-over (replicate design), two sequence, repeat dose, two centre study in mild&#xD;
      to moderate asthmatics to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fluticasone&#xD;
      proprionate/salmeterol (100/50 mcg) delivered via the Rdpi versus the Ddpi. A total of 58&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled to ensure 52 subjects complete all dosing occasions. Each subject&#xD;
      will be allocated to one of two treatment sequences and will participate in four treatment&#xD;
      periods, receiving each of the treatments twice.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a known physician diagnosis of asthma with a best Forced Expiratory&#xD;
             Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) of &gt;70% of the predicted normal value at the Screening&#xD;
             visit. Percent predicted will be calculated using the European Respiratory Society&#xD;
             Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations. Subjects must abstain from short&#xD;
             acting beta-2 agonists (SABA) use for 6 hours prior to the Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the screening visit, subjects must either demonstrate the presence of&#xD;
             reversible airway disease, defined as an increase in FEV1 of &gt;=12.0% over baseline and&#xD;
             an absolute change of &gt;=200 millilitres (mL) within 60 minutes following 4 inhalations&#xD;
             of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or equivalent nebulized treatment with&#xD;
             albuterol/salbutamol solution) or in the absence of reversibility have documented&#xD;
             evidence of a physician diagnosed asthma for at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male/females aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt;= 50 kilograms (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18 - 35.0&#xD;
             kilogram/square meter (kg/m^2) (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for&#xD;
             this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's&#xD;
             review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a&#xD;
             verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or&#xD;
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. In questionable cases a&#xD;
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40&#xD;
             milliinternational units per/millilitre (MIU/mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picogram/millilitre&#xD;
             (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomoles per liter [pmol/L]) is confirmatory. Females on hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to&#xD;
             use one of the contraception methods, if they wish to continue their HRT during the&#xD;
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will&#xD;
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on&#xD;
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,&#xD;
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.;&#xD;

             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or urine hCG test prior to dosing AND ;&#xD;
             Agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as&#xD;
             determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to&#xD;
             sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree&#xD;
             to use contraception until the follow-up visit.; OR has only same-sex partners, when&#xD;
             this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.&#xD;

             cigarettes, cigars or pipe tobacco). [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per&#xD;
             day / 20) x number of years smoked].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;= 1.5x Upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated&#xD;
             and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).&#xD;

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
             dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grapefruit or grapefruit juice containing products are excluded from 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             randomisation until collection of the final blood sample at treatment period 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoform, 3A4 (CYP3A4), are excluded from 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to randomisation until collection of the final blood sample at treatment&#xD;
             period 4. CYP3A4 inhibitors include cimetidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin,&#xD;
             ciprofloxacin, ritonavir, ketoconazole, and azole antifungals.&#xD;

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, vitamins, herbal and dietary&#xD;
             supplements, within seven days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of study medication, which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator,&#xD;
             may interfere with study outcome. Specifically, calcium and vitamin D supplements and&#xD;
             bisphosphonates are not allowed throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are not able to comply with the&#xD;
