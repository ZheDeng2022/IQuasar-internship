      It has always been a real challenge to treat sepsis in critically ill patients. The mortality&#xD;
      is as high as 20％ in patients with severe sepsis and 46％ with septic shock develops. Early&#xD;
      diagnosis and early treatment are the principles. Along with appropriate resuscitation,&#xD;
      judicious and thoughtful intravenous antibiotic therapy is the critical determinant of&#xD;
      survival in sepsis and septic shock given that ineffective initial therapy worsens the&#xD;
      outcome. Blood culture and subsequent susceptibility testing are the gold standard for&#xD;
      microbiological diagnosis to direct the optimal use of antibiotic. However, this conventional&#xD;
      approach usually takes 5-7 days to wait for the final report. Positive results were reported&#xD;
      in only 30% of patients with sepsis and 50 to 60% septic shock. Moreover, the very low&#xD;
      bacteria level in blood and prior use of antibiotics may prevent pathogen growth.&#xD;
      Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a novel spectroscopy technique based on Raman&#xD;
      scattering and localized surface plasma resonance (LSPR), which results in strongly enhanced&#xD;
      Raman signals derived from molecules attached to nanometre-sized gold (Au) and silver (Ag)&#xD;
      structures. SERS provides the structural information of biomedical molecules with&#xD;
      ultra-sensitive characterization down to single molecular level in fast and non-destructive&#xD;
      manner. The clinical application of SERS in sepsis will first help to recognize pathogens as&#xD;
      well as their specific drug sensitivity, and then optimally guide the initial antibiotics&#xD;
      usage. Plasma from twenty blood culture proven Gram positive, negative and Candida cases will&#xD;
      separately subject to metabolomics profiling and bioinformatics analysis to establish each&#xD;
      pathogen metabolites profile. The sensitivity and specificity of SERS and metabolomics in&#xD;
      identifying pathogen and antibiotics-resistant strains will be evaluated. The investigators&#xD;
      expected both techniques to play a crucial role in modern sepsis treatment and bring great&#xD;
      impact on mortality reduction.&#xD;

      Sepsis is a serious medical condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to infection.&#xD;
      Different series of chemicals released into the blood to fight infection trigger systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, which is also called systemic inflammatory syndrome, SIRS. Sepsis is one of the&#xD;
      major public health issues, which are characterized with high cost and high mortality.&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies suggest that there are approximately 300 sepsis cases in per 100,000&#xD;
      population; accounting for 2% of all hospital admissions and up to 30% of intensive care unit&#xD;
      admissions. Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. The mortality is&#xD;
      as high as 20％ in patients with severe sepsis and 46％ when septic shock develops. Despite&#xD;
      recent advances in sepsis treatment, including early goal-directed therapy, low-dose&#xD;
      corticosteroid use, protective ventilation, intensive glucose control and activated protein C&#xD;
      use, sepsis is still a major challenge for clinical physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early appropriate antibiotic therapy targeting at the causative pathogen is always crucial to&#xD;
      the successful treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock. However, blood culture, the&#xD;
      current standard for microbiological diagnosis, can't provide the instant information of&#xD;
      pathogens identification at the right beginning of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It usually takes 5-7 days to wait for the final report and even much longer for some&#xD;
      slow-growth bacteria or yeasts. Moreover, the yield positive rate is low. Only 30% positive&#xD;
      results were reported in patients with sepsis and 50 to 60% in septic shock. Some&#xD;
      microorganisms are present in the blood in very small numbers and must have longer time to&#xD;
      reproduce and grow to quantities that can be detected. Some microorganisms are difficult to&#xD;
      grow and special nutrient media may be needed. Viruses cannot be also detected using blood&#xD;
      culture bottles designed to grow bacteria. Besides, antimicrobial therapy in the preceding&#xD;
      two weeks may prevent pathogen growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the time to initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is the strongest predictor&#xD;
      of mortality, the antibiotics are usually started &quot;empirically&quot; (ie. based on doctors'&#xD;
      experience) with broad spectrum and adjusted according to the clinical response. For lack of&#xD;
      precise data, inadequate infection control may encounter leading to poor prognosis, and&#xD;
      furthermore adverse effects of antibiotics such as organ toxicity and collateral damage (i.&#xD;
      e., selection of drug-resistant organisms and the unwanted development of colonization or&#xD;
      infection with multidrug-resistant organisms) occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the SERS and fluorescent microscopy-based high-speed diagnosis platform for clinical&#xD;
      microbiology may help to solve this problem. The specific aims of the subproject are listed&#xD;
      as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a comprehensive protocol of pretreatment of the complex blood sample from the&#xD;
           patients with sepsis as the preparation for SERS detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the causative bacteria or yeasts in the blood by the high-speed diagnosis&#xD;
           platform based on SERS to guide the initial antibiotics treatment in sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the susceptibility of the causative pathogen to various antibiotics to guide&#xD;
           the initial antibiotics treatment in sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To quantify the bacterial counts in blood to explore the relationship between the load&#xD;
           (virulence) of pathogen and clinical course, transmissibility, and antibiotic resistance&#xD;
           in patients with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compile a database of SERS spectra of clinical microbiology, including bacteria,&#xD;
           yeasts and fungi that are the common causative pathogens of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect this novel technique based on SERS and fluorescent optical&#xD;
      microscopy will play a crucial role in modern sepsis treatment, not only bringing great&#xD;
      impact on mortality reduction, cost control, but also alleviating the problem of growing&#xD;
      resistant trains from the inappropriate use of antibiotics.&#xD;
