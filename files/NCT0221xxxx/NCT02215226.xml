      Compare anticapsular antibody levels against Group B Streptococcus at delivery in mothers and&#xD;
      their infants who develop disease versus those who do not. Use this comparison to establish&#xD;
      antibody levels associated with reductions in risk of GBS disease in infants aged less than&#xD;
      90 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of invasive disease during the neonatal period&#xD;
      in developed and developing countries. The global incidence of disease is 0.53 per 1000 live&#xD;
      births, though a substantially higher incidence has been reported from South Africa (3 per&#xD;
      1000 live births). Of the disease-causing serotypes, types Ia and III account for over 70% of&#xD;
      invasive disease in young infants. The introduction of screening for maternal rectovaginal&#xD;
      GBS colonization, with subsequent treatment of colonized women with intrapartum antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis (IAP) at delivery, has led to a &gt;80% reduction in the incidence of disease in&#xD;
      some settings (Schrag, 2012). However, the residual burden of early-onset disease (EOD) in&#xD;
      countries which have implemented universal screening and IAP remains similar to the incidence&#xD;
      of late-onset disease (LOD), which has not declined over time. The resources necessary to&#xD;
      implement a screening and IAP program has limited the establishment of this intervention in&#xD;
      other developed and most developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBS capsular polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines (GBS-CV) aimed at the immunization of&#xD;
      pregnant women, with protection of the newborn expected from trans-placental acquisition of&#xD;
      the induced antibodies in utero have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of challenges to undertaking a large efficacy trial of GBS-CV aimed at&#xD;
      licensure of this vaccine. Consequently, licensure of GBS-CV may depend on establishing an&#xD;
      immunologic/serologic correlate of protection against invasive disease in newborns, as has&#xD;
      been successfully motivated for and adopted in the licensure pathway of meningococcal&#xD;
      vaccines. Although previous studies have aimed to identify serotype-specific correlates of&#xD;
      anticapsular antibody protection against invasive GBS disease during early-infancy;&#xD;
      differences in study-design, age-range of invasive-cases, antibody assay methods and a lack&#xD;
      of standardized reference serum between tests mean a robust sero-correlate of protection&#xD;
      against GBS has yet to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a case control study nested within a prospective, longitudinal cohort&#xD;
      of mothers and their infants &lt;=90 days of age, at one academic hospital center in South&#xD;
      Africa. The limited intrapartum antibiotic exposure (10-12% deliveries), relatively high&#xD;
      incidence of both EOD and LOD (2 per 1000 live births and 1 per 1000 live births&#xD;
      respectively) and standardized laboratory surveillance (for case identification) offers an&#xD;
      optimal setting in which to establish correlates of protection against the GBS serotypes that&#xD;
      predominate in this setting (serotypes Ia and III for EOD and serotype III for LOD).&#xD;
