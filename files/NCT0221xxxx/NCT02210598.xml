  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study represents the first randomized trial comparing traditional inpatient induction&#xD;
      with a transcervical foley catheter versus outpatient induction with immediate removal of a&#xD;
      transcervical foley catheter. The immediate removal technique allows the induction process to&#xD;
      begin in the hospital setting, but allows the patient to go home without a foreign body in&#xD;
      situ. The investigators hypothesize the outpatient group will spend less time hospitalized&#xD;
      prior to discharge. Additionally, the investigators will explore the vaginal delivery rates&#xD;
      and maternal/neonatal safety profiles between groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are candidates for labor induction and meet inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      identified in the obstetrics clinic when they are being scheduled for induction of labor, or&#xD;
      at a later clinic date. If they agree to participate, patients will be randomized and&#xD;
      enrolled in the study at that time. Those who consent will be randomized into Group A&#xD;
      (Experimental Group) and Group B (Control Group). No stratification criteria will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the control group will undergo induction of labor using the standard&#xD;
      foley bulb and Pitocin method. Participants will be placed in the dorsal lithotomy position,&#xD;
      an 18 French Foley catheter will be placed transcervically and its balloon filled with 60mL&#xD;
      of sterile saline. One of two methods will be used to place the transcervical foley based on&#xD;
      provider preference and determination of which method will offer the greatest chance for&#xD;
      successful placement. Method A is placement of the foley &quot;blindly&quot; by palpation of the&#xD;
      cervix. Method B utilizes direct visualization with sterile speculum placement. Method will&#xD;
      be documented in the data collection forms. The catheter will be left in place and IV&#xD;
      oxytocin will be started per protocol. The foley catheter will be removed after 12 hours if&#xD;
      not spontaneously extruded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the experimental group will undergo outpatient induction of labor.&#xD;
      Either of the above two described methods will be used to place an 18 French Foley catheter&#xD;
      transcervically and its balloon filled with 60mL of sterile saline. The catheter will be&#xD;
      deflated and removed within 10 minutes of placement. The patient will then undergo a&#xD;
      non-stress test (NST). If the patient has a reactive NST with no late or variable&#xD;
      decelerations or uterine tachysystole, the patient will be discharged home with clear return&#xD;
      precautions and instructions to return to the triage area in 24 hours. When the patient&#xD;
      returns to the hospital, a sterile vaginal exam will be done and Bishop score documented. The&#xD;
      patient will then be admitted to L&amp;D for inpatient continuation of induction with IV oxytocin&#xD;
      per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with the Friedman curve and current LAC+USC practice, primigravid participants&#xD;
      will be given 20 hours of maximum Pitocin (22 mU/ min) to achieve active labor and&#xD;
      multigravid participants will be given 14 hours before a failed induction is diagnosed.&#xD;
      Cesarean delivery will be recommended for arrest of dilation, arrest of descent, or any&#xD;
      obstetric indication as decided by the on-duty house staff. Finally, at patient request,&#xD;
      intravenous or regional anesthesia will be made available at any time during the labor and&#xD;
      delivery process.&#xD;
