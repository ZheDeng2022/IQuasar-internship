      Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of bone fractures, but current predictors of&#xD;
      bone fracture seem to underestimate this risk. It is commonly known that increased levels of&#xD;
      certain biochemical bone markers predict low-energy fractures, but the pattern of these&#xD;
      markers in diabetics still show heterogeneity and inconsistency. Part of the pathology of&#xD;
      diabetes is a high blood glucose level, and this can potentially influence bone turnover and&#xD;
      thereby bone markers. Chronic inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is&#xD;
      shown to increase bone resorption, and the same may be the case in diabetics. The purpose of&#xD;
      this project is to investigate whether glucose has a direct effect on bone markers or an&#xD;
      indirect effect through intestinal hormones or inflammatory processes.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that Diabetes Mellitus type I (DMI) and II (DMII) is associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of bone fracture. Paradoxically DMII patients have higher Bone Mineral&#xD;
      Density (BMD) than average, while DMI patients have lower BMD than average. Even the low BMD&#xD;
      of DMI cannot fully explain the extent of fractures found. Known risk factors and BMD&#xD;
      underestimate the risk of fracture amongst DM patients using the 10 year fracture risk tool&#xD;
      'Fracture Risk Assessment Tool' (FRAX). It is well-known that increased levels of biochemical&#xD;
      bone markers predict low-energy fractures. However bone markers in DM patients show both&#xD;
      heterogeneity and inconsistency. Because of this, the predictive value of bone markers is&#xD;
      still uncertain in DM patients. Part of the pathology of DM is a higher blood glucose level&#xD;
      than found in non-diabetics. This high level of blood glucose could potentially influence&#xD;
      bone turnover and thereby bone markers. It is, however, still uncertain whether glucose per&#xD;
      se influences the fracture risk of DM patients. Among young healthy individuals, an Oral&#xD;
      Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) reduces the concentration of both resorptive and formative bone&#xD;
      markers. This reduction can be counteracted by the somatostatin analogue, octreotide.&#xD;
      Therefore the effect of glucose on bone markers may be indirect and linked to gut hormone&#xD;
      release. It may also be caused by a direct effect on osteocytes or a change in the chemical&#xD;
      configuration of bone markers, which render them undetectable by standard assays. To examine&#xD;
      this, we have conducted preliminary in vitro trials where glucose was added to serum. This&#xD;
      does not change the level of bone markers and it is therefore unthinkable that glucose per se&#xD;
      affects the assay or causes changed bone marker configuration. The effect of an Intravenous&#xD;
      Glucose Tolerance Test (IVGTT) on bone markers has never been examined. Subcutaneous and&#xD;
      parenteral injection of the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) dose-dependently&#xD;
      reduces resorptive bone markers, while parenteral GLP-2 entails no change in formative bone&#xD;
      markers. This shows that GLP-2 has an uncoupled effect on bone turnover, where resorption is&#xD;
      inhibited, and formation remains the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an association between bone turnover, inflammation and glucose. Chronic inflammation&#xD;
      in patients with inflammatory bowel disease increases bone resorption through an increase in&#xD;
      the Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa beta Ligand/Osteoprotegrin (RANKL/OPG) ratio,&#xD;
      and the same may be the case in DMII. Human endothelial cells augment production of the&#xD;
      inflammatory marker MCP-1 when glucose levels are continuously elevated. RANKL also induces&#xD;
      MCP-1 production in human osteoclasts. An in vitro trial shows, that at blood glucose level&#xD;
      of 24 mM, osteoblasts increases expression of RANKL, production of inflammatory markers,&#xD;
      including MCP-1, and expression of mRNA for the formative bone marker osteocalcin. It has not&#xD;
      yet been examined whether MCP-1 correlates with formative and resorptive bone markers in&#xD;
      vivo. It is therefore still uncertain whether glucose has a direct effect on bone turnover or&#xD;
      an indirect effect via. either GLP-2 or inflammatory processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to examine whether IVGTT reduces bone marker levels in the same&#xD;
      degree as OGTT does. Also, we examine whether the effect of the glucose load is direct or&#xD;
      indirect through either GLP-2 or inflammatory processes reflected by inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will determine whether the effect of glucose on bone markers is direct or&#xD;
      indirect. This knowledge can then be used to explore whether glucose is 'the missing link' in&#xD;
      the present fracture prediction score for DM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project 12 healthy male subjects will undergo both oral glucose tolerance test and&#xD;
      intra venous glucose tolerance test. During the tests bone markers will be measured at&#xD;
      different time intervals and compared to each other. Using these methods it is possible to&#xD;
      distinguish whether glucose acts directly on bone and bone markers or through an intestinal&#xD;
      or inflammatory pathway. Subjects will be recruited from advertising. After signing a consent&#xD;
      form, subjects will fill out a questionaire concerning lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, diet and&#xD;
      exercise), previous fracture and familiar disposition to DM, osteoporosis and thyroid&#xD;
      disease. Bloodpressure, height and weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired t-test and repeated measurement analysis will be used for the statistical analyses, as&#xD;
      well as linear and logistical regression for adjustment for potential confounders.&#xD;

    <description>In this intervention, the participant needs to have two intravenous accesses. In one we infuse an adjustable 20% glucose solution, and try to mimic the glucose profile found in the oral glucose tolerance test. In order to do this, blood glucose is measured every 5 minutes. At baseline and 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours later, blood is collected from another intravenous access, in order to asses primary and secondary outcomes.</description>
