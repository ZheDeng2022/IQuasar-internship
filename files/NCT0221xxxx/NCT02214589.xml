      A. Specific Aims Premature infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)&#xD;
      require up to several hundred procedures during their hospitalization. Many of these are&#xD;
      tissue-damaging procedures (TDPs) known to cause pain [1]. Through funding from NINR, the&#xD;
      investigators found that TDPs not only caused pain but also increased markers of ATP&#xD;
      degradation and oxidative stress[2[. The TDP was tape removal, a commonly performed procedure&#xD;
      in the NICU2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this finding, the investigators sought to determine if interventions that relieve&#xD;
      pain also reduce biochemical markers of ATP degradation and oxidative stress. The&#xD;
      investigators first examined the effect of oral sucrose, a commonly used intervention, when&#xD;
      given before a heel lance. The investigators chose heel lance because it is the most&#xD;
      predominant painful procedure in the NICU, as shown in 29 different clinical trials[3]. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that since oral sucrose is documented to significantly reduce pain&#xD;
      scores, then administration of this analgesic will also decrease markers of ATP degradation&#xD;
      and oxidative stress. However,the investigators observed the opposite effect. Although a&#xD;
      single dose of oral sucrose reduced behavioral markers of pain, it significantly increased&#xD;
      biochemical markers of ATP degradation (hypoxanthine, uric acid) and oxidative stress&#xD;
      (allantoin) over time[4]. More importantly, the effect of oral sucrose on breakdown markers&#xD;
      of ATP were enhanced and were significantly higher in neonates that were intubated or were&#xD;
      receiving more than 30% FiO25. These findings lead to the question: If oral sucrose does not&#xD;
      effectively reduce the biochemical effects of procedural pain, what intervention or groups of&#xD;
      intervention will decrease both behavioral markers of procedural pain and reduce ATP&#xD;
      utilization and oxidative stress in premature neonates? For this RO1 renewal, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to test the individual and additive effects of two commonly used&#xD;
      interventions for procedural pain. These interventions are (a) administration of 30% oral&#xD;
      glucose and non-nutritive sucking (NNS) (b) facilitated tucking and NNS c) administration of&#xD;
      30% oral glucose, facilitated tucking and NNS. Administration of 30% oral glucose was&#xD;
      documented to decreased procedural pain scores[6-9] without the potential adverse effects of&#xD;
      fructose, a key ingredient of sucrose[10-11]. Facilitated tucking is the gentle positioning&#xD;
      of preterm infants with arms and legs in a flexed, midline position close to the body, while&#xD;
      either in a side-lying or prone position[12]. Because tachycardia often accompanies pain, a&#xD;
      documented benefit of facilitated tucking is stabilization of heart rate and reduction of&#xD;
      motor activity (flailing)[12-13]. Non-nutritive sucking refers to the provision of a&#xD;
      weight-appropriate pacifier[14]. The painful procedure will be a clinically required heel&#xD;
      lance, which refers to the puncture of a newborn's heel for blood glucose using a specially&#xD;
      designed lancet. Our general hypothesis is that commonly used clinical interventions known to&#xD;
      reduce procedural pain alter biochemical markers of ATP degradation, oxidative stress and&#xD;
      cell injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 will determine whether (a) 30% oral glucose and NNS or (b) facilitated tucking&#xD;
      and NNS or (c) 30% oral glucose with facilitated tucking and NNS will decrease procedural&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Pain will be quantified using a validated pain scoring tool, the Premature Infant Pain&#xD;
      Profile (PIPP). Individual and additive effect of interventions will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 will determine whether (a) 30% oral glucose and NNS or (b) facilitated tucking&#xD;
      and NNS or (c) 30% oral glucose with facilitated tucking and NNS will decrease biochemical&#xD;
      markers of ATP degradation, oxidative stress and oxidative cell injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Products of ATP breakdown in plasma-hypoxanthine (Hx), xanthine (Xa), and uric acid&#xD;
           (UA)-will be measured using high performance liquid chromatography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxidative stress will be quantified by measuring plasma levels of allantoin using mass&#xD;
           spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cell injury will be quantified by measuring plasma levels of F2 isoprostane using&#xD;
           liquid-chromatography/mass spectrometry.&#xD;
