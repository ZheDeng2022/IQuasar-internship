  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postsurgical pain may effectively be treated with a multimodal approach that incorporates the&#xD;
      use of local anesthetics. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic that has been proven to be&#xD;
      effective at reducing postsurgical pain. Furthermore, this local anesthetic has been shown to&#xD;
      reduce opioid use, improve functional outcomes, allow for early mobilization, and decrease&#xD;
      hospital length of stay. However, local anesthetics, via wound infiltration, are often&#xD;
      short-acting and do not meet the duration of postsurgical pain due to their solubility and&#xD;
      protein-binding properties. ExparelTM is an FDA-approved liposomal formulation of bupivacaine&#xD;
      that allows for 72 hours of postsurgical analgesia with a single injection. This formulation&#xD;
      has been shown to have little to no adverse effects; although some studies have reported&#xD;
      adverse effects with the use of ExaprelTM, most frequently being nausea, vomiting, and&#xD;
      dizziness. The occurrences of these adverse events were still less than the placebo cohort.&#xD;

      All patients undergoing surgical fixation of a lower extremity fracture(s) will be offered&#xD;
      the opportunity to enroll in the study. Patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral surgical&#xD;
      fixation would be included. Written, informed consent to enrollment will be recorded and&#xD;
      included in the patient record. The study is designed around the standard of care for&#xD;
      postsurgical pain management. There are no additional costs to the patient strictly related&#xD;
      to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo surgical fixation of a lower extremity fracture(s) by one of surgical&#xD;
      investigators at a single institution. A sealed, opaque envelope, selected in the&#xD;
      pre-operative holding area, will accompany each patient participant to the operating room.&#xD;
      The envelope will be opened at the conclusion of the fracture fixation to reveal patient&#xD;
      assignment to either study Group 1 or Group 2. Once the total numbers of patients have&#xD;
      completed their procedures and follow-up, the study will close.&#xD;

    <description>The opaque envelope, which was selected by the treating physician, will accompany each of the study participants will be opened and the patient identified as belonging to either Group 1 or Group 2. It is important to note that randomization of the envelopes were computer-generated and placed by a co-investigator; the treating physician is completely unaware of the order of the opaque envelopes. Patients in Group 1 will receive a standardized medication regimen including non-liposomal bupivacaine by soft-tissue injection at the conclusion of their surgical procedure. Those in Group 2 will receive non-liposomal bupivacaine and ExparelTM by soft-tissue injection at the conclusion of their surgical procedure. Study participants will undergo injection in this manner until the conclusion of the study.</description>
