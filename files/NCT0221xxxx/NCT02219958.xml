  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HT) is one of the major cause of morbidity and among the top 10 causes of&#xD;
      deaths in Hong Kong in 2008 (Department of Health 2009). The Hospital Authority (HA) has&#xD;
      initiated service improvement through introducing the risk assessment and management&#xD;
      programme (RAMP) to improve the quality of care (QOC) for HT patients in general outpatient&#xD;
      clinics (GOPC). The evaluation on the QOC is an essential part of the programme in order to&#xD;
      inform future policy. The Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care (FMPC) of the&#xD;
      University of Hong Kong (HKU) has been appointed by the HA to carry out the evaluation of the&#xD;
      QOC of the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Action Learning and Audit Spiral methodologies to measure whether the target standard of&#xD;
      care intended by the RAMP programme is achieved. Each RAMP participating clinic and hospital&#xD;
      will be invited to complete a structured evaluation questionnaire. The data of all patients&#xD;
      who have enrolled into the RAMP for more than one year will be included in the evaluation on&#xD;
      the process and outcomes of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One thousand two hundred and forty-eight age and disease matched control patients who have&#xD;
      not been enrolled into the RAMP programme will be selected for the comparison in the outcomes&#xD;
      of care. A hundred and thirty participants will be followed up by telephone to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of the programme in quality of life (QOL), patient enablement, and global rating of&#xD;
      change in health condition at baseline and 6 months after enrolment. Data on the process of&#xD;
      care will be retrieved from the HA medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are the proportion of participants who have&#xD;
      received the criterion process of care, and achieved the target blood pressure levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics on proportions of centers or subjects meeting the QOC&#xD;
      criteria will be calculated. The changes in the clinical and patient reported outcomes of&#xD;
      RAMP subjects will be compared at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months will be compared by paired sample&#xD;
      t-test. The clinical outcomes between RAMP subjects and control group will be compared by&#xD;
      independent sample t-test or Chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The QOC of the RAMP programme will be determined. Areas of deficiency and possible&#xD;
      areas for quality enhancement will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The results of this study will provide empirical evidence on whether the HA's&#xD;
      RAMP programme can achieve improvement in QOC for HT patients. The information will be used&#xD;
      to guide service planning and policy decision making.&#xD;
