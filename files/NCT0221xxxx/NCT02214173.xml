      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the nutritional supplement rice&#xD;
      bran arabinoxylan compound (RBAC) on metabolic syndrome variables in persons living with HIV.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that there will be a significant improvement in metabolic syndrome and&#xD;
      immune variables in HIV-positive participants in the intervention group compared to the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Rice Bran Arabinoxylan Compound&#xD;
      (RBAC) on metabolic syndrome variables in persons living with HIV (PLWH). This nutritional&#xD;
      supplement is made from a water soluble extract of rice bran that has been partially&#xD;
      hydrolyzed by the action of a natural enzyme complex extracted from Shiitake mushroom. Given&#xD;
      that these micronutrients may be important for regulating the immune system and metabolizing&#xD;
      glucose, the investigators will explore the impact of RBAC on metabolic syndrome (MetSyn)&#xD;
      variables according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment&#xD;
      Panel III guidelines (1) (fasting plasma glucose, waist circumference, high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure), secondarily on additional&#xD;
      atherogenic variables (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, hip&#xD;
      circumference, and body mass index) and immune functioning (CD4+ and CD8+) among 40 HIV+&#xD;
      adult (18+ years of age and over) patients on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART).&#xD;
      Specifically, subjects will participate in a 6-month, two-group, randomized intervention,&#xD;
      where one group (n=20) will take 3 gram/day RBAC and the other group (n=20) will take a&#xD;
      placebo to compare differences in outcomes between the two groups. The results of the study&#xD;
      are intended to address the multi-faceted physiological problems of HIV+ patients by testing&#xD;
      the efficacy of a nutritional supplement intervention on multiple outcomes in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No substantial psychological, medical, or social risks exist to the participants, other than&#xD;
      minor discomfort associated with the venipuncture. Although all measures to protect&#xD;
      confidentiality will be put in place, the possibility exists that electronic data could be&#xD;
      jeopardized. In the remote case that such event occurs, it will be immediately reported to&#xD;
      the Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The components of RBAC should be harmless without significant food allergies. No serious,&#xD;
      untoward side effects have been reported to the company by consumers nor observed during&#xD;
      previous human studies. Potential adverse effects will be explained to each participant when&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained. Whole foods supplements are virtually no different than&#xD;
      consuming food, because of how they are manufactured. The investigators prior study on RBAC&#xD;
      showed no adverse effects. If any side effect does occur, the remedy is to discontinue until&#xD;
      asymptomatic, and then reintroduce at 1/4 dosage, increasing by the same amount every 2 days,&#xD;
      if uneventful, until full dosage is achieved. Study staff will provide additional follow-up&#xD;
      and consultation with any subject who experiences an untoward side effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other potential risks include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Randomization. A potential risk for the placebo group is no improvement in the&#xD;
           investigators outcomes of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data collection. The investigators foresee minimal risks associated with the testing,&#xD;
           other than discomfort or fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A toxicology search for each component reveals no unique toxicity characteristic of the&#xD;
      materials. As reported by Daiwa Health Development, the manufacturer of the product,&#xD;
      thousands of people currently use RBAC (under the trade names BRM4 and PeakImmune 4), and&#xD;
      Daiwa is unaware of significant toxicities. Daiwa applies the latest scientific methods to&#xD;
      ensure the value and safety of their raw materials. Daiwa products are manufactured in&#xD;
      state-of-the-art facilities, under strict quality control and environmental protection&#xD;
      standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will incur no additional appreciable psychological or social risks by&#xD;
      participating in this study, although they may undergo psychological and physical discomfort&#xD;
      sometimes. The process of interviewing during the assessment may cause discomfort. Discomfort&#xD;
      or fatigue may also be experienced in completing the assessment battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatives to this study for these MetSyn and immune functioning variables include&#xD;
      prescription medications, exercise, dietary modification, and other nutritional supplements.&#xD;
      The risks of medications can be very significant, including life-threatening, but the risk of&#xD;
      taking nutritional supplements is not totally understood, since they are not regulated by the&#xD;
      US Food and Drug Administration. Medications and nutritional supplements, as part of a change&#xD;
      in lifestyle behaviors, may also prove to be beneficial for MetSyn variables and immune&#xD;
      system functioning, but their long-term use has unknown consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information obtained in this study will help in determining the efficacy of using RBAC on&#xD;
      MetSyn and metabolic variables and immune system functioning. By participating in the study,&#xD;
      subjects may experience improved health status. The risk of participating in this study is&#xD;
      reasonable because of the potential enhancements in metabolic and immune system functioning&#xD;
      with improved nutritional status.&#xD;
