  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether daily, high-dose administration of&#xD;
      l-glutamine can reduce numbness and tingling caused by a taxane chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      L-glutamine has previously been shown to help reduce the incidence of numbness and tingling&#xD;
      in patients with breast cancer who are receiving taxane chemotherapies. However, no study to&#xD;
      date looks at the effect of l-glutamine given after this numbness and tingling (called&#xD;
      'perihperhal neuropathy') has already occurred. We hypothesize that administration of this&#xD;
      amino acid in l-glutamine naïve patients will result in a measureable reduction of their&#xD;
      taxane-induced neuropathy.&#xD;
