      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to project the incidence of perioperative hypothermia in patients with elective surgery&#xD;
           under general anesthesia in China&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the risk factors associated with perioperative hypothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to explore the patient outcome of hypothermia such as cardiovascular events, wound&#xD;
           infection,hospital stay and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The present study is a cross-sectional study with 30-day follow-up period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This survey was anticipated to enroll 2208 patients with elective surgery under general&#xD;
      anesthesia from 28 hospitals or so in China. After obtaining approval from the Ethical&#xD;
      Committee related to research involving human subjects,the investigators will enroll the&#xD;
      patients according to the inclusion and exclusion criterion. The tympanic temperature will be&#xD;
      monitored at the following time points respectively: Arriving at waiting area, entering the&#xD;
      OR room, 5 min before and after anesthesia induction, every 15 min during the operation,&#xD;
      after 2h the tympanic temperature will be monitored at every 30 min, Tympanic temperature&#xD;
      will also be taken when the surgery complete and when patients arrived at PACU. Other&#xD;
      information will also be collected including the type and dosage of anesthesia drug,duration&#xD;
      of surgery and anesthesia, patient warming method，operation room temperature, the amount of&#xD;
      the infusion of intravenous fluids and blood and their warming techniques during the whole&#xD;
      operation procedure. The postoperative follow-up will be conducted and recorded within 30&#xD;
      days after operation(for implantation surgery, the follow-up will be conducted within 90 days&#xD;
      postoperatively ) which includes ICU stays, hospital stays, wound infection, new&#xD;
      cardiovascular events.etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contract research organization will be delegated to do an on site monitor once a month&#xD;
      (online monitor once a week) for each hospital participate the survey during the recruitment&#xD;
      and perform the source data validation at the same time to review the related medical&#xD;
      records,source data and the case report forms, etc.to ensure the data accuracy and&#xD;
      completeness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management will be conducted through the whole survey procedure. In order to guarantee&#xD;
      the validation of the data, two data managing staffs will input and verify the data&#xD;
      independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis software (SAS9.2) was used for the calculation of all the statistical&#xD;
      analyses. The number of cases, mean, standard deviation, median value, maximal value and&#xD;
      minimal value should be calculated for the descriptions of the qualitative parameters. Number&#xD;
      of cases and percentages are used for the descriptions on the classification parameters.Two&#xD;
      side test is used for all the statistical tests, P&lt;0.05 indicates that the difference is&#xD;
      statistically significant (unless indicated otherwise), and 95% confidence is used as the&#xD;
      confidence interval.&#xD;
