      The purpose of this study is to determine whether new software processing of ultrasound&#xD;
      images can improve detection and size determination of kidney stones.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our research is to improve the ability to see kidney stones with ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging. Specifically, we are testing how well new stone specific processing can find stones&#xD;
      and show their size. Ultimately, better imaging can improve the care of future patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with kidney stones or undergoing surgery for kidney stones will be recruited and&#xD;
      consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will image the kidney and ureter stones of consented subjects. We will place a water-based&#xD;
      gel and ultrasound probe against the subject's skin on the back, sides, and abdomen. We will&#xD;
      save the images and the raw electrical signals received from the probe and used to make the&#xD;
      images. The images will be used to estimate the location and size of kidney stones in the&#xD;
      kidney or ureter. The size and location will also be determined from x-ray and ultrasound&#xD;
      images and reports already in the subject's medical record. And for recruited subjects who&#xD;
      are already undergoing surgery in an existing clinical not research procedure, the surgeon&#xD;
      will also measure location and size of stones seen in surgery. All these measurements of size&#xD;
      and location of kidney stones will be compared to test the accuracy of the new ultrasound&#xD;
      image processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the examination, we will not ask anything more of subjects, but we will collect some&#xD;
      information from their existing medical records. This information includes existing images of&#xD;
      your stones, size of stones, location of stones, number of stones, type of stones, and&#xD;
      treatment records. We will also record your weight, height, race, and ethnicity. Not all this&#xD;
      information may be available. We will use what information is available. This additional&#xD;
      information is used to test how well our ultrasound exam did. It also shows if we do better&#xD;
      with certain groups of patients, for example, for certain stone types or body sizes.&#xD;
