    <textblock>
      Since 1996, HAART based on 3-drug regimens (3DR) in people living with HIV (PLHIV) has&#xD;
      decreased mortality and today, PLHIV have a life expectancy close to that of the general&#xD;
      population. In the last decade new drugs have improved tolerance and posology of these&#xD;
      treatment. However PLHIV needs to continue the treatment and will likely remain on antiviral&#xD;
      therapy for many years. In the recent period, active research is being sought with the aim of&#xD;
      improving the dosage and reducing the amount of drugs necessary to maintain efficacy, to&#xD;
      avoid the possible cumulative effects of long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART). Two-drug&#xD;
      regimens (2DRs) have been investigated as a means for reducing the number of antiretroviral&#xD;
      agents (ARVs) taken by individuals who need lifelong ART. Dovato® (Dolutegravir/lamivudine)&#xD;
      has been evaluated in two phase III studies (GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2) in treatment-naive adults&#xD;
      achieving non inferiority according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Snapshot&#xD;
      algorithm. These data led to the approval of the fixed-dose combination of&#xD;
      dolutegravir/lamivudine as a once-daily, single-tablet 2DR by the FDA and the European&#xD;
      Medicines Agency. Actual update to the US Department of Health and Human Services treatment&#xD;
      guidelines for HIV-1 infection and European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines indicate Dovato&#xD;
      ® as an initial treatment in HIV-naÏve patients. However there is no real- life cohort data.&#xD;
      Our aim is to provide information related to effectiveness and tolerability/safety in naïve&#xD;
      patients when used in routine clinical practice. It has been already published results from&#xD;
      the phase III study in pretreatment adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our results in real life have encouraged us to conduct a multicenter cohort study in patients&#xD;
      who have already started their first antiretroviral therapy with dolutegravir (DTG) +&#xD;
      lamivudine (3TC), to verify efficacy and tolerance in real life. Our hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      data will be similar to those reported in clinical trials.&#xD;

      Our primary objective of this study is to analyze the proportion of individuals (HIV naïve&#xD;
      patients) who has initiated 3TC (300 mg p.o. q 24 h) plus DTG (50 mg p.o. q 24 h), and who&#xD;
      achieve viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA ≤50 copies/mL) at weeks 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are: to analyze the proportion of individuals who achieve viral&#xD;
      suppression (HIV-1 RNA ≤50 copies/mL) at weeks 24 and 96, to describe absolute values and&#xD;
      changes from ART initiation in CD4+ cells count and CD4:CD8 ratio at 24, 48 and 96 weeks,&#xD;
      Changes from ART initiation in creatinine clearance anda fasting lipids at weeks 24, 48 and&#xD;
      96, and the proportion of subjects who discontinue treatment and reasons for discontinuations&#xD;

        This is an open, multicenter and prospective cohort of HIV-infected adult patients who have&#xD;
        initiated Dolutegravir/lamivudine as first line treatment for HIV-1 infection prior to be&#xD;
        included in study. We hope to include 200 patients. Patient management will be according to&#xD;
        the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will collect data related to efficacy, tolerance, and discontinuations due any reasons&#xD;
        (lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, switching,..).&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will carry out an analysis by intention to treat according to the snapshot criteria&#xD;
        defined by the FDA ±12 weeks window in the context of routine clinical practice (±2 weeks&#xD;
        in w-4 analysis), considering as virological failure those patients who discontinue the&#xD;
        treatment for any reason, loss to follow-up, withdraw informed consent or those who die for&#xD;
        causes unrelated to the treatment&#xD;
