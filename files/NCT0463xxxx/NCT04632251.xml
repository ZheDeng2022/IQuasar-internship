  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open label, single-arm study to examine the performance and&#xD;
      safety of the SENSEI® laparoscopic tethered gamma probe in patients undergoing&#xD;
      99mTc-nanocolloid SLNB for prostate cancer (PCa) during RP and ePLND surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for RP and ePLND using the standard treatment pathways at each centre will&#xD;
      have preoperative 99mTc-nanocolloid imaging. RP and ePLND will be conducted as standard of&#xD;
      care, with SLNB guided by the SENSEI® laparoscopic tethered gamma probe carried out after RP&#xD;
      and prior to ePLND. The first 2 patients per site (N = 10 in total) are considered to be&#xD;
      sufficient to enable further familiarisation with the procedure and use of the probe in&#xD;
      addition to the usability work and training that the sites did prior to the start of this&#xD;
      study. Subsequent patients will be evaluable for the PP population. The primary analysis of&#xD;
      diagnostic performance will be performed using the PP population of patients with SLN&#xD;
      identified on preoperative imaging&#xD;
