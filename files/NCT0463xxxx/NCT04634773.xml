  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive disease resulting from the degradation of synovial joint&#xD;
      articular cartilage over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hallmark symptom is diffuse aching and progressive pain made worse with activity. Loss of&#xD;
      range of motion and compromised function inevitably follow. This degenerative disease can&#xD;
      affect the shoulder joint. When symptoms become refractory to conservative treatment such as&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medication, steroid injections, activity modification or physical therapy;&#xD;
      surgery (total or reverse shoulder arthroplasty) may be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Idiopathic shoulder OA is typically characterized by posterior subluxation of the humeral&#xD;
      head upon the glenoid and posterior bone loss. An imbalance in the application of forces&#xD;
      applied to the proximal humerus by the posterior and anterior rotator cuff muscles has been&#xD;
      postulated to be the leading cause of idiopathic shoulder OA. However, there is only&#xD;
      preliminary evidence to support this theory and the etiology of this pattern of deformity is&#xD;
      unknown. The theory the posterior humeral head subluxation is a precursor to OA is only&#xD;
      supported by very low-level evidence and no longitudinal studies have been conducted. As a&#xD;
      result, the cause and natural history of shoulder OA remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research into this area is urgently needed to generate knowledge that will inform future&#xD;
      treatments aimed at modifying and slowing the progression of shoulder OA and to reduce the&#xD;
      need for shoulder replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to develop an understanding of the pathophysiology of shoulder OA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The aim of this project is to develop an understanding of the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      shoulder OA. This project will recruit two groups of 30 participants, (60 participants in&#xD;
      total) and follow them over a period of 5-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1- Participants with posterior subluxation of the humeral head and show early signs of&#xD;
      degeneration in their shoulder 'disease group' Group 2- Participants with posterior&#xD;
      subluxation of the humeral head and show no signs of degeneration 'control/healthy' group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that there are several factors that contribute to&#xD;
      the development of shoulder OA. Uncovering those pathways will lead to more targeted therapy.&#xD;
      (1) The posterior rotator cuff muscles (infraspinatus/teres minor) apply relatively greater&#xD;
      force than the anterior (subscapularis) cuff; an imbalance in the force couple occurs and the&#xD;
      humeral head translates posteriorly on the glenoid; progressive posterior subluxation of the&#xD;
      humeral head occurs and degeneration of the glenoid and humeral head cartilage follow. (2)&#xD;
      Posterior subluxation of the humeral head is associated with progressive cartilage&#xD;
      proteoglycan loss. (3) Pre-morbid glenoid morphology including increased retroversion is&#xD;
      associated with the development of shoulder OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Involvement: The following will be completed with participants: T1Rho Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI), quantitative Computed Tomography (qCT), functional and motion&#xD;
      analysis at baseline, year 2 and year 4 in the 'affected' shoulder in both groups 1 and 2.&#xD;
      These tests will also be conducted on the asymptomatic, contralateral shoulder in Group 1&#xD;
      participants at baseline and year 4. The finite element model validation will be performed in&#xD;
      years 2 and 3, and participant-specific finite element analysis (which has no active&#xD;
      participant involvement) will occur in years 3 to 5. Overall study analysis will occur in&#xD;
      year 5. This project will be done in two-parts. The first part will consist of six&#xD;
      participants; assuming further funding is obtained, part two of the study will proceed. The&#xD;
      second part of the project will be based on successfully obtaining funds to continue the&#xD;
      remainder of the study recruitment (54 participants) and testing. As pilot data is urgently&#xD;
      needed to secure granting funds to support this overall project, the investigators will&#xD;
      commence with recruiting the first 6 participants. Once further funds are secured, the&#xD;
      remaining portion (recruitment of 54 participants) of the project will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: (1) Determine whether patients with posterior humeral head subluxation have an&#xD;
      imbalance between the posterior and anterior rotator cuff muscles. Objective 1 will be&#xD;
      assessed through T1Rho MRI, and functional testing/motion analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) Determine whether patients with static posterior subluxation of the humeral head are at&#xD;
      risk of degenerative changes (i.e. proteoglycan loss). Objective 2 will be assessed through&#xD;
      T1Rho MRI and qCT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) Determine which joint factors are associated with progression of OA. This will be&#xD;
      assessed using qCT scans and finite element model analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relevance: The cause is shoulder OA is unknown, and the burden and costs associated&#xD;
      with this degenerative disease are increasing with our aging population. Research in this&#xD;
      area is urgently needed to generate knowledge which will inform future treatments which may&#xD;
      modify and slow the progression of shoulder OA, and to reduce the need for shoulder&#xD;
      replacement therapy.&#xD;
