      A pilot randomized control trial will be conducted attaching to the MedPAC services to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a Motivational Interviewing (BMI) interaction&#xD;
      via instant messaging apps on reducing the drug abuse among youth in Hong Kong.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth who persistently abuse substances often experience an array of problems, including&#xD;
      academic difficulties, health-related problems (including mental health), poor peer&#xD;
      relationships, and involvement with the juvenile justice system. Additionally, there are&#xD;
      consequences for family members, the community, and the entire society. Although many youths&#xD;
      engage in risky, experimental drug use without developing later life addiction, the early age&#xD;
      of first drug use is strongly associated with risk for developing a substance use disorder&#xD;
      later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Central Registry of Drug Abuse Sixty-seventh Report in 2018, the total&#xD;
      number of reported drug abusers in Hong Kong has been decreasing in last decade, however,&#xD;
      about 40% of them were aged 25 or below. Reported by 2017/18 Survey of Drug Use among&#xD;
      Students, the number of students claiming to have used drugs has gone up by 23 per cent&#xD;
      compared to the last survey. Combining with the two reports, there were lifetime drug-taking&#xD;
      17800 students, while only 471 drug-users aged under 21 were reported. In addition, the 2017&#xD;
      figures revealed that 58% of the abusers took drugs at home/friend's home only, which had&#xD;
      increased substantially from 43% in 2008. The statistics above alarm that the drug abuse and&#xD;
      the hidden nature of drug-taking among the youth aged 25 or below which cannot be overlooked&#xD;
      or undervalued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychological and social factors associated with the initiation and continuation of drug&#xD;
      abuse are different for the youth and adult. Previous research has confirmed that the&#xD;
      recovery from drug abuse is influenced by the users' intention to change, which is determined&#xD;
      directly by their perceptions of anti-drug and their perceived self-efficacy to change.&#xD;
      While, drug-abusers' attitude, social influences, and demographic characteristics have more&#xD;
      indirect effects on recovery from drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the youth drug-abusers reported that the major reasons to take drugs for the first&#xD;
      time are &quot;curiosity&quot; and &quot;to seek excitement&quot;, which indicated an insufficient anti-drug&#xD;
      awareness among the high-risk population. While except for the conform bringing by&#xD;
      drug-abusing, social and psychological factors, such as peer identification, depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, stress was reported as major reasons for youth to continue using drugs. It prompts&#xD;
      us individualized interventions that clearly communicated information about the risks of drug&#xD;
      abuse should be designed for the youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Government has organized several drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation programme. However,&#xD;
      as shown in the report, about 88% of youth drug-abusers had never sought others' help. Except&#xD;
      for the feeling that drug giving, absence of problem lead to that they mostly did not&#xD;
      consider themselves addicted, which was the major reason for the youth having no awareness to&#xD;
      seek for others' help. In addition, consideration about the stigma, fear of not knowing what&#xD;
      to expect from the treatment and the whole lifestyle change, and worries about withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms were the main barriers to keep the youth from seeking drug abuse treatment. To bring&#xD;
      the usage of drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation programme into full play, these barriers&#xD;
      should be resolved for drug-abusing youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the reasons above, specifically promoting and supporting service should be&#xD;
      developed to increase the anti-drug awareness of the youth, enhancing help-seeking&#xD;
      consciousness, and promote treatment and rehabilitation for youth drug-abusers or those&#xD;
      exposed to drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone counselling is effective in promoting addiction behaviour, both in Hong Kong and&#xD;
      overseas. As reported in a previous study, the clients prefer to use online counselling as it&#xD;
      was less confronting than traditional forms of counselling by providing a private and&#xD;
      emotionally safe environment. Therefore, the telephone format encourages those who are&#xD;
      reluctant to get help face-to-face to seek direct anti-drug advice. In addition, the&#xD;
      telephone method is proven to be more effective than other health promotion intervention such&#xD;
      as mass media as it allows the counsellor to directly interact with the caller, thus&#xD;
      addressing the problem at the right moment. Comparing with face-to-face counselling, analyses&#xD;
      have consistently reported that telephone counselling allows a large segment of drug-abusers&#xD;
      to be reached at a minimal cost. Hence, the use of telephone counselling in helping&#xD;
      drug-abusing youth cannot be ignored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparing with general counsellors, there are several advantages using peer as counsellors.&#xD;
      There is evidence supporting that the use of peer counsellors can increase the appeal of&#xD;
      addiction services to youth users. Since most youths are not eligible to hold positions of&#xD;
      power in their society, they find themselves, subject to authority. Such a power differential&#xD;
      makes communication between adult and youth difficult. When one is trying to engage the youth&#xD;
      in drug abuse prevention initiatives, this power differential manifests itself also as a&#xD;
      knowledge gap. The adults' command over jargon and the &quot;science&quot; of drug addiction often acts&#xD;
      as a deterrent for the youth who may otherwise willingly engage in debate. Comparing with&#xD;
      adults, the equality in power status between the youth makes peer-based risk communication&#xD;
      successful. With similar age, peers can address concerns relevant to their experience, which&#xD;
      help the high-risk youth to aware of the problem of drug abuse. Explanation and consideration&#xD;
      from peers could be more effective in helping drug-abusing youth to eliminate or reduce the&#xD;
      fear of unknown to expect from the treatment and the whole lifestyle change, and worries&#xD;
      about withdrawal symptoms. Hence, they could be more willing to attempt to seek further help&#xD;
      and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, a thorough understanding of drug-abusing youth, especially the psychological and&#xD;
      social factors that cause them to initiation and continuation of drug abuse, is necessary to&#xD;
      design individualized interventions to these drug-abusers. The trained peer counsellors&#xD;
      provided individualized advice to the drug-abusing youth to improve their self-efficacy to&#xD;
      resist the urge to drug and control over their own behaviour. Peers can better understand the&#xD;
      problems that people their age faced such as peer pressure, conflict with parents and&#xD;
      teachers and girl-boy relationships. The empathy on the social and psychological problem&#xD;
      between the youth could be a good approach for drug-abusing youth to pour out their&#xD;
      pressures, which is associated with the prevention of relapse. As stated above, peer&#xD;
      counselling could be a potential method in increasing awareness of drug abuse, promoting&#xD;
      help-seeking and preventing relapse of drug abuse among the drug-abusing youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the collaborator of this project, the Society for the Aid and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation of Drug Abusers (SARDA) found in 1961, has rich experience in addiction&#xD;
      counselling and drug treatment and rehabilitation. SARDA has seven affiliated treatment and&#xD;
      rehabilitation centres and one clinic, which can accept the referral cases who need further&#xD;
      treatment and rehabilitation service. The medical doctors in the clinic have sound knowledge&#xD;
      of the drug abused, counselling skills, and can handle patients with drug overdose or drug&#xD;
      abuse. In addition, medical doctors, experienced counsellors in SARDA will be invited to give&#xD;
      lectures in a training programme held for the student counsellors.&#xD;
