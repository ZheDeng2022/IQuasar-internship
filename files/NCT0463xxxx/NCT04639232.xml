  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of the consumption of a combination of&#xD;
      probiotic strains (Prob-milk) and of a combination of plant extracts plus an inactivated&#xD;
      probiotic strain (VoluntasProb) on the production volume and the nutritional composition and&#xD;
      the microbiota. of breast milk in lactating women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown the galactogogue effect of fenugreek, fennel, and milk thistle.&#xD;
      However, to date no study has considered the evaluation of all three extracts. Additionally,&#xD;
      certain probiotic strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium also appear to increase milk&#xD;
      production in animal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of the consumption of a combination of&#xD;
      probiotic strains (Prob-milk) and of a combination of plant extracts plus an inactivated&#xD;
      probiotic strain (VoluntasProb) on the production volume and the nutritional composition and&#xD;
      the microbiota. of breast milk in lactating women. This is a preliminary study whose purpose&#xD;
      is to gather information for future studies.&#xD;
