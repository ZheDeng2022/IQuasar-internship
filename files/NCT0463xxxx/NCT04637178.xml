      The overall objective of the study is to identify molecular determinants of the efficacy of&#xD;
      resistance training for improving endruance performance in elite cyclists&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For elite endurance athletes, the addition of resistance training to habitual endurance&#xD;
      training routines generally leads to improved endurance performance. However, this is not&#xD;
      always the case, with several individuals failing to respond in the expected manner. This&#xD;
      inter-individual variation is likely associated with inherent cellular and molecular&#xD;
      charateristics of skeletal muscle. Indeed, responses to resistance training seem to be&#xD;
      associated with muscle biological characteristics such as muscle fiber composition and&#xD;
      ribosomal content (during the early phase of resistance training).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate the association between muscle fibre composition (type I vs type&#xD;
      II muscle fiber proportions) / ribosomal content in m. vastus lateralis and the effects of 10&#xD;
      weeks of resistance training on endurance performance in 52 elite cyclists. Half the&#xD;
      participants will perform resistance training in addition to their habitual endurance&#xD;
      training routines, the other half will perform endurance training-only. Muscle biopsies will&#xD;
      be sampled from m. vastus lateralis before and after the first two weeks of the intervention.&#xD;
      For muscle fiber composition, the hypothesis is that larger proportions of type II fibers&#xD;
      will be associated with more pronounced benefits of resistance training. For ribosomal&#xD;
      content, the hypothesis is that higher rRNA content at baseline and larger increases in rRNA&#xD;
      content during the initial part of the intervention will be associated with more pronounced&#xD;
      benefits of resistance training. No changes are expected in the non-resistance training&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
