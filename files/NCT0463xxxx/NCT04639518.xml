    <textblock>
      This is an open-label trial consisting of two sub-studies to be conducted sequentially with&#xD;
      the purpose of evaluating the safety and suitability of a two feeding systems in pre-term&#xD;
      infants (one containing HMOs and one without HMOs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label trial to be conducted in up to 70 pre-term infants in&#xD;
      order to evaluate the safety and suitability of two feeding systems as they would typically&#xD;
      be used in the neonatal care unit. Growth (in comparison to recommended growth goals),&#xD;
      feeding tolerance, biochemical parameters, and adverse event reporting will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two feeding systems will be tested in two sub-studies to be conducted sequentially:&#xD;
      sub-study 1 will evaluate a two-staged feeding system with HMOs in up to 35 pre-term infants;&#xD;
      sub-study 2 will evaluate a two-staged feeding system without HMOs in up to 35 pre-term&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
