  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 project aims to enhance and test a mobile health intervention designed to&#xD;
      increase adherence to the daily PrEP pill among culturally-diverse young adult men who have&#xD;
      sex with men. The intervention will include: a) personalized PrEP pill reminders b)&#xD;
      culturally- and developmentally-sensitive text messages targeting patient education,&#xD;
      motivation, and stress c) a gamification avatar and d) a linked online community of peers.&#xD;
      Effectively promoting PrEP adherence would reduce new HIV infections in this at-risk&#xD;
      population, which is subject to health disparities&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project is to develop and test the effectiveness of an individually-tailored,&#xD;
      developmentally- and culturally-sensitive, mobile health (mhealth) PrEP adherence&#xD;
      intervention called DOT. The intervention will target culturally-diverse, young adult men,&#xD;
      ages 18-35, who have sex with men (YMSM). The recent rise in HIV infection among young&#xD;
      people, particularly minority YMSM, points to the value of PrEP uptake and adherence support&#xD;
      for YMSM. In PrEP efficacy trials, younger age was the most consistent correlate with low&#xD;
      PrEP adherence. Our DOT mhealth intervention reflects a developmental understanding of young&#xD;
      adult decision-making, and is uniquely combined with principles from social cognitive theory,&#xD;
      positive psychology and behavioral economics. The proposed project is based on Dr. Weitzman's&#xD;
      successful Phase 1 trial of DOT, which led to significant improvements in PrEP adherence,&#xD;
      PrEP treatment self-efficacy, and intention to follow PrEP treatment guidelines among the&#xD;
      YMSM that used DOT for six weeks. Our proposed Phase 2 DOT mhealth intervention is directly&#xD;
      responsive to Phase 1 findings by adding: 1) texts targeting motivation, patient education,&#xD;
      and stress burden 2) online community for social support 3) linkage to the federal crisis&#xD;
      text line 4) virtual avatar 5) cloud-based platform to view user engagement 7) calendar for&#xD;
      clinic appointments and pharmacy refills 8) enhanced personalization of pill reminders and 9)&#xD;
      enhanced adherence graphing. In Phase 2, we will test the effectiveness of DOT at improving&#xD;
      PrEP adherence in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
