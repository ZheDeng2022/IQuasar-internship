    <textblock>
      The Pedra perfusion system measures microvascular flow through diffuse speckle contrast&#xD;
      analysis. It will be used to assess changes in perfusion in response to a number of&#xD;
      physiological stimuli. It will be compared to other standard diagnostics including&#xD;
      ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index and transcutaneous oxygen measurement. Measurements&#xD;
      will be undertaken in non-vascular patients as well as those with chronic limb threatening&#xD;
      ischaemia.&#xD;
