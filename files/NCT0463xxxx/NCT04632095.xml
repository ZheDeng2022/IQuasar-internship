      Prospective randomized study comparing aortic valve replacement using parasternal or&#xD;
      sternotomy access with regard to quality of life and systemic inflammatory reaction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The classic surgical treatment of aortic stenosis is valve replacement through complete&#xD;
      midline opening of the breastbone (median sternotomy) and use of cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      (CPB). Risks of this procedure are related to both the surgical approach and the use of CPB.&#xD;
      Using minimally invasive approaches in non-cardiac patients (e.g laparoscopy) resulted in&#xD;
      reduced postoperative inflammatory response when compared to patients undergoing the same&#xD;
      procedures carried out with a conventional &quot;open&quot; technique. Minimally invasive surgical&#xD;
      approaches in which the sternum is partially opened (partial sternotomy) or not opened at all&#xD;
      (parasternal access) have thus far shown similar procedure related mortality and lower&#xD;
      incidence of perioperative complications, despite longer CPB times. Our single center&#xD;
      experience thus far suggests superiority of parasternal aortic valve replacement (O/E ratio&#xD;
      of 0.19 over the last 2 years), as well as a reduced postoperative inflammatory response (as&#xD;
      measured by lower CRP (C reactive protein ) levels taken 6 hours post-surgery). However,&#xD;
      these data have several confounders and there is currently no prospective randomized trial&#xD;
      addressing this topic. We therefore conduct a randomized comparison of parasternal versus&#xD;
      classic sternotomy aortic valve replacement. Based on our previous experience, we expect very&#xD;
      low mortality risk in both groups (expected ≤ 1%). The primary endpoint is therefore quality&#xD;
      of life assessed using the SF-36 (Short Form) health survey questionnaire. This approach is&#xD;
      similar to other current large multicenter trials. In order to address the impact of reduced&#xD;
      surgical trauma on inflammatory response; we will quantify an established panel of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers (PCT, CRP, interleukin 6) and use bio-banking to allow for further in&#xD;
      depth analysis later on. Standardized clinical endpoints will be analyzed as additional&#xD;
      secondary parameters. Power analysis determined a number of 50 patients allocated to 2 equal&#xD;
      groups to achieve a power of 80%. The parasternal approach is expected to be superior when&#xD;
      compared to sternotomy in both the primary and some, if not most, secondary endpoints. We&#xD;
      expect our study to become an important milestone for decision-making in the treatment of&#xD;
      aortic stenosis. Patients currently fear sternotomy, but the less invasive transcatheter&#xD;
      valve implantation appears to be limited by inferior long-term outcome. The parasternal,&#xD;
      sternotomy-sparing, classic aortic valve replacement is therefore an attractive therapeutic&#xD;
      alternative. Our investigation in relation to systemic inflammatory response will further&#xD;
      shed light on the underlying mechanisms explaining differences in clinical outcomes.&#xD;
