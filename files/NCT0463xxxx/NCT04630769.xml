  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center Phase I clinical trial of FT516 administered intraperitoneally (IP)&#xD;
      once a week for 3 consecutive weeks for the treatment of recurrent gynecologic cancers. As&#xD;
      this is an early 1st in human study and the 1st intraperitoneal infusion of FT516, the safety&#xD;
      of FT516 is confirmed prior to adding enoblituzumab as an intravenous infusion approximately&#xD;
      1 week prior to the 1st dose of FT516 and every 3 weeks beginning on Day 22 (1 week after the&#xD;
      last dose of FT516). Each dose of FT516 is followed directly by an IP infusion of&#xD;
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) to facilitate natural killer (NK) cell survival. A short course of&#xD;
      outpatient lymphodepletion chemotherapy is given prior to the 1st dose of FT516.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FT516 is an off the shelf product comprised of allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells,&#xD;
      expressing high-affinity non-cleavable CD16 (FT516). Enoblituzumab is an Fc-optimized&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that targets B7-H3 which is highly expressed on ovarian cancer. Based on&#xD;
      data showing that within the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment surface expression of&#xD;
      CD16a on NK cells is diminished, the researchers hypothesize that the FT516 cellular product&#xD;
      containing a non-cleavable CD16 will bypass the low CD16 expression issue and maximize NK&#xD;
      cell cytotoxicity. Enoblituzumab is an Fc optimized humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that&#xD;
      binds to B7-H3 (CD276). B7-H3 is an inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule that is widely&#xD;
      expressed by a number of different tumor types and may play a key role in regulating the&#xD;
      immune response. It is therefore hypothesized that the combination of FT516 with&#xD;
      enoblituzumab will maximize NK cell cytotoxicity in patients with ovarian cancer.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is conducted in two consecutive stages with 5 cohorts. A minimum of 28 days must separate each cohort. Within a 3 patient cohort, a minimum of 14 days must separate the first and second patient. Stage 1 Step 1 uses a fast-track design (1 patient per cohort) with a minimum of 28 days between each patient until one of the following: a) 1st occurrence of a pre-defined adverse event at which point the study moves to Step 2. The cohort size increases from 1 to 3 patients with 2 additional patients added. Escalation in Step 2 continues until the 1st DLT at which point Stage 2 continual reassessment method (CRM) is activated. If Cohort 5 is completed with 10 patients enrolled at the MTD without a DLT, Stage 2 (CRM) is not used. b) The 1st occurrence of a DLT the study moves directly to Stage 2 (CRM) and Step 2 is not used. c) Cohort 5 is completed without a pre-defined AE or a DLT - neither Step 2 nor Stage 2 is used if a total of 10 patients are enrolled in Cohort 5.</intervention_model_description>
