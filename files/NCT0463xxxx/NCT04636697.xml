  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2/3 study is a multi-portion design to confirm that the chosen formulation and&#xD;
      dosing regimen of CoVLP has an acceptable immunogenicity and safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 3 portion is an event-driven, randomized, observer blinded, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      design that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the CoVLP formulation compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for safety and immunogenicity for a period of 12 months after the&#xD;
      last vaccination.&#xD;

             the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At the Screening visit (Visit 1), male and female subjects must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Study Populations #1: 18 to 64 (has not yet had his/her 65th birthday) years of&#xD;
                  age, inclusive;&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Study Population #3: 18 years of age or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At Screening (Visit 1) and Vaccination (Visit 2), subject must have a body mass index&#xD;
             (BMI) of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Study Populations #1 and #2: ≥ 18.5 and &lt; 30 kg/m2;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects are considered by the Investigator to be reliable and likely to cooperate&#xD;
             with the assessment procedures and be available for the duration of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Study Population #1: Subjects must be in good general health prior to study&#xD;
             participation, with no clinically relevant abnormalities that could jeopardize subject&#xD;
             safety or interfere with study assessments, as determined by medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, and vital signs. Investigator discretion will be permitted with this&#xD;
             inclusion criterion;&#xD;
&#xD;
             All regions except Canada: Note: Subjects with a pre-existing chronic disease will be&#xD;
             allowed to participate if the disease is stable and, according to the Investigator's&#xD;

             confound the results of the study or pose additional risk to the subject by&#xD;
             participating in the study. Stable disease is generally defined as no new onset or&#xD;
             exacerbation of pre-existing chronic disease three months prior to vaccination. Based&#xD;
             on the Investigator's judgment, a subject with more recent stabilization of a disease&#xD;

                  bilateral oophorectomy performed more than one month prior to the first study&#xD;
                  vaccination); or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post-menopausal (absence of menses for 12 consecutive months and age consistent&#xD;

             agree to continue employing highly effective birth control measures for at least one&#xD;
             month after the last study vaccination (or in the case of early termination, she must&#xD;
             not plan to become pregnant for at least one month after her last study vaccination).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Injectable;&#xD;
&#xD;

                  subjects who are ovulating should be asked what method(s) they would use should&#xD;
                  their circumstances change, and subjects without a well-defined plan should be&#xD;
                  excluded;&#xD;

             and have no acute or evolving medical problems prior to study participation and no&#xD;
             clinically relevant abnormalities that could jeopardize subject safety or interfere&#xD;
             with study assessments, as assessed by the Principal Investigator or sub-Investigator&#xD;
             (thereafter referred as Investigator) and determined by medical history, physical&#xD;

&#xD;
             All regions except Canada: Note: Subjects with a pre-existing chronic disease will be&#xD;

             participating in the study. Stable disease is generally defined as no new onset or&#xD;
             exacerbation of pre-existing chronic disease three months prior to vaccination. Based&#xD;
             on the Investigator's judgment and documented in source documentation, a subject with&#xD;
             more recent stabilization of a disease could also be eligible;&#xD;
&#xD;

             pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, or be&#xD;
             immunocompromised persons (e.g., treatment-controlled HIV infection, organ transplant&#xD;
