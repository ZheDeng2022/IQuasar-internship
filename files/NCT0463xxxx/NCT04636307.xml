    <textblock>
      The progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) varies between different patients, even with&#xD;
      similar metabolic control. It is becoming clear that a sizeable proportion of patients with&#xD;
      mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) will take a long time to develop any&#xD;
      sight-threatening complication. The inclusion of eyes/patients in a clinical trial that do&#xD;
      not show any significant worsening during the period of the trial masks any beneficial effect&#xD;
      of the drug being tested and consequently would increase trial sizes as the true therapeutic&#xD;
      effect in high-risk patients would be partially obscured. It appears that the only option is&#xD;
      to identify the eyes/patients that show progression of retinopathy during a pre-trial run-in&#xD;
      period and only include such patients. Characterization of progressors in the early stages of&#xD;
      DR and identification of biomarkers of disease progression are of major interest to&#xD;
      facilitate drug development in this area of high unmet need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different phenotypes of mild NPDR progression with different risks for development of&#xD;
      Clinically Significant Macular Edema (CSME) were identified using cluster analysis based on&#xD;
      the turnover rate of microaneurysms (MAT) and the central retinal thickness (CRT). Phenotype&#xD;
      A, patients with low MAT and CRT &lt; 260 micron in women and &lt; 275 micron in men (on Cirrus&#xD;
      Optical Coherence Tomography - OCT, corresponding to the mean CRT in healthy subjects plus 1&#xD;
      standard deviation, SD); Phenotype B, patients with low MAT and CRT ≥ 260 micron in women and&#xD;
      ≥ 275 micron in men; and Phenotype C patients with high MAT. These phenotypes were recently&#xD;
      confirmed in a larger population of NPDR patients. In this study, Phenotype B shows a risk&#xD;
      for DR progression to Macular Edema (ME) of OR=13.30 and Phenotype C of OR=6.32. When CRT&#xD;
      increase is present, then Phenotype C shows a higher risk for ME (OR=29.02). In these&#xD;
      studies, the occurrence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) as an outcome was rare&#xD;
      and did not allow statistical analysis. More recently it was shown that phenotype C&#xD;
      identifies eyes at higher risk for development of CSME and PDR, whereas phenotype A&#xD;
      identifies eyes at very low risk for vision-threatening complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with phenotypes B and C are, therefore, the NPDR patients with higher risk for ME&#xD;
      development and are those patients who may benefit from early therapeutic or preventive&#xD;
      treatment. Therefore, a proper characterization of this population is of major interest for&#xD;
      the understanding of the disease, and to the design of new therapeutical approaches that can&#xD;
      facilitate adequate and timely interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better characterize these patients, new non-invasive methods are now available that allow&#xD;
      for a better insight of the retinal changes that occurs in these patients. The Optical&#xD;
      Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT-A) and OCT-Leakage (OCT-L) are two of these methods&#xD;
      that can be used in longitudinal studies. These methods allow to quantify capillary closure&#xD;
      and leakage, the main alterations occurring in DR (ischemia and leakage) and which are&#xD;
      considered to predict sight-threatening complications, ME and PDR. In recent studies it was&#xD;
      shown that the vessel density in the superficial and deep layers, obtained with OCT-A, and&#xD;
      the Low Optical Reflectivity (LOR) ratio obtained with OCT-L are altered even in the earlier&#xD;
      stages of DR. These two methods are therefore expected to better characterize leaky and&#xD;
      ischemic patients' phenotypes (i.e., phenotypes B and C, respectively), being therefore a&#xD;
      major step in early diagnosis and timely treatment of DR patients. Measurement of&#xD;
      neurodegeneration (ND) represented by thinning of Ganglion Cell Layer (GCL) and Inner&#xD;
      Plexiform Layer (IPL) will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to better characterize the retinal changes that occur during a 2-years&#xD;
      follow-up period in patients with diabetes Type 2 and with the initial stages of NPDR and at&#xD;
      higher risk for sight-threatening complications, allowing better characterization of eyes at&#xD;
      risk of progression (phenotypes B and C). The inclusion will be based on patients with&#xD;
      established retinopathy ETDRS 35, 43, 47 and 53, distributed to the different clinical sites&#xD;
      in the study, creating the opportunity to demonstrate the progression phenotypes.&#xD;
