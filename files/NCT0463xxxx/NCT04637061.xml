    <textblock>
      Anastomotic failure (AF), including anastomotic leakage (AL), increases morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality after colorectal cancer (CRC) resection. An inadequate perfusion of the anastomosis&#xD;
      or technical stapling defects may contribute to AF. Several studies evaluated the singular&#xD;
      use of intraoperative near infrared (NIR) indocyanine green (ICG)-induced fluorescence&#xD;
      angiography (FA) and air leak testing to assess the integrity and the perfusion levels of the&#xD;
      colorectal anastomosis. So far, a combined use of these methodologies, although acknowledged&#xD;
      has not yet been tested as an indicator of postoperative AF or of intra-operative anastomotic&#xD;
      repair in a prospective setting. This study aims to implement the intraoperative anastomotic&#xD;
      assessment in a prospective series of patients undergoing rectal resection plus primary&#xD;
      anastomosis for rectal cancer with or without ostomy, using a semi-quantitative check of 4&#xD;
      items (4-check). The procedure will include NIR-ICG-induced FA (to assess perfusion), air&#xD;
      leak test and evaluation of the anastomotic donuts (to assess for the presence of technical&#xD;
      defects). Included patients will be those scheduled for elective rectal resection with total&#xD;
      or partial mesorectal excision and primary colo-rectal anastomosis with/or without protective&#xD;
      ostomy. Primary outcomes will be the overall incidence of intra-operative anastomotic repair&#xD;
      and the rate of post-operative AF. Secondary outcomes will be the overall incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events and serious complications, the estimation of costs and resources, the&#xD;
      operative time, hospitalization and post-operative measurement of inflammatory markers.&#xD;

      All consecutive patients undergoing rectal resection (open and mini-invasive procedures) plus&#xD;
      primary anastomosis for rectal cancer selected for the study will udergo a surgical&#xD;
      intra-operative assessment of the anastomosis based on the check of the following 4 items&#xD;
      (4-check):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Extra-luminal (serosa) evaluation of the proximal colon and distal rectal stump&#xD;
           perfusion based on a semi-quantitative assessment of the near infrared (NIR) indocyanine&#xD;
           green (ICG)-induced fluorescence angiography (FA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endo-luminal (mucosal) evaluation of the proximal colon and distal rectal stump&#xD;
           perfusion based on a semi-quantitative assessment of the NIR-ICG-induced FA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Air leak test (extra-luminal and reverse).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of the anastomotic donuts. aiming to test the efficacy of the procedure&#xD;
           (overall incidence of intra-operative anastomosis repairs) and the overall incidence of&#xD;
           anastomotic failure&#xD;

        Selected patients will receive oral bowel preparation as for colonoscopy, 2 days before&#xD;
        surgery and managed with ERAS protocol. Patients should be treated with rectal resection&#xD;
        with TME or PME and mechanical anastomosis with a circular stapler, using one of the&#xD;
        following approaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Laparoscopic surgery (operations performed through small incisions and ports&#xD;
             placements independently from the type and length of incision for specimen&#xD;
             extraction).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Robot-assisted surgery (using robotic systems to aid in surgical procedures&#xD;
             independently from the type and length of incision for specimen extraction).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. TaTME. Mini-invasive bottom up approach for mesorectal dissection and colorectal&#xD;
             anastomosis using a single/double team, independently from the type and length of&#xD;
             incision for specimen extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following procedures is required during surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Routine splenic flexure mobilization.&#xD;
