      This multi-modal methods study will investigate neurophysiological, endocrinological,&#xD;
      cognitive, psycho-social-emotional markers of disease, and targets for integrative health&#xD;
      treatments in mood disorders.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 16.2 million adults in the USA suffer at least one depressive episode&#xD;
      any given year. Mood disorders are associated with decreased quality of life, attention,&#xD;
      memory, and executive function deficits, and increased health care cost. Despite successful&#xD;
      medication and psychotherapies, mood disorders rarely respond completely to common treatment&#xD;
      options. MBI's offer a low-cost, non-pharmacological alternative with accruing efficacy.&#xD;
      Developing robust and specific non-pharmacologic intervention programs, on par with&#xD;
      pharmacological clinical outcomes without harmful side-effects is a crucial unmet clinical&#xD;
      need and a research priority for the NCCIH. Understanding the mechanistic pathways of these&#xD;
      interventions is key to their clinical development and implementation for treating depression&#xD;
      in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) show similar clinical efficacy for mood disorders as&#xD;
      pharmacology, and co-morbid symptoms of depression and anxiety. There is substantial&#xD;
      consistent and replicated empirical evidence across multiple clinical sites highlighting the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of MBI in decreasing risk of depressive relapse ascertained from randomized&#xD;
      RCTs comparing MBI with treatment as usual. Meta-analysis including 183 patients with&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis showed efficacy in psychosocial outcomes, quality of life, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and select physical symptoms including fatigue, pain, and vestibular symptoms.&#xD;
      The clinical efficacy of MBIs appears to extend mood disorders, as a systematic review&#xD;
      including 13 studies in fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and irritable bowel syndrome showed&#xD;
      significant effect sizes, reported as standardized mean difference (SMD), compared to control&#xD;
      conditions in reducing depression (SMD= -.23), anxiety (SMD= -.20), symptom severity (SMD=&#xD;
      -.40), and pain (SMD= -.21). Cognitively, MBIs appear to enhance executive control and&#xD;
      self-regulatory processing, that has a beneficial effect upon emotion regulation, pain&#xD;
      perception, and has shown to reduce rumination in depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This overarching study aims to identify key phenotypic markers and treatment targets of mood&#xD;
      disorders, and further understand MBI mechanism in its treatment.&#xD;
