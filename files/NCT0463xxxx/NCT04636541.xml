  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment is experienced by approximately 30% of patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD-MCI), often affecting executive functions. There is currently no pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment available for PD-MCI and non-pharmacological treatments are still scarce. The aim&#xD;
      of this study was to test preliminary efficacy/effectiveness of two home-based cognitive&#xD;
      interventions adapted for patients with PD-MCI: Goal Management Training, adapted for PD-MCI&#xD;
      (Adapted-GMT), and a psychoeducation program combined with mindfulness exercises. Twelve&#xD;
      persons with PD-MCI with executive dysfunctions, as measured by extensive neuropsychological&#xD;
      evaluation, were randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups. Both groups received&#xD;
      five sessions each lasting 60-90 minutes for five weeks, in presence of the caregiver.&#xD;
      Measures were collected at baseline, mid-point, at one-week, four-week and 12-week&#xD;
      follow-ups. Primary outcomes were executive functions assessed by subjective (DEX&#xD;
      questionnaire patient- and caregiver-rated) and objective (Zoo Map Test) measures. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes included quality of life (PDQ-39), global cognition (DRS-II), and neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms (NPI-12). Safety data (fatigue, medication change and compliance) were also&#xD;
      recorded. Repeated measures ANCOVAs were applied to outcomes. Both groups significantly&#xD;
      ameliorated executive functions overtime as indicated by improvements in DEX-patient and&#xD;
      DEX-caregiver scores. PDQ-39 scores decreased at the four-week follow-up in the&#xD;
      Psychoeducation/Mindfulness group whereas they were maintained in the Adapted-GMT group. All&#xD;
      other measures were maintained over time in both groups. Adapted-GMT and&#xD;
      Psychoeducation/Mindfulness groups both improved executive functioning. This is one of the&#xD;
      first studies to test home-based approaches, tailored to the participant's cognitive needs,&#xD;
      and involving caregivers.&#xD;

    <description>GMT modules were adapted for French-speaking patients with PD-MCI. Each session was reduced from nine 90-120-minute sessions (original GMT) to five 60-90-minute sessions, one session per week, in order to avoid fatigue. As for original GMT, participants were given exercises between sessions (mindfulness exercises and metacognitive reflections). In original-GMT, some information is repeated several times, but not in Adapted-GMT. Exercises demanding motor dexterity, such as card distribution, were removed. Adapted-GMT included information on PD-MCI and executive dysfunction (some psychoeducation). In addition, Adapted-GMT modules were administered individually with an iPad, as opposed to a power-point group presentation in original-GMT. A workbook was handed to participants, as in previous studies.</description>

    <description>Five modules were designed as a discussion with patients and caregivers about various PD symptoms: module I-brain and motor symptoms; module II-autonomic symptoms; module III- psychological symptoms; module IV-brain and cognition; and module V-cognitive impairments in PD. Patients were handed the information book about the five modules at the beginning of the study. The objective was to improve their understanding of their condition and to discuss other components that could affect their cognitive abilities. After the 40-60-minute informative part, mindfulness exercises were offered for 20-30 minutes per session. Participants were not invited to practice exercises between sessions, but 3/6 participants reported they did.</description>

    <description>Goal Management Training® (GMT) has been developed to improve executive functions. It was validated in patients presenting executive dysfunction following many conditions: acquired traumatic brain injury, neurodevelopmental spina bifida, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), subjective cognitive complaints and multiple sclerosis. GMT includes self-instruction strategies, self-monitoring exercises, cognitive training techniques, psychoeducation on cognitive processes, mindfulness exercises and assignments between sessions. It has been shown to increase patient awareness of deficits and improve cognitive control in goal-directed behaviors. The original GMT is a nine-week program administered to dysexecutive patients in 90-to-120-minute group sessions. Thus, it might be suitable for PD-MCI patients presenting with executive dysfunction.</description>

    <description>See the Arm section for full details. For a justification of how we designed this intervention: Many clinical guidelines include general recommendations about giving information to PD patients and family so they can take part into decision process. However, few standardized psychoeducation interventions are available, and they don't include information on PD cognitive decline. Some studies investigated Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and other related mindfulness interventions in PD patients. In this approach, formal meditative exercises are included to develop non-judgmental attention to experiences in the present moment. In elderly patients with MCI unrelated to PD, mindfulness interventions show positive effects on cognitive functioning, including attention, executive functioning and memory (Gard et al., 2014). Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions for PD-MCI including both education on cognitive symptoms, as well as mindfulness exercises, are promising.</description>
