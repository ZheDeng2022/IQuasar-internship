    <textblock>
      This study was planned to examine the effect of telephone support for breastfeeding follow-up&#xD;
      on physiological jaundice, exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, infantile colic,&#xD;
      maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy, and breastfeeding success.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Hypothesis; H1: Telephone support for breastfeeding follow-up affects the development of&#xD;
      physiological jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Telephone support for breastfeeding monitoring affects exclusive breastfeeding for the&#xD;
      first six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Telephone support for breastfeeding follow-up affects infantile colic. H4: Telephone&#xD;
      support for breastfeeding follow-up affects maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H5: Telephone support for breastfeeding follow-up affects breastfeeding success of mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social media communication is planned to be completed at the 36th or older gestational week,&#xD;
      who will have her first or second birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria - Having/had a new birth between the ages of 18-45 - Having his 1st or 2nd&#xD;
      birth - Agreeing to participate in the study voluntarily and obtaining consent form - Having&#xD;
      given birth to a healthy baby above 36 weeks of gestation - Planning to breastfeed - The baby&#xD;
      does not need intensive care and does not develop any postpartum complications - The baby&#xD;
      does not have a vision and hearing problem, does not have a disease that may prevent&#xD;
      breastfeeding - The baby does not have a physical and psychological deficit - The baby does&#xD;
      not have a disease or an anatomical problem that will prevent breastfeeding - Mother's&#xD;
      ability to continue monitoring on the phone and to have a phone that can provide monitoring&#xD;
      and video chat. No blood incompatibility between mother and baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria - Refusal to participate in the study - Failure to continue monitoring by&#xD;
      phone - Mother's illiteracy - Development of pathological jaundice in the baby&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block randomization will be applied according to maternal age, the number of births, baby&#xD;
      gender, and birth week. Age (3 groups) X number of births (2 groups) X baby gender (2 groups)&#xD;
      X gestational week (2 groups) = 24 blocks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through social media, women between the ages of 18-45, who will have their first or second&#xD;
      birth at their 36th or older gestational week will be included in the study. The woman in the&#xD;
      control and study groups will be given breastfeeding and baby care training with the help of&#xD;
      the training booklet by video calling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-Demographic Data Collection Form, Baby Monitoring Form, Infantile Colic Scale,&#xD;
      Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form, and LATCH Breastfeeding Diagnostic Scale will&#xD;
      be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A socio-demographic data collection form will be filled, and the LATCH Breastfeeding&#xD;
           Diagnostic Scale will be applied to the woman in the control and study groups on the day&#xD;
           the mother gives birth, by making a video call by phone during breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The women in the study group will be provided with a video call every day for the first&#xD;
           week after their discharge from the hospital, to provide consultancy to the mother on&#xD;
           the matters she needs and to be recorded in the Baby Monitoring Form. The general&#xD;
           appearance of the baby, observation during sucking, jaundice, drowsiness, reluctance to&#xD;
           suck will be observed. The consultancy will be provided to the mother on these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No additional intervention or routine call will be made to mothers in the control group.&#xD;
           The researcher's phone will be given to the mothers in both groups and the incoming&#xD;
           calls and their content will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the following weeks, the consultancy will continue to be given to the working group&#xD;
           by making a video talk one week apart. The control group will be called to fill in the&#xD;
           scales for monitoring purposes.&#xD;

    <description>LATCH Breastfeeding Assesment Scale: It is a measurement tool developed by Jensen et al. (1994) to evaluate breastfeeding. It was created to diagnose breastfeeding, to identify problems, to determine training accordingly, to create a common language among health professionals and to be used in studies (Yenal et al., 2013). This measurement tool consists of the English initials of five evaluation criteria. Each item is scored between 0-2 points. The highest score is 10.</description>

    <description>Infantile Colic Scale: It was developed by Ellett et al. (2003) to diagnose and evaluate colic. The validity and reliability study of the scale was done by Cetinkaya and Başbakkal (2007) in Turkey. 12 Scale items are graded with Likert type scoring ranging from 1 to 6.</description>

    <description>Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form: It is a 33-item scale developed by Dennis and Faux (1999) to evaluate breastfeeding self-efficacy levels of mothers. Later, a 14-item short form of the scale was developed in 2003 (Dennis 2003). Dennis (2003) recommends this short form for use. It is applied more easily and evaluates self-efficacy correctly. Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Short Form Scale is a 5 point Likert type scale.</description>
