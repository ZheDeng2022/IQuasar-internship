    <textblock>
      SATURN study aims at evaluating Home Healthcare Provider (HHP) Management of type 1 diabetic&#xD;
      patients using a closed-loop automatic insulin delivery system (or artificial pancreas), and&#xD;
      specifically satisfaction and interactions of all people involved (patients, HHPs, hospital&#xD;
      healthcare teams) after 1 and 3 months of follow-up, under normal conditions of use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      National, multi-centre, longitudinal, non-comparative interventional study with minimal risks&#xD;
      and constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two French hospitals and their HHP representatives will participate in the study. A&#xD;
      recruitment of a total of 35 patients is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult type 1 diabetic patients for whom the investigator prescribes the use of a closed-loop&#xD;
      automatic insulin delivery system (or artificial pancreas) consisting in an insulin pump with&#xD;
      a continuous glucose monitoring system combined with a dedicated terminal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for a period of 3 months, starting from the end of the device&#xD;
      installation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HHP Management comprises three distinct phases: pre-installation, installation and follow-up&#xD;
      during which number, nature and duration of contacts (visits/telephone calls) may vary&#xD;
      according to patient's needs, investigator's judgement and practice, and judgement of HHP&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-installation and installation phases consist of two patients' visits at hospital, and of&#xD;
      two to five visits from HHP staff to patients' home (only one visit at hospital). Follow-up&#xD;
      phase held after installation consists of four patients' contacts (phone contact and/or home&#xD;
      visit) performed by HHP staff.&#xD;
