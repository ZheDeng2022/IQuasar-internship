      -  To systematically evaluate an innovative directed psycho-educational intervention&#xD;
           consisting of written specific, age-appropriate information, complemented by a follow-up&#xD;
           targeted telephone call in order to reduce psychological sequelae in the child and their&#xD;
           parents/guardians after PICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm the effects of the psycho-educational tool on parent and child emotional&#xD;
           adjustment 6 months after PICU discharge; and to explore whether these outcomes are&#xD;
           associated with the child's age; with receipt of the targeted telephone call; and/or&#xD;
           with parental levels of stress during the child's admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain detailed feedback from parents/guardians and children about the different&#xD;
           aspects of the psycho-educational intervention (the written information and the targeted&#xD;
           telephone call) and the utility of these two psycho-educational interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will perform a randomised controlled trial of the intervention vs treatment as&#xD;
      usual in children 0-16 years, stratified according to age (&lt; 4 years and &gt; 4 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 288 children will be required to show a difference in outcome which is&#xD;
      PTSD in parents and children.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To systematically evaluate an innovative directed psycho-educational intervention&#xD;
           consisting of written specific, age-appropriate information, complemented by a follow-up&#xD;
           targeted telephone call in order to reduce psychological sequelae in the child and their&#xD;
           parents/guardians after PICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm the effects of the psycho-educational tool on parent and child emotional&#xD;
           adjustment 6 months after PICU discharge; and to explore whether these outcomes are&#xD;
           associated with the child's age; with receipt of the targeted telephone call; and/or&#xD;
           with parental levels of stress during the child's admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain detailed feedback from parents/guardians and children about the different&#xD;
           aspects of the psycho-educational intervention (the written information and the targeted&#xD;
           telephone call) and the utility of these two psycho-educational interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To determine if the psycho-educational intervention is superior to&#xD;
      treatment as usual in reducing parental post-traumatic stress and other psychological&#xD;
      symptoms measured at 6 months after PICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if the intervention is superior to treatment as usual in reducing child&#xD;
           post-traumatic stress and other psychological symptoms measured at 6 months post PICU&#xD;
           discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether the degree of parental stress during their child's PICU admission&#xD;
           is particularly associated with the extent of psychological sequelae and whether the&#xD;
           psycho-educational intervention is as less or more effective in the highly stressed&#xD;
           families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if adding this relatively simple, innovative and pragmatic intervention to&#xD;
           treatment as usual will provide a cost-effective use of NHS resources&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate in detail child and parental acceptance of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of the Psycho-educational Tool and Assessment of Parental/Guardian Stress on PICU&#xD;
      Discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible families will include children 0-16 years admitted to PICU for &gt; 24 hours,&#xD;
           surviving to be discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents who are deemed to lack adequate English Language to understand the written&#xD;
           psycho-educational tool, telephone call and questionnaires will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Our aim in future, if the intervention is shown to be successful, is to translate the&#xD;
      intervention tools into the most frequently encountered foreign languages.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent prior to the child's discharge from PICU, a parental PICU&#xD;
      stress screening questionnaire (18), will be given to all parents/guardians prior to&#xD;
      discharge by the researcher or appropriately trained bedside PICU nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents/guardians of all eligible children will be randomized using random allocation to&#xD;
           receive either active intervention or treatment as usual (TAU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those randomised to the intervention group will be given the age-appropriate written&#xD;
           psycho-educational tool prior to PICU discharge, by the researcher. The researcher will&#xD;
           also explain the mechanism of the targeted telephone call to be delivered 4-6 weeks&#xD;
           after PICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ Telephone Call:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All parents/guardians randomised to the intervention group will be offered the directed&#xD;
           targeted telephone call from the researcher at 4-6 weeks post hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The researcher will use a protocolised, scripted interview questionnaire to discuss the&#xD;
           contents of the tool and any psychological problems arising post PICU discharge, as well&#xD;
           as provide information to families of ways of managing these, including, when&#xD;
           appropriate referral to GP and local mental health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study team will record the key outcomes of the call to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uptake rates and outcome; the number of families with impairing symptoms; and rates of&#xD;
      referral to GPs and/or local mental health services.&#xD;
