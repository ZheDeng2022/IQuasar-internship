  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies pelvic floor dysfunction and quality of life in uterine cancer survivors.&#xD;
      Using questionnaires may help researchers learn more about the sexual function and quality of&#xD;
      life in uterine cancer survivors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate and compare the prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunction in uterine cancer&#xD;
      survivors by modality of treatment and to compare with a control group with no history of&#xD;
      cancer using the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the degree of sexual dysfunction in uterine cancer survivors by modality of&#xD;
      treatment using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) as a continuous measure, and to&#xD;
      compare to a non-cancer control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the long term quality of life (QoL) (using the FSFI, the Pelvic Floor Impact&#xD;
      Questionnaire [PFIQ], Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endometrial Cancer [FACT-En],&#xD;
      Brief Pain Inventory [BPI], Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale [ADAS]/Cancer Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Evaluation System for Research [CARES] dating scale and Menopausal survey) of patients who&#xD;
      were treated with surgery and radiotherapy versus surgery alone (with or without&#xD;
      chemotherapy), and to compare to a control group with no history of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate associations between dose volume parameters of organs at risk and pelvic&#xD;
      floor symptoms using the PFIQ and PFDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate associations between the radiation and surgical technique and quality of life&#xD;
      (including pelvic symptoms and sexual function using the FSFI, PFIQ, PFDI, and FACT-En).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete questionnaires over 45-60 minutes consisting of demographic, treatment,&#xD;
      lifestyle, disease, and comorbidity questions, as well as multiple study instruments&#xD;
      assessing quality of life as it pertains to common toxicities of uterine cancer treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Measured by the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20. Descriptive statistics (i.e. frequencies, percentages, medians, ranges, means, standard deviations, measures of skewness and kurtosis), including 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be computed for the measures derived by study cohort. Prevalence estimates along with exact 95% CIs will be computed. Logistic regression analysis will be used to assess the odds of PFD for treatment cohorts relative to the cohort of patient controls.</description>

      <textblock>
        Patients with uterine cancer treated with surgery +/- radiation at MD Anderson between 2006&#xD;
        and 2017 and patients who have never been diagnosed with any cancer other than&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uterine cancer (including endometrial and uterine carcinoma or sarcoma)&#xD;
             treated with surgery +/- radiation at MD Anderson between 2006 and 2017&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Eligible surgeries include laparoscopic or robotic assisted abdominal total&#xD;
                  hysterectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and vaginal hysterectomy with or&#xD;
