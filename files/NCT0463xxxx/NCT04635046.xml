  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the foot and ankle group at the Department of Orthopaedics, Uppsala University Hospital,&#xD;
      the routine is to perform a tendon transfer of peroneus longus to brevis in case of a&#xD;
      ruptured peroneus brevis tendon in the ankle. The reports of patient outcome from this&#xD;
      surgery varies in different studies. The aim of the current study is to analyse how well the&#xD;
      patients think their general health has improved after the surgery, and how they perceive&#xD;
      that the foot function has changed after the surgery. In an objective way the changes in gait&#xD;
      after surgery will be measured with gait analysis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients are asked to fill in Short Form 36 (SF 36) and Foot and Ankle Outcome Score&#xD;
      (FAOS) before surgery, six months and one year after surgery. At each visit a clinical&#xD;
      examination is done by a foot and ankle surgeon, according to a protocol. At the same visit a&#xD;
      gait analysis is performed with force plates, registration of speed and gait length and 3D&#xD;
      recording. The surgery itself is performed according to the clinic's usual protocol and&#xD;
      standardised, so all patients are treated in the same way. The physiotherapy is also done&#xD;
      according to a protocol. The surgeon is not involved in the follow- up, this is done by&#xD;
      another surgeon, and the gait analysis is done by a physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are chosen from two groups: primary tear of the peroneus brevis tendon,&#xD;
      requiring a longus to brevis transfer, and primary tear of the peroneus longus tendon,&#xD;
      requiring removal of the tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group has a sub-group: patients who are in need of a calcaneal osteotomy because of&#xD;
      a severe varus hindfoot. The reason the study group is so heterogenous is that peroneus&#xD;
      longus and brevis tears are very rare, and 10 patients are referred to the Orthoaedic&#xD;
      deparment each year, that need this type of surgery. The sample size has been calculated to&#xD;
      30 patients (based on changes in force measurements during gate), but more patients need to&#xD;
      be involved in the study in order to have 30 patients at one year follow up.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in foot function one year after surgery including a peroneus longus transfer</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery to 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in foot function after surgery is measured using a patient reported outcome measure: Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) (range 0-100 points, 100 points being a totally healthy foot). The patient fill in the score before surgery, at 6 months and 12 months after surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weakness in push-off during gait</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>After removal of the peroneus longus tendon one might observe a weakness in the plantar flexion of the first metatarsal bone, leading to a weakness in push off during gait. This will be measured on the RSscan pressure mat (from RSscan International), recording the pressure at push-off in Newtons/ m2. The patient will be walking both bare foot and with shoes. Measurements are done before surgery, at 6 months and 12 months after surgery.</description>
