      The study proposes to identify deviant speech dimensions in patients with HD at&#xD;
      presymptomatic and declared stages of the disease, compared to healthy subjects, using the&#xD;
      computerized MonPaGe speech protocol. This tool is based on a multidimensional and quantified&#xD;
      assessment of voice and speech, by a set of targeted acoustic and perceptual criteria.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system, of&#xD;
      genetic etiology. It manifests itself in motor, cognitive and psychiatric disorders, which&#xD;
      progressively worsen until the patient is grabbed. Motor speech performance disorders are&#xD;
      present from the early stage of the disease. These difficulties, which progressively worsen&#xD;
      until the end of the patient's life, lead to a communication disorder and constitute a major&#xD;
      handicap with social withdrawal, loss of self-esteem and isolation, which are always very&#xD;
      painfully experienced by patients and their entourage. Dysarthria in the HD has been very&#xD;
      little studied, which makes its speech therapy uncodified. According to the most widely used&#xD;
      classification by speech therapists and neurologists, the Darley classification (1975), the&#xD;
      speech disorders observed in the HD are included in the heterogeneous group of hyperkinetic&#xD;
      dysarthria, whose contours and properties are ill-defined. In this context, a more precise&#xD;
      knowledge of speech disorders in the HD appears necessary to identify and characterize the&#xD;
      different types of dysarthria and the dysfunctions associated with each level of production&#xD;
      (respiration, phonation, resonance, articulation, prosody) and thus improve speech language&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to use an acoustic evaluation to support the perceptual evaluation,&#xD;
      available in the MonPaGe protocol, to describe the fine characteristics of the speech&#xD;
      disorders in the HD and to define objective markers of dysarthria in this disease for&#xD;
      francophone patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient is seen in the framework of his annual follow-up consultation in the Competence&#xD;
      Center mdH of Bordeaux University Hospital or in the Reference Center mdH of the hospital&#xD;
      Henri Mondor of Créteil, for an evaluation of his speech with the computerized tool MonPaGe.&#xD;
      A first speech evaluation with the BECD (Auzou, 2006) during 30 minutes is proposed to&#xD;
      exclude very severe dysarthria. At the end of this rapid test subtest, the subjects who&#xD;
      obtain a perceptive score &lt;16 are offered the complete assesment of the MonPaGe computerized&#xD;
      protocol (30 minutes).The application records directly and anonymously stores speech&#xD;
      productions made by the patient.The productions are transmitted to the Phonetics and&#xD;
      Phonology Laboratory of Paris (UMR 7018 CNRS / Sorbonne Nouvelle), via a secure large data&#xD;
      exchange server and are subject to a perceptual and acoustic evaluation a posteriori.&#xD;
