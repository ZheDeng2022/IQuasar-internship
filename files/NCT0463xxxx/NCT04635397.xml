      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative option&#xD;
      for many hematologic malignancies, in particular acute leukemias and myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the center of these reactions are the donor's T and NK cells. Several studies have&#xD;
      highlighted the impact of T cells reconstitution on post-transplant infection rates, relapse&#xD;
      and GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the post-allogeneic immune reconstitution studies available to us today include young&#xD;
      patients (&lt;60 years of age) who have had genoidentic or phenoidentic 10/10 allografts and&#xD;
      mostly only study the phenotype of a limited number of immune cells. While it is important to&#xD;
      know the absolute number reconstitution kinetics of the different categories of immune cells,&#xD;
      it is essential to also be able to assess the function of the different cells. Knowledge of&#xD;
      the restoration of T function at key dates after allogeneic stem cell transplantation would&#xD;
      make it possible to adapt post allogeneic immunomodulation (immunosuppressive treatment and&#xD;
      injections of donor lymphocytes) and anti-infectious prophylaxis for patients. The&#xD;
      measurement of cytokine profiles after nonspecific stimulation of T and NK lymphocytes&#xD;
      recently made available to the immunology laboratory of the CHU de Nice allows a routine&#xD;
      assessment of T lymphocyte function (Th1, Th2 Th 17 and T regulatory) and NK by measurement&#xD;
      of the secretion of different cytokines after stimulation of the patient's lymphocytes with&#xD;
      different antigens (anti-CD3 and anti-TLR7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytokine profile during immune reconstitution in hematopoietic cell transplants has never&#xD;
      been evaluated; we will analyze it with regard to clinical data: relapse, infections and&#xD;
      GVHD.&#xD;

      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative option&#xD;
      for many hematologic malignancies, in particular acute leukemias and myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of the allogeneic transplant is based on the Graft versus Leukemia (GvL) effect&#xD;
      which corresponds to the elimination of tumor cells by the donor's immune system from the&#xD;
      recipient's body. Conversely, graft versus host disease (GvHD) is an immune response of the&#xD;
      donor versus the host due to major and / or minor histocompatibility differences resulting in&#xD;
      multi-organ damage and being the main cause of transplant-related mortality. The main causes&#xD;
      of death in allogeneic patients are infections, relapse of the initial disease and GvHD. The&#xD;
      relapse linked to an ineffectiveness of the anti-tumor response of the donor's immune system&#xD;
      is responsible for 40% of transplant failures. GvHD is present in 40 to 70% of transplants.&#xD;
      In both cases, therapeutic options are available in order to modulate the immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, in the event of a relapse of the disease, reinjections of donor lymphocytes make it&#xD;
      possible to trigger a GvL effect and cure. For patients with GvHD, on the other hand,&#xD;
      treatment is based on increased immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the center of these reactions are the donor's T and NK cells. Several studies have&#xD;
      highlighted the impact of T immune reconstitution on post-transplant infection rates, relapse&#xD;
      and GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infections and relapses may be linked to insufficient antiviral or anti-tumor responses of&#xD;
      the graft (Th1 pathway deficiency) while GvHD is linked to an excessive response of the graft&#xD;
      against the host cells (Immune imbalance associating a excess of Th1, Th2 and Th17&#xD;
      responses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is currently no routine test to predict the kinetics and quality of immune&#xD;
      reconstitution in allogeneic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the post-allogeneic immune reconstitution studies available to us today include young&#xD;
      patients (&lt;60 years of age) who have had genoidentic or phenoidentic 10/10 allografts and&#xD;
      mostly only study the phenotype of a limited number of immune cells. While it is important to&#xD;
      know the absolute number reconstitution kinetics of the different categories of immune cells,&#xD;
      it is essential to also be able to assess the function of the different cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of lymphocyte function is mainly based on the measurement of their ability to&#xD;
      secrete different cytokines. This measure currently requires complex procedures exclusively&#xD;
      reserved for research. Knowledge of the restoration of T function at key dates after&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation would make it possible to adapt post allogeneic&#xD;
      immunomodulation (immunosuppressive treatment and injections of donor lymphocytes) and&#xD;
      anti-infectious prophylaxis for patients. The measurement of cytokine profiles after&#xD;
      nonspecific stimulation of T and NK lymphocytes recently made available to the immunology&#xD;
      laboratory of the CHU de Nice allows a routine assessment of T lymphocyte function (Th1, Th2&#xD;
      Th 17 and T regulatory) and NK by measurement of the secretion of different cytokines after&#xD;
      stimulation of the patient's lymphocytes with different antigens (anti-CD3 and anti-TLR7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunology laboratory of the Nice University Hospital recently demonstrated in a cohort&#xD;
      of patients with a kidney transplant that the level of secretion of INF-Î³ (Th1 pathway) by T&#xD;
      lymphocytes after non-specific stimulation was correlated with the risk of rejection and&#xD;
      inversely correlated with the risk of infectious complications. In addition, in a cohort of&#xD;
      patients with an autoimmune disease (Extra-Membranous Glomerulonephritis), the level of&#xD;
      secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from the Th17 pathway (IL6, IL17, etc.) was&#xD;
      correlated with the risk of thrombo-complications. embolic and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytokine profile during immune reconstitution in hematopoietic cell transplants has never&#xD;
      been evaluated; we will analyze it with regard to clinical data: relapse, infections and&#xD;
      GVHD.&#xD;
