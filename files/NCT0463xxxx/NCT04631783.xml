      This observational survey with retrospective follow-up is designed to study the daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness based on Epworth Sleepiness Scale a good way or not to assess Taiwanese with&#xD;
      suspected obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Daytime sleepiness (DS) is a complicated clinical problem, often indicating a serious&#xD;
      underlying physiological abnormality and associated with higher prevalence of comorbid&#xD;
      conditions such as diabetes, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Daytime sleepiness is also&#xD;
      the cardinal symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. How to identify the high risks patients&#xD;
      with obstructive sleep apnea for further polysomnography is a difficult problem for doctors&#xD;
      in out-patient department. Different methods have been proposed for measuring sleepiness and&#xD;
      the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) is the measure of sleepiness most commonly used in sleep&#xD;
      research and clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, whether Epworth sleepiness scale is a good tool with high predictive value of&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea is not evaluated in the population of Taiwanese. This observational&#xD;
      study is set up to document these practices.&#xD;
