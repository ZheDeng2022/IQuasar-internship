  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ⅲ, multicenter, randomized, evaluator-blinded, parallel-group,&#xD;
      active-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin 0.3% plus&#xD;
      fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% otic solution vs ciprofloxacin 0.3% otic solution in the&#xD;
      treatment of AOE, and to assess the pharmacokinetic properties in 12 selected adult subjects.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized at 1:1 ration to either the treatment arm or control&#xD;
      arm. All subject will receive 7 consecutive days of either ciprofloxacin 0.3% plus&#xD;
      fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% otic solution or ciprofloxacin 0.3% otic solution alone. The&#xD;
      main objectives are to assess the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin 0.3% plus fluocinolone&#xD;
      acetonide 0.025% otic solution in the treatment of AOE, and to assess the plasma&#xD;
      concentration of ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide after multiple doses of test drug&#xD;
      in 12 adult subjects, and evaluate the PK parameters.&#xD;

    <description>Warm the otic solution by holding the vial in the hands for 1 to 2 minutes. Twist off the vial cap. Tilt the subjects' head to one side to keep the affected ear up. Instill the content of 1 vial in the ear (0.25mL). Gently pull the outer ear lobe upward and outward to allow the solution to flow into the ear canal. Keep the subjects' head tilted sideways for approximately 5 minutes to allow the drug time to penetrate the ear. Use twice daily (every 12±1h , morning and evening) for 7 consecutive days.</description>
