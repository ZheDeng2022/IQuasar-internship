  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acceptability of vulvar vibration therapy has been evaluated in women with vulvodynia,&#xD;
      and found to be acceptable, however has not been assessed in women with a primary complaint&#xD;
      of vaginismus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study looks at the feasibility and acceptability of using clitoral vibration&#xD;
      therapy, alongside current therapy, for women with vaginismus. It is likely that many, if not&#xD;
      most, of these women will also have an element of vulvodynia. The investigators propose that&#xD;
      the use of external clitoral or vulval vibration therapy is likely to be acceptable in most&#xD;
      women with vaginismus, based on acceptability of vulvar vibration therapy in women with&#xD;
      vulvodynia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed that vibrator therapy may help women with female sexual dysfunction to use&#xD;
      vaginal dilators.&#xD;

      This is a nonrandomized controlled trial, with the initial cluster of patients receiving&#xD;
      standard therapy, and the second cluster receiving standard therapy plus vibrator.&#xD;
      Recruitment will be an initial 15 participants who will receive standard therapy, and then&#xD;
      another 15 who will receive an external vibrator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place over approximately 12 months. Enrollment of patients will be from&#xD;
      a joint psychosexual clinic led by a medical doctor and a clinical psychologist. Female&#xD;
      patients are referred to this clinic by General Practitioners, from within the Sexual Health&#xD;
      service, or via Gynaecologists, frequently with complaint of difficulty or pain with&#xD;
      penetrative sex. Exclusion criteria will be: patients unable/ unwilling to consent,&#xD;
      transgender male or on testosterone therapy, unable to understand written and/or verbal&#xD;
      English, current dermtatological skin conditions requiring active treatment, genital herpes&#xD;
      simplex virus within 3 months, or not reporting symptoms of vaginismus with no evidence of&#xD;
      vaginismus on clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial information will be given at the initial appointment. If the patient wishes to enrol,&#xD;
      than an initial baseline questionnaire will be given, and a follow up questionnaire will be&#xD;
      filled out by phone contact at 3-4 months afterward the initial consultation at the patients&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
