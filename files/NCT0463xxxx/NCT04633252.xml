      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic castration sensitive and castration resistant prostate cancer (mCSPC and mCRPC)&#xD;
      are prostate cancers that have spread to other parts of the body. Use of the drug docetaxel&#xD;
      with androgen deprivation therapy can improve survival for men with mCSPC. Researchers want&#xD;
      to see if combining this treatment with other drugs can help delay the time it takes for&#xD;
      mCSPC and mCRPC to get worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if giving docetaxel with M7824 and M9241 is safe and effective for men with prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men age 18 and older with mCSPC or mCRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Their diagnosis will&#xD;
      be confirmed. Their symptoms and how well they do their normal activities will be reviewed.&#xD;
      They will have blood and urine tests. Their heart will be evaluated. They will have imaging&#xD;
      scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They will have bone scans with intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      injections of Tc99 to check for tumor spread in the bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get treatment in cycles. Each cycle will last 21 days. They will get&#xD;
      docetaxel and M7824 through IV infusion. They will get M9241 as an injection under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with mCSPC will have up to 6 cycles. Those with mCRPC will be treated until they&#xD;
      cannot tolerate the side effects or their disease gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after treatment ends. Those with mCSPC will&#xD;
      then have follow-up visits at the clinic every 3 months....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase III trial demonstrated that combining docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
      (ADT) significantly improved survival (57.6 vs 44.0 months (hazard ratio HR=0.56,&#xD;
      (0.44-0.70), p &lt;0.0001) for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).&#xD;
      The greatest benefit was seen in men with &quot;high volume disease&quot; (visceral disease or 4+ bone&#xD;
      lesions with at least one beyond the pelvis and spine.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data has indicated that PSA &lt;0.20 ng/mL seven months after starting androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT) is prognostic for overall survival based on data from the phase III&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel has limited efficacy in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)&#xD;
      patients who have already progressed on anti-androgen therapy (abiraterone or enzalutamide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-PD-L1/TGF-beta trap (M7824) is a novel first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein&#xD;
      composed of a monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 fused to the extracellular domain of human&#xD;
      TGF-beta receptor II (TGFbetaRII), which effectively functions to sequester or &quot;trap&quot; all&#xD;
      three TGF-beta isoforms. A phase I study of M7824 (NCT02517398) demonstrated a manageable&#xD;
      safety profile and clinical efficacy among patients with heavily pre-treated advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M9241 is an immunocytokine that can enhance the efficacy of anti-PDL1 targeting antibodies&#xD;
      such as M7824.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data suggests that there may be synergistic anti-tumor effects, when docetaxel,&#xD;
      M9241 and M7824 are combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate safety and tolerability of docetaxel in combination with M7824 and M9241 in&#xD;
      participants who have metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine clinical efficacy in adults with prostate cancer treated with docetaxel in&#xD;
      combination with Anti-PD-L1/TGF-beta trap (M7824) and the immunocytokine, M9241.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For mCSPC participants: Clinical efficacy will be measured by prostate specific antigen (PSA&#xD;
      &lt;0.2 ng/ml) seven months after start of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For mCRPC participants: Clinical efficacy will be measured by an increase in their median&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men age &gt;=18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological confirmation of prostate cancer. If no pathologic specimen is available,&#xD;
      participants may enroll with a pathologist's report showing a histologic diagnosis of&#xD;
      prostate cancer and a clinical course consistent with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must have metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mCSPC participants must be within 134 days of starting ADT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mCRPC participants must have been previously treated with ADT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, single-center, non-randomized Phase I/II study&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure safety of the combination before using in larger numbers of mCSPC and mCRPC&#xD;
      participants, M9241 will be escalated from a starting dose of 12 mcg/kg and a second dose&#xD;
      level of 16.8 mcg/kg along with docetaxel. mCSPC participants will receive a maximum of 6&#xD;
      cycles. mCRPC participants will continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of M9241 has been defined, we will do a safety&#xD;
      run-in cohort to include another 6 participants to determine the safety of the combination of&#xD;
      docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 (given every 3 weeks x 6 cycles starting at Cycle 1), with M9241 at the&#xD;
      RP2D and M7824 (2400 mg), given every 3 weeks from cycle 2 through cycle 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining participants will be enrolled onto the trial in the following expansion&#xD;
      cohorts, each of which will receive the determined safe dose of M9241.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mCSPC participants: ADT followed by simultaneous docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 (given every 3&#xD;
           weeks x 6 cycles starting at Cycle 1), with M9241 at the RP2D and M7824 (2400 mg), given&#xD;
           every 3 weeks from cycle 2 through cycle 6). Prednisone is optional and may be given&#xD;
           orally at 5 mg once a day. Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) may include GnRH agonist&#xD;
           or monthly degarelix converted to GnRH agonist after 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mCRPC participants: docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 (given every 3 weeks starting at Cycle 1) with&#xD;
           M9241 at the RP2D and M7824 (2400 mg), given every 3 weeks from cycle 2 onwards until&#xD;
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Prednisone will be given 5 mg twice a day&#xD;
           for each dose or 10 mg once a day. ADT will be continued as per standard of care.&#xD;
           Testosterone suppression will be maintained throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that approximately 1.5 to 2 years may be required for accrual of up to 86&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must have documented histopathological confirmation of prostate cancer.&#xD;
             If no pathologic specimen is available, participants may enroll with a pathologist's&#xD;
             report showing a histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer and a clinical course&#xD;
             consistent with the disease.&#xD;

             or M921, even if oral contraceptives are also used. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately and her partner should inform the study&#xD;
             doctor immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
