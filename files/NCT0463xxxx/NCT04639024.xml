  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is research study to find out if a drug called ADCT-301 is safe and to look at how&#xD;
      patients respond to the study drug after an allogeneic transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADCT-301 will be administered on Days 1, 8 and 15 with blood tests following study drug&#xD;
      infusion. Patients will have a bone marrow biopsy at the end of cycle 2/before cycle 3 to see&#xD;
      how they are responding to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for approximately every 12 weeks from the last disease assessment&#xD;
      for up to 1 year from completion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are risks to this study drug. Some risks include: decrease in certain blood cells,&#xD;
      weight loss, loss of appetite, rash and Guillain-Barre syndrome, where the immune system&#xD;
      attacks and damages nerves.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients ≧ 18 years of age with persistence or relapse/progression AML, MDS, or MDS/MPN,&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. following allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  grade 1 overall GVHD at time of inclusion with stable immune suppression for at&#xD;
                  least 2 weeks pre infusion on study and planned stable immune suppression dose&#xD;
                  for at least 8 weeks (the safety evaluation period)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min as estimated by Cockcroft Gault and not&#xD;
             dialysis dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. AST, ALT &lt;3 x ULN unless documented due to medications (ie azole or other common&#xD;
             therapy for such patients). Total bilirubin ≤3.0 mg/dl unless there is a history of&#xD;
             Gilbert's syndrome in which case the T bili hould be &lt; 5.0 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females cannot be pregnant or breast-feeding from time of enrollment till 16 weeks&#xD;
             post final agent exposure on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Immune suppression not greater than 20mg prednisone daily or equivalent dosing of&#xD;
             alternative GVHD prophylaxis/therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients are at least 30 days from most recent allogeneic stem cell infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients may have had other therapy post alloBMT and other donor lymphocyte infusions&#xD;
             but they must be at least 60 days from the last infusion of cell therapy products&#xD;

             sclerosis, active Guillain Barré syndrome, poliomyelitis, sjogren's are not eligible.&#xD;
             Given the immediate, life threatening nature of the relapsed cancer in this patient&#xD;
             population, those with other stable and non-immediate non-threatening autoimmune&#xD;
             disorders such as thyroid disease or diabetes and others are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a known infection/reactivation of any of the following within 28 days of&#xD;

             measles, influenza A, Zika, Chikungunya, mycoplasma pneumonia, Campylobacter jejuni,&#xD;
             enterovirus B68, or SARS-CoV-2. Patients will have evaluation for HSV1, HSV2, VZV,&#xD;
             EBV, CMV as part of screening studies. Patients will have SARS-CoV-2 screening&#xD;
             performed if at all possible during the screening process. If screening is not&#xD;
             available, then screening based on symptoms will be documented. Additionally,&#xD;
             screening based on clinical concern and/or symptoms will be conducted for measles,&#xD;
