  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the efficacy and safety of the AbsorbaSeal (ABS 5.6.7.) Vascular&#xD;
      Closure device (VCD) for the closure of access site of patients requiring percutaneous&#xD;
      diagnostic or interventional procedures. An expected total of 50 patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this study. A total of 12 patients (4 patients per site) will be treated as roll-in phase,&#xD;
      prior to enrollment of the first patient. The primary objective of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the safety and effectiveness of the ABS 5.6.7. VCD in sealing the femoral arterial access&#xD;
      site following diagnostic or interventional peripheral or coronary procedures. Following&#xD;
      physician training, patients will be enrolled. Efficacy and safety analyses will be based on&#xD;
      these patients. Patients will be followed procedurally to discharge, at one month, (follow-up&#xD;
      commitment). Secondary objectives are to further characterize adverse events (serious and&#xD;
      non-serious), clinical utility measures and health-related quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increased number of percutaneous interventions being performed in outpatient&#xD;
      settings, there is a growing need to obtain safer, faster, and more secure hemostasis&#xD;
      following these procedures. Due to its automatic deployment feature and simplicity in&#xD;
      operation. AbsorbaSeal (ABS 5.6.7) will lead to more widespread use and improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes. The active closure system used in the ABS 5.6.7 ensures a secure closure. The&#xD;
      composition of the seal used is completely bio-absorbable and does not require the use of&#xD;
      adjunct materials (i.e. collagen, sutures, staples, etc.) needed in many of the devices&#xD;
      currently available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive laboratory testing, acute animal labs and deployment in chronic animal studies were&#xD;
      performed with ABS 6. After a few device modification to create the improved ABS 5.6.7, only&#xD;
      minimal confirmatory testing was performed with the current, modified ABS 5.6.7. The&#xD;
      extensive test results on the previous device iterations are used to complete the&#xD;
      confirmatory testing of the ABS 5.6.7 design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The First in Man (FIM) trial (CP001) supports the initial safety and effectiveness of ABS&#xD;
      5.6.7 in humans (n=20) and was completed prior to application for a pivotal Investigational&#xD;
      Device Exemption (IDE) Study in the United States and a CE Mark Study approval (CP004CE) in&#xD;
      the European Union.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the ABS&#xD;
      5.6.7. Enrollment into this study will include anatomically eligible patients requiring&#xD;
      diagnostic and interventional procedures. Patients will be followed procedurally to&#xD;
      discharge, at one month, (follow-up commitment). Secondary objectives are to further&#xD;
      characterize adverse events (serious and non-serious), clinical utility measures, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life.&#xD;
