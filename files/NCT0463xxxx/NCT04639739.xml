  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapies have gained significant results in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies. There are limitations of CAR-T&#xD;
      cells, the consuming manufacturing time and expensive price exclude the majority of patients.&#xD;
      therefore, we designed this trial to manifest the safety and efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR NK&#xD;
      cell therapy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
