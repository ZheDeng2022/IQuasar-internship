  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the long-term safety, including pregnancy,&#xD;
      infant, and lactation outcomes, of patients with LC-FAOD who are enrolled in the DMP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LC-FAOD DMP is a global observational long-term prospective outcomes study aiming to&#xD;
      collect information for up to 10 years from adult and pediatric patients with LC-FAOD,&#xD;
      regardless of disease management, including treatment with triheptanoin, and those who have&#xD;
      previously participated in triheptanoin clinical trials or Expanded Access Program (EAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolling in the LC-FAOD DMP will be managed at the discretion of their physicians&#xD;
      and may or may not be treated with triheptanoin during the course of the study. Patients will&#xD;
      only have access to triheptanoin through authorized commercial use (if approved in their&#xD;
      country) or available EAP but not from the LC-FAOD DMP itself.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of a concurrent disease or condition that would interfere with study&#xD;
             participation or affect patient's safety in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence or history of any condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places the&#xD;
