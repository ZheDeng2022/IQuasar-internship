  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty is an effective surgical intervention for patients with chronic&#xD;
      osteoarthritis commonly performed worldwide. Postoperative pain management has been a key&#xD;
      focus in patient care for this procedure. Poorly controlled pain following total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty is associated with decreased ambulation, increased length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      increased complications (particularly related to significant opioid use), and overall&#xD;
      suboptimal patient recovery. Appropriate postoperative pain management utilizing motor&#xD;
      sparing peripheral nerve blocks and periarticular injections has been shown to provide&#xD;
      faster, more optimized patient recovery and reduced hospital length of stay in patients&#xD;
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adductor canal block (ACB) is a well-studied peripheral nerve block performed for analgesia&#xD;
      following total knee arthroplasty. ACB is an effective component of multimodal analgesia&#xD;
      providing improved pain control to the peripatellar and intra-articular aspect of the knee&#xD;
      joint while largely preserving the strength of the quadriceps muscles1. In addition,&#xD;
      perioperative local infiltration analgesia (LIA) performed by the orthopaedic surgical team&#xD;
      is a common practice that has been shown to improve short-term postoperative pain relief and&#xD;
      reduce total systemic opioid consumption during hospital stay2 for total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Infiltration between the Popliteal Artery and Capsule of the Knee (iPACK) block is a&#xD;
      newly described regional anesthesia technique for postoperative analgesia in total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty, performed under ultrasound guidance. It targets the articular branches of the&#xD;
      tibial, common peroneal, and obturator nerves in the popliteal region, and aims to provide&#xD;
      analgesia to the posterior aspect of the knee joint without compromising lower extremity&#xD;
      motor function following total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine whether the IPACK block provides additional analgesia (in&#xD;
      combination with ACB + LIA) for total knee arthroplasty surgeries. The study will examine how&#xD;
      much additional analgesia IPACK provides in the context of an already-optimized regional&#xD;
      anesthesia pathway for total knee arthroplasty, which uses ACB + LIA, both modalities that&#xD;
      have reasonable existing evidence.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, limited studies exist in the literature regarding the use of iPACK for analgesia&#xD;
      in total knee arthroplasty. Specific studies on the addition of iPACK to ACB or LIA&#xD;
      demonstrate clinically significant reductions in pain scores for patients undergoing total&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty. However, no studies currently examine the use of iPACK in the setting of&#xD;
      patients receiving both ACB and LIA, as a fully optimized regional anesthesia &quot;bundle&quot; for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia in total knee arthroplasty. As such, this study aims to determine&#xD;
      whether the addition of the iPACK block, in combination with ACB and LIA, will improve&#xD;
      analgesia compared to what is provided by ACB and LIA alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IPACK block, based on limited existing literature, seems to provide superior analgesia&#xD;
      with minimal complications following total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine whether the IPACK block provides additional analgesia (in&#xD;
      combination with ACB + LIA) for total knee arthroplasty surgeries. The study will examine how&#xD;
      much additional analgesia IPACK provides in the context of an already-optimized regional&#xD;
      anesthesia pathway for total knee arthroplasty, which uses ACB + LIA, both modalities that&#xD;
      have reasonable existing evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining the effectiveness of IPACK in addition to the already validated multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia including ACB and LIA for improving postoperative pain may further improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. This may reduce postoperative opioid&#xD;
      requirements and its side effects, increase patient satisfaction, and decrease morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality associated with a prolonged hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demand for total knee arthroplasty is predicted to increase in the upcoming years owing&#xD;
      to an aging population and increased prevalence of osteoarthritis worldwide. The growing&#xD;
      number generates multiple issues to the healthcare system, mainly the additional pressure to&#xD;
      decrease the already unsustainable high healthcare costs. The role of iPACK as an additional&#xD;
      component of pain management may be the key to providing a safe and cost-effective healthcare&#xD;
      service to patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Question Does the addition of the iPACK block, in combination with ACB and LIA, improve&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia and clinical outcomes compared to ACB and LIA alone in patients&#xD;
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that the addition of this newly described, motor-sparing iPACK&#xD;
      block will significantly improve analgesia and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing total&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effectiveness of the iPACK block as a component of multimodal analgesia for&#xD;
      patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, this study will be a prospective double blinded&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial where the patients will be randomized to 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will receive perioperative ACB, LIA, and sham IPACK block. Group B will receive&#xD;
      perioperative ACB, LIA, and real IPACK block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, all patients will receive a standard spinal anesthetic as per our institutional&#xD;
      protocol, along with procedural IV sedation at the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. Local infiltration analgesia will be administered by the orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeon as per standard practice. ACB and iPACK block will be performed by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist immediately preoperatively under ultrasound guidance as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in the study will receive ACB, performed by an experienced anesthesiologist, as&#xD;
      conventionally described, using full aseptic technique, in-plane ultrasound guidance,&#xD;
      identification of the superficial femoral artery, sartorius muscle and adductor canal. Local&#xD;
      anesthetic (0.25% bupivacaine + 2.5mcg/mL epinephrine + 50mcg/mL preservative-free&#xD;
      dexamethasone x 15mL) will be infiltrated with real-time ultrasound visualization, needle&#xD;
      approach lateral to medial, with incremental injection, intermittent aspiration, and&#xD;
      confirmation of adequate local anesthetic spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group A will receive a sham iPACK block while those in group B will receive a&#xD;
      real iPACK block. Both sham and real iPACK blocks will be performed by an experienced&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, blinded to the intervention. Real and sham iPACK blocks will be performed&#xD;
      as conventionally described with ultrasound guidance (initial approach 1 finger breadth above&#xD;
      the patella, if this approach fails, subsequent attempt at level of femoral&#xD;
      condyles/bicondylar approach). All sham and real iPACK blocks will be done with full aseptic&#xD;
      technique, in-plane ultrasound guidance, identification of popliteal artery/vessels, femur,&#xD;
      and sciatic nerve. Normal saline x 20mL (Group A), or local anesthetic x 20mL (Group B -&#xD;
      0.25% bupivacaine + 2.5mcg/mL epinephrine + 50mcg/mL preservative-free dexamethasone), will&#xD;
      be infiltrated with real-time ultrasound visualization, needle approach medial to lateral,&#xD;
      with incremental injection, intermittent aspiration, and confirmation of adequate local&#xD;
      anesthetic spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study personnel, including research team, anesthesiologists, surgeons, physiotherapists,&#xD;
      recovery room and ward nurses, as well as patients will be blinded to the group allocation.&#xD;
      Anesthesia assistants not involved in study data collection or patient care will prepare the&#xD;
      sham or real local anesthetic injectate solution for iPACK block. Syringes will be prepared&#xD;
      immediately after randomization and before block placement and provided to the blinded&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. Pain scores and opioid consumption, length of stay, and other data will be&#xD;
      collected and assessed in person by a member of the research team or patient care team who is&#xD;
      blinded to study interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating orthopaedic surgeons will identify eligible patients and introduce them to the&#xD;
      study and research team at Alberta Hip and Knee Clinic (AHKC). Research staff will follow&#xD;
      recruitment procedure and seek informed consent from patients at AHKC. Participation in this&#xD;
      study will remain completely voluntary without any pressure from investigators. Patients'&#xD;
      questions will be answered at recruitment session. Upon recruitment, patients will be asked&#xD;
      to complete Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and Knee&#xD;
      Society Scoring (KSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be assigned study identification and get randomized in to two&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistician who run randomization would only know study identifications and stay blinded&#xD;
      to patients' treatment arms. Hospital data will be used to know Length of Stay (LOS) and&#xD;
      opioid consumption at hospital. A physiotherapist will perform Timed Up and Go test and Range&#xD;
      of Motion (ROM) Pre and post-operatively at Peter Lougheed Hospital. Pain score will be&#xD;
      recorded using Visual analogue scale 4 hours postoperatively and at discharge. Emergency room&#xD;
      visit or 30-day readmission will be accessed through Alberta Bone and Joint Health Institute&#xD;
      (ABJHI) data repository. &quot;Unanticipated complications of iPACK block&quot; and &quot;technical&#xD;
      difficulties with performing the iPACK block&quot; will be recorded by the study anesthesiologist.&#xD;
