  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to compare the three types of prosthetic limbs: the passive prosthetic&#xD;
      limb that the patients have been using so far, the 'RoFT', a prosthetic limb developed by the&#xD;
      Korea Institute of Machinery &amp; Materials, and the Meridium of Ottobock in terms of safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will compare the safety and effectiveness of RoFT, a robotic&#xD;
      ankle prosthesis developed by a Korea Institute of Machinery &amp; Materials, Meridium of&#xD;
      Ottobock Co., a representative commercial ankle-type robotic prosthesis, passive prosthetic&#xD;
      limb that the patients have been using so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to compare the above three types of prostheses in terms of their effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety, the robotic prosthesis will be evaluated after 30 minutes of familiarization after&#xD;
      applying, and the evaluation interval using the two types of robotic prostheses will be 2&#xD;
      weeks to eliminate the carryover effect. For evaluation, 3D motion analysis, dynamic EMG&#xD;
      analysis, energy consumption analysis, 6 minute walk test, Berg balance scale, Locomotor&#xD;
      Capabilities Index, and Korean-Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety analysis, any kinds of safety issues including skin abrasion, bone fracture, or&#xD;
      tendon/ligament injury due to fall down injury will be recorded and categorized for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Dynamic EMG is calculated by measuring EMG signals by attaching surface EMG to the skin using a tape on Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris, Tensor Fascia Latae, Medial Hamstring, and Gluteus Maximus of both lower extremities, measuring the EMG signal, and converting it to Root mean square (RMS).&#xD;
The measured EMG signal is used to calculate the activation period and timing according to the gait cycle for each muscle, and analyze the degree of activation.&#xD;
Attach surface EMG to the above-mentioned muscles&#xD;
Muscle activation start and end points within the walking cycle&#xD;

    <description>Using QUARK CPET (COSMED, Italy)&#xD;
Perform calibration of the gas respiration analyzer 30 minutes before the start of the experiment and maintain the temperature and humidity inside the laboratory.&#xD;
Before measurement, each amputated patient sits on a chair on the treadmill, rests for 5 minutes, and then walks on the treadmill at a comfortable pace for 3 minutes.&#xD;
Afterwards, all amputated patients are asked to walk on the treadmill at a self-selected walking velocity.&#xD;
The preferred speed is set to a level in which conversation is possible by deep breathing through a rating of perceived exertion (RPE).&#xD;
Measurement is made at a preferred speed and 12% slope for 10 minutes, and walk for at least 6 minutes. If it is difficult to measure at a slope of 12% due to the subject's physiological characteristics, measure at a slope of 0%.&#xD;
The value of rate(ml/min/kg) is obtained by averaging the value during the steady state for the last minute of the measurement section.</description>
