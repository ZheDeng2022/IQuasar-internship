  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is defined as persistent or recurrent pain lasting longer than 3 months as per&#xD;
      ICD11 and includes seven categories of pain. Chronic musculoskeletal pain is one of them.&#xD;
      Neck pain is one of the top five causes of chronic pain yet few clinical trials are dedicated&#xD;
      solely to neck pain. Chronic neck pain not only leads to neuromuscular dysfunction but also&#xD;
      psychological distress and fear-avoidance all contributing to reduced quality of life,&#xD;
      emotional health, and productivity of a person. Absenteeism and presenteeism are both&#xD;
      measures of work productivity of a person but presenteeism is more significant where being&#xD;
      absent from work is not a feasible option like in the case of homemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homemakers are often neglected but they constitute an essential part of society. Although&#xD;
      they do not have a formal occupation, they perform a multitude of ergonomically stressful&#xD;
      activities leading to different types of musculoskeletal pain. Being mostly a silent&#xD;
      sufferer, they often seek medical help when the pain becomes chronic and affects different&#xD;
      areas of health thereby necessitating a holistic management approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Central Indian cultural scenario, a homemaker rarely takes complete rest from her&#xD;
      household chores. So presenteeism can be used as a marker for work productivity. This study&#xD;
      aims to analyze the impact of chronic neck pain in the pre-treatment quality of life,&#xD;
      presenteeism, and emotional health in homemakers and to find the association of the findings&#xD;
      with the cause and severity of chronic neck pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is defined as a persistent or recurrent pain lasting longer than 3 months as per&#xD;
      ICD11 and constitutes of seven categories of pain including musculoskeletal pain. Neck pain&#xD;
      is one of the top five causes of chronic pain which globally affects 332 million and ranks&#xD;
      4-6th as a cause of Years Lived with Disability. It has been described by the Bone and Joint&#xD;
      Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders as 'pain located in the&#xD;
      anatomical region of the neck with or without radiation to the head, trunk, and upper limbs.&#xD;
      Chronic neck pain not only leads to neuromuscular dysfunction but also psychological distress&#xD;
      and fear-avoidance all contributing to reduced quality of life and emotional health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain expectedly affects the work productivity of an individual. Work productivity is&#xD;
      measured by either 'absenteeism' or 'presenteeism'. Absenteeism (absence from work) is&#xD;
      calculated by missed days at work and presenteeism means being present at work while&#xD;
      experiencing health complaints or to put it simply 'not unwell enough&quot; to skip work when&#xD;
      sick. Presenteeism is commonly interpreted through various scales of pain, cognition, and&#xD;
      quality of life. The highest rate of presenteeism across various sectors has been reported in&#xD;
      human service organizations that deal with care, welfare, and education. The last decade has&#xD;
      seen a surge in interest in presenteeism and the concept has received both positive and&#xD;
      negative criticism. High presenteeism ensures excellent attendance at work but also signifies&#xD;
      a higher workload and poor work-life balance along with variations in personal work ethics.&#xD;
      Presenteeism has been variously studied across different disease conditions and specific&#xD;
      ergonomic populations but there are very limited studies on homemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homemakers along with students and retirees are considered a part of the Out of the labor&#xD;
      force (OLF) of the society who do not have an income and are hence formally unemployed.&#xD;
      However, in a patriarchal society like India, women homemakers often perform a multitude of&#xD;
      roles (parental, caretaker, household) which are comparable to that of paid domestic help and&#xD;
      can be classified as an occupation on its own. Observing from an ergonomic point of view,&#xD;
      homemakers engage in activities that involve prolonged awkward postures as well as repetitive&#xD;
      movements which are risk factors for various musculoskeletal pain of the neck, back, and&#xD;
      limbs. But unlike other professions, there is no externally imposed time frame or formal&#xD;
      'breaks' which prevents a homemaker from taking a leave. Thus despite the biomechanical and&#xD;
      psychosocial stress, homemakers continue their chores and seek help only when the pain is&#xD;
      chronic and unbearable. So presenteeism instead of absenteeism is a more appropriate and&#xD;
      reliable marker for work productivity amongst homemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are studies to see the prevalence of neck pain in the world, there are few&#xD;
      clinical studies dedicated solely to neck pain especially in a specific population of&#xD;
      homemakers more so in Central India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of chronic neck pain in the pre-treatment&#xD;
      quality of life, presenteesism and emotional health in homemakers and to find the association&#xD;
      of the findings with the cause and severity of chronic neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who met the inclusion criteria were approached with the study. After obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent, a pro forma consisting of the socio-demographic details and pre-treatment&#xD;
      assessment questionnaire (including Visual analog scale The Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form&#xD;
      Health Survey The hospital anxiety and depression scale Work functioning impairment scale)&#xD;
      was filled for each subject. The record was maintained based on a serial number given to each&#xD;
      patient. Routine blood investigations (complete blood count, fasting blood sugar, renal,&#xD;
      liver, and thyroid function test was done for all. X-ray of the cervical spine (AP and&#xD;
      Lateral views) was prescribed. The final diagnosis was noted in subsequent follow-ups at OPD&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results were then co related with the cause of chronic neck pain.&#xD;
