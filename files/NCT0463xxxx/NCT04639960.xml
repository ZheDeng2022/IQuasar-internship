  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a neurogenetic condition associated with a&#xD;
      high risk of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia spectrum disorders. This&#xD;
      population is characterized by a particular neurocognitive profile and atypical brain&#xD;
      development. Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic, inhibitor of dopaminergic&#xD;
      receptors. Used in the treatment of psychosis, risperidone is frequently prescribed in&#xD;
      22q11DS, for example to treat a psychotic episode. Research on an animal model of 22q11DS&#xD;
      (LgDel+/- mice) shows that administering an antipsychotic for 12 days during a critical&#xD;
      period of brain development (adolescence) prevents deleterious neuronal changes and improves&#xD;
      behavioral performance in mice. The aim of this study is therefore to replicate the results&#xD;
      found in mice and to identify a long-term neuroprotective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is inspired on the one hand by the families who share with us the difficulties of&#xD;
      individuals affected by 22q11DS on a daily basis, but also by the encouraging results of&#xD;
      studies conducted on mice.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a double-blind placebo design, this study investigates the effects of a 12 weeks treatment&#xD;
      of risperidone (vs placebo) for participants with 22q11DS without psychotic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis of this study is that a short-term (12 weeks) risperidone&#xD;
      (Risperdal®) treatment during a critical phase of development (adolescence) will result in&#xD;
      improved cognitive performance and brain changes observable using brain imaging techniques&#xD;
      (Magnetic resonance Imaging, MRI and Electroencephalography, EEG). In addition, the&#xD;
      beneficial effects will be observable in a follow-up evaluation, 6 months after the of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risperdal® is a marketed product and is listed in the Swiss Compendium (2015). However, it is&#xD;
      not used according to its indication for the treatment of psychotic disorders. The treatment&#xD;
      will be administered orally in the form of capsules containing the ground tablet in order to&#xD;
      preserve the double-blind procedure (meaning that neither the examiner nor the patient knows&#xD;
      whether the capsule contains the active ingredient risperidone or a placebo). The dose will&#xD;
      be individually adjusted according to the weight of each participant. The lowest dose&#xD;
      recommended in the Swiss Compendium is 0.25 mg/day for children. Therefore this dos will be&#xD;
      prescribe at the beginning of the treatment and then gradually increased to 0.25 mg gradually&#xD;
      over 7 days. For individuals weighing less than 50 kg, the recommended dose is 0.5 mg/day,&#xD;
      this dose will not be exceeded for these individuals. For individuals over 50 kg, the&#xD;
      recommended dose is 1 mg/day. this dose will not exceeded for individuals over 50 kg.&#xD;
      However, in order to adapt as closely as possible to the different weight categories, a dose&#xD;
      of 0.75 mg will be given to the 51 to 70 kg weight category, and a maximum dose of 1 mg to&#xD;
      individuals over 70 kg. Treatment will also be discontinued in progressive stages over a&#xD;
      period of two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will complete a series of evaluations including cognitive tests and brain&#xD;
      imaging (MRI and EEG) on 3 occasions: the 1st before the treatment period (baseline), the 2nd&#xD;
      at the end of the treatment period (short-term effect) and the 3rd 6 months after the end of&#xD;
      treatment (long-term effect).&#xD;

    <description>15 signs &amp; 15 words is a homemade episodic memory task inspired by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (Rey, 1958). Participants are required to learn 15 common French words and 15 signs (drawings made out of 1 or 2 basic geometrical forms). After delays of thirty minutes, one day, one week and one month, participants are asked to freely recall the words and the signs they remembered. They are also asked to recognize the target items form a list of distractors. Variables of interest are (1) learning score = Maximum number of items correctly recalled during learning divided by the number of trials to reach learning criterion. Low score indicates poor learning. (2) Retention % thirty minutes/on day/one week/one month = Number of items recalled after each delay in time divided by the maximum of items recalled during learning. Low score indicates poor memory.</description>

    <time_frame>EEG Auditory pre-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Auditory steady state response paradigm: sequences of 2 types of auditory stimuli are presented binaurally: a 100 ripple tones (40 Hz) and 10 semi-randomly intermixed flat tones (1000 Hz). Ripple tones are presented at about 93 dB and the flat tones at about 83 dB. Participants are asked to detect the flat tone, while the ripple tones entrained the neural gamma oscillatory response. The duration of the task is around 7 minutes.</description>

    <time_frame>EEG Visual pre-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Visual inward moving grating task paradigm: participants are presented with 3 blocks of 80 trials, with each trial consisting of a circular sinewave grating that contracted toward central fixation. The task of the participants is to detect and respond by button press to a velocity increase of the stimulus, randomly occurring between 750 and 3000 ms. Feedback on performance is provided on every trial, shortly after the response onset terminated stimulus presentation. The duration of the task is around 21 minutes in 3 blocks.</description>

    <measure>Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>BRIEF pre-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Children and Adults version. This questionnaire provides an ecological assessment of EF, with a Global Executive Composite (GEC) score derived from the Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) and Metacognitive Index (MI). The BRI includes subscales of Inhibition, Shifting, Emotional regulation and only in the adult-form, Self- monitoring. The MI includes subscales of Initiation, Working memory, Planning, Organization and Monitoring. Observations are reported using standardized scores (T-scores)</description>

    <measure>Sensory-motor conflict 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Synchrony condition pre-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The task uses a robotic device altering sensorimotor processing in participants and inducing mild to moderate hallucinations (presence hallucinations - PH) and passivity experiences. Participants move with their hand a robotic device placed in front of them. A second robot placed behind them reproduced their movements, thus delivering tactile feedback on their back either synchronously (0ms between the movement and the touch, sync) or asynchronously (delay of 500ms, async). Participants rate the strength of robot-induced PH, passivity experiences that they felt during robot manipulation, and control items. Occurrence and severity of clinical symptoms are assessed.</description>
