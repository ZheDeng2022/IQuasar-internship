  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      111Indium-labelled IPN01087 (111In-IPN01087) is developed as a radioactive diagnostic imaging&#xD;
      agent in patients with colorectal or pancreatic cancer. It is used with single-photon&#xD;
      emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the identification of tumours that overexpress the&#xD;
      neurotensin receptor-1 (NTSR1). The purpose of this study is to assess how well&#xD;
      111In-IPN01087 is tolerated and what the most suitable amount to be injected is to obtain&#xD;
      good quality images. The study will also look at how 111In-IPN01087 is distributed throughout&#xD;
      the body and what the optimal time for doing the scans will be after it has been given as a&#xD;
      single intravenous injection.&#xD;
