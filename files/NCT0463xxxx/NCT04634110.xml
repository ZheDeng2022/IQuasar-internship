  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II study of brigatinib alone for patients with brain metastases&#xD;
      from anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who have&#xD;
      either not been treated previously with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting ALK or&#xD;
      who have had prior exposure to crizotinib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this single-arm phase II trial, patients with brain metastases from ALK+ NSCLC will be&#xD;
      treated with brigatinib alone without upfront brain irradiation. Patients will have close&#xD;
      monitoring with clinical follow up visits and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      surveillance, which will maximize safety and allow for early treatment if disease progression&#xD;
      is observed. If brigatinib alone can demonstrate high rates of CNS disease control, these&#xD;
      data could support a strategy of upfront brigatinib alone for carefully selected patients&#xD;
      with brain metastases from ALK+ NSCLC.&#xD;

             with minor neurological findings, no medication needed; Grade 2: Neurological findings&#xD;
             present sufficient to require home care / nursing assistance may be required /&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Neurologically symptomatic patients must not require immediate surgical or radiation&#xD;
             therapy for their symptoms, as decided by an investigator.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN (&lt;3.0×ULN for patients with Gilbert syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;

             contraception with their sexual partners from the time of signing the informed consent&#xD;
             through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to completely abstain&#xD;
             from heterosexual intercourse. Brigatinib may decrease effectiveness of hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives, therefore, women are recommended to use non-hormonal methods of&#xD;
             contraception. Highly effective non-hormonal birth control for women of child bearing&#xD;
             potential with male partners includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexual abstinence (no sexual intercourse)&#xD;

             to 1 of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period&#xD;
                  and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or completely abstain&#xD;
                  from heterosexual intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have received prior brigatinib therapy or other CNS-penetrant ALK TKIs,&#xD;
             including alectinib, lorlatinib, or ceritinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. RTOG/EORTC Acute CNS symptoms, grade 3 and 4 (Grade 3: Neurological findings requiring&#xD;
             hospitalization for initial management; Grade 4: Serious neurological impairment that&#xD;
             includes paralysis, coma, or seizures &gt; 3 per week despite medication /&#xD;
             hospitalization required).&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Have malabsorption syndrome or other GI illness that could affect oral absorption of&#xD;
             brigatinib.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Received systemic treatment with strong cytochrome p-450 (cyp)3a inhibitors, strong&#xD;
             cyp3a inducers, or moderate cyp3a inducers within 14 days before enrollment.&#xD;
