    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine if Gulf War Illness (GWI) likely involves&#xD;
      neuroinflammation. The investigators hypothesize that GWI involves neuroinflammation. By&#xD;
      assessing the five neuroinflammatory outcomes across the brain, the investigators can&#xD;
      determine if there are focal or global signs of one or more neuroinflammatory markers in the&#xD;
      brains of individuals with GWI. This neuroimaging technique may allow investigators and&#xD;
      others to detect cases of GWI neuroinflammation, which would improve treatment decisions as&#xD;
      well as the development of new targeted therapies. It is an ideal diagnostic tool because it&#xD;
      has low patient risk, is noninvasive, can be used repeatedly in longitudinal studies,&#xD;
      provides whole-brain coverage, yields multiple independent markers of inflammation, and can&#xD;
      be employed at most hospitals and research neuroimaging suites.&#xD;

      This proposal is for a Tier 1 (Discovery) study that uses a human, cross-sectional,&#xD;
      observational neuroimaging approach to measure neuroinflammation in Gulf War Illness (GWI). A&#xD;
      whole-brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) scan will be used to detect&#xD;
      multiple markers of neuroinflammation in 30 individuals with GWI and 30 healthy veteran&#xD;
      controls. The investigators have fully tested the MRSI scan in several patient groups, and&#xD;
      have found strong evidence of neuroinflammation in fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome&#xD;
      - conditions the investigators believe involve abnormal central immune system processing. The&#xD;
      investigators have not, however, performed the scan on individuals with GWI. The discovery&#xD;
      study will allow investigators to transfer this existing technology to the GWI field. This&#xD;
      project meets the core Special Interest of investigating dysregulation between the immune and&#xD;
      neurological systems in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' central hypothesis is that GWI involves chronic neuroinflammation. The&#xD;
      symptoms of GWI (e.g. fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbances, and cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction) overlap heavily with classic cytokine-induced sickness responses. In the case of&#xD;
      GWI, microglial cells in the brain can be pushed into a hypersensitized state by toxins or&#xD;
      abnormal immune challenges, leading to chronic overproduction of pro-inflammatory factors&#xD;
      that result in the primary symptoms of GWI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the central hypothesis, it is necessary to measure neuroinflammation in humans in&#xD;
      vivo. However, most techniques are too invasive for use in living individuals. To address&#xD;
      that problem, the investigators use an MRSI scan which provides metabolite concentrations in&#xD;
      4,000 separate voxels, giving whole-brain coverage. The scan yields measurements for:&#xD;
      Myo-inositol (a marker of glial cell proliferation), lactate (a product of anaerobic&#xD;
      metabolism), choline (a sign of cellular breakdown), and N-acetylaspartate (a marker of&#xD;
      neuronal health). The scan also provides absolute brain temperature, which is shown to be&#xD;
      elevated with severe neuroinflammation. The five main outcomes are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myo-inositol (MI): Higher values represent greater microglia proliferation or gliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactate (Lac): Higher values represent more severe inflammatory activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choline (Cho): Higher values indicate greater cell turnover (inflammation, gliosis, or&#xD;
      demyelination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAA: Lower values represent neurodegeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature: Higher values represent greater neuroinflammation. Metabolite and&#xD;
      water-reference data will be analyzed using the MIDAS package and thermometry extension41.&#xD;
      Absolute brain temperatures (in °C) within each voxel will be calculated by measuring the&#xD;
      distance of the temperature-invariant NAA peak from the temperature-variant water peak using&#xD;
      the formula: Tbrain = -102.76 × Δwater-NAA + 310.5°C, which has been validated in our scanner&#xD;
      to produce reliable readings. Temperature will be expressed on absolute values in °C.&#xD;

        This study requires the recruitment of Gulf War Veterans who were present in the Persian&#xD;
        Gulf between 1990 and August 1991 and who were forward deployed to either Iraq or Kuwait.&#xD;
        Of the approximate 650,000 service members who served in the Gulf War, only around 50,000&#xD;
        were women. As the number of female veterans who fit the study criteria wanes in comparison&#xD;
        to that of the male veterans, it would prove extremely difficult to recruit both GWI and&#xD;
        age-matched, healthy control female veterans. To circumvent this issue, the investigators&#xD;
        chose to use only male Gulf War veterans for our study.&#xD;
