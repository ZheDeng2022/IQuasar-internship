  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important regulator in the body. It&#xD;
      controls how well cells protect themselves against stress. PB125 (Pathways Bioscience) is a&#xD;
      plant based activator of this important regulator Nrf2. PB125 is made up of three plant&#xD;
      extracts (rosemary, ashwagandha, and Sophora japonica) so that it contains these things; 1.&#xD;
      Carnosol, 2. Withaferin A, and 3. Luteolin. Carnosol comes from rosemary leaves. Rosemary is&#xD;
      a spice often used in Italian foods and grown in many herb gardens all around Fort Collins.&#xD;
      Withaferin A comes from the medicinal plant Withania somnifera, also called ashwagandha.&#xD;
      Ashwaganda is commonly known as &quot;Indian Winter cherry&quot; or &quot;Indian Ginseng&quot; and it is one of&#xD;
      the most important herbs of Ayurveda (the traditional system of medicine in India) used for&#xD;
      millennia. Finally, luteolin is found widely in plants including those present in the diet&#xD;
      (peppers, onions, celery, herbs/spices). Some people purchase these herbs commercially, and&#xD;
      take them on their own for a variety of purposes. Typically, when you buy them, they will be&#xD;
      in much higher doses than they are in PB125. What makes PB125 different is that very low&#xD;
      doses of each of the 3 components work together-synergistically-to activate Nrf2 and increase&#xD;
      the ability of cells to respond to stress. It is unknown if there are any benefits to taking&#xD;
      PB125 and the risks are currently unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine changes in&#xD;
      muscle, in joint pain, in mobility (standing and walking) and in leg strength that occur&#xD;
      after consuming PB125 every day for 3 months. We want to make these measurements in people&#xD;
      who have been diagnosed with mild to moderate osteoarthritis-a degenerative joint disease-in&#xD;
      their knees.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preventing or slowing age-related decline in musculoskeletal function is important for&#xD;
      maintaining mobility and independence. In the US, osteoarthritis (OA) is the primary cause of&#xD;
      disability in adults, with no medical or surgical therapeutic intervention known to restore&#xD;
      the degenerated cartilage. The loss of skeletal muscle mass and function with age, is also&#xD;
      linked to increased risk of other diseases, risk of falls, and decreased quality of life.&#xD;
      Therefore, OA and muscle loss together are primary contributors to age-related decreases in&#xD;
      mobility and independence. Evidence suggests a decrease in muscle quality is associated with&#xD;
      or precedes primary knee OA, suggesting that these two conditions may share a common cause.&#xD;
      We will treat 50-65 year old people with mild or moderate OA in both knees, and reported loss&#xD;
      of muscle strength, with a supplement already available for use in humans to reduce oxidative&#xD;
      stress and inflammation. The supplement is called PB125. In this pilot clinical trial, we&#xD;
      will measure the ability of muscle to make energy, measure mobility (walking and standing)&#xD;
      and strength, and assess pain following PB125 or placebo treatment.&#xD;
