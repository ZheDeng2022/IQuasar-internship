  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HS-10352 is a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide&#xD;
      3-kinase (p110α). In preclinical studies, it demonstrated strong activity against PI3K p110α&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo, and inhibited tumor cell growth. The first-in-human trial is conducted&#xD;
      to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of HS-10352 at single dose and&#xD;
      multiple doses.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of single and multiple doses of oral administration of&#xD;
      HS-10352 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with hormone receptor&#xD;
      (HR) positive and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative who have progressed&#xD;
      following prior therapy. There is a dose-escalation study, which is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single dose and multiple doses of HS-10352&#xD;
      given once every day (QD). An alternative dosing schedule of twice every day (BID) may be&#xD;
      investigated if the drug clearance of HS-10352 is faster than anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be carefully followed for adverse events during the study treatment and for&#xD;
      28 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects of this study will be permitted to&#xD;
      continue therapy with assessments for progression once every 8 weeks, if the product is well&#xD;
      tolerated and the subject has stable disease or better. As the disease progresses, survival&#xD;
      follow-up is recommended bimonthly.&#xD;
