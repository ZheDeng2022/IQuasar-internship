      the primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy (progression-free survival,PFS)&#xD;
      of DCC-2618 (ripretinib, ZL-2307) and sunitinib in patients with advanced gastrointestinal&#xD;
      stromal tumors after treatment with imatinib. This study will enroll approximately 98&#xD;
      subjects in around 18 sites in China mainland, and all subjects will be receiving DCC-2618 or&#xD;
      Sunitinib in equal chance as treatment.&#xD;
