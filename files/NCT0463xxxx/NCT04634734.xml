    <textblock>
      The study is a cross-sectional study investigating the correlation between periodontitis and&#xD;
      both hypertension and body mass index among a sample of adult Egyptian dental patients&#xD;
      attending diagnostic center at faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Dental patients will be recruited in a consecutive manner from the outpatient Diagnostic&#xD;
           center, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the interview, the aim of the study will be explained to the patient and the&#xD;
           patient's acceptance to participate in the survey will be received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full questionnaire will be filled, then full mouth periodontal examination and charting&#xD;
           will be done for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The questionnaire will be filled through a face-to-face personal interview with the&#xD;
           patient using simple, short, easily comprehended questions (Goulart A.C., Armani F. et&#xD;
           al. 2017, Machado V., Aguilera E. M. et al. 2020). The questionnaire will be translated&#xD;
           by a certified translator into Arabic and validated. All the interviews will be done by&#xD;
           the same investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-respondent patients or patients refusing to participate will be reported with the&#xD;
           cause of their refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The questionnaire which will be applied in study will include sociodemographic and&#xD;
           medical questionnaires. These covariates will include gender, age, marital status&#xD;
           (single, married/union of fact, divorced or widowed), occupation (student, employed,&#xD;
           unemployed or retired) and smoking habits (current status: never, former, current).&#xD;
           Education will be categorized according to the 2011 International Standard&#xD;
           Classification of Education (ISCED-2011) (UNESCO 2012): no education (ISCED 0 level),&#xD;
           elementary (ISCED 1-2 levels), middle (ISCED 3-4 levels), higher (ISCED 5- 8 levels)&#xD;
           (ISCED 2011). Blood pressure will be measured at the clinic by automated&#xD;
           sphygmomanometer device. Finally, measurements of height and weight will be taken at the&#xD;
           clinical exam and body mass index (BMI) will be calculated as kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination will be held on a dental unit using the light of the unit and a&#xD;
           mirror. Periodontal status will be evaluated by full mouth charting using UNC 15&#xD;
           periodontal probe, including assessment of plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP),&#xD;
           Probing Depth (PD), Clinical Attachment Level (CAL), gingival recession depth (Rec) and&#xD;
           radiographic X-Ray imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodontitis case is defined according to the latest available EFP/AAP consensus. It&#xD;
           will be defined if interdental CAL is detectable at ≥ 2 non-adjacent teeth, or buccal or&#xD;
           oral CAL ≥ 3 mm with PPD &gt; 3 mm at ≥ 2 teeth. Periodontitis staging will be defined&#xD;
           according to severity and extent. Concerning severity, interdental CAL at the site of&#xD;
           the greatest loss of 1-2 mm, 3-4 and ≥5 was considered as mild (Stage 1), moderate&#xD;
           (Stage 2), and severe (Stage 3 and Stage 4), respectively (Tonetti, Greenwell et al.&#xD;
           2018).&#xD;

Periodontal status will be evaluated by full mouth charting using UNC 15 periodontal probe, including assessment of plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BoP), Probing Depth (PD), Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) and digital radiographic imaging.&#xD;
Periodontitis case is defined according to the latest available EFP/AAP consensus.&#xD;
Blood pressure measured by using an automated sphygmomanometer device. hypertension will be defined as values of systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, or; the use of antihypertensive medication.&#xD;
Then a questionnaire will be collected to estimate the prevalence of hypertension in periodontitis Egyptians adult patients.</description>
