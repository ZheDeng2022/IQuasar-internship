  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer pain is a frequent symptom, reported by 20 to 70% of patients in any stage of the&#xD;
      cancer disease : 60 to 70% in the advanced stage of the disease and 20 to 40% among the&#xD;
      survivors. Among patients who report pain, 40% report undertreated pain. Strengthening Pain&#xD;
      management in cancer is a specific objective of the French Cancer Plan. Providing patient&#xD;
      education for cancer pain management is recommended since small to moderate efficacy of&#xD;
      patient education on pain intensity and interference was found in all meta-analysis. An&#xD;
      effect size comparable with some analgesic agents. However, recommendations suggest&#xD;
      improvement in order to increase effectiveness and population reach of those interventions.&#xD;
      The DECLIC EPRI intervention aim at addressing all the issues raised by patient education for&#xD;
      cancer pain management. It was developed according to the framework of Michie's Behavior&#xD;
      change wheel theory.&#xD;
