  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the potential antiseizure effects of adjunctive XEN496 (ezogabine) compared&#xD;
      with placebo in children with KCNQ2 Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (KCNQ2-DEE).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EPIK Phase 3 clinical trial is designed as a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study targeting to enroll approximately 40 pediatric subjects&#xD;
      (aged from 1 month to less than 6 years) with documented genetic evidence consistent with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of KCNQ2 Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (KCNQ2-DEE). After screening,&#xD;
      subjects will enter a baseline period before being randomized to receive either XEN496&#xD;
      (ezogabine) or placebo, added to their existing antiseizure medications (ASMs), for 12 weeks&#xD;
      (maintenance), once a titration period of up to 24 days is complete. At the end of the&#xD;
      maintenance phase, eligible subjects will have the opportunity to qualify for and participate&#xD;
      in the separate open-label extension (OLE) study and receive XEN496 or, should they choose to&#xD;
      exit the study, will undergo a dose taper period of up to 15 days and 4-week follow-up.&#xD;
