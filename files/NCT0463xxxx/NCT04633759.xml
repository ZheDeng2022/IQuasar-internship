  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Primary Aim of this research study is to determine the feasibility of 8 weeks of physical&#xD;
      therapy strengthening exercises using blood flow restriction (BFR) in people with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS) who have moderate-to-severe walking problems. BFR training involves placing a&#xD;
      cuff on the leg being exercised in order to restrict blood flow. The cuff is attached to a&#xD;
      specialized device that automatically detects the appropriate amount of pressure to place on&#xD;
      the limb. Testing will occur before and after the 8-week treatment period.&#xD;

      The Primary Aim of this research study is to determine the feasibility of 8 weeks of physical&#xD;
      therapy strengthening exercises using blood flow restriction (BFR) in people with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS) who have moderate-to-severe walking problems. BFR training involves placing a&#xD;
      cuff on the leg being exercised in order to restrict blood flow. The cuff is attached to a&#xD;
      specialized device that automatically detects the appropriate amount of pressure to place on&#xD;
      the limb. Testing will occur before and after the 8-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the feasibility of BFR by assessing recruitment rate, retention,&#xD;
      adherence, satisfaction, and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Feasibility will be demonstrated by: 1) enrolling 20 participants in 8 months, 2)&#xD;
      retaining at least 16 (80%) participants, 3) 80% adherence to intervention, 4) 90%&#xD;
      satisfaction with intervention, and 5) no serious adverse events related to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine changes in knee and hip extension, hip abduction, and ankle&#xD;
      plantarflexion muscle strength after the 8-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Following intervention there will be clinically important within-group strength&#xD;
      changes that correspond to established minimal detectable change values and which can be&#xD;
      characterized as having at least a moderate effect size as defined by Cohen's d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: Explore changes in functional mobility (30-Second Sit-to-Stand, Berg Balance&#xD;
      Scale, Timed 25-Foot Walk. 10-day average activity level) and self-report measures (12-Item&#xD;
      MS Walking Scale, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, MS Impact Scale-29, and Patient-Specific&#xD;
      Functional Scale) after the 8-week intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Following a 5-minute low intensity warm-up, the BFR cuff will be placed at the most proximal portion of the leg and dosed following standard BFR guidelines: 1 set of 30 reps, then 3 sets of 15 reps at 20-30% 1RM with up to 80% limb occlusion. Exercises will target bilateral 1) knee and hip extension, 2) hip abduction, and 3) ankle plantarflexion, as these muscles are important for functional mobility in people with MS.</description>
