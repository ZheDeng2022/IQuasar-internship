  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic video game that incorporates&#xD;
      elements from metacognitive training on delusions and jumping-to-conclusions in patients with&#xD;
      psychotic disorders.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an international, multicenter study and is being conducted in Switzerland&#xD;
      (University of Basel) as well as in Germany (University of Lübeck). A total of 36&#xD;
      participants will be included. The estimated duration of the study is 15 months. All&#xD;
      participants play a video game from the genre &quot;Third Person Adventure&quot;. A character is&#xD;
      navigated through a fantasy world using a keyboard and mouse. In the fantasy world,&#xD;
      &quot;stations&quot; in the form of glowing gems are sought where players have to solve different&#xD;
      tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized to receive either the therapeutic video game with metacognitive&#xD;
      training content or another video game with attention and memory tasks (&quot;control&#xD;
      intervention&quot;). The control intervention does not include metacognitive tasks. Metacognitive&#xD;
      training is an approach for the treatment of psychotic disorders, particularly delusions. The&#xD;
      focus of metacognitive training is on thought distortions (so-called &quot;cognitive biases&quot;) that&#xD;
      are more pronounced in people with psychosis. The control intervention includes easily&#xD;
      understandable, playful tasks. The intervention will take 4 appointments within 2 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of a puzzle adventure game, in which players have to explore the fantasy world &quot;Macu'ta&quot;. The puzzles are based on Metacognitive Training for Psychosis (MCT), an intervention using playful, entertaining exercises to increase awareness of reasoning biases in patients and 'sow the seeds of doubt' through corrective ('aha!') experiences. The tasks will address reasoning biases associated with the emergence and maintenance of delusions.</description>

    <description>In the fantasy world &quot;Macu'ta&quot;, players explore the world by walking around with an avatar in order to find the puzzles and proceed in the game. The intervention consists of 4 different puzzles. Unbeknownst to the player, the first pieces of evidence of each puzzle are often misleading, i.e. indicate the wrong solution, such that hasty decisions are punished. Players receive immediate feedback and are shown the correct response after submitting their solution, as well as explicit cues that educate them on the value of making adequately informed decisions. The order of the puzzles is fixed for each player, but different per session.</description>
