  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of producing artificial vision in&#xD;
      persons with blindness. Study participants will have wireless electrical stimulators&#xD;
      implanted into the cortical vision processing areas of their brains. The ability of the&#xD;
      participants to perceive artificial vision in response to electrical stimulation will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the safety of the ICVP system and the feasibility of&#xD;
      eliciting visual percepts in response to electrical stimulation in persons with blindness.&#xD;
      The electrical stimulation is provided by wireless floating microelectrode arrays (WFMAs)&#xD;
      that are part of the ICVP system. The WFMAs are implanted in the visual cortex. Five&#xD;
      participants will take part in the study and each participant will have multiple WFMA devices&#xD;
      implanted in their visual cortex on one side of the brain. After recovery from surgery,&#xD;
      participants will begin a series of tests to assess the ability of electrical stimulation to&#xD;
      induce visual percepts and how these percepts may provide some measure of artificial vision.&#xD;
      Weekly participant testing will occur over a period of one to three years.&#xD;
