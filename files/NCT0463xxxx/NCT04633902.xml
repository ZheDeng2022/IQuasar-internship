  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label phase II trial studies how well olaparib in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      works in treating patients with advanced, metastatic melanoma with the homologous&#xD;
      recombination (HR) pathway gene mutation / alteration. Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, and potentially augment an&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune response to pembrolizumab. The trial is designed to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of olaparib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with HR mutation/ alteration&#xD;
      whose disease progressed on prior immunotherapy and/or BRAF-targeting therapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with PARP inhibitors could represent a novel opportunity to selectively kill a&#xD;
      subset of cancer cells with deficiencies in DNA repair pathways. For example, a tumor arising&#xD;
      in a patient with a germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAmut) has a defective homologous&#xD;
      recombination DNA repair pathway and would be increasingly dependent on NHEJ, alt-NHEJ, and&#xD;
      BER for maintenance of genomic integrity. PARP inhibitors block alt-NHEJ and BER, forcing&#xD;
      tumors with BRCA deficiencies to use the error-prone NHEJ to fix double-strand breaks.&#xD;
      Non-BRCA deficiencies in homologous recombination DNA repair genes could also enhance tumor&#xD;
      cell sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. The rationale for anticancer activity in a subset of&#xD;
      non-gBRCAmut tumors is that they share distinctive DNA repair defects with gBRCAmut carriers,&#xD;
      a phenomenon broadly described as &quot;BRCAness.&quot; DNA repair defects can be caused by germline or&#xD;
      somatic alterations to the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway. Homologous&#xD;
      recombination is a complex pathway, and several genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 are required&#xD;
      either to sense or repair DNA double-strand breaks via the homologous recombination pathway.&#xD;
      Therefore, PARP inhibitors are also selectively cytotoxic for cancer cells with deficiencies&#xD;
      in DNA repair proteins other than BRCA1 and BRCA2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In melanoma, genetic HR mutation/ alterations are rather common. Retrospective data showed&#xD;
      that nearly 20-30% of cutaneous melanoma harbors a mutation in at least 1 of the HR genes in&#xD;
      their tumor. The commonly altered genes were ARID1A, FANCA, ATM, BRCA1, ATRX and BRCA2, ATR,&#xD;
      BRCA1 and BRIP1. These findings indicate that HR mutations / alterations are frequently&#xD;
      observed in metastatic melanoma, and they suggest that PARP inhibitors could potentially be&#xD;
      of a great clinical value in a substantial portion of the patients with advanced melanoma. In&#xD;
      addition, the retrospective data also showed that presence of HR mutation was associated with&#xD;
      high TMB and clinical response to checkpoint immunotherapy. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      propose a phase II study of niraparib in patients with advanced melanoma with genetic&#xD;
      homologous recombination mutation/ alteration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical study, clinical efficacy of olaparib in combination with pembrolizumab will&#xD;
      be evaluated by assessing an objective clinical response rate in patients with advanced,&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma with the homologous recombination (HR) pathway gene mutation /&#xD;
      alteration. All participating patients will receive olaparib 300 mg a day and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      200 mg every 3 weeks (for up to 2 years) until disease progresses or they experience&#xD;
      intolerable toxicity.&#xD;
