  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a post-market surveillance study of the Lumbar Implant for Stiffness&#xD;
      Augmentation (LISA), a medical device, which is used to treat lumbar stenosis and chronic&#xD;
      back pain due to lumbar degenerative disease, and restore the natural movements of the spine.&#xD;
      &quot;Post-market&quot; means the device (i.e. the LISA implant) being used in this study has already&#xD;
      obtained CE certification and is commercially available for use in the European market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LISA implant consists of a &quot;spacer&quot;, a woven polyester band and a titanium blocker. The&#xD;
      spacer is placed between the two vertebrae, identified causing back pain and is fastened by&#xD;
      the band to these vertebrae. The band is tightened and locked into the spacer. This ensures&#xD;
      that there is sufficient stiffness at the concerned segment to protect the disc from extra&#xD;
      stress and to restore natural mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Device manufacturers conduct &quot;post-market&quot; clinical studies in order to continuously&#xD;
      evaluate the product scientifically and to comply with legal and ethical obligations. With&#xD;
      these studies, the long-term safety as well as performance of their medical devices are&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, which is initiated and sponsored by BACKBONE (LISA designer, developer,&#xD;
      manufacturer and marketer), aims to evaluate the long-term safety and performance of the LISA&#xD;
      implant for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disease and to evaluate the treatment.&#xD;
