      This research aims to determine whether cognitive behavioral therapy can effectively reduce&#xD;
      parasomnias in a sample of 20 adult outpatients with Non-REM and REM parasomnias. A secondary&#xD;
      objective is to assess whether treatment produces improvements in daytime energy, mood, and&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms, as well as functional impairment (work/leisure activities).&#xD;

      Sleep wake disorders are prevalent and impactful conditions often poorly assessed and&#xD;
      sub-optimally treated in the clinical setting. Undiagnosed sleep disorders can masquerade as&#xD;
      mental health conditions and worsen the outcomes associated with these conditions. Further,&#xD;
      sleep disorders can develop from mental health conditions and the reverse is also true&#xD;
      (particularly for mood disorders). Successful treatment of sleep disorders requires a&#xD;
      targeted approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasomnias are unwanted physical or mental events that occur during sleep or during arousal&#xD;
      from sleep. The states of wakefulness, NREM, and REM are normally distinct and occur in an&#xD;
      organized and predictable pattern over the 24-hour period. However, in parasomnias, aspects&#xD;
      of more than one state co-occur and intermix. There are four types of parasomnias identified&#xD;
      by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM 5). These include two NREM&#xD;
      parasomnias: sleepwalking and sleep terrors, and two REM parasomnias: nightmare disorder and&#xD;
      REM sleep behaviour disorder (RSBD). Lifetime prevalence of these conditions ranges from 6.9%&#xD;
      (sleepwalking) to 67% (nightmare disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, NREM parasomnia events are primed by conditions that increase sleep pressure and&#xD;
      triggered by sleep-disrupting factors. They are more likely to occur following sleep&#xD;
      restriction or deprivation, when SWS rebounds. Immediate triggers of sleepwalking in adults&#xD;
      are sleep disruptions associated with sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements,&#xD;
      noises and touch. Pilon et al. induced episodes in adult sleepwalkers, but not in&#xD;
      non-sleepwalkers, with specific auditory stimuli and this effect was accentuated under&#xD;
      conditions of prior sleep deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently accepted interventions for parasomnias include pharmacological and psychological&#xD;
      treatments. Pharmacological interventions involve the use of sedating medications&#xD;
      (benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants) or alpha-1 blocker (Prazosin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Psychological treatments primarily rely on cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy to achieve better sleep hygiene, reduced hyperarousal, and to teach the ability to&#xD;
      practice with reducing cognitive arousal during the sleep period through planned rehearsal&#xD;
      and scheduled awakenings. There are no well elaborated and systematic treatment packages for&#xD;
      Non-REM parasomnias and so this protocol will represent an innovation in this area.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop and test such a package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-Monitoring of Sleep. Self-monitoring of disturbed sleep has been shown to produce small&#xD;
      but significant positive impacts on some aspects of sleep (e.g., insomnia). As there is no&#xD;
      widely accepted placebo for parasomnia treatment, this is viewed as an adequate control&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives This research aims to determine whether cognitive behavioral therapy can&#xD;
      effectively reduce parasomnias in a sample of 20 adult outpatients with Non-REM and REM&#xD;
      parasomnias. A secondary objective is to assess whether treatment produces improvements in&#xD;
      daytime energy, mood, and anxiety symptoms, as well as functional impairment (work/leisure&#xD;
      activities). The hypotheses of the study are that participants who receive a 6-week program&#xD;
      CBT-p therapy will report fewer episodes of parasomnia than those who self-monitor their&#xD;
      sleep for 6 weeks, and will have objectively better sleep as measured by the prodigy and&#xD;
      actigraphy at one-week (T2) post treatment and at two months post treatment (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Trial Design This will be a single-blind randomized controlled trial with two&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
