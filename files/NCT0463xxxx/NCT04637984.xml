  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a worldwide major cause of disability with great social and economic burdens. The&#xD;
      recovery of motor function is crucial for the patient to regain independence and quality of&#xD;
      life. Identifying early predictors of motor recovery and outcomes is useful for planning&#xD;
      personalized rehabilitation programs and increasing their efficiency. However, making&#xD;
      predictions using a single clinical assessment is often difficult and a combination of&#xD;
      multiple tools is required. In the last decades, were validated two predictive algorithms for&#xD;
      upper limb function and independent walking that can be easily implemented into clinical&#xD;
      practice with the aim of increasing knowledge on expected outcome after stroke in patients,&#xD;
      families and rehabilitation teams. This will be the first single-site randomized control&#xD;
      trial that will test the implementation of such tools in a rehabilitation setting in Italy.&#xD;

    <description>A) PREP2. It combines clinical measures and neurological biomarkers in the initial days after stroke: 1) SAFE score (day 3), which is the sum of shoulder abduction and finger extension strength in the paretic upper limb using the Medical Research Council (MRC); 2) NIH Stroke Scale (day 3); 3) transcranial magnetic stimulation (day 3-7) to determine the presence of MEPs in the paretic arm. According with the aforementioned measures, 4 categories of upper limb recovery will be identified: EXCELLENT, GOOD, LIMITED and POOR.</description>
