  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional study on the use of personalized blood flow restriction during&#xD;
      rehabilitation exercises and its effects on biomechanics on people who have had an anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament reconstruction and healthy controls&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation after surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) aims to&#xD;
      reestablish the function of the knee. However, regaining previous levels of strength is&#xD;
      challenging, with long-term muscle weakness frequently reported and thought to play a key&#xD;
      role in the increased risk of knee osteoarthritis for individuals with a history of ACL&#xD;
      damage. Effectively building muscle strength requires exercises with high resistance loads,&#xD;
      however the joint stress and risk of further injury makes these types of activities&#xD;
      inappropriate and unsafe for those rehabilitating after ACL reconstruction surgery and other&#xD;
      injuries. Personalized blood flow restriction (BFR) training is a technique where the blood&#xD;
      flow to the muscles being exercised is controlled by a pressure cuff to a predefined level,&#xD;
      and has been shown to increase strength while exercising with significantly lower loads.&#xD;
      Early results have been promising, however the effects of BFR on the biomechanics of the&#xD;
      exercise as well as the acceptability in the ACL reconstruction population have not been&#xD;
      explored. In this application, we propose a cross-sectional study designed to test the&#xD;
      acceptability of BFR training for those undergoing rehabilitation from ACL reconstruction&#xD;
      surgery and healthy controls during free standing exercises. We will also investigate the&#xD;
      biomechanical effects of this rehabilitation technique. This application is part of a larger&#xD;
      program of musculoskeletal research in this area being developed by the team. The results&#xD;
      from the proposed project will inform the design of a clinical trial of personalized BFR&#xD;
      after ACL reconstruction.&#xD;
