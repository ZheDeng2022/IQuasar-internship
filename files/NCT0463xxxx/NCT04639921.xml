&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a newly described disease entity, where&#xD;
      the individual shows signs of sensitivity to gluten, but with no evidence of IgE-mediated&#xD;
      wheat allergy or CD (1). The extent and severity of NCGS is so far an enigma (2), but&#xD;
      symptoms of NCGS may be commonly occurring, with a reported prevalence of up to 6% of the&#xD;
      adult population (3). So far, only ten studies with a double-blind placebo-controlled food&#xD;
      challenge have been performed showing divergent study outcomes due to different study designs&#xD;
      and methods and a significant nocebo/placebo effect. In general, the studies are&#xD;
      characterized by patient recruitment from a gastroenterological clinic limited to adults (4).&#xD;
      Our study stands out in this respect, as we will investigate an unselected group of patients&#xD;
      as adolescents (not recruited from an outpatient clinic), because patients with NCGS often&#xD;
      report that their symptoms started at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several researchers have concluded that patients with NCGS may not react to gluten but&#xD;
      instead to dietary carbohydrates, so-called FODMAPS or amylase trypsin inhibitors (5). A&#xD;
      study with Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenges by Lundin et al. (6) has been&#xD;
      published but with inconclusive results. Given this background, contrary to CD, factors&#xD;
      involved in the etiology of NCGS are still unknown. In a search for biomarkers and perhaps&#xD;
      even contributing factors for NCGS, a microbial signature of the gut would be a good&#xD;
      candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study Design In a population based on healthy adolescents we conducted a double blind&#xD;
      placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) with cross-over to identify patients with NCGS as&#xD;
      recommended by the Salerno criteria(1). It will take place at Hans Christian Andersen&#xD;
      Childrens Hospital at Odense University Hospital, Denmark in November 2020. It was approved&#xD;
      by The Regional Committees on Health Research Ethics for Southern Denmark (project no&#xD;
      S-20160061) and the Danish Protection Agency (2008-58-0018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population The adolescents were participants in the GlutenFunen cohort, which were&#xD;
      recruited from an unselected subsample of the Danish National Birth Cohort, defined as those&#xD;
      living on the Island of Funen, Denmark. The Danish National Birth Cohort consists of approx.&#xD;
      96,000 children, who are followed from intrauterine life and onwards (most recent follow-up&#xD;
      is 18-years follow-up)(7). Their mothers were recruited from 1996 to 2002 from the general&#xD;
      population with a participation rate of approximately 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GlutenFunen cohort included 1266 out of the 7431 eligible participants (17%), in the age&#xD;
      15-21 years old and were examined for Coeliac Disease, anthropometric and metabolic&#xD;
      measurements. Furthermore, the participants in the GlutenFunen cohort answered a&#xD;
      questionnaire about their gastrointestinal symptoms, and a score based on the number of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms was calculated. Criteria for inclusion was a score higher than&#xD;
      three, in total 273 participants. They were all contacted by phone by the author NS or CC and&#xD;
      invited to an information meeting where a dietician instructed how to follow a gluten free&#xD;
      diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were wheat allergy, transglutaminase IgA higher than reference range,&#xD;
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease and current antibiotic treatment Study Intervention The study was&#xD;
      arranged in two phases. See figure 1. The first phase began with a run-in period of seven&#xD;
      days to adapt the gluten free diet, subsequent one week of gluten free diet. If the&#xD;
      participants responded to the gluten free diet defined as a VAS score higher than 25%&#xD;
      compared to initial VAS score the participants proceeded to phase two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase two consisted of three periods each lasting seven days; The first being a challenge&#xD;
      with gluten/placebo, then a wash-out phase, and finally the second challenge with&#xD;
      placebo/gluten. During the whole study, the participants had to follow a strict gluten free&#xD;
      diet. Adherence was not evaluated during the trial, but the participants were asked to note&#xD;
      whether they accidentally had eaten gluten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The granola bars The participants had to eat two granola bars every day except for the&#xD;
      wash-out period. The granola bar was lactose free and low in FODMAPS and the amount of gluten&#xD;
      in the gluten containing granola bar was 5.0g. The recipe was kindly provided by Lundin et&#xD;
      al. (6). In a triangle test there were no difference regarding taste, look and consistency&#xD;
      between the gluten and the placebo granola bar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Gastrointestinal symptoms were measured with a self-administrated 10 items&#xD;
      questionnaire, which represented a modified gastrointestinal symptom rating score. It was&#xD;
      assessed on a 100mm visual analog scale (VAS) (1-100) at day 1 and 13 and day 15-35. A total&#xD;
      score was calculated as the mean of the 10 items. Extraintestinal symptoms and mental health&#xD;
      symptoms were measured with SF-36 and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental well-being scale (14&#xD;
      items) at day 1, 14, 21, 28 and 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Microbiome The participants had to deliver a faecal sample at day 1, 14, 21,28 and 35. To&#xD;
      ensure a high compliance the faecal sample was collected at the home of the participants. The&#xD;
      faecal sample was frozen immediately, as described previously (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding. The participants were randomised to placebo-gluten or&#xD;
      gluten-placebo in blocks of four by the randomization module in RedCap administrated by the&#xD;
      data-manager of the study. The kitchen of Odense University Hospital baked the granola bars&#xD;
      and packed them in different boxes with two colours to ensure the blinding of the study for&#xD;
      the investigators and the participants. The randomization code was not revealed before the&#xD;
      end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome The primary outcome was identifying participants with NCGS defined as a 30% worsening&#xD;
      of symptoms when eating gluten compared to the placebo based on the modified VAS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome was an improvement in the mental health of the participants when living&#xD;
      on the gluten free diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary outcome was to identify microbial signatures in patients with NCGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Normally distributed data were described with means and the standard&#xD;
      deviation and they were compared using paired t-test. Non-parametric data were described with&#xD;
      median and percentiles and compared using Mank-Whitney Rank sum test ??. P-values &lt; 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Assuming a positivity of 30% to the challenge, a power of 80% and a significance level&#xD;
      of 5% we calculated a need for 29 participants.&#xD;
