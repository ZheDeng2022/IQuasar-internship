  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-sequence, multiple-dose, 3 cohort study to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of DRV/RTV and/or ETR on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK3640254 and the effects of&#xD;
      GSK3640254 on the PK of DRV/RTV and/or ETR. This study will aid in understanding these&#xD;
      interactions and resulting changes in exposure (if any) when given in combination with&#xD;
      GSK3640254.&#xD;
