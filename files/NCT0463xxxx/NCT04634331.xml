  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activities of daily living (ADL) frequently involve the simultaneous performance of two or&#xD;
      more tasks, such as crossing the street while holding a conversation, commonly referred to as&#xD;
      dual tasking. The simultaneous performance of a motor and a cognitive task increases postural&#xD;
      instability, gait dysfunction, and may increase fall rates in Parkinson's disease (PD). The&#xD;
      goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of utilizing a digital therapeutic,&#xD;
      Dual-task Augmented Reality Treatment (DART) protocol, for the treatment of postural&#xD;
      instability and gait dysfunction (PIGD) in individuals with PD. A randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      will be conducted at the Main Campus of the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, OH). A total of 50&#xD;
      individuals with Parkinson's disease will be randomized into 1) a traditional multi-modal&#xD;
      training group, or 2) multi-modal training administered via an augmented reality headset.&#xD;
      Multi-modal therapy is where the participant practices performing two things at once (i.e.&#xD;
      marching while answering math questions). Augmented reality is a type of head-worn technology&#xD;
      that allows the individual to see the real world and places holograms in the space. Both&#xD;
      groups will exercise 2x/week for a total of 8 weeks. Assessments involving walking,&#xD;
      balancing, and turning will be completed to assess the efficacy of the treatment.&#xD;

      Individuals with Parkinson's disease who qualify for the study will come to the Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic for an informed consent visit. At the informed consent visit, the participant will&#xD;
      receive an activity monitor and a fall diary. Following a 4-week period where activity and&#xD;
      falls are monitored, the participant will come to the Cleveland Clinic for a comprehensive&#xD;
      physical and cognitive assessment primarily using a virtual reality treadmill system. During&#xD;
      that baseline assessment, the individual will be randomized to either 1) traditional&#xD;
      multi-modal training, or 2) augmented reality multi-modal training. Regardless of group&#xD;
      allocation, the participant will complete a total of 16 treatment sessions (2x/week for 8&#xD;
      weeks). The traditional multi-modal treatment will be administered 1:1 by a physical&#xD;
      therapist. The augmented reality multi-modal training will be overseen by a physical&#xD;
      therapist and administered via the Microsoft HoloLens 2 augmented reality device. Follow-up&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted at the end of the 16 treatment sessions and 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      treatment sessions have ceased. Falls and activity data will be monitored throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>Multi-modal training will be administered via the Microsoft HoloLens 2 augmented reality head set. Augmented reality allows user to see the real world, and inserts holograms into the environment. For example, the user could see boxes on the ground that they need to step around when walking. The boxes are not real, but rather a hologram that only the user can see. The augmented reality device will instruct the participant on the motor and cognitive task that should be performed simultaneously in a similar manner to the physical therapist in the traditional multi-modal training group. The intervention will be overseen by a physical therapist.</description>
