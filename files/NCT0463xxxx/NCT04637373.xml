  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retained products of conception (RPOC) and intrauterine adhesions (IUA) may occur following&#xD;
      suction curettage for early miscarriage and cause secondary infertility, recurrent pregnancy&#xD;
      loss and pregnancy complications. The aim of this study is to investigate whether adding&#xD;
      hysteroscopy to suction curettage reduces the rates of RPOC and IUA.&#xD;

      This is a descriptive, prospective study. Women aged 18-40 years admitted for surgical&#xD;
      evacuation in cases of early missed abortion in a single university affiliated medical center&#xD;
      are being recruited. All procedures performed under general anesthesia following cervical&#xD;
      ripening with vaginal Misoprostol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the evacuation, a diagnostic hysteroscopy was performed to identify the pregnancy's&#xD;
      implantation wall. Subsequently, ultrasound guided suction and curettage directed to the&#xD;
      implantation wall is done. Finally, the uterine cavity is evaluated by hysteroscopy for RPOC.&#xD;
      Participants are scheduled for follow-up diagnostic office hysteroscopy 2 months after&#xD;
      termination of pregnancy for assessment of IUA and RPOC. However, due to restrictions on&#xD;
      elective surgical procedures brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, the follow-up hysteroscopy&#xD;
      examination was postponed until 5 to 6 months after termination of pregnancy.&#xD;
