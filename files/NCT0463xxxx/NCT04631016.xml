      Study D9180C00002 is a Phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group, proof of concept study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MEDI3506 in adult&#xD;
      participants with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Chronic&#xD;
      Bonchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 129 sites globally will participate in this study. Approximately 322&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to receive MEDI3506 or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
