  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot study, which involves cardiothoracic patients. Patients, who are&#xD;
      scheduled for elective cardiosurgical procedure, will be seen in multidisciplinary&#xD;
      anesthesia/Patient Blood Management (PBM) clinic and screened for anemia prior to surgery.&#xD;
      Anemic patients will eventually be treated with 500mg of ferric carboxymaltose 1 to 4 days&#xD;
      prior to surgery. A high blood loss is expected in these procedures (&gt;500ml). Blood is&#xD;
      collected and re-transfused to the patient via use of cell savers/ autologous blood&#xD;
      restoration. The investigators will examine how fast intravenous ferric carboxymaltose is&#xD;
      stored within the iron storage cells of the body, and how much remains within the patients&#xD;
      blood at the time point of surgery. Next, the investigators will assess the wash out effect&#xD;
      of iron via cell salvage. The hypothesis of this trial is that ferric carboxymaltose is&#xD;
      washed out of the collected patient's blood by cell caver usage (Wash-Out Effect).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the short time frame between iron therapy to procedure in cardiac surgery due to&#xD;
      the need to perform cardiac revascularization, the investigators aim to investigate how much&#xD;
      of the iron compound ferric carboxymaltose is being stored within the iron storage cells of&#xD;
      the human body, and how much remains in the patient's own blood at the time point of surgery.&#xD;
      The terminal elimination half-life time of ferric carboxymaltose is known to be approximately&#xD;
      7.1 to 12.1 hours, with peak serum ferritin levels at 48h to 120h after administration. When&#xD;
      high blood loss in a surgical procedure is expected, such as in cardiosurgical procedures,&#xD;
      the usage of autologous cell salvage, so called &quot;Cell Saver&quot;, is considered standard, good&#xD;
      practice. The blood that is lost during surgery is collected and after a specified blood&#xD;
      separation wash, being retransfused in form of concentrated red blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to examine whether Cell Saver usage might recover high molecular iron&#xD;
      complexes such as ferric carboxymaltose lost by bleeding intraoperatively or wash out these&#xD;
      molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If amount of lost blood during surgery is too low, that Cell Saver usage would not be&#xD;
      possible otherwise, averagely 300ml of blood from the heart-lung machine are added to the&#xD;
      cell saver to enable the process of cell saver use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, 7 samples will be taken. The samples include patient's blood samples&#xD;
      and samples from cell saver compartments (Washing solution, concentrates) as well as from the&#xD;
      heart-lung-machine, in detail:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. arterial patient's blood, preoperative, day of procedure, prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. blood from the heart-lung machine, intraoperative 30 minutes prior to end of use of the&#xD;
           heart-lung machine, day of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cell Saver: washed-out compounds, intraoperative, after end of use of heart-lung&#xD;
           machine, day of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cell Saver: produced red blood cell concentrate, intra- or postoperative, after end of&#xD;
           use of heart-lung machine, day of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. arterial patient's blood, postoperative, day of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. venous patient's blood, 3. day postoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. venous patient's blood, 7. day postoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
      By liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS) levels of&#xD;
      ferric carboxymaltose are examined&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. in the patient's blood prior to surgery to determine the amount of ferric carboxymaltose&#xD;
           within the patients blood prior to surgery, and after a certain time after the&#xD;
           intravenous Infusion of ferric carboxymaltose (12-96 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. pre- and postoperatively and in cell saver compartments. If ferric carboxymaltose is&#xD;
           detected in the washing solution of the Cell Saver System and not within the stored red&#xD;
           blood cell concentrate, ferric carboxymaltose is washed out by the cell saver.&#xD;
