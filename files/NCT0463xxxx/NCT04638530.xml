  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resident education on breaking bad news and conducting end of life conversations has been&#xD;
      shown to improve comfort levels with having these conversations. Interventions with OB/GYN&#xD;
      residents specifically have used a combination of didactics, resident role-playing and&#xD;
      ultimately interaction with standardized patients with feedback from palliative care&#xD;
      specialists. These interventions can be costly and also are not practical during the pandemic&#xD;
      training environment where resident has transitioned to a virtual curriculum. While the&#xD;
      didactics portions of this previously proven curriculum can be done virtually, the&#xD;
      standardized patient interactions are challenging to replicate. Additionally, one of the key&#xD;
      changes to patient care that has emerged during the pandemic is restrictive hospital and&#xD;
      clinic visitor policies. Care providers must now have the ability to have difficult&#xD;
      conversations and break bad news to family members over the phone rather than in person.&#xD;
      Additionally, there has been an increasing reliance on telehealth visits. There are no&#xD;
      currently studied training interventions in obstetrics and gynecology that address these&#xD;
      skills.&#xD;

      First residents will be asked to participate. After giving consent, they will complete a&#xD;
      pre-study questionnaire regarding their education and experience with end of life and&#xD;
      breaking bad news conversations: They will be queried on basic demographic information: Age,&#xD;
      Sex, Year of Residency, Intended specialty, prior education on end of life and breaking bad&#xD;
      news: (0 hrs, 1-3 hours, 4-10 hours, 10-40 hrs, &gt; 40 hrs), prior palliative or hospice&#xD;
      rotation, have you had interaction with palliative care providers during training, have you&#xD;
      experienced the death of a close family member or friend?, have you experienced a personally&#xD;
      life threatening diagnosis?. We also will query the number of times residents have&#xD;
      participated in code discussions, breaking bad news, discussion about prognosis, discussion&#xD;
      about care at the end of life and discussion about hospice. They will also rate their own&#xD;
      ability and comfort with the following topics : self-assessed preparation and attitudes about&#xD;
      end-of life communication. First will be asked to review &quot;Discussing Resuscitation&#xD;
      Preferences with Patients: Challenges and Rewards&quot; There will be a didactic session during&#xD;
      which we will review the article and discuss strategies for breaking bad news to family&#xD;
      members. A faculty member from General OB/GYN, MFM and Gynecologic Oncology will each give a&#xD;
      brief 10 min lecture on how they have difficulty conversations with patients and family&#xD;
      members in their specific field (post-operative complications , pre-viable delivery, and&#xD;
      hospice/end of life/withdrawal of car). The lecture will be taped for those unable to attend.&#xD;
      Two sessions will be held during didactics via Zoom in two different months to encompass&#xD;
      those on night shifts and vacations. Residents will be split into groups of 3 with a faculty&#xD;
      member in each group. They will role-play three scenarios one specific to each of the&#xD;
      subspecialties- 1) Pre-viable delivery, 2) Discussion of withdrawal of care for a patient&#xD;
      with advanced gynecologic malignancy who can no longer make their own medical decisions, and&#xD;
      3) Telling a family member about a surgical complication requiring an emergent return to the&#xD;
      operating room. One resident will play the part of the family member receiving the phone&#xD;
      call. To better mimic phone conversation, video will be turned off during this portion. The&#xD;
      faculty member will score the interaction based on the following criteria and also give&#xD;
      specific feedback regarding what went well and what should be improved. After receiving&#xD;
      feedback from the role playing session, residents will then sign up for a recorded session&#xD;
      with an actor playing a family member. They will be randomly assigned to one of the three&#xD;
      topics and will then be assessed by a faculty member with the same criteria. After each of&#xD;
      the three sections of teaching, residents will be asked to rate on a 1 to 5 scale their&#xD;
      experience with the content and if it improved their ability to have end of life&#xD;
      conversations. 3 months following the intervention, residents will be queried with the same&#xD;
      questions asked previously to assess changes in their comfort with these conversations&#xD;
