  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the wrist devices have the advantage of being smaller, lighter, and more inexpensive&#xD;
      than the upper arm devices, wrist devices become increasingly popular. However, it is of&#xD;
      utmost importance to ensure that the BP measuring device can measure BP accurately. This&#xD;
      study will be aimed to validate a wrist type oscillometric blood pressure monitoring with&#xD;
      reference to the brachial blood pressure measured by auscultatory method with a mercury&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure (BP) is one of the major cardiovascular risk factors in adults. Home&#xD;
      blood pressure monitoring is superior to office-based measurements for prediction of the&#xD;
      future development of cardiovascular diseases and is recommended by major guidelines. To&#xD;
      monitor BP at home, patients can use devices that measure BP either at the arm or at the&#xD;
      wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among BP monitors, the wrist device is relatively easy to use, as the cuff can be used with&#xD;
      one hand easily and correctly around the wrist than around the arm, and undressing is not&#xD;
      necessary. Since the wrist devices have the advantage of being smaller, lighter, and more&#xD;
      inexpensive than the upper arm devices, wrist devices become increasingly popular. However,&#xD;
      it is of utmost importance to ensure that the BP measuring device can measure BP accurately.&#xD;
      To make sure the performance of these devices, several guidelines have proposed protocols to&#xD;
      validate these devices. This study will be aimed to validate a wrist type oscillometric blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring with reference to the brachial blood pressure measured by auscultatory&#xD;
      method with a mercury sphygmomanometer.&#xD;

        Patients will be recruited from outpatient clinics at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from&#xD;
        2020 to 2021. A total of 100 subjects will be enrolled in the study, and informed consent&#xD;
        forms will be obtained from before measurements. In accordance with the ANSI/AAMI/ISO,&#xD;
        subjects will be screened to ensure that sex, age, wrist circumference, and BP readings&#xD;
        fulfilled the participation requirements described in those protocols. If subjects aged&#xD;
        less than 12 years old, having wrist circumference outside of the designated range (13.5-23&#xD;
        cm), having arrhythmias, who moved their arms or bodies during the BP measurements, and&#xD;
        have unclear Korotkoff sounds will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
