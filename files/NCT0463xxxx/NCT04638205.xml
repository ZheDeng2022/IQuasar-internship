    <textblock>
      Suicidal behaviors seriously alter the vital and functional prognosis of adolescents.&#xD;
      Although the literature has lighted out a considerable number of risk factors for suicide&#xD;
      attempts in youth, theoretical models - among which bio-psycho-social models - still lack&#xD;
      empirical evidence. More specifically, the way adverse life events dynamically interact&#xD;
      together and with the individual's diathesis to precipitate suicidal attempts remains&#xD;
      unclear. Studies of life trajectories have opened an alternative approach to traditional&#xD;
      linear epidemiological analysis to capture such a complex process. To date, adverse&#xD;
      trajectories approaches never have been applied to the period immediately preceding the&#xD;
      occurrence of the suicidal gesture (proximal adverse trajectories).&#xD;

    <description>We will build growth mixture models to account for the 1-year longitudinal evolution of the Burden of Adversity values. Each group will be characterized by the parameters (intercepts and slopes) of the best-fitting model.&#xD;

We will then test whether the growth parameters of the ideation/pain trajectories correlate with those of the adversity trajectories</description>

        recurrence prevention device implemented in all establishments in the Hauts-de-France&#xD;
        region that receive patients who have attempted suicide (www.dispositifvigilans.org).&#xD;
