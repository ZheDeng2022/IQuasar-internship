  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After development of the prototype Bedtime Routine module of the Talk Parenting program, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate its feasibility and initial efficacy in a within-subjects&#xD;
      pre-post design study. Through recruitment partner agencies, the investigators will recruit a&#xD;
      sample of 52 at-risk families (52 primary parents, 52 target children, and 34 second&#xD;
      parents). Primary parents will be assessed at enrollment via online an questionnaire, then&#xD;
      provided an Amazon Echo Dot and asked to use the Bedtime Routine module for 6 weeks. They&#xD;
      will then be re-assessed with the online questionnaire at 6 weeks (at treatment completion).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents will provide consent for their own participation, as well as the participation of&#xD;
      their target child (their child aged 3-5 years who presents the most behavioral challenges).&#xD;
      After consent, primary parents will complete the enrollment questionnaire via the Qualtrics&#xD;
      online assessment platform and then be provided an Echo Dot with the Bedtime Routine module&#xD;
      enabled. After 6 weeks, they will be administered the 6 weeks (at treatment&#xD;
      completion)questionnaire. This design will allow us to evaluate enrollment-6 weeks (at&#xD;
      treatment completion) change and satisfaction/usability of the Bedtime Routine prototype&#xD;
      module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment and 6 weeks (at treatment completion) questionnaires will measure primary parents'&#xD;
      parenting practices, self-efficacy, and stress; children's behavior, emotional adjustment,&#xD;
      and sleep problems; and the parent-child relationship. The 6 weeks (at treatment completion)&#xD;
      questionnaire will also contain measures of parent satisfaction, acceptability, and usability&#xD;
      of the Talk Parenting skill, as well as any difficulties experienced or problems made worse.&#xD;
      Demographics will be collected at enrollment. Enrollment and 6 weeks (at treatment&#xD;
      completion) questionnaires will be administered via Qualtrics, an online assessment tool.&#xD;
      Project staff will follow-up with parents as needed to encourage questionnaire completion in&#xD;
      a timely manner. Parents will be paid $20 per assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will provide families an Echo Dot device and enable the skill using a&#xD;
      research Amazon account created for each family. The Echo Dot devices will be paired with&#xD;
      portable auxiliary battery packs to enable mobile use within the home, so that the device can&#xD;
      be carried from room to room during execution of the bedtime routine. The devices will be&#xD;
      preconfigured by project staff onto research Amazon accounts. Families without broadband&#xD;
      internet access at home will be provided a hotspot to allow high-speed access. All families&#xD;
      will be provided a pre-configured wifi adaptor that creates a wifi network specific for the&#xD;
      Echo Dot device to connect to. After enrollment, primary parents will come to one of several&#xD;
      orientation sessions to obtain their Echo Dot device, portable auxiliary battery pack, wifi&#xD;
      adaptor, and set-up instructions; staff will provide follow-up phone support as needed. Usage&#xD;
      data will show whether families have used the device; the investigators will call to assist&#xD;
      set up if parents have not enabled/used the device within 2 weeks. To ensure exposure to Talk&#xD;
      Parenting, parents will be asked to engage with the skill at least twice per week; project&#xD;
      staff will prompt parents two times (via text, email, device notification, or phone,&#xD;
      depending on parent's preference) during the 6-week session to encourage usage and provide&#xD;
      technical support as needed. Two reminders is viewed as having external validity; a parenting&#xD;
      education agency providing Talk Parenting to client families could conceivably check in with&#xD;
      parents a couple of times to remind them to use the tool and see how it is going.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, families will be asked to return the wifi adaptor to the project&#xD;
      offices; they will be free to keep the Echo Dot device and auxiliary battery pack.&#xD;

    <measure>Parenting &amp; Family Adjustment scales (PAFAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, 6 weeks (at treatment completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Measure change using the Parenting &amp; Family Adjustment Scales; the PAFAS is used to measure change in parenting practices, parents' stress, and the parent-child relationship. The 30 items on the PAFAS sort into 7 subscales with good internal consistency and construct validity: Parental consistency, Coercive parenting, Positive encouragement, Parent-child relationship, Parental adjustment/stress, Family relationships, and Parental teamwork with partner. The PAFAS will be adapted to include additional items about the presence of a bedtime routine and parents' satisfaction with how that routine is going.</description>

    <measure>Child Adjustment &amp; Parent Self-Efficacy Scale (CAPES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, 6 weeks (at treatment completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Measure change using The Child Adjustment &amp; Parent Efficacy Scale (CAPES) in children's behaviors and emotional adjustment. The Behavior Problems subscale consists of 16 problematic and 8 reverse-coded positive behaviors; the Emotional Maladjustment subscale has 3 items. The CAPES is highly correlated with the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI), a common measure for children's behavior problems, but the CAPES has the added advantage that it includes positive behavior items and emotional maladjustment, and is less burdensome for parents to complete. The CAPES will also be used to measure parent's self-efficacy; parents rate their confidence that they can successfully deal with each of the 19 negative behaviors/emotions on the CAPES. The CAPES will be adapted to include additional items about the child's cooperation before bed at bedtime.</description>

We will also ask about any problems experienced, frustrations, behaviors or relationships made worse, or points of dissatisfaction.</description>
