  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multi-center, prospective, open-label, single-arm, clinical trial to be&#xD;
      carried out in subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency manifested as afibrinogenemia&#xD;
      or severe hypofibrinogenemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is planned to be performed at study sites in multiple countries. It is&#xD;
      planned to include a maximum of 32 adult and pediatric subjects with congenital fibrinogen&#xD;
      deficiency in order to provide at least 28 evaluable acute bleeding episodes and/or surgical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
