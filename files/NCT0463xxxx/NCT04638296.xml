      Background: Noise in operating rooms (ORs) during surgery may affect OR personnel and pose a&#xD;
      threat to patient safety. The sources of noise vary depending on the operation. We aimed to&#xD;
      study how OR staff perceived noise, whether music was considered noise and what its perceived&#xD;
      effects were.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Surgeons, anesthesiologists, residents, and nurses were interviewed. IPads were&#xD;
      placed in the ORs to gather noise level data.&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           High noise levels in the operating rooms (ORs) during surgery may pose a major threat to&#xD;
           the safety and efficiency of procedures performed [1]. The recommended threshold for&#xD;
           noise should not exceed 90 dBA over an 8 hour period to prevent noise induced hearing&#xD;
           loss [2]. Unfortunately, in 40% of surgeries, OR noise levels reach and exceed 100-120&#xD;
           dBA [2], comparable to a busy highway (1). High noise levels affect both patients and&#xD;
           staff: patients may suffer from intraoperative hypertension and tachycardia [3], and&#xD;
           prolonged exposure of staff to OR noise has been linked to noise induced hearing loss&#xD;
           [4,5], to interference with communication in the OR (6) and to decrements in surgeons'&#xD;
           concentration and vigilance [4,7,8].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sources of noise in the OR stem primarily from (a) surgical instruments including high&#xD;
           speed pneumatic drills, chisels, hammers, and saws [9], (b) equipment such as vital sign&#xD;
           monitors, alarms, ventilators, anesthesia machines, waste management devices, and&#xD;
           radiological equipment [6] and (c) conversations amongst the staff [4]. Clanging,&#xD;
           clattering or dropping metal instruments is also another source of noise [1]. In&#xD;
           addition to the above, music is occasionally played in ORs, often requested and chosen&#xD;
           by the operating surgeon; whether music qualifies as just more noise is debatable [5].&#xD;
           There have been mixed reports on the effect of music on personnel performance,&#xD;
           concentration, communication, speed and cooperation [8, 10-16]. Proponents of music&#xD;
           claim that it masks some of the noise, has a calming effect, improves motivation,&#xD;
           increases accuracy, and reduces stress [1, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17]. A review of the&#xD;
           literature describes the effect of music as contributing to overall stress of the&#xD;
           environment, interfering with communication, and posing a threat to the safety of&#xD;
           patient and staff as well as to task completion [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
           The literature is lacking in research on the effects of music as a distractor during&#xD;
           operations, especially given the likelihood of unexpected stressful intraoperative&#xD;
           complications [18]. It is not clear if at a critical time in a race against the clock,&#xD;
           music incentivizes the surgeon and OR staff or if it exacerbates their stress and&#xD;
           distracts them.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our aim was to determine how surgeons, anesthesiologists, residents and nurses perceived&#xD;
           the presence of noise and music in the operating room and how they thought it affected&#xD;
           their performance, concentration and communication. The results of this study will guide&#xD;
           the design of a follow up study to determine the effects of music on outcomes of&#xD;
           specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Material and Methods 2.1 Study design and setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was an observational, cross sectional study between January 2019-January 2020 of OR&#xD;
      personnel's perceptions of noise and music in the ORs at a tertiary academic institution in&#xD;
      Beirut, Lebanon. Interviews were conducted in the privacy of the physician's lounge or in a&#xD;
      private location within the hospital at the participant's convenience. IPads were placed in&#xD;
      all of the center's ten ORs. They were placed in the corner of the ORs away from the working&#xD;
      areas and mounted on the walls to avoid interference with the work of the staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is reported in line with the STROCSS guideline [19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All OR staff were eligible for recruitment, including surgeons, anesthesiologists, residents&#xD;
      and nurses. There were no exclusion criteria per se; however, the interview had to be&#xD;
      conducted on the day the participant was involved in a surgical operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated at 85 participants. This value was based on a correlation&#xD;
      sample size calculation, with a Type I error rate of 0.05, Type II error rate of 0.2, and an&#xD;
      expected correlation coefficient of 0.3. Data for this study was collected from 91&#xD;
      participants to err on the side of caution and to maintain heterogeneity among the different&#xD;
      staff groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were recruited via a scripted invitation email detailing the specifics of the&#xD;
      study sent by the IT Academic Core Processes and Systems (ACPS) on behalf of the&#xD;
      investigating team per ethical research conduct guidelines. Willing potential participants&#xD;
      were asked to contact the study team for any questions and to schedule a private meeting for&#xD;
      the interview at their convenience. Participation was entirely voluntary, and interviews were&#xD;
      conducted following the participants' explicit written consent. Some interviews were audio&#xD;
      recorded following participant's consent; otherwise, the interviewer took notes. Interviews&#xD;
      lasted approximately 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi Structured Interview Guide The investigators designed 3 versions of the semi structured&#xD;
      interview guide for each of the surgeons/anesthesiologists.1), residents and nurses . 3). All&#xD;
      versions were subdivided into 3 general categories: 1) participant demographics such as&#xD;
      participant's age, years of experience, specialty, years of employment at the institution 2)&#xD;
      participant's perceptions of noise in the OR, what they considered as sources of noise, the&#xD;
      loudness level, whether they thought this impacted their concentration, performance,&#xD;
      communication, whether this was distracting or helpful in different stages of the operation,&#xD;
      and 3) perceptions on music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most questions were closed ended: effects of noise/music on concentration, performance and&#xD;
      communication, and levels of loudness. Answers were rated on 3- point Likert scales&#xD;
      (3-Positively, 2- Neutral, 1-Negatively and 3-High, 2- Moderate, 1- Low, respectively). These&#xD;
      were followed by open ended questions referring to the potential effects of noise and music:&#xD;
      1. At which times during surgery do you find music helpful, and why? and 2. At which times&#xD;
      during surgery do you find music distracting? Answers to these questions were reviewed and&#xD;
      collated thematically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPads IPads installed in the ORs were placed in a thin plastic bag in the corner of each&#xD;
      operating room. This is to ensure that the iPads did not interfere with the work of the&#xD;
      staff. The iPads were iPad Air Wi-Fi 64 GB. The application &quot;Sound Affects&quot; was installed on&#xD;
      the iPads and used to extract the noise data. The application was developed by Memac Ogilvy&#xD;
      for the institution based on technical requirements from the Patient Affairs Unit. It uses&#xD;
      the built in microphone of the iPad hence accounting for the relative loudness perceived by&#xD;
      the human ear, which is known as A-weighting value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data from interviews was entered into the Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS) version 24 (IBM Corp.) for analysis. Descriptive analyses were carried out&#xD;
      using the number and percent for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation for&#xD;
      continuous variables and analyzing the noise level data gathered from the sensors and iPads.&#xD;
      Pearson Chi square and correlation tests were performed to test for relationships. Narrative&#xD;
      responses to open ended questions were categorized thematically.&#xD;
