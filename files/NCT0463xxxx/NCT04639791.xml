  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to prospectively assess the asthma control and management of asthma patients&#xD;
      who are on step 4, 5 asthma of GINA in Hong Kong (on at least medium-dose ICS-LABA as&#xD;
      controller therapy for asthma) and also observe their exacerbations over 2 years. In&#xD;
      addition, this study will also assess patients who are on biologics for their suitability and&#xD;
      outcome. The investigators hope this study will be able to provided data regarding the&#xD;
      management and outcome of patients who have difficult-to-treat and severe asthma. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to build a biologic registry for asthma that would be able to help local&#xD;
      doctors to gain experience to the use of these new and expensive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre study involving public hospitals in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is important as this will generate local data for healthcare planning for severe&#xD;
      asthma in Hong Kong.&#xD;

      Background Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway&#xD;
      inflammation. It is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness&#xD;
      of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with&#xD;
      variable expiratory airflow limitation.1 The World Health Organization estimates that 300&#xD;
      million people worldwide have asthma with an associated 250,000 asthma deaths annually.2 In&#xD;
      Hong Kong, the prevalence rates of physician-diagnosed asthma in 13- to-14-year-olds were&#xD;
      10.2% in 2002,3 and 5.8% in the elderly (aged &gt;70 years) in 2003.4 The crude mortality rate&#xD;
      of asthma in 2005 in Hong Kong was 1.4/100,000.5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe asthma is not very common but casts a considerable burden on the healthcare system and&#xD;
      patients. According to a Dutch survey which included adult asthma patients, 17.4% and 3.6% of&#xD;
      them had difficult-to-treat asthma and severe asthma respectively.6 Although severe asthma&#xD;
      involves only a small proportion of the asthma population, it generates a huge amount of&#xD;
      asthma-related healthcare expenditure.7 An observational cohort by a French study group found&#xD;
      that 83% of patients with severe asthma experienced at least one exacerbation and 14% were&#xD;
      hospitalised for asthma over the past 12 months.8 Also, patients with severe asthma&#xD;
      experience a different spectrum and more severe symptoms, with higher functional and&#xD;
      psychological limitation than the general asthma population.9&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is considered as difficult-to-treat if it remains uncontrolled despite Global&#xD;
      Initiative for Asthma (GINA) step 4 or 5 treatment (e.g. medium or high dose inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids [ICS] plus a second controller), or that requires such treatment to maintain&#xD;
      good symptom control and reduce the risk of exacerbation.1 Various modifiable factors may&#xD;
      contribute to difficult-to-treat asthma, that includes incorrect inhaler technique,&#xD;
      suboptimal medication adherence, associated comorbid conditions and even wrong diagnosis.&#xD;
      Severe asthma is considered as a subset of difficult-to-treat asthma after exclusion of the&#xD;
      modifiable factors other than poorly controlled asthma itself. It is defined as asthma that&#xD;
      is uncontrolled despite adherence with maximal optimised therapy and treatment of&#xD;
      contributory factors, or that worsens when high dose treatment is decreased.1 Disease&#xD;
      phenotyping has revolutionised the management of asthma from stepwise treatment to&#xD;
      phenotype-based treatment. As asthma is a clinical syndrome comprising of several spectrums&#xD;
      of symptom, different molecular pathways may be involved. Most of these are associated with&#xD;
      evidence of cellular inflammation in the airway.10 Identifying treatable traits may&#xD;
      potentially guide the choice and predict the outcome of treatment, e.g. blood or airway&#xD;
      eosinophilia, is usually a good indicator of corticosteroid responsiveness.11 12 The process&#xD;
      of characterising observable treatable traits is termed phenotyping, and this allows&#xD;
      physicians to select the most appropriate add-on therapies for patients with severe asthma.&#xD;
      Phenotype identification is usually performed in patients on high dose ICS, as most clinical&#xD;
      trials on an add-on or biologic treatments were performed in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the various inflammatory phenotypes, Type 2 inflammation is the most important one, and&#xD;
      its mechanism forms the basis of several biologic treatments. This inflammation pathway is&#xD;
      characterised by the presence of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13. IL-4 and IL-5 promote&#xD;
      the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and eosinophils respectively, thus the occurrence of&#xD;
      eosinophilic inflammation and atopic phenomenon in asthma.1, 13&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five biologics have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for&#xD;
      antagonising the Type 2 inflammatory mechanisms in severe asthma. They are omalizumab,&#xD;
      mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab. In general, severe asthma patients with&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory features manifesting Type 2 inflammation (e.g. allergen-driven, high&#xD;
      IgE level, high eosinophil activity) and exacerbations are good candidates for such&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Hong Kong, there is no information regarding the prevalence of severe or difficult to&#xD;
      treat asthma. There is also a lack of data on how this group of severe patients are managed,&#xD;
      and also their morbidity and mortality. Biologics have been introduced into Hong Kong, and&#xD;
      there is no data on how the patients are responding to these new therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study This study aims to prospectively assess the asthma control and management&#xD;
      of asthma patients who are on step 4, 5 asthma of GINA1 in Hong Kong (on at least medium-dose&#xD;
      ICS-LABA as controller therapy for asthma) and also observe their exacerbations over 2 years.&#xD;
      In addition, this study will also assess patients who are on biologics for their suitability&#xD;
      and outcome. The investigators hope this study will be able to provided data regarding the&#xD;
      management and outcome of patients who have difficult-to-treat and severe asthma. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to build a biologic registry for asthma that would be able to help local&#xD;
      doctors to gain experience to the use of these new and expensive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre study involving public hospitals in Hong Kong. At the moment, Prince&#xD;
      of Wales Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital will join the study. The investigators will&#xD;
      invite more hospitals to join later and will get ethical approval in all involved centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is important as this will generate local data for healthcare planning for severe&#xD;
      asthma in Hong Kong.&#xD;
