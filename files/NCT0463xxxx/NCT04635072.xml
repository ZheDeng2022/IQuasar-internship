    <textblock>
      This clinical trial serves to look at the effectiveness of SWRB for the treatment of mild to&#xD;
      moderate Atopic Dermatitis in patients below the age of 18. Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a&#xD;
      common condition seen in dermatology, paediatric and primary care clinics in Malaysia. AD&#xD;
      poses a significant biopsychosocial burden among sufferers and their families. Current&#xD;
      management patterns of AD sufferers in South-east Asia mainly involve use of topical&#xD;
      moisturizers and topical corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rice bran and products derived from it have been studied regarding their anti-oxidant,&#xD;
      nutritional, cholesterol lowering and health promoting properties. However, there are very&#xD;
      few studies that have focused on the benefits of SWRB when used topically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SWRB is cost-effective and easily available, while being an under-utilised product. The&#xD;
      investigators wanted to study its effectiveness in controlling the signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      Atopic Dermatitis when used as a cleanser and topical paste (emollient) as very little is&#xD;
      known on this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to study participants below 18 years of age with mild and moderate&#xD;
      Atopic Dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be followed up for four to six (4 - 6) weeks and the clinical features&#xD;
      tabulated. This study does not involve any enteral or parenteral administration of SWRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither does it involve any invasive procedures.&#xD;

      Objective of the study To study whether the natural product, SWRB, is effective to control&#xD;
      the symptoms and signs of mild to moderate Atopic Dermatitis (AD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background, rationale &amp; justification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Atopic Dermatitis is a common condition seen in dermatology, paediatric and primary care&#xD;
           clinics in Malaysia. The overall prevalence of Atopic Dermatitis in the paediatric&#xD;
           population in Malaysia was shown to be around 13.4% in 2018 (Goh et al., 2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AD poses a significant biopsychosocial burden among sufferers and their families.&#xD;
           (Carroll et al., 2005). Current management patterns of AD sufferers in South-east Asia&#xD;
           mainly involve use of topical moisturizers and topical corticosteroids (Chan et al.,&#xD;
           2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There are many concerns among parents of sufferers of AD regarding the side effects of&#xD;
           these therapies, causing them to seek alternative therapies (Lee and Bielory, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Many emollients are available in the market which are either occlusives, hemectants or&#xD;
           both. There are also bath emollients and directly applied ones. Very little has been&#xD;
           studied regarding their effectiveness. Emollients available may also contain&#xD;
           preservatives and fragrances that can prove to be irritants when applied topically&#xD;
           (Rubel et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Rice bran and products derived from it have been studied regarding their anti-oxidant,&#xD;
           nutritional, cholesterol lowering and health promoting properties (Nagendra Prasad et&#xD;
           al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, there are very few studies that have focused on the benefits of SWRB when used&#xD;
           topically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Justification: SWRB is cost-effective and easily available, while being an&#xD;
           under-utilised product. The investigators wanted to study its effectiveness in&#xD;
           controlling the signs and symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis when used as a cleanser and&#xD;
           topical paste (emollient) as very little is known on this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology This is a clinical trial involving topical therapy with pure SWRB which is in&#xD;
      powder form, on patients below 18 years of age, who suffer from mild to moderate atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis. The SWRB is from locally grown rice and locally milled rice bran. This has been&#xD;
      recently stabilised, for the first time in Malaysia, and made suitable for human use by Rice&#xD;
      Bran Nutraceuticlas Sdn. Bhd (RBN). The SWRB is provided Free of Charge for this Study by&#xD;
      RBN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The proposed sample size is 50-100 patients of the above mentioned age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of disease in the selected sample will be assessed using the widely used SCORAD&#xD;
      index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected from out-patient clinics of&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dato' Dr S Sellappan's clinic at Loh Guan Lye Specialist Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Klinik Derma Sivasantha at 11, Jalan Sungai. 10150 Pulau Pinang.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other Doctor or Clinic who is interested in participating in this study. Written&#xD;
           consent to participate in this study will be obtained from the parent/guardian via a&#xD;
           consent form, which includes Information Leaflet for the Parent/Guardian and Participant&#xD;
           as well as Instructions to Patients for Use of SWRB as cleanser or as moisturiser.&#xD;
           Assent from the subjects from the ages from 8 to below 18 will be obtained using the&#xD;
           assent form attached. Both, the consent and the assent forms will be attached to the&#xD;
           child's medical records. Confidentiality of patient information and anonymity will be&#xD;
           maintained at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with mild AD will be given SWRB in powder form, to be used as a cleanser after&#xD;
      adding water to it according to set proportions given as instructions, one time per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with moderate disease will be instructed to use SWRB as a cleanser as above. In&#xD;
      addition, they will also use SWRB as an emollient after constituting it into a paste as in&#xD;
      instructions, apply at night and leave it overnight. This study does not involve any enteral&#xD;
      or parenteral administration of SWRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither does it involve any invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The patients will be followed up for four to six (4 - 6) weeks and the&#xD;
      clinical features tabulated . Where appropriate, photographs of the lesion/s will be taken&#xD;
      for evaluation of progression / regression at the end of the study, while protecting the&#xD;
      identity of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire using the Likert scale, will be prepared for the patient's parent/s to&#xD;
      complete. This will be to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents' opinion of the product&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ease of application&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Convenience (cleaning the bed of the powder, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents' perception regarding improvement seen/not seen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study The study will commence on 21st September 2020. The duration of this study&#xD;
      will be 4 to 6 weeks i.e. each participant will be followed up for 4 - 6 weeks for the&#xD;
      purpose of obtaining results for this study. However, follow up beyond the duration of this&#xD;
      study may continue as per participants' wishes, for the purpose of continued therapy of the&#xD;
      long -term condition, which may or may not involve SWRB. Each participant will be followed up&#xD;
      every two (2) weeks and the progression or regression of the skin lesions recorded.&#xD;
