  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      What is the problem? Every year about 2.5 million children are affected by critical illness&#xD;
      and require admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). However, both children and&#xD;
      their parents may encounter difficulties after critical illness. Children affected physically&#xD;
      may have difficulties in breathing, eating, and drinking. Parents have reported feeling&#xD;
      symptoms of stress such as nightmares and excessive worries after PICU discharge. Currently,&#xD;
      the investigators do not know when and how the problems unfold and what harm does it cause.&#xD;
      Without this information, healthcare professionals are not equipped to support these families&#xD;
      after PICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan? To understand how critical illness could affect the physical, emotional, and&#xD;
      social experiences of children age 1 month to 18 years of age and their parents in the first&#xD;
      6 months after a PICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      144 children and their parents will be followed from the time of PICU admission to 6 months&#xD;
      after discharge. Children and their parents will complete surveys to measure physical,&#xD;
      social, emotional and function outcomes. A total of 12 families will be interviewed at 1 and&#xD;
      3 months after PICU discharge. Using the data provided to map out any trend or changes in&#xD;
      this information over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is this study important? To better understand the experience and health consequences of&#xD;
      children and their parents in the first six months after PICU admission. This information&#xD;
      would help to identify potential areas to improve the negative consequence of children and&#xD;
      their families after a severe illness. Results will be shared to the PICU survivors and their&#xD;
      families, national organizations, international pediatric intensive care community to improve&#xD;
      the experiences and health outcomes following a PICU admission.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To describe and compare the change in total score of the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 (PedsQL™) in children at baseline from 6 months after PICU discharge.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL instrument consists of 23 items that evaluate 4 domains: physical, emotional, social, and school functioning with summary scores available for physical and psychological health. It is scored using a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (A lot) with a possible score of 0 to 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the correlation between race/ethnicity, children's health baseline, and PICU factors with a total score of the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 (PedsQL™) after PICU discharge.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 (PedsQL™) total score will be used to compare the difference between Chinese, Malay, and Indian families. This instrument consists of 23 items that evaluate 4 domains: physical, emotional, social, and school functioning with summary scores available for physical and psychological health. It is scored using a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (A lot) with a possible score of 0 to 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To investigate the risk factors for parental PTSD using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) six months after their child's' PICU discharge.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) assesses the 20 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The 20 items self-report measure is scored on a rating a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely). The symptoms severity score ranges from 0-80. A cut-off score between 31-33 is indicative of probable PTSD.</description>
