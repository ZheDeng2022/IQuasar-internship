  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A three-armed randomized pilot trial will be conducted with 51 women having stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence, to evaluate the acceptance and ease of use of the conventional electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG) biofeedback via vaginal probe in the treatment of urinary incontinence and that of the&#xD;
      newly developed EMG biofeedback with Bluetooth. Women will be randomly allocated to one of&#xD;
      two intervention groups (new biofeedback or conventional biofeedback) or the control group&#xD;
      (PFMT alone). Women in the intervention groups will perform PFMT either with the new&#xD;
      biofeedback or the conventional biofeedback, based on their group allocation. The control&#xD;
      group will perform PFMT without a biofeedback device. Study outcome measures include,&#xD;
      feasibility measures, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire, and 1-hour&#xD;
      pad test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Objectives: (1) to compare the acceptance and ease of use of the conventional&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG) biofeedback via vaginal probe in the treatment of urinary incontinence&#xD;
      and that of the newly developed EMG biofeedback with Bluetooth; (2) to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of conventional biofeedback, the new biofeedback, and pelvic floor muscle training&#xD;
      (PFMT) alone on urinary incontinence and adherence to PFMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: (1) The new biofeedback will be easier to use and women will more readily accept&#xD;
      it than the conventional biofeedback. (2) Women assigned to the new biofeedback group will&#xD;
      report better adherence to PFMT and greater improvements in urinary incontinence than women&#xD;
      assigned to participate in the conventional biofeedback group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects: A three-armed randomized pilot trial will be conducted with 51 women who&#xD;
      have stress urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Women will be randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups (new&#xD;
      biofeedback or conventional biofeedback) or the control group (PFMT alone). Women in the&#xD;
      intervention groups will perform PFMT either with the new biofeedback or the conventional&#xD;
      biofeedback, based on their group allocation. The control group will perform PFMT without a&#xD;
      biofeedback device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Feasibility measures, International Consultation on Incontinence&#xD;
      Questionnaire, and 1-hour pad test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and expected results: A one-way between-groups analysis of covariance will be&#xD;
      conducted. Adherence to PFMT will be better in the new biofeedback group than in the&#xD;
      conventional biofeedback group. New biofeedback will have greater beneficial effects on&#xD;
      urinary incontinence than either the conventional biofeedback or PFMT alone.&#xD;
