      A recent study showed that 6 cycles of obinutuzumab when given after at least 1 year of&#xD;
      ibrutinib did result in MRD conversion in a significant proportion of patients (50%). The&#xD;
      precise influence, timing and interplay of venetoclax, ibrutinib and obinutuzumab on&#xD;
      clearance of CLL cells in different compartments (PB, BM, LN), and achievement of uMRD and&#xD;
      complete remission (CR) are not well known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators set out a study to evaluate whether patients who are not in CR&#xD;
      or who have detectable MRD after 12 months of combination treatment with ibrutinib and&#xD;
      venetoclax (15 months total treatment including three months ibrutinib lead-in) could be&#xD;
      converted into uMRD CR with an additional 6 cycles obinutuzumab in combination with&#xD;
      ibrutinib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BCL-2 antagonist venetoclax, specifically if combined with a CD20 antibody proved highly&#xD;
      active in clearance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in peripheral blood (PB) and&#xD;
      bone marrow (BM) but less so in lymph nodes (LN), probably due to the abundant expression of&#xD;
      additional anti-apoptotic proteins within the LN compartment. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that due to the forced egress from the LN by ibrutinib, leukemic cells cannot escape from the&#xD;
      apoptosis initiating effects of venetoclax, making combination of these drugs highly&#xD;
      effective. Preliminary data from multiple ongoing trials on this combination are indeed&#xD;
      promising, with not only superior rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) than&#xD;
      other ibrutinib combinations but perhaps more important, achievement of complete LN responses&#xD;
      in the majority of patients. Yet, also with this combination, a significant subgroup of&#xD;
      patients are expected to remain with detectable MRD. A recent study showed that 6 cycles of&#xD;
      obinutuzumab when given after at least 1 year of ibrutinib did result in MRD conversion in a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients (50%). The precise influence, timing and interplay of&#xD;
      venetoclax, ibrutinib and obinutuzumab on clearance of CLL cells in different compartments&#xD;
      (PB, BM, LN), and achievement of uMRD and complete remission (CR) are not well known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators set out a study to evaluate whether patients who are not in CR&#xD;
      or who have detectable MRD after 12 months of combination treatment with ibrutinib and&#xD;
      venetoclax (15 months total treatment including three months ibrutinib lead-in) could be&#xD;
      converted into uMRD CR with an additional 6 cycles obinutuzumab in combination with&#xD;
      ibrutinib. In addition to efficacy, as measured by undetectable MRD rate, emphasis of this&#xD;
      trial will be on clearance of different compartments (PB, BM, LN) at different time points on&#xD;
      protocol and in follow up. In addition, the toxicity profile is taken into consideration.&#xD;
