      Control group (coronally advanced flap and subepithelial connective tissue graft alone) Test&#xD;
      group (coronally advanced flap and subepithelial connective tissue graft using microsurgical&#xD;
      approach) Same procedure will be executed but with the addition of vitamin C injection.&#xD;
      Intraepidermal injection (oral mesotherapy technique) of 1-1.5 ml (200-300 mg concentration)&#xD;
      of L-ascorbic acid will be done. It will be locally introduced in relation to the keratinized&#xD;
      gingival tissues with extension to the whole target region successively using special&#xD;
      syringes (30 gauge). The needle will be introduced parallel to the gingival tissues with the&#xD;
      bevel facing upwards. Vitamin C will then be delivered through the attached gingival tissues&#xD;
      at the epithelium-connective tissue junction (equivalent to epidermal- dermal junction) till&#xD;
      the tissues blanch. Vitamin C will be injected first time immediately postsurgical and then&#xD;
      repeated once per week for 3 consecutive weeks for a total of 4 injections.&#xD;

    <measure>Ginigval thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determined 2 mm apical to the gingival margin with a short needle for anesthesia and a 3 mm diameter silicon disk stop. The needle is inserted perpendicular to the mucosal surface, through the soft tissues with light pressure until a hard surface is felt. The silicon disk stop is then placed in tight contact with the soft tissue surface with the coronal border overlapping the soft tissue margin. As the needle is located in the center of the silicon disk, measurement of GT is performed 2 mm apical from the gingival margin. Once in the correct position, the disk is fixed with a drop of cyanocrylic adhesive; after careful removal of the needle, the penetration depth is measured with a caliper accurate to the nearest 0.1 mm.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured as the distance between the gingival margin and the mucogingival junction (MGJ).&#xD;
All measurements will be performed by means of the UNC periodontal probe and will be rounded up to the nearest millimeter.</description>
