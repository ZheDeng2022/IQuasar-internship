  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic Foot Ulceration (DFU) is one of the most common complication of diabetes costing the&#xD;
      NHS over Â£970m annually. Management of foot ulcers is time-consuming and expensive with 45%&#xD;
      taking more than six months to heal. Around 25% of patients re-ulcerate in 3 months, 40%&#xD;
      within 1 year and 60% within 3 years and patients who have achieved wound closure are&#xD;
      generally considered to be in remission rather than healed. A patient presenting with a foot&#xD;
      ulcer has a greatly elevated risk of amputation while 80% of amputations can be prevented&#xD;
      with the appropriate treatment, such as footwear intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ViscoTurf is a novel, 3D printed, orthotic device designed specifically for this purpose. It&#xD;
      emulates the function of natural turf to provide cushioning, optimised offloading and better&#xD;
      microcirculation on the vulnerable areas of the plantar surface of the foot. This improves&#xD;
      perfusion (the delivery of blood to the capillary bed) in the load bearing regions of the&#xD;
      foot where the risk of re-ulceration is very high. An earlier feasibility study established&#xD;
      proof-of-concept, showing ViscoTurf achieved a higher and longer-lasting increase in&#xD;
      perfusion compared to conventional support structures. ViscoTurf insoles can be automatically&#xD;
      designed to the foot size and 3D printed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the immediate effect of walking in Viscoturf&#xD;
      insole (Turf-Like insoles) on skin perfusion and pressure at the sole of the foot in diabetic&#xD;
      patients with history of ulceration. To achieve this, the immediate efficacy (effect as a&#xD;
      result of walking for 15 meters) of Viscoturf insole will be assessed and compared to that of&#xD;
      the standard flat insole. Intervention insole will be produced as 3D printed insole with the&#xD;
      Turf-Like patches incorporated in the areas of interest, while the Standard Insole will be a&#xD;
      standard 3D printed flat with NO Turf-like patches.&#xD;
