  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered an effective treatment for acne vulgaris. The study&#xD;
      aims to determine whether treatment with daylight as an illumination source is as effective&#xD;
      as conventional, red light illumination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 patients with acne vulgaris received 4 treatment sessions at three-week intervals. First,&#xD;
      5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was applied to the entire face. Then the face was divided into&#xD;
      two symmetrical contralateral treatment areas: the left was covered with a light-impermeable&#xD;
      dressing, while the right face was exposed to sunlight. After 2 hours outdoors, the right&#xD;
      side of the face was covered, and the left half was illuminated with red light.&#xD;

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered an effective treatment for acne vulgaris .One of the&#xD;
      most important drawbacks of PDT is the pain during illumination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that daylight PDT is an effective treatment for actinic keratosis. In order&#xD;
      to examine the efficacy of daylight PDT for acne vulgaris, we used a split-face design: the&#xD;
      face was divided into two symmetrical contralateral treatment areas: the left was covered&#xD;
      with a light-impermeable dressing, while the right face was exposed to daylight. After 2&#xD;
      hours outdoors, the right side of the face was covered, and the left half was illuminated&#xD;
      with red light.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>&quot;Split Face design&quot; is a common model used in dermatology to study the difference between two treatments on a facial condition. The face was divided into two symmetrical contralateral treatment areas: the left was covered with a light-impermeable dressing, while the right face was exposed to sunlight. After 2 hours outdoors, the right side of the face was covered, and the left half was illuminated with red light.</intervention_model_description>
