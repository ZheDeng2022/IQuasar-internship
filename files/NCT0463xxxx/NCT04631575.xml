        to enter the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The informed consent is signed before the trial, and the content, process and possible&#xD;
             adverse reactions are fully understood; Be able to complete the study according to the&#xD;
             requirements of the test scheme;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both male and female, subjects aged 18 to 65 years (including both ends) on the date&#xD;
             of signing informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The body weight of male subjects is ≥50 kg, while female subjects is ≥45 kg. Body mass&#xD;
             index (BMI) is in the range of 18.5 kg/m2-30 kg/m2;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic stable primary liver disease is necessary for patients with liver impairment,&#xD;
             then patients with Grade-A/mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh score: 5-6) and&#xD;
             Grade-B/moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7-6) are assessed according to&#xD;
             Child-Pugh classification;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide documentary evidence of confirmed liver impairment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have stable medication regimen for liver impairment, complications and&#xD;
             other concomitant diseases within at least 28 days before taking the experimental&#xD;
             drug, and the medication does not need to be adjusted (including drug type, dosage or&#xD;
             frequency) during the clinical trials; or those who do not use the drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The function of vital organs meets the following criteria: Absolute neutrophil count&#xD;
             (ANC) ≥ 1.0 × 109 / L (1000 / mm3); Platelet ≥ 75.0 × 109 / L (75000 / mm3);&#xD;
             Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9.0 g / dL (90g / L); ALT and AST ≤ 5ULN; Creatinine clearance rate&#xD;
             (CLcr) ≥ 60 mL / min; The corrected QTc interval (QTcF) ≤ 450 msec (male), ≤ 470 msec&#xD;
             (female);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition to liver impairment and complications, the investigator judged good&#xD;
             condition according to the history inquiry, vital signs, physical examination, routine&#xD;
             laboratory examination, 12-lead ECG, EEG, etc., and there was no other clinically&#xD;
             significant abnormality;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No family planning during the trial and within 6 months after the last administration&#xD;
             of the trial drug, and voluntarily take effective contraceptive measures; Serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test must be negative within 7 days before the experimental drug for women&#xD;
             of childbearing age.&#xD;
