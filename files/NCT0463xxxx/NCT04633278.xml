  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMP-001-007 is a Phase 2 study of CMP-001 intratumoral (IT) and pembrolizumab intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) administered to participants with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who have&#xD;
      not been previously treated with a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blocking antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the Investigator-assessed confirmed&#xD;
      objective response with CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMP-001 administered by intratumoral (IT)&#xD;
           injection in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with HNSCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with&#xD;
           HNSCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and programmed&#xD;
           death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressions on the efficacy of CMP-001 in combination with&#xD;
           pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue to receive treatment of CMP-001 and pembrolizumab according to the&#xD;
      treatment schedule until a reason for treatment discontinuation is reached.&#xD;
