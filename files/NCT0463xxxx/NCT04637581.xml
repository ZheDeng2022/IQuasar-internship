  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation quasi-experimental&#xD;
      trial. Participants are drawn from two different communities contemporaneously. The&#xD;
      intervention participants in one community receive a Wraparound intervention. Comparison&#xD;
      group participants drawn from a second matched community receive treatment as usual. With&#xD;
      this design, the investigators aim to study outcomes associated with the intervention as well&#xD;
      as explore important facilitators and barriers associated with the implementation and other&#xD;
      factors associated with reach / participation, engagement and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wraparound is a structured 12-month family-driven &quot;process&quot; that is guided by family goals,&#xD;
      includes a team of supports to wrap around families, and coordinates care for families.&#xD;
      Wraparound has been primarily delivered and tested with families of older-age children with&#xD;
      severe emotional and behavioral needs in an attempt to prevent residential placement. The&#xD;
      investigators are interested in testing the model in a sample of families (n=160) affected by&#xD;
      substance use disorders who have children placed outside the home or are at risk of such&#xD;
      placement. The investigators hypothesize that families receiving Wraparound will obtain&#xD;
      better parenting and family functioning outcomes (primary outcome); child safety, permanency,&#xD;
      and well-being; and parental recovery than families receiving treatment as usual. The&#xD;
      investigators will also explore factors associated with higher levels of engagement and&#xD;
      outcomes, including family characteristics, referral sources and hand-off, and similarly,&#xD;
      explore barriers and facilitators associated with engagement and/or outcomes.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The Research Questions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do families receiving Wraparound intervention achieve higher parenting and family&#xD;
           functioning outcomes than treatment as usual?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do children of Wraparound families achieve higher levels of child well-being, safety and&#xD;
           permanency than those receiving treatment as usual?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do parents receiving Wraparound intervention achieve greater reductions in addiction&#xD;
           severity, trauma symptoms, and more sustained recovery than those receiving treatment as&#xD;
           usual?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does participation in a Wraparound lead to greater engagement in services and&#xD;
           development of family strengths?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What factors lead to higher levels of engagement and better outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What are the barriers and facilitators associated with engagement and outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection and analytic plan described in this document include only those&#xD;
      activities planned for research questions 1-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment. Enrollment into the study will begin fall 2020 and run through spring 2023 for a&#xD;
      total of 30 months. The project has multiple referral sites spanning medical centers,&#xD;
      addiction treatment or recovery centers, child protection, family courts, family resource&#xD;
      centers, and other social service agencies. The investigators plan for a rolling recruitment&#xD;
      process, aiming for 40 participants enrolled per year. (Wraparound case-loads should not&#xD;
      exceed 10 families and there are 2 Wraparound coordinators).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group balance (size, Division of Children Youth and Families involvement, other demographics)&#xD;
      will be monitored by the evaluation team at least semi-annually (which should be sufficient&#xD;
      given the 12-month intervention) and any adjustments to the sampling procedures will be&#xD;
      reviewed with the Data Safety Monitoring Board and national cross-site evaluation liaison&#xD;
      before executing. When cases from either group are lost to follow-up or Wraparound caseloads&#xD;
      drop below 10 families per Wraparound coordinator at any given time, the investigators will&#xD;
      randomly select families from a short-term wait list or if necessary, re-engage referral&#xD;
      sites to enroll and consent at least four families from which to randomize into the&#xD;
      intervention and treatment-as-usual groups to restore target sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection. Outcomes will be measured on five domains: Family Functioning (primary),&#xD;
      Child Well-Being, Child Safety, Child Permanency, Parent Recovery. Outcome measures for the&#xD;
      domains of family functioning (primary outcome; parenting and parent depression), child&#xD;
      wellbeing (child behaviors/functioning), and parent recovery (addiction severity, trauma&#xD;
      symptoms) will be collected from participants in both study arms at baseline, 6 months&#xD;
      (mid-point), and 12 months (post-intervention/treatment as usual). The battery of outcome&#xD;
      measures will take around 60 minutes to complete at each of the 3 time points. Child safety&#xD;
      and permanency data, as well as parent engagement in substance use disorder treatment and&#xD;
      recovery services will come from New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services&#xD;
      administrative records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project coordinator or Wraparound coordinator will conduct the baseline Wraparound data&#xD;
      collection on both intervention and treatment-as-usual families. Midpoint and endpoint&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted by members of the evaluation team to help reduce bias. Midpoint&#xD;
      and endpoint assessments will not be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also gather state-level Department of Health and Human Services&#xD;
      administrative data on all recovery domain adults and all children involved in cases whether&#xD;
      in the Wraparound intervention or treatment as usual groups. The investigators will request&#xD;
      all available data for adults (from when they turned age 18 through the end of the grant -&#xD;
      Sept. 2024) and lifetime data (from birth through end of grant) for children who are a part&#xD;
      of the case. The investigators estimate 2 children per family. Not all enrolled families will&#xD;
      have had past involvement with the Division of Children Youth and Families. The investigators&#xD;
      estimate that 75% of cases will have past or current Division of Children Youth and Families&#xD;
      involvement and have administrative data on children. A data share agreement between New&#xD;
      Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health, and Dartmouth&#xD;
      College is underway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management. All participant data will be stored in a Health Insurance Portability and&#xD;
      Accountability Act-, and Service Organization Control 1/2/3-compliant, password-protected,&#xD;
      encrypted database serving as the central project data management system. Each case and case&#xD;
      member (parent, child, other guardian/caregiver) will be assigned a unique case identifier at&#xD;
      the time of enrollment and consent into the study. The only people who will have credentialed&#xD;
      full access to the data will be members of the evaluation team. Other project team members&#xD;
      will have limited credentialed access to be able to enter data on children and parents and&#xD;
      view data reports (individual or aggregate). A Data Share Agreement is in progress to assist&#xD;
      with administrative data sharing between Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health, Dartmouth College, and&#xD;
      the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses. Given the complexity and multi-level nature of the data in this study (e.g.,&#xD;
      children nested in families; families referred from different access points), the&#xD;
      investigators will employ a range of analytic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child-Level Outcomes: The investigators will use generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the Wraparound intervention on child well-being over time and compared&#xD;
      to the children in the treatment as usual group. They will use generalized linear mixed&#xD;
      modeling, which models both fixed and random effects and provides flexibility for modeling&#xD;
      outcomes with binary or non-normal distributions and clustered or grouped data. Link&#xD;
      functions within generalized linear mixed models will model outcomes measured on binary or&#xD;
      dichotomous scales (e.g., logistic/logit link), continuous scales (e.g., regression/identity&#xD;
      link), and counts (e.g., Poisson regression/log link). Most of the child well-being measures&#xD;
      will be continuous in nature, but some safety and permanency data will be binary. Analyses&#xD;
      will also control for potential covariates associated with the different referral/access&#xD;
      point (e.g., those involved and not involved with New Hampshire Division of Children Youth&#xD;
      and Families).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child well-being measures differ by age group. One measure is used with very young children&#xD;
      (Infant-Toddler Sensory-Profile, children 0-18 months), and two versions of another measure&#xD;
      (Child Behavior Checklist) are divided by age (10 months - 5 years; 6 -18 years). Scores from&#xD;
      the two versions of the Child Behavior Checklist can be combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent- and Family-Level Outcomes: The investigators will use Repeated Measures Analysis of&#xD;
      Variance and McNemar's Chi-square to demonstrate the effects of program participation on&#xD;
      parent (e.g., recovery measures, parenting skills) and family outcomes. Where covariates are&#xD;
      important to model, they will use repeated measures Analysis of Covariance and logistic&#xD;
      regression. Multiple regression will identify factors that explain family engagement and&#xD;
      perceptions of support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events. The study team, Wraparound coordinators, and evaluators (during midpoint and&#xD;
      endpoint assessments and check-ins) will closely monitor adverse events. They will report any&#xD;
      adverse event (e.g., suicide attempt, drug overdose) immediately to the Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board and Data Safety and Monitoring Board (already established) to carefully consider&#xD;
      whether the study impacted these events, how to best support the participant, and how to&#xD;
      otherwise report and mitigate the events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change management. Not applicable. No registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power. With a minimum of 80 parents for whom self-reported family functioning&#xD;
      and recovery outcomes are expected in each group, the investigators have ample power (0.99)&#xD;
      to detect a medium effect size across three time points (η2=.06), assuming moderate&#xD;
      correlations (0.3) between the 3 time points and alpha of .05. For parent administrative data&#xD;
      gathered from the New Hampshire Bureau for Drug and Alcohol Services, the investigators&#xD;
      estimate 1 parent per family, leading to 80 per group. However, the investigators expect 90%&#xD;
      (n=72 per arm) of these parents to have administrative data available in the Bureau for Drug&#xD;
      and Alcohol Services. This analysis will be powered at .99 to detect a medium effect size&#xD;
      with an alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children, the investigators estimate having 65 children in each group for whom the same&#xD;
      child well-being measure (Child Behavior Checklist) will be available. (the investigators&#xD;
      will only collect this measure on 1 focal child per family). For this child well-being&#xD;
      outcome, the investigators estimate power at .99 to detect differences of medium effect size&#xD;
      (η2=.06) across three time points assuming moderate correlations (0.3) in the measures&#xD;
      between time points and an alpha of 0.05. In terms of child safety and permanency&#xD;
      administrative data comparisons, the investigators estimate 2 children per family (n=160; 80&#xD;
      per group). However, the investigators expect about 75% of children to be involved with the&#xD;
      New Hampshire Department of Children Youth and Families and only those with this involvement&#xD;
      will have administrative data (child safety, permanency) available. The investigators&#xD;
      therefore estimate 60 in each group. The analyses are still powered at .99 to detect a medium&#xD;
      effect size with an alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcomes data (at the individual level) will also be used in a national cross-site&#xD;
      evaluation to study intervention effects with a combined sample across all grantees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data. The outcomes analyses will utilize an intention to treat approach to&#xD;
      minimize potential for bias based on drop out from the intervention and loss to follow-up,&#xD;
      and imputation to account for missing data.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Expecting parent or parent/guardian of children birth to age 17 where one or both&#xD;
             parents report or screen positively for a substance use disorder (SUD) within the past&#xD;
             year, excluding tobacco or cannabis/marijuana as the primary substance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For court guardianship cases and cases where children are in foster care, where one or&#xD;
             both birth parents have a substance use disorder, a birth parent is willing to consent&#xD;
             to make a good faith effort to be part of the Wraparound process and complete recovery&#xD;
             measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Child(ren) in out-of-home placement or at risk for out of home placement; &quot;at risk&quot;&#xD;
             means: 1) strongly considered or have made reports to the New Hampshire Division of&#xD;
             Children Youth and Families or the child would be at high risk of removal if not for&#xD;
             the intervention. In addition, for guardianship cases, the child's placement with the&#xD;
             guardian needs to be at risk for disruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Parent/guardian is age 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Parent/guardian has cognitive capacity to consent to research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. For intervention: Parent/guardian lives in Sullivan or Lower Grafton counties in New&#xD;
             Hampshire (Division of Children Youth and Families Claremont District Office catchment&#xD;
             area) or Windsor, upper Windham, and lower Orange County, VT (Hartford and Springfield&#xD;
             VT Department of Children and Families district office catchment areas). For the&#xD;
             comparison group, parents live within the catchment area of the Keene, NH DCYF&#xD;
             district office (Cheshire County, NH and surrounding towns). Parents do not have plans&#xD;
             to move outside of these towns within the next 12 mo. *If the parent lives within the&#xD;
             catchment area, and the child is placed outside of the catchment area, the foster&#xD;
             parent (outside of catchment area) must be willing to make a good faith effort to be&#xD;
             involved with the Wraparound process and complete the child well-being measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Exclude if at time of eligibility assessment into the study, the Termination of&#xD;
             Parental Rights (TPR) hearing is scheduled. *If the termination hearing is scheduled&#xD;
             later, during the course of the intervention, the investigators will continue working&#xD;
             with the child(ren) or family if the new guardian with legal authority to consent to&#xD;
             the study consents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Exclude if the child is in residential care and there is no plan for the child to&#xD;
             return home within 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Exclude if the parent/guardian is in residential treatment and there is no plan for&#xD;
             the parent/guardian to return home within 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Exclude if the parent/guardian lacks the cognitive capacity to provide informed&#xD;
             consent to research.&#xD;
