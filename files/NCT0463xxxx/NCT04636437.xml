  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to see if people with HIV who had a significant weight&#xD;
      gain after starting INSTI (integrase strand transfer inhibitor)+TAF/FTC (tenofovir&#xD;
      alafenamide/emtricitabine) (TAF/3TC (lamivudine)) regimen could either slow their rate of&#xD;
      weight gain or lose weight within about 1 year if they switch to a regimen containing&#xD;
      doravirine (DOR; a newer, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor medication). The&#xD;
      study will also try to see if participants changing from TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) to TDF/FTC (or&#xD;
      TDF/3TC) will experience less additional weight gain or a reduction in overall body weight at&#xD;
      48 weeks compared to persons continued on an INSTI + TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) combination.&#xD;
      INSTINs assessed in A5391 include bictegravir (BIC), dolutegravir (DTG), or raltegravir&#xD;
      (RAL). Additionally, the study will see whether a change in ART can affect things like waist&#xD;
      circumference, metabolic and cardiovascular health, fat and lean mass body composition, bone&#xD;
      health, and maintenance of virologic suppression. Finally, the study will look at the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of DOR plus either TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) versus TDF/FTC (or TDF/3TC).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness of participant or legal guardian/representative to provide&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;

             immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a&#xD;
             licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial&#xD;
             rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. If a&#xD;
             rapid HIV test or any FDA-approved HIV-1 E/CIA test kit is not available, two HIV-1&#xD;
             RNA values ≥2000 copies/mL at least 24 hours apart may be performed by any US&#xD;
             laboratory that has a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification&#xD;
             or its equivalent, or by any non-US laboratory that is DAIDS Good Clinical Laboratory&#xD;
             Practice (GCLP) compliant and, if performing HIV-1 RNA testing, is Virology Quality&#xD;
             Assurance (VQA)-certified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit, or for sites located in&#xD;
        countries other than the United States, a kit that has been certified or licensed by an&#xD;
        oversight body within that country and validated internally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        World Health Organization (WHO) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&#xD;
        guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is&#xD;
        different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test&#xD;
        should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a&#xD;
        different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus&#xD;
        competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently, on a BIC (bictegravir), DTG (dolutegravir), or RAL (raltegravir) +TAF/FTC&#xD;
             (or TAF/3TC) regimen with ≥48 weeks INSTI+TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) dosing prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE A: Participants who did not start TAF at the same time as they started an INSTI will&#xD;
        be eligible if they started TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) ≥48 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE B: Participants who underwent within-INSTI class substitutions (including from EVG&#xD;
        (elvitegravir) to BIC, DTG, or RAL) will be eligible if substitution occurred ≥24 weeks&#xD;
        prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE C: Participants are permitted ART adherence gaps of ≤7 days (i.e., missed doses), with&#xD;
        a maximum of 3 gaps in the 48 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to acquire NRTIs (TAF/FTC or TAF/3TC, and TDF/FTC or TDF/3TC) and INSTI&#xD;
             through usual care for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A BMI ≥27.5 kg/m2 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An unintentional &gt;10% weight gain in the 1-3 years after initiating or switching to&#xD;
             INSTI-based ART and with ≥48 weeks of TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) preceding enrollment, as&#xD;
             ascertained from clinical records, with no other medically apparent reason to readily&#xD;
             explain the weight gain (including, but not limited to, concomitant medication use&#xD;
             [e.g., corticosteroids], Cushing's disease, recent prolonged hospitalization, etc.),&#xD;
             in the opinion of the site investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No known plans to change or to initiate medications known to be associated with&#xD;
             significant weight changes during study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to adhere to assigned ART during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one HIV-1 RNA level &lt;50 copies/mL (or below the lower limit of HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
             detection available at the site if the lower limit of detection is &gt;50) performed in&#xD;
             the 48 weeks prior (≤48 weeks) to study screening, and at least one HIV-1 RNA level&#xD;
             &lt;50 copies/mL ≥48 weeks prior to study screening, using an FDA-approved assay&#xD;
             performed by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or at&#xD;
             any network-approved non-US laboratory that is VQA certified. HIV-1 RNA values prior&#xD;
             to the screening visit will be assessed for eligibility by the site and assay dates&#xD;
             and values do not need to be entered on an eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL (or below the lower limit of HIV-1 RNA detection&#xD;
             available if the lower limit of detection is &gt;50) performed within 45 days prior to&#xD;
             study entry by any US laboratory that possesses a CLIA certification or its&#xD;
             equivalent, or at any network-approved non-US laboratory that is VQA certified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants capable of becoming pregnant, negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 45 days prior to study entry by any US clinic or laboratory that has a CLIA&#xD;
             certification or its equivalent, or is using a point of care (POC)/ CLIA-waived test,&#xD;
             or at any network-approved non-US laboratory or clinic that operates in accordance&#xD;
             with GCLP and participates in appropriate external quality assurance programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Participants capable of becoming pregnant are defined as individuals who were&#xD;
        assigned a female sex at birth and of reproductive potential; (i.e., have reached menarche&#xD;
        and who have not been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, and have not&#xD;
        undergone surgical sterilization such as hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal&#xD;
        ligation, or salpingectomy). This includes transgender men who could become pregnant if&#xD;
        menstruation were not suppressed. Participant-reported history is acceptable documentation&#xD;
        of menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants engaging in sexual activity and capable of becoming pregnant must agree&#xD;
             to use contraception while on study drug (approximately 48 weeks) and for 8 weeks&#xD;
             after the end of the study. At least one of the following contraceptive methods must&#xD;
             be used:&#xD;

                  participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Participant report of partner sterilization is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Transgender participants who are currently taking hormones must be on a stable hormone&#xD;
             dose for &gt;12 weeks prior to study entry. Transgender participants should not have&#xD;
             active plans to change their hormone regimen or dose during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: As some transgender participants may also use hormones purchased outside of the&#xD;
        medical system (e.g., street hormones), the medication history should include questions&#xD;
        about the use of these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to study entry by any US&#xD;
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or at any network-approved&#xD;
