  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Mindfulness-based&#xD;
      Therapeutic Sailing (MBTS) versus a standard recreation therapy activity (bowling) among&#xD;
      Veterans with psychiatric and/or substance use disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this investigation are to determine whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MBTS will result in greater pre- to post-intervention increases in psychological&#xD;
           flexibility and state mindfulness than a standard recreation therapy activity (SRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MBTS participants will experience greater enjoyment of the activity than SRT&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MBTS will result in greater pre- to post-intervention increases in positive affect and&#xD;
           decreases in anxiety as measured as compared to the SRT participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MBTS participants will exhibit improved outcomes, as compared to the SRT group, in the&#xD;
           3-month post-intervention period.&#xD;

    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>We want to determine if MBTS will result in greater pre- to post-intervention increases in psychological flexibility, as measured by the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ2), than a standard recreation therapy activity (SRT). The scale for each question of AAQ2 ranges from 1 to 7. A larger score means a worse outcome-less flexibility.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in the change of Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS) measure for MBTS and SRT</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>We want to determine if MBTS will result in greater pre- to post-intervention increases in state mindfulness, as measured by the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS), than a standard recreation therapy activity (SRT). The scale for each question of TMS ranges from 0 to 4. A larger score means a better outcome-greater curiosity or decentering depending on the question.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in the change of Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)measure for MBTS and SRT</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>We want to determine if MBTS will result in greater pre- to post-intervention increases in positive affect, as measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), as compared to the SRT participants. The scale for each question of PANAS ranges from 1 to 5. A larger score indicates a positive or negative effect depending on the question.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in the change of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) measure for MBTS and SRT</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>We want to determine if MBTS will result in greater pre- to post-intervention decreases in anxiety, as measured by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), as compared to the SRT participants. The scale for each question of STAI ranges from 1 to 4. A larger score may indicate greater or smaller level of anxiety depending on a question.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in the change of psychiatric hospitalizations for MBTS and SRT</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>We want to determine if MBTS participants will exhibit improved outcomes, as compared to the SRT group, in the 3 month post-intervention period as measured by number of psychiatric hospitalizations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in the change of Emergency Department (ED) visits for MBTS and SRT</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>We want to determine if MBTS participants will exhibit improved outcomes, as compared to the SRT group, in the 3 month post-intervention period as measured by number of ED visits for psychiatric reasons.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in the change of Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES)measure for MBTS and SRT</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>We want to determine if MBTS participants will experience greater enjoyment of the activity, as measured by the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES), than SRT participants. The scale for each question of PACES ranges from 1 to 7. A larger score indicates a positive or negative experience with the activity depending on the question.</description>
