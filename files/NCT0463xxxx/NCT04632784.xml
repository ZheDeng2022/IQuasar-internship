  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, open-label, single-arm, and multicentre clinical investigation&#xD;
      with three years of follow-up. Artiflex Presbyopic is a phakic intraocular lens to be&#xD;
      implanted in the anterior chamber, intended for adult subjects and indicated for the optical&#xD;
      correction of presbyopia and spherical error requiring a correction. The results of this&#xD;
      study will be used for CE-approval and registration as well as marketing purposes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presbyopic adult&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential for binocular vision&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject wishes to be spectacle independent for near and far vision&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refractive error that can be corrected with correction at PIOL plane from +2.0 to&#xD;
             -15.0 D&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject requiring a presbyopic correction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A distance corrected near visual acuity of 20/60 or worse (0.48 LogMAR or higher)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable refraction (±0.75 D), as expressed by manifest refraction spherical equivalent&#xD;
             (MRSE) for a minimum of 12 months prior to surgery, verified by consecutive&#xD;
             refractions and/or medical records or prescription history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expected best-corrected visual acuity of 0.2 logMAR (0.63 Snellen decimal) or better&#xD;
             after lens implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current contact lens wearer should demonstrate stable refraction (± 0.5 D), expressed&#xD;
             as subjective refraction spherical equivalent, on two consecutive examination dates&#xD;
             performed at least 7 days apart. Before the first refraction, the contact lens wearer&#xD;
             should not have worn lenses for at least 2 weeks in case of rigid and toric contact&#xD;
             lenses, or 3 days for spherical soft contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any subject, who is expected to have a residual postoperative cylindrical refractive&#xD;
             error of below 0.75 D&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability, willingness and sufficient cognitive awareness and physical ability to&#xD;
             comply with examination procedures throughout the entire duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pre-existing pathology or physiology which may be aggravated by the implant or where the&#xD;
        implant may interfere with the possibility of examining or treating the disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preoperative ocular or systemic condition or medication use that would be expected to&#xD;
             present an undue risk to the subject, that can predispose for future complications or&#xD;
             confound the outcome(s) of the study. E.g. the systemic use of alpha-1a adrenergic&#xD;
             receptor antagonists was suggested to increase the occurrence of intraoperative floppy&#xD;
             iris syndrome, alter iris morphology - or more specifically reduce iris thickness at&#xD;
             the site of potential IOL enclavation - and increase postoperative endothelial cell&#xD;
             loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous ocular surgery which might affect the outcome of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent participation or participation during the last 30 days in another drug or&#xD;
             device investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a distance corrected near visual acuity of better than 20/60 or 0.48&#xD;
             LogMAR.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Preoperative anterior chamber depth measurement of below 3.0 mm from corneal&#xD;

             critical distance between PIOL and endothelium of 1.5 mm or more as simulated with&#xD;
             anterior segment imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;

             corneal dystrophy, or other)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular surface conditions which might influence the quality of vision and affect the&#xD;
             outcome of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal pupil (e.g. nonreactive, fixed)&#xD;
&#xD;
