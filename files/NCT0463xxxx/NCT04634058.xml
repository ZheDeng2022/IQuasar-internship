      The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-L1 antibody combined with the CTLA-4&#xD;
      antibody in patients with advanced ICC who progressed after standard treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of unresectable and metastatic intrahepatic biliary tract cancer (ICC) is&#xD;
      extremely poor. The median overall survival of first-line gemcitabine and cisplatin for&#xD;
      advanced biliary tumors (including ICC) is only 11.7 months. Currently, there is no standard&#xD;
      second-line or third-line treatment for advanced ICC, and there is an urgent need to develop&#xD;
      new treatment methods to improve patient survival. Chronic inflammation caused by viral&#xD;
      infections and bile duct stones is the most common potential risk factor for ICC. The&#xD;
      abnormal immune system plays a key role in the occurrence and development of ICC. The immune&#xD;
      checkpoint molecules PD-L1 and CTLA-4 are overexpressed in ICC, and they are obviously&#xD;
      heterogeneous, so immunotherapy has potential value. Immune checkpoint inhibitors against&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 show a good objective remission rate in advanced biliary tumors (including ICC).&#xD;
      CTLA-4 inhibitors combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors show significant clinical enhancement&#xD;
      Role, CTLA-4 inhibitors combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been clinically studied in a&#xD;
      number of solid tumors. In this phase II clinical study, we will evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of PD-L1 monoclonal antibody combined with CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody in patients with&#xD;
      advanced ICC who progressed after standard treatment.&#xD;
