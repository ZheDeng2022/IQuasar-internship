  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial investigates the side effects of genetically engineered cells called&#xD;
      FH-MagIC TCR-T cells and how well they work with atezolizumab in treating patients with&#xD;
      triple negative breast cancer, urothelial cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body (metastatic). T cells are infection fighting blood cells&#xD;
      that can kill tumor cells. The T cells given in this study will come from the patient and&#xD;
      will have a new gene put in them that makes them able to recognize MAGE-A1, a protein on the&#xD;
      surface of tumor cells. These MAGE-A1-specific T cells may help the body's immune system&#xD;
      identify and kill MAGE-A1 tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving FH-MagIC TCR-T cells with atezolizumab may&#xD;
      help treat patients with triple negative breast cancer, urothelial cancer, or non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I, dose escalation study of FH-MagIC TCR-T cells followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LYMPHODEPLETION: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) and fludarabine IV on&#xD;
      days -4, -3, and -2 before each T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive FH-MagIC TCR-T cells IV over 15-20 minutes. Six to twelve&#xD;
      weeks after first T-cell infusion, patients with progressive disease and non-persisting&#xD;
      transgenic TCR T cells may receive a second T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase 2 portion of the study, atezolizumab will be administered as standard of care&#xD;
      beginning 24-72 hours after T-cell infusion. Atezolizumab will be given IV every 3 weeks for&#xD;
      at least 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If an&#xD;
      alternative PD1 inhibitor is instead available for a patient, it may be substituted instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 15 years after&#xD;
      final infusion of FH-MagIC TCR-T.&#xD;

             consultation with the investigator. Similarly, should an investigator determine that a&#xD;
