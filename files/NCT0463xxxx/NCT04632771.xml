  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot aims to generate data that are critical for informing the design of a planned,&#xD;
      more detailed study to evaluate the effect of multiple micronutrient (MN)-fortified bouillon&#xD;
      cube on biomarkers of nutrient status of women and children. Data collection includes&#xD;
      measures of nutritional status and dietary intake among women and children and their&#xD;
      households in communities in northern Ghana.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Micronutrient (MN) deficiencies are severe and widespread in West Africa&#xD;
      including Ghana, which contributes to impaired growth and development in children, increased&#xD;
      risk of mortality, and low economic productivity in adults. While large-scale intervention&#xD;
      programs (including salt iodization and cooking oil and wheat flour fortification) exist,&#xD;
      these programs are often not well-monitored, and they often provide only a subset of&#xD;
      nutrients or reach only a subset of the deficient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bouillon cubes may be an ideal fortification vehicle for delivering micronutrients in West&#xD;
      Africa because they are purchased by most households (including rural and poorer households),&#xD;
      added to home-made meals and consumed by most members of the household in relatively constant&#xD;
      amounts, and they are mainly processed centrally at large scale. However, several important&#xD;
      questions must be addressed regarding the extent to which multi-fortified bouillon cubes can&#xD;
      address inadequate intake of key micronutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This pilot aims to generate data that are critical for informing the design of a&#xD;
      planned, more detailed study to evaluate the effect of multiple micronutrient-fortified&#xD;
      bouillon cube on biomarkers of nutrient status of women and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This will be a cross-sectional study, which will be conducted in the Kumbungu and&#xD;
      Tolon districts in the Northern Region, where a recent survey showed that micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies were common. Four sets of research activities will be carried out, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pilot survey: The investigators will recruit non-pregnant, non-lactating women of&#xD;
           reproductive age, WRA (n = 250), children 2-5 years of age (n = 250), and lactating&#xD;
           women (n= 250) who will be identified from households in selected communities using the&#xD;
           random walk method. Information collected will include anthropometric and micronutrient&#xD;
           status, hemoglobin concentration, inflammation, morbidity, household-level food&#xD;
           consumption, and individual dietary intakes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Retinol isotope dilution (RID) Pilot Study 1: The investigators will recruit&#xD;
           non-pregnant and nonlactating women of reproductive age, WRA (n = 30) from a subset of&#xD;
           the same communities as the pilot survey using the random walk method, and&#xD;
           quantitatively estimate their total body vitamin A stores after consuming a dose of&#xD;
           d6-labelled vitamin A. Total body stores of vitamin A will be estimated at 14 days after&#xD;
           dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Retinol isotope dilution (RID) Pilot Study 2 (kinetic study): Based on results from RID&#xD;
           pilot study 1, the investigators will recruit non-pregnant and non-lactating women of&#xD;
           reproductive age, WRA (n = 123) from a subset of the same communities as the pilot&#xD;
           survey using the random walk method, to construct a population-level plasma retinol&#xD;
           kinetic curve, after consuming a dose of d6-labelled vitamin A. A compartmental model&#xD;
           will be fit to the plasma retinol kinetic data to develop population-specific&#xD;
           coefficients for the RID prediction equation to quantitatively estimate total body&#xD;
           vitamin A stores of WRA in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Formative research: The investigators will (a) conduct focus group discussions on&#xD;
           knowledge, attitudes and practices related to salt and bouillon cube use, nutrition and&#xD;
           health problems in the community, and micronutrient fortification; (b) perform a market&#xD;
           assessment of the availability and cost of fortified, non-fortified and potentially&#xD;
           fortifiable foods in the communities; and (c) observe how various local food recipes are&#xD;
           prepared, including the types and quantities of ingredients used, and cooking duration&#xD;
           and temperature.&#xD;
