      LATERAL COLPORRHAPHY: A NEW SURGICAL INTERVENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CASE SERIES STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The surgical anatomy of site-specific defects of lateral vaginal wall (LVW)&#xD;
      prolapse into the canal and its treatment are described for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Thirty-two women who presented with symptomatic LVW prolapse (deep&#xD;
      dyspareunia, sensation of vaginal fulness, and heaviness) were study. Before surgery, gross&#xD;
      anatomy and the lateral colporrhaphy rehearsals had been performed on ten-human fresh female&#xD;
      cadavers. A case series study was designed and conducted. Objectives were to ascertain the&#xD;
      surgical anatomy within lateral vaginal wall site-specific defects; to evaluate whether&#xD;
      lateral colporrhaphy can cure or improve symptoms; to describe a new lateral colporrhaphy.&#xD;
      The primary outcome measured occurrences of site-specific defects within the lateral vaginal&#xD;
      wall. The secondary outcome measured objective and subjective cure rates of lateral&#xD;
      colporrhaphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results Twenty-eight women (87.5%) concluded the study. The mean age of women was 46 ± 12&#xD;
      years, BMI 26.7 ± 2 kg/m2, and vaginal parity 2 ± 1. In all subjects, LVW defects had bulged&#xD;
      into the vaginal canal. Lateral colporrhaphy yielded objective and subjective cure rates of&#xD;
      93% and 97%, respectively. Symptomatic improvements were recorded in 7%. The LVW surgical&#xD;
      anatomy consisted of the full thickness of the vaginal wall, pubovaginalis muscle with&#xD;
      fascia, and the perineal membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions Symptomatic site-specific defects occur within the lateral vaginal wall. Lateral&#xD;
      colporrhaphy cures or improves symptoms in this study group. The new lateral colporrhaphy&#xD;
      procedure is a simple surgical intervention and is easy to perform.&#xD;

      Material &amp; methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Ethics The author follows the ethical standards in this clinical-scientific study and&#xD;
      complains with the Declaration of Helsinki [7, 8]. The local Institutional Review Board (IRB)&#xD;
      was consulted with the study protocol and informed consent. Based on the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki, Section C, entitled &quot;Unproven Interventions in Clinical Practice,&quot; the study was&#xD;
      excluded from an IRB formal process. IRB advised referencing the Helsinki Declaration [7, 8].&#xD;
      All subjects had been furnished with informed consent in writing before enrollment. The&#xD;
      cadaver study was approved by the local university Ethics Committee (no. AKBE 146/12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Preoperative Evaluation The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) was used to determine the&#xD;
      severity of dyspareunia, and the subject's report was incorporated in evaluating other&#xD;
      symptoms. All study participants were furnished with the standardized self-reported (NPRS)&#xD;
      form. The numeric formula ranging from 0 to 10 (0, no pain; 1- 4, mild pain; 5 -7, moderate&#xD;
      pain; 8-10, severe pain). Patients' dyspareunia severity was recorded based on the woman's&#xD;
      real pain experience during vaginal intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lateral vaginal walls were assessed from fornix to the exterior vaginal introitus,&#xD;
      site-specific defects were identified and recorded, and photos were taken. Deep dyspareunia&#xD;
      was reproduced during a clinical vaginal evaluation by poking a defective lateral vaginal&#xD;
      wall. Induced surrogate pain was the endpoint for actual in-depth deep dyspareunia&#xD;
      evaluation. In each follow-up visit, the author determined the objective cure rate with&#xD;
      patient assistance. For this purpose, Extra-Absorbent Large Tipped Applicators with Plastic&#xD;
      Handle (Puritan Medical Products, Guilford, ME 04443-0149, USA) were used. Patients reported&#xD;
      the severity of pain, and the author charted pain. The protruding part of the LVW into the&#xD;
      vaginal canal was evaluated by direct visualization. The prolapsing part was measured from&#xD;
      the base of LVW to the most protruded portion of the lateral vaginal. This evaluation was&#xD;
      applied preoperatively and during each follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Data Collection and Analysis Objective data were collected during a one-on-one interview&#xD;
      performed by the author with every subject. Subjective data collected before and after&#xD;
      surgery and yearly intervals until the completion of the follow-ups. Findings were compared&#xD;
      with preoperative results, follow-up visits, and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Literature Search Zotero - reference manager, and PubMed, and other non-indexed studies&#xD;
      were used for electronic medical literature searches regarding the lateral vaginal wall&#xD;
      anatomy, site-specific defects within this structure, and surgical reconstruction. The&#xD;
      Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) applied to gather relevant articles. Conference Proceedings&#xD;
      and specializing website included in searches. Keywords were used: Vaginal wall anatomy;&#xD;
      Vaginal wall surgical anatomy; Vaginal wall defects; Vaginal introitus; Vaginal tightening;&#xD;
      Vaginal introitus; Vaginal walls; Lateral vaginal wall defects; Lateral vaginal wall defect&#xD;
      repairs; Vaginal colporrhaphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Informed Consent Every subject in the before enrollment received written informed&#xD;
      consent, which is presented in the present study. At the time of pre-surgical consultation,&#xD;
      all patients were educated, in understandable terms, on the lateral colporrhaphy. The formal&#xD;
      inform consent is included in the supplemental file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Local Anesthesia All lateral colporrhaphy performed under local anesthesia. One-hour&#xD;
      before the operation, a mixture of Lidocaine/Prilocaine (2.5%/2.5%) cream would be applied by&#xD;
      the patient to the vaginal canal, the posterior perineum, the vaginal vestibule. Thirty&#xD;
      minutes before the surgery, orally, Valium 2.5-5 mg and Phenergan 12.5 mg rectal suppository&#xD;
      for light conscious sedation was administered. Bupivacaine 0.5 % with epinephrine solution&#xD;
      (Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL USA) used for vaginal wall infiltration if a patient was not&#xD;
      sensitive to this agent (a skin test would be done before a surgical intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The consecutive corpses who demised within 24-hour and&#xD;
      did not undergo a preservation process were included for the study and rehearsal. Those alive&#xD;
      women who presented with lateral vaginal defects prolapsing into the vaginal canal and&#xD;
      affiliated with moderate to severe deep dyspareunia were included. Anteverted uterus,&#xD;
      anterior or posterior, colporrhaphy, and intact paravaginal suspension were prerequisites for&#xD;
      inclusion. No concomitant procedure was performed during lateral vaginal wall repair. Women&#xD;
      who presented with anterior or posterior vaginal wall defects (cystocele or rectocele),&#xD;
      paravaginal defect, lateral vaginal defect, and did not have a prior surgical treatment for&#xD;
      those conditions were excluded. Retroverted uterus, pregnancy, current infection of the lower&#xD;
      genital tract, general illnesses, and inflammatory disorder constituted reasons for subjects&#xD;
      being excluded from the study. Additionally, women who underwent a prior hysterectomy,&#xD;
      bilateral oophorectomy, or had the diagnosis of vaginal dryness, endometriosis, prolapse,&#xD;
      myofascial pain were excluded. A total of eight patients were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.8 Cadaveric Rehearsal Stratum-by-stratum anatomical cadaveric dissection was performed to&#xD;
      verify the gross anatomy on one side of the same subject to identify the lateral vaginal wall&#xD;
      and its supportive/suspending structures. On the other side of the same corps, rehearsal of&#xD;
      the newly developed lateral vaginal wall colporrhaphy concept was exercised according to the&#xD;
      narrative description of this surgical intervention, which is described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.9 Surgical Intervention The surgery on live subjects was performed under x 3,5-4.0&#xD;
      magnifying loupe. A small vertical incision was made approximately 0.5 - 1.0 cm from the&#xD;
      inner hymeneal ring on the lateral vaginal mucosa (between 2 and 3 o'clock on the left and 8&#xD;
      and 9 o'clock on the right side). The incision continued until after the full thickness of&#xD;
      the vaginal wall was exposed. A traction suture, without tying, placed on the distal edge of&#xD;
      the incision. The full thickness of the vaginal wall was dissected-off from vaginal&#xD;
      inner-lateral defect. Approximately 1.0 cm above the proximal defect, another traction suture&#xD;
      placed, without tying, and lateral sub-vaginal anatomical defect(s) was exposed. Both&#xD;
      traction sutures were stretched, and scarification of defect edges was carried out until&#xD;
      fresh oozing blood was observed. Edges of defects were approximated with a simple interrupted&#xD;
      2-0 delayed absorbable suture on a tapered, small needle. Site-specific defects&#xD;
      reconstructions were completed in layers; the vaginal mucosa was trimmed and closed with a&#xD;
      single interrupted 3-0 delayed stitch on a taper needle. Meticulous hemostasis was achieved.&#xD;
      The overall procedure duration was measured in each case from the first incision to the&#xD;
      operation's completion. The follow-up study was conducted at a one-year interval for 3 years.&#xD;
