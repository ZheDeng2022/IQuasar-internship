  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Episodic breathlessness (or dyspnea) is one form of chronic refractory breathlessness&#xD;
      characterized by a severe worsening of breathlessness intensity or unpleasantness beyond&#xD;
      usual fluctuations in the patient's perception. Episodes are time-limited (seconds to hours)&#xD;
      and occur intermittently, with or without underlying continuous breathlessness. Episodes may&#xD;
      be predictable or unpredictable, depending on whether any trigger(s) can be identified. There&#xD;
      is a range of known triggers which can interact (e.g. exertion, emotions, comorbidities or&#xD;
      external environment). One episode can be caused by one or more triggers.&quot; ( definition by an&#xD;
      international expert consensus [Simon et al. 2013]). Approximately half of patients with&#xD;
      cancer complain about breathlessness with the highest prevalence in pulmonary malignancies.&#xD;
      Episodic breathlessness is reported by 81% of breathless cancer patients with significant&#xD;
      impairment on quality of life and limitations on activity. Although episodic breathlessness&#xD;
      show some similar characteristics like episodes of pain (breakthrough cancer pain, BTCP;&#xD;
      median duration 30minutes), they are often shorter: 91% last less than 20minutes (min). Other&#xD;
      evidence supports these findings with duration between 2-15minutes which is a real challenge&#xD;
      for the treatment of episodic breathlessness. In the majority of cases, episodic&#xD;
      breathlessness occur 1-4 times per day and peak intensity is rated moderate or severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence for the effectiveness of opioids for the relief of chronic refractory&#xD;
      breathlessness. There is no evaluated and proven standard treatment for the relief of&#xD;
      episodic breathlessness at the moment but immediate-release morphine (IRM) as solution or&#xD;
      tablet is most frequently used in clinical practice to treat episodic breathlessness. Time to&#xD;
      onset of action of IRM is about 20-30min for pain. Fentanyl is a potent opioid and shows good&#xD;
      evidence for the treatment of BTCP through its quick onset of action (5-15min) and short&#xD;
      duration of action (50-60min). Because of its pharmacodynamic properties fentanyl might be&#xD;
      appropriate and effective for the relief of episodic breathlessness. However, the efficacy of&#xD;
      fentanyl for the relief of breathlessness and time to onset is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study aims to evaluate relative efficacy, feasibility and time to onset of two&#xD;
      different opioids (fentanyl and morphine) in order to improve the management of episodic&#xD;
      breathlessness.&#xD;
