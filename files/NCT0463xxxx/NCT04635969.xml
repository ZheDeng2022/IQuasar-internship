    <textblock>
      By integrating sexuality and disability literatures, theories, and research, this study aims&#xD;
      to: determine the effectiveness of sexual health and development education for children&#xD;
      (12-18 years) with mild to moderate intellectual disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: There is no significant difference between the intervention group and the control group&#xD;
      in the mean score of the &quot;Sexual Development Characteristics Scale of Children with Mentally&#xD;
      Retardation in Adolescence&quot; after the sexual health and development trainings given to&#xD;
      children with intellectual disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: After the sexual health and development trainings given to children with intellectual&#xD;
      disabilities, the mean score of the &quot;Sexual Development Characteristics Scale of Children&#xD;
      with Intellectual Disability in Adolescence&quot; is significantly higher in the intervention&#xD;
      group compared to the control group.&#xD;

      By integrating sexuality and disability literatures, theories, and research, this study aims&#xD;
      to: determine the effectiveness of sexual health and development education for children&#xD;
      (12-18 years) with mild to moderate intellectual disability. The number of children in the&#xD;
      groups will be analyzed based on another study in which one of the scales to be used in the&#xD;
      study. According to the calculations made in the G-Power 3.1 Demo package program, when the&#xD;
      effect size is accepted as 0.8, it was seen that at least 24 cases in each group (total 48&#xD;
      children) would be sufficient for 80% power. These children will be selected from 48 children&#xD;
      who got the least score from the &quot;Sexual Development Characteristics of Adolescent Children&#xD;
      with Intellectual Disability Scale&quot;. In this way, the criteria sampling method will be used.&#xD;
      In this way, the criteria sampling method will be used. Anticipated duration is one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria of the children in the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Being between the ages of 12-18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having mild to moderate mental disability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parent's agreement to participate in research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of speech and vision impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing all trainings and follow-ups during the research period&#xD;
&#xD;
      For intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled and consent is documented, eligible subject's will participate in the study for&#xD;
      approximately three months. Participants will be expected to attend 8 training sessions over&#xD;
      a two months period, each are up to half hours in length. Follow-up will be made at the&#xD;
      beginning of the training, right after the last training and one month after the last&#xD;
      training after the questionnaire. Data analysis will begin once all trainings have been&#xD;
      completed. Investigators anticipate completing the study, including primary analyses, within&#xD;
      one year from the date recruitment begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled and consent is documented, eligible subject's will participate in the study for&#xD;
      approximately three months. Children in the control group will not be educated.Follow-up will&#xD;
      be made at the beginning of the training, right after the last training and one month after&#xD;
      the last training after the questionnaire. Data analysis will begin once all trainings have&#xD;
      been completed. Investigators anticipate completing the study, including primary analyses,&#xD;
      within one year from the date recruitment begins. After the study is completed, training will&#xD;
      be provided to children in the control group in a way that will not affect the data of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
