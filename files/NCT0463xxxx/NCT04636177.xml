  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is a two-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) of pain rehabilitation&#xD;
      virtual reality (PRVR) aimed at measuring changes in physical function and fear for&#xD;
      adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal pain when compared to Standard Physiotherapy&#xD;
      Rehabilitation (SPR). Both groups include standard physiotherapy treatment including&#xD;
      functional goal setting and progressive exercise with half of the treatment session delivered&#xD;
      virtually in the PRVR arm. The RCT aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate physical function outcomes between PRVR and SPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate pain-related fear as a potential mechanism of change in physical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize feasibility of a future hybrid effectiveness-dissemination trial of PRVR&#xD;
           in routine physiotherapy practice.&#xD;

    <description>Sessions are individually-tailored and based on the Guide to Physical Therapy Practice 3.0 consisting of 1) therapeutic exercise, 2) balance and proprioception, 3) strength training, and 4) use of modalities (e.g., heat/cold pack). Patients will be given a structured Home Exercise Program (HEP) with prescribed exercises for home. SPR participants will be allocated a VR headset for recreational use.</description>

    <description>Sessions will follow the same guidelines as SPR, with half of the physiotherapy (PT) sessions delivered in virtual reality (VR). VR in PT will engage participants in a series of immersive games customized to align with individual PT needs. Patients in the PRVR arm will be given a structured HEP to practice prescribed exercises at home with integrated VR activities. PRVR participants will be allocated a VR headset for use in PT sessions and with HEP.</description>
