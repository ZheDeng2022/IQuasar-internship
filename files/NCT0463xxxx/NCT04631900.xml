  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depression measured with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (T0), post at week 8 (T1) and follow-up at week 20 (T2).</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001) is a self-reported questionnaire designed for use in primary care. It is a structured questionnaire that enquires after the nine symptom- based criteria for diagnostic criteria in the DSM-IV depression. Score can range from 0-27. Sum scores of 0-4 indicate none or minimal depressive symptoms, 5-9 mild depressive symptoms, 10-14 moderate depressive symptoms, and 15-27 severe depressive symptoms. It has been found to have good sensitivity and specificity (Kroenke et al., 2001). The Cronbach's alpha was reported to be 0.86 - 0.89 (Smarr &amp; Keefer, 2011).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety measured with General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (T0), post at week 8 (T1) and follow-up at week 20 (T2).</time_frame>
    <description>The General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Löwe, 2006) is an easy-to-use 7 items self-administered patient questionnaire used to screen the severity measure of generalized anxiety disorder with good psychometric property. Score can range from 0-21. Sum scores of 0-5 indicates mild anxiety, 6-10 moderate anxiety, 11-15 moderately severe anxiety, and 16-21 severe anxiety. The Chinese version was tested to be a reliable and efficient instrument. (Wang Li, Lukai, Rongjing, Dayi, &amp; Sheng, 2014).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hope measured with State Hope Scale (SHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The data will be collected in both experimental and wait-list control groups at three points: at baseline (T0), week 8 (T1) and week 20 (T2).</time_frame>
    <description>The State Hope Scale (SHS) ( Snyder et al., 1996) is a 6 items self-reported instrument for measuring the extent of hope individuals held toward ongoing events in their lives. It is an 8-point Likert scale, with 1 (definitely false) to 8 (definitely true), with odd-number items measuring pathway thinking and even number items measuring agency thinking. Scores can range from 6 to 48, with higher scores representing higher hope levels.. C. R. Snyder et al. (1996) reported that SHS was a reliable and valid measure of state hope, with factor analyses confirming the two factors of agency and pathways. The internal consistency values ranging from 0.90 to 0.95 for both the agency and pathways subscale, and all adaptations and translations of the scale are reported to retain the high internal consistency (Brooks &amp; Hirsch, 2017). The Chinese version is available (Mak, Ng, &amp; Wong, 2011).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in meaning and purpose in life measured with Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (T0), post at week 8 (T1) and follow-up at week 20 (T2).</time_frame>
    <description>The Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ) (Steger, Frazier, Oishi, &amp; Kaler, 2006) is a 10 items questionnaire. It measures 2 subscales of the presence of meaning in life and the search for meaning in life. It is a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (absolutely true) to 7 (absolutely untrue). 5 items are for presence of meaning and 5 for search for meaning. Items are summed yielding a range from 5 to 35 for each subscale with higher scores indicates a strong presence of/search for meaning in one's life. It has been translated into over two dozen languages. The Chinese version of the questionnaire has the same factor structure as the original version of MLQ among the caregivers in Hong Kong (Chan, 2014).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-esteem measured with Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (T0), post at week 6 (T1) and follow-up at week 18 (T2).</time_frame>
    <description>The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) (Rosenberg, 1965) is a widely used instrument (10 items) around the world for measuring self-esteem with a 4 point Likert scale ranging from ranging from 4 (strong agree) to 1 (strong disagree). Reverse scoring (4= strongly disagree to 1= strongly agree are used for five negatively worded items: 2, 5, 6, 8 and 9. The total score ranges from 10 to 40 with higher scores indicates higher self-esteem. The internal reliability and factor structure of the scale is psychometrically sound across many languages and cultures (Schmitt &amp; Allik, 2005).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived social support measured with Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (T0), post at week 8 (T1) and follow-up at week 20 (T2).</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) (Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, &amp; Farley, 1988) is one of the most extensively used instruments to assess social support. It is a 12 items self -administered measure of social support with 3 subscales of family, friends, and significant others. It is a 7 point Likert scale ranging from 1(very strongly disagree ) to 7 (very strongly agree). The mean scores for significant other subscale is the sum across items 1, 2, 5 &amp; 10, then divided by 4; the mean scores for family subscale is the sum across items 3,4, 8, &amp; 11, then divided by 4; the mean scores of friends subscale is the sum across items 6, 7, 9, &amp;b 12, then divided by 4. The mean score of the total scale is the sum across all 12 items, then divided by 12. The mean score range from 1 (lowest) to 7 (highest). The Chinese version of MSPSS has good internal consistency reliability with composite reliability values of more than 0.7 (Y. Wang, Wan, Huang, Huang, &amp; Kong, 2017).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in spiritual experience measured with Daily Spiritual Experience Scale (DSES)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (T0), post at week 8 (T1) and follow-up at week 20 (T2).</time_frame>
    <description>The Daily Spiritual Experience Scale (DSES) (Underwood, 2011) is a 16-items self-reported validated questionnaire that assesses ordinary experience of the transcendence in daily life. It includes constructs such as awe, gratitude, mercy, sense of connection with the transcendent and compassionate love. It also includes measures of awareness of inspiration and a sense of deep inner peace. The first 15 items are scored with a Likert scale, from many times a day for 6 marks to never or almost never for 1 mark. The last item has only four response ranging from as close as possible for 4 mark to not close for 1 mark. The scores are summed up with higher score indicate higher level of spirituality. The reliability and validity of DSES have been tested to be satisfactory (Underwood &amp; Teresi, 2002). It has been translated into over 40 languages. The Chinese version of DSES has been found to have the satisfactory psychometric properties (Ng, Fong, Tsui, Au-Yeung, &amp; Law, 2009).</description>

    <description>Participants recruited in the waitlist control will be initially tested to generate pre-test scores and will then tested six weeks later which is equivalent to the timespan between the pre-test and post-test for the experimental spiritual programme. In between these two testing sessions, the waitlist control group will not receive any type of spiritual intervention. For ethical reasons, following the second testing session, the participants in the waitlist group will be given the opportunity to participant in the spiritual intervention programme.</description>
