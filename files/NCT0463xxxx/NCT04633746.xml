  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs up to 50% of patients admitted to intensive&#xD;
      care unit. Plasma Endostatin, released from basement membrane of Bowman's capsule, rises&#xD;
      early during AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of Work: To investigate the role of the plasma endostatin in the outcome prediction&#xD;
      (renal recovery, ICU stay, mortality) of acute kidney injury in patients with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: a prospective, observational single center study on 40 patients with Sepsis at the&#xD;
      Critical Care Department, Cairo University hospitals between March 2019 and November 2019.&#xD;
      Serum plasma endostatin was measured at the day of admission &amp; every 48hrs (3 samples).&#xD;
      APACHE II, SOFA scores were calculated. Forced diuresis was used if indicated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted on 40 patients with sepsis who admitted in the Critical Care&#xD;
      department of Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sepsis is identified according to surviving sepsis campaign guidelines with use of SOFA&#xD;
      score to establish the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients divided into 2 groups the first group included 25 patients who developed AKI as&#xD;
      defined by KDIGO guidelines and the other group included 15 patients as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Plasma Endostatin level is sampled in the first 24 hours of diagnosis of AKI, the&#xD;
      estimation of plasma Endostatin level done by ELISA technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results were presented in form of: descriptive, analytical and comparative data between&#xD;
      the groups of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was found that the patients with higher levels of plasma endostatin had a higher incidence&#xD;
      of recovery from AKI and higher incidence of 28 days survival, while the patients with lower&#xD;
      levels of plasma Endostatin below the determined Cut-off value have increased incidence of&#xD;
      RRT .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also that the patients with higher levels of plasma Endostatin levels were less labile to&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and had a higher incidence of weaning of vasopressors in comparison of&#xD;
      the other group of lower levels of plasma Endostatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma Endostatin levels have no difference between the AKI group and sepsis group which may&#xD;
      need further investigations to determine its role in sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      so that, the plasma Endostatin can be used as a marker of recovery from AKI.&#xD;
