  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating if a program that involves remote monitoring and home-based care may&#xD;
      improve the post-discharge care of recently hospitalized patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Supportive Oncology Care at Home intervention consists of three key components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Remote patient monitoring (e.g. patient-reported symptoms, home-monitored vital signs&#xD;
           and body weight);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Medically Home care model for symptom assessment, evaluation, and management (e.g.&#xD;
           triggers for phone calls and visits to patients' homes to address and manage any&#xD;
           concerning issues identified);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Structured communication with the oncology team to ensure continuity of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm pilot study of recently hospitalized patients with advanced cancer to&#xD;
      assess the the feasibility of delivering a remote monitoring and home-based program,&#xD;
      Supportive Oncology Care at Home, the acceptability and satisfaction with the Supportive&#xD;
      Oncology Care at Home program, and changes in the quality of life and symptoms of patients&#xD;
      who receive the Supportive Oncology Care at Home program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oncologists at the MGH Cancer Center developed the Supportive Oncology Care program to&#xD;
      address the symptoms and frequent hospital visits that patients face as a result of their&#xD;
      cancer and the treatment they receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remote monitoring of symptoms, vital signs, and body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires asking about demographic information (e.g. gender, ethnicity, income) and&#xD;
           participant experience with cancer (e.g. your quality of life, your symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews to assess participant impressions of the program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caregiver Interviews, Questionnaires and Surveys to assess caregiver impressions of the&#xD;
           program and caregiver perceptions of participant symptoms while in the program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinician Interviews and Questionnaires to assess impressions of the program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection from participant medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will take part in the program for two weeks following hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that between 75 and 110 people will enroll, including up to 30 patients, up to&#xD;
      30 caregivers, and up to 15 clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medically Home Group, Inc. is supporting this research study by providing funding for this&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
