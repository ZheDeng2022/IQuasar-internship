  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been developed in order to demonstrate the validity of the Sparkle respiratory&#xD;
      effort signal.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for undertaking this study is to demonstrate that the agreement between the&#xD;
      Sparkle respiratory effort signal amplitude and esophageal manometry is non-inferior to the&#xD;
      agreement between the thoracic belt respiratory effort signal amplitude and esophageal&#xD;
      manometry. Data collection will be completed within a single visit, in which participants&#xD;
      will undergo simultaneous measurement using the Sparkle device, respiratory belts, and&#xD;
      esophageal manometry. Data collection will be completed during wakefulness, while&#xD;
      participants undergo a series of breathing maneuvers.&#xD;
