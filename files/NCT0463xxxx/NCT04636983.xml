             90 mmHg or &lt; 50 mmHg at Screening or Day 1 prior to dosing (any abnormal blood&#xD;
             pressure results may be repeated once and if the repeat result is within the normal&#xD;
             range, it is not considered to have met the exclusion criterion). Pulse rate &gt; 90 or &lt;&#xD;

             subject will only be included if the Cystatin C value is below the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase&#xD;

             parameters may be repeated and if the repeat result is within the laboratory reference&#xD;
             range, it is not considered to have met the exclusion criterion.&#xD;

             allowed, if they are not clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of symptomatic, chronic or recurrent infection (e.g. nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
             diarrhoea, infection with fever) or any viral (including symptomatic herpes zoster),&#xD;

             unless in the opinion of the Investigator the medication will not interfere with the&#xD;
             study procedures or compromise safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
