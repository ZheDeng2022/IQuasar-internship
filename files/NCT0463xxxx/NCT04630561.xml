  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a posture intervention on specific&#xD;
      areas of daily function and health: physical, psychological, cognitive, social, and&#xD;
      environmental characteristics.&#xD;

      This project promotes community health through postural movement to demonstrate strong&#xD;
      physical and mental health benefits. Specifically, Great Posture, Great Health will address&#xD;
      two of the top five priorities of general health concerns: 1) obesity and 2) mental health.&#xD;
      First, obesity is on the rise although more individuals are meeting or exceeding the current&#xD;
      federal physical activity guidelines based on the data provided by the US Department of&#xD;
      Health and Human Services (2020). Obesity is a common problem in adults with all&#xD;
      socioeconomic status and all races, except Asians. In fact, Asians have low rates of heart&#xD;
      disease, asthma, cancer, and a longer life expectancy than other races, potentially due to&#xD;
      health behaviors, environment, and stress coping strategies (Acciai et al., 2015). Therefore,&#xD;
      we should not overlook the importance of stress coping strategies practiced in Asian&#xD;
      countries on obesity. It is becoming more evident that chronic stress (such as elevated&#xD;
      cortisol levels) and steroid-based medications are strongly associated with obesity and&#xD;
      chronic diseases. It is critical to develop and validate community health strategies to&#xD;
      address both priorities. Great Posture, Great Health will introduce one of the most common&#xD;
      mind-body postural exercises practiced in Asian countries to a large and diverse population.&#xD;
