  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One out of 8 women will develop breast cancer (BC) in her lifetime and despite improvements&#xD;
      in therapeutic strategies it remains one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality for&#xD;
      women in industrialized countries. Over the past decades another worldwide health problem has&#xD;
      emerged: obesity. Around 50% of European women are either overweight or obese (body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI)≥25 kg/m2: overweight; BMI≥30 kg/m2: obese). The global health effects of high BMI&#xD;
      include the well-known elevated risk for developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes and a&#xD;
      broad range of cancers, including in the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The connection between BC and obesity is gaining attention because of its clinical relevance.&#xD;
      Heavier BC patients are generally older and tend to present with more aggressive disease&#xD;
      (larger tumours and more frequent axillary lymph node dissemination). Likewise, they are also&#xD;
      at higher risk of recurrence and resistance to therapy. This is of high importance, as&#xD;
      development of therapy-resistant metastases is the ultimate cause of death in relapsing&#xD;
      patients. Several molecular pathways linking the more aggressive BC nature to obesity have&#xD;
      been proposed, such as oestrogens and fat cell signalling molecules, insulin signalling,&#xD;
      metabolic inflammation and altered lipid metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adiposity is hardly taken into consideration in the treatment of BC patients. This is in&#xD;
      contrast with the emerging trend to develop personalized therapies based on individual&#xD;
      characteristics of the patient and molecular features of the tumour. Very recent data show&#xD;
      that the upcoming treatment strategy of immunotherapy (IT) has better outcomes in obese&#xD;
      patients in melanoma, renal cell and lung carcinoma. This could be explained by the fact that&#xD;
      obesity induces T-cell dysregulation, which makes these patients more sensitive to IT.&#xD;
      Whether or not this accounts for BC as well, is currently unknown. In endocrine BC treatment,&#xD;
      research on the effect of BMI on treatment resistance is mainly retrospective and it is&#xD;
      unclear whether heavier patients would present a differential benefit to aromatase inhibitors&#xD;
      compared to lean patients. Also, most of these studies only considered BMI and no additional&#xD;
      adiposity-related inflammation and other variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we therefore want to prospectively evaluate the local and systemic effects of aromatase&#xD;
      inhibition and immunotherapy, either combined or alone, in a window of opportunity study&#xD;
      carried out in luminal B like postmenopausal BC patients.&#xD;
