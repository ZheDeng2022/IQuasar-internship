  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This controlled, randomized, double blind, multicenter study will be carried out to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the topical ophthalmic nanoemulsion of difluprednate 0.05% (Tolf®, Poen&#xD;
      Laboratories), has a high anti-inflammatory efficacy, which would allow it to be administered&#xD;
      after cataract surgery 1 drop, twice a day , starting the day before surgery and continuing&#xD;
      for 14 days and 1 drop, once a day for the following 2 weeks, achieving an adequate&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory activity, with the benefit of reducing the toxicity on the ocular surface,&#xD;
      improving the dosage and adherence to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up time will be 28 days and the outcome measures will be evaluated in a baseline&#xD;
      (time 0), on day 1, on day 4 and on day 28 after surgery. The active control will be&#xD;
      prednisolone acetate 1% + phenylephrine hydrochloride 0.12% topical ophthalmic suspension&#xD;
      (Prednefrin® Forte, Allergan Argentina) given 1 drop, 4 times a days and 1 drop, twice a day&#xD;
      for the next 2 weeks. Corneal thickness, central macula thickness, endothelial cell count,&#xD;
      intraocular pressure, visual acuity, anterior chamber clearance and lacrimal film recovery&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Demonstrate that 0.05% difluprednate ophthalmic nanoemulsion administered 1 drop, 2 times a day, beginning the day before cataract surgery and continuing for the first 14 postoperative days and then 1 drop, once a day for the next 14 days, it does not present an anti-inflammatory efficacy lower than treatment with prednisolone acetate 1% + phenylephrine hydrochloride 0.12% ophthalmic suspension administered 1 drop, 4 times a day starting the day before surgery and continuing during the first 14 post-surgical days and 1 drop , 2 times a day for the next 14 days, for the treatment of postsurgical inflammation, in patients operated on for N2 and N3 cataracts.&#xD;
Difluprednate 0.05% ophthalmic nanoemulsion will not be clinically inferior than Prednisolone acetate 1% + 0.12% phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic suspension, if the difference in corneal thickness obtained with OCT between the baseline day and the post-surgical day it does not differ beyond 17 µm between treatments.</description>
