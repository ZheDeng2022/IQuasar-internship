  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy are more likely to develop and die of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease later in life, even if they are otherwise healthy. The reason why this&#xD;
      occurs is unclear but may be related to blood vessel damage and increased inflammation that&#xD;
      occurs during the preeclamptic pregnancy and persists postpartum. The purpose of this&#xD;
      investigation is to determine the mechanisms contributing to this lasting blood vessel damage&#xD;
      and to test whether taking a medication that blocks angiotensin II receptors (losartan)&#xD;
      decrease these negative effects in women who have had preeclampsia. Identification of these&#xD;
      mechanisms and treatment strategies may lead to better clinical management,of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease risk in these women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we use the blood vessels in the skin as a representative vascular bed. Using a&#xD;
      minimally invasive technique (intradermal microdialysis for the local delivery of&#xD;
      pharmaceutical agents) we examine the blood vessels in a nickle-sized area of the skin in&#xD;
      women who have had preeclampsia. We make these measurements after the subjects take a placebo&#xD;
      and after they take losartan (an angiotensin II receptor blocker) to test whether this&#xD;
      treatment improves vascular function in these women. As a compliment to these measurements,&#xD;
      we also draw blood from the subjects and isolate the inflammatory cells to test how sensitive&#xD;
      their inflammatory responses are following the placebo and the losartan treatment.&#xD;
