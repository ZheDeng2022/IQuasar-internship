    <textblock>
      ActivSightTM combines an innovative form factor and proprietary software to deliver precise,&#xD;
      objective, real-time visualization of blood flow and tissue perfusion intraoperatively for&#xD;
      laparoscope-based surgery. A small adaptor that fits between any existing laparoscope and&#xD;
      camera systems and a separate light source placed along any current commercial system will&#xD;
      deliver objective real-time tissue perfusion and blood flow information intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine safety and feasibility of ActivSightTM in displaying tissue&#xD;
      perfusion in intestinal anastomoses including colorectal and bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To determine the efficacy of ActivSightTM in; (1) displaying tissue&#xD;
      vascularity and perfusion in comparison to indocyanine green (ICG) during gastrointestinal&#xD;
      anastomoses; and (2) displaying biliary tree during laparoscopic cholecystectomy using&#xD;
      ICG-based intraoperative cholangiography (IOC).&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a feasibility study designed to evaluate safety and feasibility of ActivSightTM&#xD;
           in gastrointestinal anastomoses and cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety will be determined through clinical assessments and evaluation of any adverse&#xD;
           event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility will be determined through technically successful completion of intended&#xD;
           visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of preliminary efficacy will be performed through analysis of any&#xD;
           intraoperative decisions made based on visual display as compared to standard endoscopic&#xD;
           approach, or non-inferiority to ICG-based visualization and usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients outcome and follow up to Postoperative day 28 will be monitored for clinical&#xD;
           outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target enrollment for the assessment of 40 patients; 26 evaluating intestinal&#xD;
           anastomoses cases (including bariatric and colorectal cases); and 14 evaluating&#xD;
           laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Stopping rules are triggered following the first 6&#xD;
           patients and a comparison group 6 patients in ICG-based treatment.&#xD;

    <description>To determine safety of ActivSightTM in patients undergoing intestinal anastomoses, as defined through clinical assessments and evaluation of use related adverse events intraoperatively and a routine follow up at 28 days following surgery. ActivSightTM will be deemed safe if hardware (adaptor or light source)-related major (serious) adverse event is encountered in the treated patients and if less than 2 hardware-related minor adverse events are encountered.&#xD;
Adverse events will be summarized descriptively and tabulations on the type, severity, and relationship to application will be performed and any changes of outcomes from baseline on follow up will be examined using the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank test.</description>
