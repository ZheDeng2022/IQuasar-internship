      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first few decades of life, the brain changes dramatically in shape and function.&#xD;
      Sleep lets researchers measure these changes. Researchers want to create a database of sleep&#xD;
      and neurodevelopmental data in a group of infants and children to learn more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address a knowledge and data gap in the field of sleep and neurodevelopment in infants and&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children ages 6 months to 76 months who may or may not be at risk for neurodevelopmental and&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric disorders. Also, children ages 6 months to 8 years who have a referral for a&#xD;
      sleep study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have neurodevelopmental testing. They will have a medical, psychiatric, and&#xD;
      family history. They will have a physical and neurological exam. They will be interviewed and&#xD;
      complete surveys. They will give a cheek swab and/or blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have 1 study visit that lasts 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other participants will have up to 4 study visits. Each visit will last 2 days. Visits occur&#xD;
      every 8 months to 1 year, for a total participation time of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a 20-minute daytime electroencephalogram (EEG), if possible. This EEG&#xD;
      session will be used to calibrate the machine for the overnight study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take part in an inpatient overnight sleep study. Electrodes will be placed&#xD;
      on the participants. For young children, parents will help place the EEG leads. Other sensors&#xD;
      may also be placed. A gauze cap will be placed on participants head to protect the leads and&#xD;
      keep the participants from moving them. 'Lights out' will occur as close to participants&#xD;
      bedtime as possible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multisite longitudinal study with NIH as the lead site. The other sites: Texas&#xD;
      Children s Hospital, Boston Children s Hospital, Geisinger Medical Center, NYU and the NHLBI-&#xD;
      supported, area specific repository, National Sleep Research Repository (NSRR). This study&#xD;
      will address the data gap established by two NIMH sponsored intramural/extramural workshops&#xD;
      (2017 and 2018) in the field of sleep and neurodevelopment by establishing a standardized,&#xD;
      reliable protocol for real time acquisition of research data on the normal and abnormal&#xD;
      neuro-maturational changes that are sleep-dependent. It will facilitate data-sharing in this&#xD;
      area and speed the pace of discovery. Sleep EEG is a highly advantageous modality to provide&#xD;
      non-invasive, reliable, robust and reproducible imaging of the brain in young and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmentally disordered populations. Sleep EEG affords data acquisition of functional&#xD;
      network microstructure with a decreased signal to noise ratio compared to acquisition in the&#xD;
      awake state. In addition, potential deviations from the natural ultradian and other sleep&#xD;
      oscillatory patterns of the sleep process have the potential to inform on underlying&#xD;
      developing neuropathology of various microstructures and neurotransmitter systems prior to&#xD;
      the emergence of putatively associated behavioral phenomenon. Ideally, these oscillatory&#xD;
      trajectories will not only map to developmental behavioral phenotypes but also to clinical&#xD;
      disorders of the sleep state itself, such as the malignant insomnias that are prevalent in&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental syndromes. The protocol will initiate the&#xD;
      establishment of a normative database for electrophysiologic sleep data in the developing&#xD;
      brain. Disorders of particular interest include autism, disorders of social cognition and&#xD;
      other neurodevelopmental disorders, childhood psychiatric disorders, and unique clinical&#xD;
      presentations of neurogenetic syndromes, such as those associated with genetic disorders or&#xD;
      those with a unique family history. The study plans to use a quantitative, dimensional&#xD;
      approach to outcome measurement with respect to adaptive functioning in children and to&#xD;
      symptoms of behavioral and/or neurodevelopmental problems, irrespective of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While specific differences in the architecture of sleep (e.g., stages, movement&#xD;
      abnormalities, cyclicity, spindles and other bio-signatures that reflect anatomical&#xD;
      microstructure) may be used to differentiate neurodevelopmental cohorts, the enormous&#xD;
      potential of this proposed database lies in the ability to track functional connectivity&#xD;
      (coherence) during sleep in the developing brain in a longitudinal, prospective manner,&#xD;
      thereby establishing both normal and aberrant trajectories. Predictive relationships can be&#xD;
      determined once these trajectories are established. Coherence studies would allow for the&#xD;
      potential recreation of neural circuits that sub-serve various brain functions, such as&#xD;
      language and attention. Tracking the trajectory of neural development prior to and during the&#xD;
      developmental window when these circuits are maturing will allow for an understanding of best&#xD;
      potential windows of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The long term, primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate the degree to&#xD;
      which the development and maturation of sleep patterns, with an emphasis on the relationship&#xD;
      of those patterns to electrophysiologic signals, can predict cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      outcomes. Assessing participants over time will allow researchers to gain additional&#xD;
      knowledge about the role of abnormal sleep, measured both clinically and by polysomnogram, in&#xD;
      various childhood neuropsychiatric/ neurodevelopmental disorders and behavioral syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The total number of participants to be enrolled will be set at N = 244 (6&#xD;
      months to 8 years old) and will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study 1: N = 90 with no known risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. These include&#xD;
           children without identified neurodevelopmental problems who score within age-expected&#xD;
           ranges on cognitive and behavioral screeners.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study 2: N = 154 children at risk for or known to have selected&#xD;
           neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric disorders, based on any one or more of the following&#xD;
           criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Enrolled in early intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Getting any targeted therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Failed Infant Toddler Checklist (ITC) (ages 6 months 24 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Failed the Early Intervention (EI) screener (&gt;24 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Study 1 (N = 90) and Study 2 (N = 154) use the same accelerated longitudinal design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure in Study 1 is sleep spindle activity. Study 2&#xD;
      has an additional primary outcome, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior (VABS) Socialization growth&#xD;
      scale. In both studies, secondary outcome measures will include:other characteristics of&#xD;
      sleep spindles, sleep rhythms (ultradian, circadian), macroarchitecture (stages and&#xD;
      latencies), microarchitecture (measures of connectivity and network analyses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors include other neurodevelopmental variables, including other domain scores from the&#xD;
      Vineland, IQ, and quantitative measurement of behavioral problems and social communicative&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
