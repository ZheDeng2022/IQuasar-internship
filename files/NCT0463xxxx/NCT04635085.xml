  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is proposed to address the research gap identified by the investigation team. The&#xD;
      investigators are currently conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the&#xD;
      effects of a new volunteer-supported model to improve cognitive function in MCI persons&#xD;
      through the promotion of an active lifestyle. The investigators noticed that sleep problems&#xD;
      are highly prevalent among this vulnerable group, and their motivation is low. As such, this&#xD;
      team of investigators, which has a strong research track record and expertise in delivering&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions, care of persons with MCI and dementia and chronic disease&#xD;
      management using the empowerment-based educational model, developed an evidenced-based&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention featuring the empowerment&#xD;
      approach to improve sleep quality and cognition in persons with MCI. The PI and the Co-I (D.&#xD;
      Yu) have successfully used the empowerment model to promote self-care among patients with&#xD;
      heart failure. Indeed, the co-investigators have extensive research and clinical experience&#xD;
      in working with people with MCI and dementia. The Co-I (D. Yu), a nursing academician&#xD;
      specializing in gerontology, has established an online CBT-based website (Sweet Dream) to&#xD;
      fight against insomnia in the older population in Hong Kong and has tested the effects of an&#xD;
      activity-based intervention for older people with sleep complaints. Another Co-I (A. Wong) is&#xD;
      a psychologist with substantial research experience working with people with MCI and&#xD;
      dementia. This study proposes to address a neglected area in the literature and to test the&#xD;
      effects of an empowerment-based CBT-I for MCI persons on their sleep and cognition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will have two aims: i) to evaluate the effects of an empowerment-based&#xD;
      CBT-I on sleep pattern, sleep quality, cognitive function and HRQoL in MCI persons; and ii)&#xD;
      to examine whether the effects of the empowerment-based CBT-I on cognitive function and&#xD;
      HRQoL, if any, are mediated through improved sleep. Sleep pattern in terms of time to&#xD;
      initiate sleep (sleep latency, SL), number and duration of awakenings after sleep onset&#xD;
      (WASO), ratio of total sleep time (TST) to the time spent in bed (sleep efficiency, SE) and&#xD;
      sleep quality will be the primary outcomes, and cognitive function and HRQoL will be the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This will be a single-blinded parallel-group waitlist RCT study to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of the CBT-I on sleep, cognitive outcomes and HRQoL in persons with MCI. The&#xD;
      study implementation protocol is outlined in Figure 1. A research assistant (RA1) will&#xD;
      recruit eligible participants from the elderly community centers operated by two&#xD;
      non-governmental organizations in Hong Kong. After collecting the baseline data (T0), RA1&#xD;
      will randomly assign participants into the intervention group and control group with block&#xD;
      randomization to ensure even distribution of participants in the two study groups over the&#xD;
      study period. A computer-generated random sequence will be used to determine the block size&#xD;
      (6, 8 and 10) and respective study group allocation in a 1:1 ratio. To ensure allocation&#xD;
      concealment, the group allocation will be determined according to the random sequence codes&#xD;
      placed in sealed opaque envelopes. Participants in the intervention group will receive the&#xD;
      empowerment-based CBT-I, whereas the waitlist control group will receive usual care during&#xD;
      the study period and then will receive the CBT-I upon completion of the study evaluation. To&#xD;
      minimize biases, another research assistant (RA2) who is blinded to the group allocation will&#xD;
      be responsible for collecting post-test data. A total of 30 subjects will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in the initial phase of pilot study to explore the feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of the methods and procedures to be used on a subsequent full-scale RCT. The RA2 will also&#xD;
      invite all participants in this pilot phase to complete a satisfaction survey upon completion&#xD;
      of the intervention. All of the participants in the intervention group will be invited to&#xD;
      take part in a semi-structured qualitative interview to gather in-depth comments about the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the empowerment-based CBT-T intervention. The collected&#xD;
      information will be used to optimize the procedures and process of the main study. To reduce&#xD;
      contamination of the control group, the intervention sessions will be delivered in a private&#xD;
      room of the study sites. The participants in the intervention group will be advised not to&#xD;
      share the content with other members in the centers. Nonetheless, the active ingredients of&#xD;
      the intervention are the intensive interactions between the intervener and the participants,&#xD;
      which is less likely to be replicated and disclosed by the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions Intervention group: Empowerment-based CBT-I for MCI Participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group will participate in a 12-week empowerment-based CBT-I comprising&#xD;
      face-to-face sessions supplemented with telephone follow-ups. In total, six face-to-face&#xD;
      sessions (90 minutes/session) will be conducted in a small group format with 6-8 participants&#xD;
      in a group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The face-to-face delivery modality is adopted to meet the challenges of mildly impaired&#xD;
      cognition faced by MCI persons, whereas the small group format was chosen in accordance with&#xD;
      the literature suggesting it has efficacy comparable with the individual format.51 The group&#xD;
      format is more cost-effective, and it can facilitate peer modeling and learning. The&#xD;
      face-to-face sessions will cover the following core areas in CBT-I: i) sleep education, ii)&#xD;
      sleep hygiene and relaxation, iii) sleep restriction, iv) stimulus control and v) cognitive&#xD;
      therapy. The first five sessions will cover these core areas, and a booster session will then&#xD;
      follow to summarize the key components of CBT-I and equip the participants with&#xD;
      relapse-prevention strategies when sleeping problems recur. The content of the CBT-I&#xD;
      components complies with the recommendations for managing chronic insomnia by major&#xD;
      international sleep associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A five-step empowerment approach will be adopted to implement each face-to-face session to&#xD;
      facilitate goal attainment and behavioral maintenance. At the beginning of each session, RA1&#xD;
      will encourage the participants to discuss their usual practice or beliefs about sleep or&#xD;
      insomnia related to the core area of that week, then deliver a structured educational session&#xD;
      about the topic area. The rationales and explicit methods of how to carry out the suggested&#xD;
      behaviors will be stated. The content will emphasize assisting participants to understand the&#xD;
      linkage between their usual practice (behaviors/thoughts) and the consequences to sleep&#xD;
      disruption. The RA1 will then facilitate the participants to identify the discrepancies&#xD;
      between their usual practice/dysfunctional beliefs and the recommended best practice for&#xD;
      sleep improvement/beliefs that favor better sleep. Easy-to-understand comic stories will be&#xD;
      incorporated to illustrate the more abstract concepts about dysfunctional beliefs related to&#xD;
      insomnia (for the session on cognitive therapy) and bed-sleep association (for the session on&#xD;
      stimulus control). The RA1 will also highlight the possible consequences of these&#xD;
      discrepancies on brain health. The RA1 will then assist participants to set self-directed&#xD;
      goals related to these areas. During this process, the RA1 will work collaboratively with the&#xD;
      participants and ensure that the goals are achievable yet challenging. The RA1 will also work&#xD;
      with the participants to develop an action plan for achieving the goals set during each&#xD;
      session. After action-planning, a subsequent interactive skill-building session will ensure&#xD;
      that participants acquire the skills required to perform specific behaviors. A scenario-based&#xD;
      approach will be adopted to train the participants on how to maintain the recommended&#xD;
      behaviors. The RA1 will make use of group dynamics by encouraging the discussion among the&#xD;
      peers of successful actions, feelings, concerns and perceived barriers to goal achievement.&#xD;
      Various memory compensatory strategies will be used to reinforce the educational content,&#xD;
      such as memory aids (e.g., memory notebooks, calendars and to-do lists) and mnemonic&#xD;
      strategies. Each subsequent session will begin with a discussion of progress in goal&#xD;
      attainment and challenges and barriers encountered while implementing the action plan set&#xD;
      during the preceding week. The RA1 will also review the key messages delivered in previous&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RA1 will provide continuous support through individualized one-to-one face-to-face&#xD;
      meetings (7th and 9th week) and telephone calls (three bi-weekly calls on 8th, 10th and 12th&#xD;
      week) upon the completion of all the group-based sessions. A personal record containing the&#xD;
      participants' demographic and clinical profile, endorsed dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes&#xD;
      about sleep, self-directed goals and action plans will be created to facilitate the&#xD;
      individualized face-to-face sessions and telephone support. The RA1 will monitor&#xD;
      participants' adherence to the recommended behaviors and goal attainment progress, identify&#xD;
      barriers in real-life settings and provide methods of resolving them. The advice and&#xD;
      counseling given will be documented to guide subsequent telephone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Usual care The control group will not receive any structured cognitive&#xD;
      training or sleep promoting interventions during the study period. The participants in the&#xD;
      control group will continue to participate in the social activities offered by the elderly&#xD;
      community centers. They have access to the newspapers, board games and computer facility in&#xD;
      the centers. Upon completion of collecting all evaluation data for both groups at the three&#xD;
      different time points, the empowerment-based CBT-I will be offered to participants in the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes from the Hong Kong List Learning Test (HKLLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline HKLLT at the 12th week (after the intervention) and 3 months (follow up)]</time_frame>
    <description>The HKLLT is a validated instrument for assessing complex attention, executive function and task switching. Participants were required to learn a list of 16 Chinese words through three learning trials. After 10 and 30 min delay, they were asked to recall as many words as possible. The total number of recalled words after a delay was used to reflect verbal memory ability. A low score on Trial 1, with normal performance on Trial 3 and total learning, is considered to reflect problems in auditory attention spam, but intact learning ability. Poor scores on all three learning trials provide evidence for acquisition problems in learning and memory. The T-score range from &lt;20 to &gt;/= 65. The score of &gt;=65 represents superior and &lt;20 represents the severely impaired.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline the CCT at the 12th week (after the intervention) and 3 months (follow up)]</time_frame>
    <description>CCT is a validated instrument for assessing complex attention, executive function and task switching. Time taken to complete each part of the CTT is recorded in seconds and is compared to normative data. Qualitative aspects of the performance that may be indicative of brain dysfunction (e.g. near misses, prompts required, sequencing errors for color and number) are also recorded. The CTT manual reports that it takes 3-8 minutes to complete the CTT. A task is discontinued if the client takes longer than 240 seconds to complete it. Performance time &lt;60 seconds on the CTT was found to predict passing the on-road evaluation, whereas &gt;60 seconds was predictive of failing</description>

    <description>SF-12 is a validated instrument for assessing the general health of people, both physical and mental well-being. A mental component score and a physical component score are reported as Z-scores (different compared to the population average, 12 are both 50 points). The standard deviation is 10 points, so each 10 increment of 10 points above or below 50, corresponds to one standard deviation away from the average.</description>
