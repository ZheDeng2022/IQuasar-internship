  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The promoter of the study will conduct a monocentric cohort study that aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      consequences of home respiratory devices on patient caregivers' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine the impact of home respiratory devices on quality of life in&#xD;
      general, sleep quality, anxiety and humour depending on equipment type (Non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or long-term oxygen therapy&#xD;
      (LTOT)) for patients and partners. The investigators will assess the correlation between&#xD;
      patient and caregiver's answers. The investigators will assess the correlation between&#xD;
      couple's quality of life and adherence to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, the investigators will use four quality of life questionnaires and the&#xD;
      investigators will collect demographic data, medical data and usage report from the&#xD;
      equipment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Home respiratory devices improve patients' quality of life and clinical outcomes. However,&#xD;
      they bring medical equipment into the bedroom and are used overnight. The aim of this&#xD;
      prospective cohort is to assess the quality of life of patient's caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient caregivers' quality of life will be assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire&#xD;
      (World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief version questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to enroll 200 patients' partners equipped with non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation, 100 patients' partners equipped with continuous positive airway pressure and 50&#xD;
      patients' partners equipped with long-term oxygen therapy. Patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      the cohort of patients already established on home treatment and cared for by Asten Santé.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent, patient will receive dedicated questionnaires. During a home visit, home&#xD;
      healthcare provider technician will retrieve data from the home device.&#xD;

    <description>Total quality of life score on WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire (World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief version questionnaire). This questionnaire contains 26 items and addresses four quality of life domains. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (low score of 1 to high score of 5) to determine a raw item score. The first and the second questions of the questionnaire are examined separately. For the other questions, the mean score for each domain is calculated, resulting in a mean score per domain that is between 4 and 20. Finally, this mean domain score is then multiplied by 4 in order to transform the domain score into a scaled score . For each domain, the minimum domain score is 4 and the maximum domain score is 20. It corresponds to a minimum scaled score of 0 and a maximum scale score of 100 for each domain. A higher score indicating a higher QOL.</description>

    <description>Total quality of life score on study specific questionnaire. It corresponds with the total score on the study specific questionnaire prepared by the investigators before the study after consulting a committee of experts in the field of chronic respiratory failure and a panel of patients familiar with ventilation according to the Delphi method. This questionnaire assesses five areas of quality of life : sleep, health, married life, social relations and participation in care through the 20 questions considered the most relevant by the panel.&#xD;
Items are rated on a 10-point Likert scale (low score of 0 to high score of 10) to determine each question score. For each question, the minimum score value is 0 and the maximum score value is 10. The minimum total score value is 0 reflection of a very negative impact of the equipment on the studied domains and the maximum score is 200, reflection of a very positive impact of the equipment.</description>

    <description>Total depression and anxiety score on HADS index (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale). The HADS scale is an instrument used to screen for anxiety and depressive disorders. It has 14 items ranked from 0 to 3. Seven questions relate to anxiety and seven others to the depressive dimension. The score obtained on the HADS scale will be expressed as a score for each area of study:&#xD;
the &quot;anxiety score&quot;, evaluated by the 7 questions (questions number 1,3,5,7,9,11 and 13)&#xD;
the depression score evaluated by the 7 other questions. The total score ranges from 0 to 42 for each participant. For each score (anxiety or depression), a score value of 7 or less corresponds to the absence of anxiety or depression. A score value between 8 and 10 reflects a doubtful symptomatology. A score value more than 11 reflect that the symptomatology is certain.</description>
