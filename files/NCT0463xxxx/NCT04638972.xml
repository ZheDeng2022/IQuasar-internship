  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of tactile sense, digital periapical&#xD;
      radiograph and two different varieties of electronic apex locators at working length&#xD;
      determination in primary molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 infected mandibular primary second molar teeth in twelve children aged between&#xD;
      5 and 8 years were included in this study. Working length determination was performed using&#xD;
      tactile sense, radiographic method and two different varieties of electronic apex locators&#xD;
      (ProPex Pixi® and Ipex®) separately.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The teeth were first anaesthetized with Ultracaine Ds-Forte (Sanofi Aventis, İstanbul,&#xD;
      Türkiye) and then isolated with rubber dam. Caries was removed and access cavity was prepared&#xD;
      using a round diamond bur with copious water in each tooth. Barbed broaches were used to&#xD;
      extirpate the pulpal tissue and 2.5 % sodium hypochlorite was used as the irrigation&#xD;
      solution. Sterile cotton pellets were used to dry the cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For working length determination, the groups were performed as; Group 1: Tactile Sense Method&#xD;
      Group 2: Radiographic Method (digital periapical radiography) Group 3: Ipex® EAL Group 4:&#xD;
      Propex® pixi EAL The measurement techniques given in the groups were used in each root canal&#xD;
      of all primary molars (n=90).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Root canal length determination by tactile sense method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the determination of working length using tactile sense, a K-file with the tip that best&#xD;
      adjusted to the apical area was selected and gently inserted into the canal until the&#xD;
      operator felt the narrowest region. The silicone stop was then placed at the coronal&#xD;
      reference, and tooth length considering the end of the root was measured with an endodontic&#xD;
      ruler (0.5mm accuracy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Root canal length determination by radiographic method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group 2, working length determination was performed with digital periapical radiograph&#xD;
      (……………….). Before the radiographic evaluation, the protective thyroid lead and protective&#xD;
      lead apron were used for all children. Digital periapical radiograph was taken with using&#xD;
      paralleling technique while the files were in the canals. X-ray positioning device (FPS&#xD;
      3000-Film positioning system complete, TPC Advanced Technology Inc., California, USA) was&#xD;
      used to standardize the distances between the source and the tooth, and the tooth and the&#xD;
      film. Cusp adjacent to the canal was taken as the occlusal reference. Files, 1 mm shorter&#xD;
      than the tooth length as recorded according to the preoperative radiograph, were inserted in&#xD;
      the canals. The difference between the tip of the file and the end of the root was calculated&#xD;
      on the image. In case the file had not passed the apex, this amount and the original length&#xD;
      was calculated. In case the file had passed the apex, the amount was subtracted from the&#xD;
      original length. Lastly, 1 mm was subtracted from this adjusted length to confirm the&#xD;
      cemento-dentinal junction and recorded as radiographic working length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Root canal length determination by EALs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electronic working length determination was performed either with Ipex®/Goup 2 (NSK Ltd,&#xD;
      Tokyo, Japan) or ProPex Pixi®/Group 3 (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) apex&#xD;
      locators. Lip clip was attached to patients' lower lip in order to complete the circuit.&#xD;
      Then, the root canals were moistened with 0.9% saline solution, and a no.15 K- file (Dentsply&#xD;
      Maillefer, Baillaigues, Switzerland) mounted to the holder was gently inserted till &quot;0.5&quot;&#xD;
      signaled on the screen, meaning that the tip of file was at the apical constriction. If the&#xD;
      reading was stable for at least 5 seconds, the file was pulled back and the length between&#xD;
      the silicone stopper and the tip of the file was measured with an endodontic ruler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endodontic treatment was completed in same appointments.&#xD;

    <description>In clinical practice, tactile sense and conventional radiography have been the methods of choice for determination of working length for a long time. However, these two methods have some limitations in determining working length. While the accuracy rate in tactile sense changes with experience, radiographic examination in children is usually hard due to poor cooperation or the unsuitable sensor size for child's small mouth [7]. Also, these techniques may yield inaccurate information especially in cases with root resorption</description>
