  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this work is to develop an effective remote mental health and substance use&#xD;
      Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) program for pregnant and&#xD;
      postpartum women. The present study will conduct a pilot RCT of of a text-message based SBIRT&#xD;
      and home-based telemedicine services for pregnant and postpartum women - called Listening to&#xD;
      Women (LTW), compared to treatment as usual (TAU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants: 100 adult, pregnant women receiving prenatal, mental health and/or substance&#xD;
      use disorder treatment within the MUSC Health System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Listening to Women is a mobile phone-based program designed to enhance delivery&#xD;
      of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), an evidence-based&#xD;
      approach for mental health and substance use screening and treatment for perinatal women.&#xD;
      This program was created as a result of key informant interviews with obstetric providers and&#xD;
      pregnant and postpartum women with opioid use disorders. The program utilizes mobile phone&#xD;
      text message-based screenings with immediate automated feedback, paired with remote care&#xD;
      coordination and, if appropriate, home-based telemedicine mental health and substance use&#xD;
      disorder treatment services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a two-arm pilot RCT (N=100) with 2:1 allocation will examine feasibility and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of LTW, compared to TAU. The investigators aim to identify and address&#xD;
      barriers in recruitment, retention, use of LTW, as well as provide effect size estimates for&#xD;
      a larger RCT.&#xD;
