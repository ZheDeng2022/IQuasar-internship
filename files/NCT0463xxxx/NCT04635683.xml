  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the safety and how effective the combination of ublituximab,&#xD;
      umbralisib, and lenalidomide is in certain types of indolent (slow-growing) non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma. Lenalidomide may stimulate the immune system in different&#xD;
      ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Lenalidomide may also stop the growth of&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Umbralisib is designed to block&#xD;
      a protein called PI3 kinase in order to stop cancer growth and cause changes in the immune&#xD;
      system that may allow the immune system to better act against cancer cells. Ublituximab is an&#xD;
      antibody that attaches to the lymphoma cells and triggers immune reactions that may result in&#xD;
      the death of the targeted lymphoma cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and toxicity of lenalidomide, umbralisib and&#xD;
      ublituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) or&#xD;
      mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the overall response rate (ORR) for patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma (FL) treated at the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to treatment&#xD;
      failure and overall survival (OS) for patients with relapsed or refractory FL treated at the&#xD;
      RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide and umbralisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and umbralisib PO QD&#xD;
      on days 1-28. Beginning in cycle 2, patients also receive ublituximab intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      90 minutes to 4 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a partial or&#xD;
      complete response after cycle 6 continue treatment of lenalidomide PO QD and umbralisib PO QD&#xD;
      for 12 additional cycles, and ublituximab IV on day 1 of subsequent even cycles (8, 10, 12,&#xD;
      14, 16, and 18). Patients with stable disease after cycle 6 may continue on treatment for an&#xD;
      additional 12 cycles at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 8 weeks, and then every&#xD;
      6 months for 2 years.&#xD;

          -  No evidence of prior malignancy except: DLBCL, adequately treated non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer, adequately treated in situ carcinoma, low grade prostate carcinoma (Gleason&#xD;
             grade =&lt; 6) managed with observation that has been stable for at least 6 months, or&#xD;
             any malignancy treated with curative intent and continuously disease free for at least&#xD;
             3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing immunosuppressive therapy (such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine, mycophenolate,&#xD;
             methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors, alemtuzumab). Systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent =&lt; 20 mg daily) are allowed as clinically&#xD;
             warranted. Patients are allowed to use topical or inhaled corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in other interventional clinical trials, including those with other&#xD;
             investigational agents not included in this trial, within 21 days of day 1, cycle 1 of&#xD;
             this trial. Also excluded are patients who are receiving any other investigational&#xD;
             agents outside of a clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of chronic active hepatitis B (hepatitis B virus [HBV], not including&#xD;
             patients with prior hepatitis B vaccination; or positive serum hepatitis B antibody)&#xD;
             or chronic active hepatitis C infection (HCV), active cytomegalovirus (CMV), or known&#xD;
             history of human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV). If hepatitis B core (HBc) antibody&#xD;
             is positive, the subject must be evaluated for the presence of HBV deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
             acid (DNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). If HCV antibody is positive, the&#xD;
             subject must be evaluated for the presence of HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) by PCR. If&#xD;
             the subject is CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) or CMV IgM positive, the subject must be&#xD;
             evaluated for the presence of CMV DNA by PCR. Subjects with positive HBc antibody and&#xD;
             negative HBV DNA by PCR are eligible. Subjects with positive HCV antibody and negative&#xD;
             HCV RNA by PCR are eligible. Subjects who are CMV IgG or CMV IgM positive but who are&#xD;
             CMV DNA negative by PCR are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because lenalidomide has&#xD;
             known teratogenic effects. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lenalidomide,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with lenalidomide. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of anaphylaxis (excluding infusion related reactions) in association with&#xD;
             previous anti-CD20 administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Live virus vaccines within 4 weeks prior to ublituximab therapy&#xD;
