  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis follow different epidemiological trends also&#xD;
      suggesting different pathophysiology behind these two different forms of appendicitis. In&#xD;
      3-10% of patients complicated acute appendicitis is enclosed by formation of a circumscribed&#xD;
      periappendicular abscess. The clinically established practice of antibiotic therapy and&#xD;
      drainage, if necessary, has been shown safe and effective, allowing the acute inflammatory&#xD;
      process to subside in more than 90% of cases without surgery. The need of subsequent interval&#xD;
      appendectomy has been questioned with appendicitis recurrence risk varying between 5-26%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During trial enrollment in our randomized Peri-APPAC trial based on the interim analysis&#xD;
      results with 17% appendiceal tumor rate in the study population, the trial was prematurely&#xD;
      terminated based on ethical concerns. All the follow-up group patients were re-evaluated and&#xD;
      surgery was offered and recommended to all follow-up group patients. After this assessment&#xD;
      and additional appendectomies, two more tumors were diagnosed resulting in neoplasm rate of&#xD;
      20% in the whole study group all diagnosed in patients over 40 years and the neoplasm rate in&#xD;
      patients over 40 years was 29%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on high appendiceal tumor rate in patients over 40 years, the appendiceal neoplasm rate&#xD;
      needs to be further evaluated in prospective patient cohorts undergoing interval appendectomy&#xD;
      as interval appendectomy is generally well tolerated and obliterates the risk of missing a&#xD;
      possible tumor. In a recent systematic review of retrospective cohort studies with 13.244&#xD;
      acute appendicitis patients the overall appendiceal tumor rate was 1% after appendectomy, but&#xD;
      in patients presenting with appendiceal inflammatory mass the neoplasm rate varied from 10%&#xD;
      to 29%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This nationwide prospective multicenter cohort study is designed to assess the prevalence of&#xD;
      appendiceal tumors associated with a periappendicular abscess. All consecutive patients&#xD;
      presenting with a periappendicular abscess are recommended to undergo interval appendectomy&#xD;
      after initial conservative treatment with antibiotic therapy and drainage, if necessary. All&#xD;
      patients older than 35 years will undergo laparoscopic interval appendectomy at 2 to 3 months&#xD;
      and this is also recommended for the patients between 18 and 35 years of age. Asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients under 35 years not willing to undergo interval appendectomy, will undergo a&#xD;
      follow-up MRI at 1 year after the initial non-operative treatment.&#xD;

      During trial enrollment in our randomized Peri-APPAC trial, the high incidence of appendiceal&#xD;
      tumors in the study population alarmed the researchers. Based on the interim analysis results&#xD;
      with 17% appendiceal tumor rate in the study population, the trial was prematurely terminated&#xD;
      based on ethical concerns. All the follow-up group patients were re-evaluated and surgery was&#xD;
      offered and recommended to all follow-up group patients. After this assessment and additional&#xD;
      appendectomies, two more tumors were diagnosed resulting in neoplasm rate of 20% in the whole&#xD;

&#xD;
      This nationwide prospective multicenter cohort study is designed to assess the prevalence of&#xD;
      appendiceal tumors associated with a periappendicular abscess. All of the study hospitals&#xD;
      will have a common clinical protocol of recommending interval appendectomy to all patients&#xD;
      presenting with a periappendicular abscess after initial conservative treatment with&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy and drainage, if necessary. Considering the high rate of appendiceal&#xD;
      neoplasms, all patients older than 35 years will undergo laparoscopic interval appendectomy&#xD;
      at 2 to 3 months after the successful initial non-operative treatment and this is also&#xD;
      recommended for the patients between 18 and 35 years of age. Asymptomatic patients under 35&#xD;
      years not willing to undergo interval appendectomy, will undergo a follow-up MRI at 1 year&#xD;
      after the initial non-operative treatment.&#xD;
