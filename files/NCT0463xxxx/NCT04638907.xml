      Assessing the routinely used protokoll for deep NM Block during robot-assisted prostatectomy&#xD;
      in general anesthesia. The protocoll contains the repeated dosing of rocuronium according to&#xD;
      the results of relaxometry performed with a TOFcuff relaxometer (RGB Medical, Madrid) during&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum. This is done by keeping the block level between 1 to 6 PTC (post tetanic&#xD;
      counts). The scope of the study was to find out, to which percentage this protocoll permits&#xD;
      the maintenance of block level inside of the desired range.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Robot-assisted urological interventions require sufficiently deep neuromuscular relaxation&#xD;
      (NMR) during the phase of pneumoperitoneum. This is achieved by repeated administration of&#xD;
      the non-depolarizing neuromuscular relaxant rocuronium, which is used in clinical routine.&#xD;
      The level of relaxation is usually measured with the TOF-Watch relaxometer. This device has&#xD;
      limitations in its usability and accuracy in this setting because it is unreliable when the&#xD;
      monitored arm of the patient is not accessible for the anaesthetist for visual or tactile&#xD;
      assessment of finger movements. The novel TOF-Cuff relaxometry equipment is by design&#xD;
      intended to provide constant and reliable quantitative and in vivo calibrated relaxometric&#xD;
      values independently of the arm position. The combination of frequently adjusted&#xD;
      neuromuscular relaxation in a standardised mode in combination with a reliable relaxometry by&#xD;
      TOFcuff promises an improved surveillance of neuromuscular relaxation and a higher safety&#xD;
      standard. This investigation aims to test and to define the combined use of the best&#xD;
      available drug with the best available relaxometer for general anesthesia in robot-assisted&#xD;
      urological surgery.&#xD;
