      Malnutrition is a comorbidity oftenly seen in COPD patients who have progressive chronic&#xD;
      inflammation and severity. The investigators aimed to determine the impact of nutritional&#xD;
      status and nutrition-related factors on prolonged length of stay in hospitalized patients&#xD;
      with acute respiratory failure and COPD. Nutritional status has been defined as an&#xD;
      individual's health condition as it is influenced by the intake and utilization of nutrients&#xD;
      (Todhunter, 1970). Nutritional status can be defined by energy balance, body composition and&#xD;
      body function, moreover the chronic inflammation and the physical activity have an important&#xD;
      role. In the study is used some tools (anthropometry, Nutritional Risk Screening [NRS 2002],&#xD;
      food intake, body composition, Fat-Free Mass Index [FFMI], diaphragm ultrasound for&#xD;
      evaluating diaphragmatic mobility, blood tests, hand) to define nutritional status. The&#xD;
      investigatos'll analyze prevalance of malnutrition in the sample and the correlation of&#xD;
      malnutrition with prolonged length of stay in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory&#xD;
      failure and COPD.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease characterized by chronic&#xD;
      obstruction of lung airflow that interferes with normal breathing and is not fully&#xD;
      reversible. In Italy the disease frequency is growing, our last estimate by National Health&#xD;
      Service in the year 2014 shows more than 6 cases on 100 people (6% of the population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample selection: 40 partecipants were enrolled in the Internal Medicine Department of&#xD;
           S. Giovanni Calibita Fatebenefratelli Hospital in Rome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection: anamnesis (sex, age, GOLD classification, active pathologies, length of&#xD;
           stay in hospital); Nutritional Risk Screening [NRS 2002]; food Intake: as pergentage of&#xD;
           ingesta in the last meal; (MMRC) dyspnea scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometry parameters: height , body weight, arm circumference, triceps skin fold&#xD;
           thickness and Body Mass index was calculated [BMI = weight (Kg) / (stature (m))Â²]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Composition: bioimpedance analysis (fat free mass, fat mass, phase angle, fat free&#xD;
           mass index [height-normalized index of FFM, which is calculated by dividing FFM (in kg)&#xD;
           by height (in m2) ]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: albumin (g/dL), transferrin (mg/dL), prealbumin (mg/dL), lymphocytes /mm3,&#xD;
           Retinol-binding protein (mg/dL), PCR (mg/L), NLR (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional examinations: handgrip&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diaphragm ultrasound performed during quiet respiration. The right diaphragm is analyzed&#xD;
           through the liver window. The transducer is placed in the anterior subcostal region&#xD;
           between the mid clavicular and anterior axillary lines. The ultrasound beam should reach&#xD;
           the posterior part of the diaphragm. In the B mode view, the diaphragm is identified as&#xD;
           an echogenic line between the interface of the lung and liver or spleen. Then, M mode is&#xD;
           performed to record diaphragmatic excursion during respiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Demographic and clinical features were summarized with the descriptive statistic&#xD;
      (mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range) for continuous variables and with&#xD;
      absolute frequencies and percentage for categorical variables. We used Chi-Square Tests or&#xD;
      Fisher's Exact Test (if n &lt; 5) for comparison of percentages. We used the Pearson or Sperman&#xD;
      correlation to evaluate the relationship between the continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval and consent to participate All procedures performed in studies involving&#xD;
      human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and the&#xD;
      national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments&#xD;
      or comparable ethical standards.&#xD;
