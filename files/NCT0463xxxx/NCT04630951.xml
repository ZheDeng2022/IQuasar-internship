  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this clinical study are evaluated the effects of Blood Flood Restriction training&#xD;
      on the sport performance of professional and semi-professional soccer players. The&#xD;
      participants are twenty male professional and semi-professional soccer players who are&#xD;
      playing at RCD Mallorca. Participants will be assigned in two different groups. Both groups&#xD;
      develop for six weeks a strength training programs. The first group will base their training&#xD;
      in Low Load using Blood Flow Restriction (20-50% of one maximum repetition). The second group&#xD;
      will base their training in High Load (60-80% of one maximum repetition). This training&#xD;
      program includes three type of exercises in each training session; back squat, single&#xD;
      deadlift and barbell hip thrust. Before and after this program the investigators will collect&#xD;
      sociodemographic and anthropometrics data. On top of that, the investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      the muscle mass, the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles, the muscle strength&#xD;
      and the sprint ability of every participant. Before to the evaluation, the soccer players&#xD;
      will warm-up during 15 minutes under the control of the evaluators.&#xD;

      PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are soccer players of RCD Mallorca (Second Spanish Football Division) and RCD&#xD;
      Mallorca B (Third Spanish Football Division).Before to start the study, every participant&#xD;
      will receive an informed consent about the clinical study. This informed consent will be&#xD;
      signed by them according to Declaration of Helsinki. At the same time, the data will be&#xD;
      anonymized and only the main researcher of the study will have access to it, to ensure&#xD;
      compliance with the Data Protection Law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      W-UP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The warm-up will consist of 5 minutes running slow (treadmill), 5 minutes mobility, and 5&#xD;
      minutes of running exercises. In addition, the warm-up will contain a familiarization with&#xD;
      the jump test&#xD;
