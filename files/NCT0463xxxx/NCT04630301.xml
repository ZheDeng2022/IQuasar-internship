  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrapleural pressures have been shown to be a useful clinical predictor in pleural&#xD;
      effusions, however it's utility has not been described in pneumothorax. Data on intrapleural&#xD;
      pressures in pneumothorax are limited. Furthermore, the pleural pressure in tension&#xD;
      pneumothorax is theorized to be greater than atmospheric pressure, though this has never been&#xD;
      verified. Pneumothorax is primarily treated with a tube thoracostomy. This observational&#xD;
      study will record intrapleural pressures in participants with pneumothorax undergoing a tube&#xD;
      thoracostomy. Clinical outcomes of participants will then be monitored for need for&#xD;
      pleurodesis, intrabronchial valve placement, and video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)&#xD;
      to identify a correlation with intrapleural pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rate of hospitalization for spontaneous pneumothorax among people age 14 or older is&#xD;
      approximately 227 per million. Spontaneous pneumothorax in the absence of trauma can be&#xD;
      further classified as primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) or secondary spontaneous&#xD;
      pneumothorax (SSP) based on the absence or presence of underlying structural lung disease,&#xD;
      respectively. Though recent studies suggest that in some cases conservative management with&#xD;
      close observation is an acceptable treatment, definitive evacuation remains a cornerstone of&#xD;
      management for patients who are symptomatic or who have a large pneumothorax. Intrapleural&#xD;
      air can be removed by either needle aspiration or introduction of a watersealed catheter into&#xD;
      the pleural space. In the event of tension pneumothorax (TP), emergent chest thoracostomy is&#xD;
      preferred. In all cases, the goal of treatment remains to re-expand the affected lung, after&#xD;
      which the catheter may be removed. If the visceral pleural defect is not healed after 5 days,&#xD;
      it is deemed a persistent air leak. In these cases, the chest tube is maintained and more&#xD;
      aggressive measures such as pleurodesis, placement of an intrabronchial valve (IBV), or VATS&#xD;
      are performed. Unfortunately, there is currently no method to predict which patients will&#xD;
      require these more invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of prognostic indicators is not the case in pleural effusions, however. Pleural&#xD;
      manometry has been shown to be a useful tool in the management of patients with effusions.&#xD;
      Doelken et al. described using an overdamped water manometer or an electronic transducer&#xD;
      connected to a thoracentesis catheter for the direct measurement of Ppl with similar&#xD;
      accuracy. Traditionally, thoracenteses are aborted after onset of dyspnea or cough, all fluid&#xD;
      is drained, or 1 liter of fluid has been removed. This 1 liter limit exists to avoid the&#xD;
      feared complicated of reexpansion pulmonary edema. However, monitoring of Ppl during drainage&#xD;
      and aborting the procedure once Ppl drops below -20 cmH2O allows for safe drainage of often&#xD;
      larger volumes. - Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Ppl could diagnose&#xD;
      non-expandable lung and predict pleurodesis failure in patients with malignant effusion. We&#xD;
      recently reported the use of a simple, in-line, digital manometer to measure Ppl in patients&#xD;
      with pleural effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine use of pleural manometry in the evaluation and management of pneumothorax has not yet&#xD;
      been adopted, likely due to the historical difficulty in obtaining measurements and the&#xD;
      uncertain clinical benefit pleural manometry provided. It has been found that Ppl in&#xD;
      spontaneous pneumothorax was greater in patients that required prolonged drainage. These&#xD;
      results were later supported in a study that demonstrated the practicality of measuring Ppl&#xD;
      in pneumothorax. Ppl measurements required only up to 30 seconds by using an electronic&#xD;
      manometer connected to an intrapleural catheter. Still to date, Ppl in TP have yet to be&#xD;
      reported. Ultimately, measurement of Ppl in pneumothorax may help identify patients at&#xD;
      increased risk for the need of advanced therapies such as IBV placement, pleurodesis, or&#xD;
      VATS. Early identification of these high-risk patients will allow for these interventions to&#xD;
      be performed earlier, thus reducing hospital length of stay, associated complications, and&#xD;
      health-care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients admitted to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with spontaneous, iatrogenic, or tension&#xD;
           pneumothorax referred to the Division of Interventional Pulmonology for thoracostomy&#xD;
           will be recruited. Using standard sterile technique, a 14fr catheter will be inserted&#xD;
           into the pleural space. An electronic manometer (Compass, Medline Industries, Inc.) will&#xD;
           be connected in-line to the introducer needle and Ppl will be recorded for 3-5&#xD;
           respiratory cycles. After measurement, the manometer will be removed and the catheter&#xD;
           will remain in place per routine standards of practice. Outcome data of patients will be&#xD;
           collected including duration of chest tube placement, need for pleurodesis, IBV, and&#xD;
           referral for VATS. Patient data will be de-identified and stored on the a Johns Hopkins&#xD;
           secured (SAFE) desktop. A separate file will also be kept on the SAFE desktop that&#xD;
           contains participant Medical Record Numbers to allow for matching of Ppl measurements&#xD;
           with clinical outcomes. Once outcome data is collected for a participant, the&#xD;
           participant's identifiable information will be removed. A combined waiver of consent and&#xD;
           oral consent process will be used. The waiver of consent will allow performance of chest&#xD;
           tube placement and the collection of pressure measurements via the manometer without the&#xD;
           consent of potential subjects. Subsequently, an oral consent process will be used to&#xD;
           invite potential subjects to enroll in the study and to get consent for the use of the&#xD;
           pressure data already collected as well as for further data collection from the&#xD;
           patients' medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No biospecimens will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients will be enrolled over the course of 1 year. The study will not impact length of&#xD;
           hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. This is a nonblinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients will continue to receive standard of care treatments. This study may delay&#xD;
           catheter placement by mere seconds to accommodate for Ppl measurements, this delay is&#xD;
           negligible and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. will not impact clinical outcomes as even in the case of tension the pleural air will be&#xD;
           evacuated via the introducer needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. This study does not include a placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Participant removal criteria include pneumothorax in which Ppl cannot be reliably&#xD;
           measured within 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Participants removed from the study will continue to receive standard-of-care treatment.&#xD;
