      The study aims at evaluating the morphological changes of plaque estimated by optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT) and Factors Influencing Plaque Healing after Drug-Coated Balloon&#xD;
      (DCB) for de Novo Coronary Lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Percutaneous coronary intervention with a drug-eluting stent (DES) is the most common mode of&#xD;
      revascularization for coronary artery disease. However, their efficacy is limited by in-stent&#xD;
      restenosis and stent thrombosis. Drug-coated balloon (DCB) deliver an anti-proliferative drug&#xD;
      into the vessel wall and leave nothing behind, which is a promising technique in the&#xD;
      treatment of coronary artery disease. Previous many studies have confirmed that DCB treatment&#xD;
      for de Novo coronary lesions is safe and efficient. But, data about morphological changes of&#xD;
      plaque and factors influencing plaque healing after DCB for de Novo Coronary Lesions is&#xD;
      scarce. The study compares morphological changes of plaques evaluated by OCT between baseline&#xD;
      and 1-year follow-up and evaluates factors influencing plaque healing. All the included&#xD;
      patient will receive dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for one month followed by clopidogrel&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Lesion characteristics evaluated by OCT include lipid-rich plaque, fibrous plaque, macrophage, cholesterol crystal, microchannels and calcification and minimal lumen area (MLA). The follow-up OCT assessment will be performed 12 months after the treatment procedure.</description>

    <description>The characteristics of lipid-plaque evaluated by OCT include lipid core length, mean lipid arc, max lipid arc, fibrous cap thickness (FCT). The follow-up OCT assessment will be performed 12 months after the treatment procedure.</description>

    <time_frame>1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>All the patients are divided into two groups according to presence of late lumen loss (LLL) at follow-up. The OCT-defined characteristics include plaque rupture, plaque erosion, lipid-rich plaque, fibrous plaque, macrophage, cholesterol crystal, microchannels and calcification. If the plaque is rich in lipid, the lipid core length, mean lipid arc, max lipid arc, fibrous cap thickness (FCT) will be compared.</description>
