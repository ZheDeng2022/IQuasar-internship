  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In 2012, over 3.2 million Canadians over 15 (11.3%) years reported symptoms of&#xD;
      major depressive disorder (MDD), and barriers such as lack of readily available care system,&#xD;
      stigma and affordability of health care services were reported by millions of Canadians who&#xD;
      expressed they had unmet or partially met mental health care needs. There is the need to&#xD;
      develop innovative psychological interventions which are not human resource intensive, are&#xD;
      easily accessible, cost-effective, are geographic location independent, scalable, and can be&#xD;
      offered to thousands of people simultaneously. Supportive text messaging has been proven in&#xD;
      clinical trials to be effective in alleviating depression symptoms but are limited in their&#xD;
      ability support those without active cell phones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness and user satisfaction with daily supportive e-mail messaging as an intervention&#xD;
      to treat patients with MDD when compared to daily supportive text messaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: In this innovative two-arm randomized non-inferiority pilot trial, patients with MDD&#xD;
      receiving usual care would be randomized to receive either daily supportive email messaging&#xD;
      or daily supportive text messaging of the same content for six months. The Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 scale will be utilized to record depression symptom scores, the&#xD;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 scale would be used to record the anxiety symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life will be measured using the WHO (Five) Well-Being Index (WHO-5) at baseline,&#xD;
      6, 12 and 24 weeks. Primary outcomes would be the mean difference in change scores on the&#xD;
      PHQ-9 and WHO-5 scales from baseline to 6, 12 and 24 weeks for the two study arms. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include changed scores on the GAD7 scale from baseline to 6, 12 and 24 weeks for the&#xD;
      two study arms, the dropout rates and the satisfaction rates at 12 and 24 weeks for&#xD;
      participants in the two treatment arms. All outcome measures would be analyzed using&#xD;
      descriptive and inferential statistics. Qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic&#xD;
      analysis aided by NVIVO software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: We expect the study results to be available within 18 months of study commencement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The results of this study will shed light on the feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      effectiveness of using automated email supportive message interventions in the management of&#xD;
      patients with MDD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a debilitating condition which is characterized by changes in mood,&#xD;
      self-attitude, cognitive functioning, sleep, appetite, and energy levels. Depression causes a&#xD;
      decrease in quality of life that leads to impairment in occupational and social functioning.&#xD;
      In 2010, it was estimated that mental and substance use disorders were the leading cause of&#xD;
      years lived with disability worldwide, with Depressive disorders in particular accounting for&#xD;
      40·5% of disability-adjusted life-years caused by mental and substance use disorders.&#xD;
      Depression is thus a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease and it is&#xD;
      projected by the World Health Organization, that by 2030, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)&#xD;
      will be the leading cause of disability worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, over 3.2 million Canadians over 15 (11.3%) years reported symptoms of major&#xD;
      depression and a higher health and service utilization amongst patients with depression have&#xD;
      been reported compared to other patients. Psycho-social interventions and pharmacotherapy is&#xD;
      the preferred first-line treatment for severe mental health problems including major&#xD;
      depression. Psychotherapies, such as cognitive behavior therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy,&#xD;
      problem-solving and behavioral activation are common and effective forms of treatment for&#xD;
      depression. However, access to these psychotherapies are often limited by human resource&#xD;
      capacity constraints and most people with depressive disorders do not receive treatment.&#xD;
      Psychosocial services are also mostly found in cities and towns, with reduced access for&#xD;
      rural inhabitants. Even in cities and towns these services are mostly only available during&#xD;
      the working days and day time business hours, with caregivers often dealing with double the&#xD;
      recommended number of clients, further restricting appointment availability. Long wait times&#xD;
      to access counselling services and the stigma associated with seeking mental health&#xD;
      counselling also compound the problem. In the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey on Mental&#xD;
      Health, barriers such as lack of readily available care system, stigma and affordability of&#xD;
      health care services, were reported by 2.3 million Canadians who expressed they had unmet or&#xD;
      partially met mental health care needs. It is clear, that traditional ways of providing&#xD;
      mental healthcare alone will not be able to meet the demands for services given that the&#xD;
      prevalence of depression is so high and not likely to decrease any time soon. There is,&#xD;
      therefore, the need to develop innovative psychological interventions which are not human&#xD;
      resource intensive, are easily accessible, cost-effective, are geographic location&#xD;
      independent, scalable, and can be offered to thousands of people simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital technologies for the provision of health care interventions have advanced&#xD;
      significantly in the last decade and further development of this field looks very promising.&#xD;
      The new technologies may enhance access to mental healthcare and contribute to closing the&#xD;
      treatment gap that has existed over the years. Current evidence supports the efficacy and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of tele mental health, especially in the context of treating depressive&#xD;
      disorders. Useful communication methods for the delivery of mental health services includes&#xD;
      smartphone apps, text messages and e-mails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive text messages have become an appropriate and acceptable means of delivering&#xD;
      psychological care to patients with mental health issues. It is estimated that 99% of&#xD;
      received mobile text messages are opened, and 90% of all text messages are read within three&#xD;
      minutes of reception and present an opportunity to aid in the closure of the psychological&#xD;
      treatment gap for patients with depression. In three randomized controlled trials conducted&#xD;
      in Ireland and Canada, patients with MDD who received twice-daily supportive text messages&#xD;
      had significantly greater reductions in their depression symptom scores compared to patients&#xD;
      who received the usual treatment. In the first of two studies conducted in Ireland, after&#xD;
      three months, the mean difference in change Becks Depression Inventory (BID)-II scores&#xD;
      between the intervention and the control group was -7.9 (95% CI -13.06 to -2.76,&#xD;
      Cohen'sd=0.85) in favor of the intervention group. Similar results were reported in another&#xD;
      Irish study with larger sample size and in a Canadian study, a significant difference was&#xD;
      found in the 3 months mean BDI scores between the intervention and control groups: (20.8 (SD&#xD;
      = 11.7) vs. 24.9 (SD = 11.5), respectively, F (1, 60) = 4.83, p = 0.03, ηp2 = 0.07) with an&#xD;
      effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.67. literature review of studies conducted on the effectiveness&#xD;
      of text messaging as an adjunct therapy for mothers with postpartum depression living in&#xD;
      low-income countries also reported a positive outcome and the mothers noted that they would&#xD;
      love to receive psychological care via the text messaging. Several studies have also reported&#xD;
      high user satisfaction of the supportive text message intervention and in one of these&#xD;
      studies, 83% of subscribers to the Text4Mood program reported that the daily messages&#xD;
      contributed to improving their overall mental wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anecdotally, some people have not been able to subscribe to supportive text messaging&#xD;
      programs such as Text4Hope and Text4Mood because they do not have active cell phone numbers,&#xD;
      with several individuals for whom these programs have been recommended in Addiction and&#xD;
      Mental Health clinics in Edmonton enquiring if the messages could be sent to them via email.&#xD;
      In the participants' satisfaction survey for the Text4Hope program, majority of respondents&#xD;
      (64%), even though they had access to cell phones, were in favor of Email messaging for as&#xD;
      part of their health care interventions during crisis periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this technological period where faster, accessible and efficient communication medium is&#xD;
      of outmost importance, e-mail has emerged and professionals have continued to used e-mail as&#xD;
      a medium of communication, including communication between physicians with patients. The&#xD;
      uniqueness of E-mail can be linked to its special characteristics, such as asynchronous&#xD;
      communication and rapid message delivery. Electronic-therapy has been rapidly expanding in&#xD;
      the last decades, with evidence suggesting that the provision of mental health services over&#xD;
      the internet is both clinically efficacious and cost-effective even though its effects remain&#xD;
      underutilized by the medical fraternity as a viable medium of communication. Given this&#xD;
      introduction, the goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness and user satisfaction with daily supportive e-mail messaging as an intervention&#xD;
      to treat patients with MDD when compared to daily supportive text messaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the mean the difference/change in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 scores&#xD;
           from baseline at 6, 12 and 24 weeks for patients with MDD receiving standard care plus&#xD;
           daily supportive Email messages to those receiving standard care plus daily supportive&#xD;
           text messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the mean the difference/change in the WHO (Five) Well-Being Index (WHO-5)&#xD;
           scores from baseline at 6, 12 and 24 week for patients with MDD receiving standard care&#xD;
           plus daily supportive Email messages to those receiving standard care plus daily&#xD;
           supportive text messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the mean the difference/change in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7&#xD;
           scale scores from baseline at 6, 12 and 24 week for patients with MDD receiving standard&#xD;
           care plus daily supportive Email messages to those receiving standard care plus daily&#xD;
           supportive text messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the dropout and satisfaction rates between patients in the two treatment&#xD;
           arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To explore the perspectives of beneficiaries and opt-out patients on their perceptions&#xD;
           about the interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research coordinator will assist participants who have provided written informed consent to&#xD;
      enrol on either the email messaging or text messaging program by inputting their email&#xD;
      address or phone numbers into online email messaging or text messaging applications which&#xD;
      would be used to deliver the daily messages. Starting a day after enrollments, participants&#xD;
      will receive either daily supportive text messages or daily supportive email messages. Both&#xD;
      the email and text messages have the same content and have been crafted by mental health&#xD;
      therapists, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists and mental health service users based on&#xD;
      Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) principles. Each message would be scheduled to be delivered&#xD;
      to participants cell phone or email address at 10 AM MT and each participant would receive&#xD;
      the messages for 6 months.&#xD;
