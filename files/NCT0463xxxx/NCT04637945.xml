  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the capacity of an anthocyanin-rich blend (ACRB) dietary&#xD;
      supplement to improve the alterations in lipid and glucose homeostasis triggered by&#xD;
      consumption of a high-fat meal. Given the impact of Western style diets and obesity on the&#xD;
      development of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other pathologies, this study has&#xD;
      major public health implications.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In particular, this study will investigate the beneficial effects of long-term (8 weeks)&#xD;
      supplementation with ACRB on fasting and postprandial levels of plasma triglycerides, as well&#xD;
      as other parameters of lipid and glucose homeostasis and inflammation. Postprandial changes&#xD;
      will be evaluated after consumption of a high-fat meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive either a: i) placebo (control),or ii) ACRB product for 8 weeks. At the&#xD;
      beginning and at the end of the 8-week period, subjects will be submitted to a metabolic&#xD;
      challenge consisting of consuming a high-fat meal after receiving the study product (placebo,&#xD;
      ACRB). The high-fat meal will consist of English muffin bread, sausage, egg and cheese,&#xD;
      obtained from US market with carotenoid-free palm oil added to bring the total dietary fat to&#xD;
      the desired level. The total weight of the high-fat meal will be 320 g with 70.5 g of fat&#xD;
      (29.8 g of saturated fat), 270 mg of cholesterol, 65 g carbohydrate, 5.2 g sugar, and 33 g&#xD;
      protein. The total energy content of the high-fat meal will be 1,026 Kcal with a total of 62%&#xD;
      energy originated from fat, 25% from carbohydrates and 13% from protein. Blood will be taken&#xD;
      by venipuncture before (baseline, 0 h) and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5 h after consumption of&#xD;
      both the high-fat meal and the study product. Plasma will be collected and chylomicrons and&#xD;
      peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) will be isolated. Blood pressure and skin carotenoid&#xD;
      content will be measured. Subjects will be also asked to collect feces before starting and at&#xD;
      the end of the 8 week period.&#xD;
