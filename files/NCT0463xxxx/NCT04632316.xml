    <textblock>
      WiNK is a Phase I/IIa trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oNKord® in 33 adults with&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are in morphologic complete remission with residual&#xD;
      measurable disease and with no strong indication for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WiNK is a prospective 2-stage, open-label, single arm, multicenter Phase I/IIa trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of oNKord®, an off-the-shelf, ex vivo-cultured allogeneic NK&#xD;
      cell preparation, in 33 adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are in morphologic&#xD;
      complete remission (CR) with residual measurable disease (MRD) and with no strong indication&#xD;
      for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent and eligibility procedures, subjects enrolled in the trial will&#xD;
      receive a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine&#xD;
      (Cy/Flu) followed by up to 3 oNKord® infusions 4 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage A of the trial (dose escalation stage) is designed to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of up to 3 oNKord® infusions, 4 days apart, in 3 cohorts of 3 subjects, and to&#xD;
      determine the oNKord® recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) to be used in Stage B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage B of the trial (expansion stage) will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      oNKord® at the RP2D in 24 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects treated with oNKord® will be followed up until 12 months after the start of&#xD;
      treatment. Eligibility criteria for participation in the trial and follow-up duration are the&#xD;
      same for subjects in both Stage A and Stage B.&#xD;
