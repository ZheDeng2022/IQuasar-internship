  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a restaurant menu label to indicate foods and beverage items on&#xD;
      restaurant menus that contain high amounts of added sugars and to test its perceived&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Objectives and hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to examine how added sugar restaurant menu labels influence U.S.&#xD;
      adults' perceptions and reactions. Predictions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a between-subjects experiment with 3 arms (control label, icon-only added sugars label,&#xD;
      and icon plus text added sugars label):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Added sugar labels will be perceived as more effective than the control label.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The text plus icon label will be perceived as more effective than the icon-only label.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A larger proportion of participants who see the added sugar labels will report learning&#xD;
           something new than those who see the control label.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Added sugar labels will lead participants to more accurately identify restaurant menu&#xD;
           items high in added sugars compared to the control label, and the text plus icon label&#xD;
           will outperform the icon-only label on this outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, using a within-subjects design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will examine which label (control, icon, text plus icon) most discourages wanting&#xD;
      to consume menu items high in added sugars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will compare various icon and text options for the added sugars label to determine&#xD;
      which icon and which text variations are perceived as most discouraging for wanting to&#xD;
      consume items high in added sugars. The is no hypothesis about which will be perceived as&#xD;
      more discouraging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For predictions 1-2: linear regression model (OLS) regressing PME on indicator variables for&#xD;
      experimental condition. The margins command in STATA will be used to conduct pairwise&#xD;
      comparisons between each condition (i.e., icon-only vs. icon plus text label). Also, PME will&#xD;
      be regressed on an indicator variable combining the added sugar label groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For predictions 3-4, Poisson regression with robust standard errors will be used to estimate&#xD;
      relative probability, regressing each dichotomous outcome on indicator variables for&#xD;
      experimental condition. The margins command in STATA will be used to conduct pairwise&#xD;
      comparisons between each condition. The outcomes will be regressed on an indicator variable&#xD;
      combining the added sugar label groups. If the Poisson regressions do not converge, logistic&#xD;
      regression will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the within-subjects comparisons, mixed effects linear models will be used to assess the&#xD;
      relationship between condition and rating of label discouragement for consuming items high in&#xD;
      added sugars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A critical alpha 0.05 will be used, and statistical tests will be two-tailed. Because this is&#xD;
      an initial, exploratory study to help identify the best performing label to use in a larger&#xD;
      trial, alpha level will not be adjusted to control for multiple comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is evidence of deviations from modeling assumptions required for the parametric&#xD;
      tests above, non-parametric sensitivity analyses will be conducted.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study uses both a between- and within-subjects design.&#xD;
Between-subjects design: Participants will be randomized to view restaurant menu items with a control label (QR code) or either one of two added sugars labels: an icon based label or the same icon plus text. (Within the icon condition, participants will be randomized to view 1 of 6 label icons. In the icon plus text condition, participants will be randomized to see 1 of 3 text options accompanying 1 of the 6 icons.&#xD;
Within-subjects design:&#xD;
To identify which label is perceived as most discouraging, participants will view the 3 labels one-by-one in random order, for a total of 3 conditions.&#xD;
To identify which design variations in icon and text are perceived as most discouraging, participants will view 6 icon-only labels one-by-one in random order. Then participants will view each of the 3 text variations together with one of the icons one-by-one in random order.</intervention_model_description>
