      2.1. Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the incidence and risk of CDI within one year after kidney, liver, and/or&#xD;
           pancreas transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the risk factors for recurrent CDI post-transplant in patients who were&#xD;
           diagnosed with a CDI within one year prior to Solid Organ Transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of CDI on graft survival following Solid Organ Transplant&#xD;

      -  Single center, retrospective cohort chart review study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be collected on all liver, kidney, pancreas and combined transplant recipients&#xD;
           who received their graft(s) from April 1, 2015 to July 31, 2018&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will analyze outcomes from April 1, 2014 to July 31, 2019&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient list will be generated in Epic and Meditech&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All data will be obtained from Epic and Meditech&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All data will be collected retrospectively after the patient is discharged from the&#xD;
           hospital&#xD;
