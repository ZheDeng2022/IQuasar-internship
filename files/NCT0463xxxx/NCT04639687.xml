  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food insecurity predisposes to poor diet, thereby increasing risk for diet-sensitive chronic&#xD;
      disease. This trial is to evaluate the impact of a model of weekly home-delivery of&#xD;
      locally-grown vegetables along with selected whole grains on diet among low-income children&#xD;
      living in a household with food insecurity. The investigators plan to enroll children (10-15&#xD;
      years) who will participate along with their parent/caregiver. Intervention will consist of&#xD;
      12 weeks of weekly delivered food plus recipes and text-messaged links to cooking&#xD;
      instruction. Dyads will be randomized (2:1) to either immediate intervention or a wait-list&#xD;
      control group, and diet and diet-related behaviors will be assessed in-person as well as over&#xD;
      the telephone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children and their families who are seen at the investigators primary care clinic will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility by the research team study staff, and caregiver/parents will be&#xD;
      asked a short 2-item screener about access to food. This screener has been called the &quot;Hunger&#xD;
      Vital Sign&quot;. When a screen for household food security is positive, caregivers are invited to&#xD;
      participate in this study along with their child, as a dyad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized clinical trial. The first activity consists of an in-person visit where&#xD;
      child and caregiver answer survey questions related to diet (specifically regarding vegetable&#xD;
      and whole grain purchase and consumption). Anthropometrics are measured. The child has a&#xD;
      24-hour diet recall that is conducted in person at this visit, and then two more times in the&#xD;
      intervening time (approximately 2 weeks). They are randomized (2:1) at this visit to either&#xD;
      receive 12 weeks of deliveries immediately (starting in approximately 2 weeks) or after a&#xD;
      delay of 3 months, when they serve as the delayed-intervention control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate intervention group receives a weekly delivery of vegetables and whole grains as&#xD;
      well as 1-2 weekly text messages that contain education such as links to cooking tips and&#xD;
      videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months, both immediate intervention and the delayed intervention groups return for a&#xD;
      second in-person visit, and complete all of the visit activities. Delayed intervention group&#xD;
      starts their deliveries at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months, the delayed intervention group returns for a third in-person visit, though&#xD;
      the immediate intervention participants complete their follow-up survey questions over the&#xD;
      telephone, only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This home delivery model, done in coordination with a community-supported has been&#xD;
      successfully-piloted in a population of low-income dyads with a child having prediabetes.&#xD;
