  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liquid biopsy based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) method has become an increasingly&#xD;
      powerful detection tool for clinical research and practice. As a companion diagnostic panel,&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay has the considerable potential to detect the blood tumor&#xD;
      mutation burden (bTMB), and bTMB calculated by ctDNA assay is regarded as a novel and&#xD;
      promising biomarker for immunotherapy nowadays. Though immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in&#xD;
      immunotherapy are highly effective but can induce severe immune-related adverse events&#xD;
      (irAEs), which cannot be better predicted in advance. Meanwhile adoptive transfer of T cells&#xD;
      transgenic for tumor-reactive T-cell receptors (TCR) is an attractive immunotherapeutic&#xD;
      approach. However, clinical translation is so far limited due to challenges in the&#xD;
      identification of suitable target antigens as well as TCRs that are concurrent safe and&#xD;
      efficient. Definition of key characteristics relevant for effective and specific tumor&#xD;
      rejection is essential to improve current TCR-based immunotherapy. This research is to&#xD;
      characterize in-depth TCRs derived from HLA-mismatched allogeneic repertoire targeting&#xD;
      different myeloperoxidase (MPO)-derived peptides presented by the same HLA-restriction&#xD;
      element. Overall the purpose of this trial is to investigate the combined predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers (including bTMB and HLA) related to the immunotherapy effects and the biomarker&#xD;
      (TCR) associated with adverse reactions during immunotherapy and hold a predictive role, thus&#xD;
      further benefit patients receiving immunotherapy, especially in the advanced stage lung&#xD;
      cancer patients where tissue samples are unavailable.&#xD;

      Blood samples including the plasma and PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cell) from&#xD;
      immunotherapy-naive lung cancer patients will be analyzed by CGP panel (OrigiMed, Inc.) for&#xD;
      multiple molecular biomarkers including mutations with sensitivity/resistance to targeted&#xD;
      therapies, bTMB, HLA, etc. Treatment methods and outcomes will be followed-up to inspect the&#xD;
      clinical benefit and safety with CGP-panel analysis.&#xD;
