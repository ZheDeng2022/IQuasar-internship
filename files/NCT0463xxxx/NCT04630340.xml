      An Innovation involving Self-Surveillance and Serious Gaming to Increase Smoking Quit rate:&#xD;
      Protocol for a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract Introduction and study aims Smoking is a health hazard associated with cancer,&#xD;
      vascular and lung diseases. Current methods to manage smoking cessation have limited success.&#xD;
      A recent systematic review suggests increase in smoking cessation potential via serious&#xD;
      gaming to attain desirable healthcare outcomes. Outcomes are limited in these studies to&#xD;
      demonstrate, quantify, and understand these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have demonstrated feasibility of a portable device (&quot;STEADES-1&quot;) which&#xD;
      allows smokers to measure their exhaled-breath carbon monoxide (eCO) levels, related to their&#xD;
      cigarette-smoking intensities. They can relay the eCO measurements via smart-phone&#xD;
      applications (app) to their virtual coach to report their smoking cessation progress. The&#xD;
      investigators have created an enhanced STEADES-2 system, which incorporates gamification&#xD;
      using the eCO data as game element and allows anonymized smokers to compete with each other&#xD;
      for the game rewards. It has additional authentication functions and embeds an e-coaching&#xD;
      program by trained healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis This pilot randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the feasibility&#xD;
      and outcomes of the STEADES-2 system in increasing smoking quit rate. The former includes&#xD;
      assessing the smokers to monitor their eCO levels; leverage on telesupport via the e-Coaching&#xD;
      to raise their motivation; reduce relapse tendencies by playing serious games with fellow&#xD;
      smokers. The investigators postulate that the smoking quit rate in smokers in the STEADES-2&#xD;
      intervention group will be higher by 50% than the controls over 12 weeks. This trial will&#xD;
      randomly select 20 smokers each into the intervention group and the control group. Smokers in&#xD;
      both groups will be compared in terms of complete abstinence from cigarettes as the primary&#xD;
      outcome at 12 weeks post-enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination The Institutional Review Board approves the study. The results will&#xD;
      be disseminated via conferences and publications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This overarching aim of this pilot randomized controlled trial is to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of implementing the STEADES system (device and app) in smokers and to compare its&#xD;
      effectiveness in increasing their smoking quit rate between the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups. Feasibility is demonstrated by quantifying the self-surveillance, serious gaming and&#xD;
      engagement of the virtual coaches in the STEADES-2 system. Thus the feasibility is evaluated&#xD;
      by the utility rate of the STEADES-2 device by the smokers, transmission rate of the eCO data&#xD;
      and frequency of interaction with their virtual coach and gamification rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The study aims to determine the proportion of smokers with total abstinence of smoking&#xD;
      in the STEADES-2 intervention arm compared to those in the control arm at the end of 12 weeks&#xD;
      after study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The proportion of smokers with total smoking abstinence in the intervention arm&#xD;
      will be 50% higher than those in the control arm at the end of 12 weeks from the time of&#xD;
      study recruitment. The total smoking abstinence is defined by both the eCO measurement&#xD;
      (0-1pmm) from the STEADES-2 device and the negative result based on the cotinine test kit at&#xD;
      12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The study is a pilot randomized controlled trial in ambulatory setting at public&#xD;
      primary care clinics (polyclinics) in a densely populated, urbanised community in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main site for the implementation of the study will be located at two branches of&#xD;
      SingHealth Polyclinics in Pasir Ris and Bedok estates in north-eastern and eastern region of&#xD;
      the island state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects The target subjects are adult smokers aged 21 years and above, who will be recruited&#xD;
      at the two sites. Smokers from the other SingHealth Polyclinics can be directed to the study&#xD;
      sites by internal referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation This is planned as a pilot study to assess the feasibility of this&#xD;
      complex intervention involving a multi-component innovation. In addition, the limited funding&#xD;
      allows the recruitment of up to 40 smokers, 20 of which will be randomly selected to the&#xD;
      intervention arm and another 20 to the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization will be carried out centrally at the Research Department office&#xD;
      at the institution headquarter. The clinical research coordinator will call in to an&#xD;
      administrator to determine the assignment of the consented subject. The administrator will&#xD;
      use sealed envelope with a prior sequence of allotment based on random numbers generated by&#xD;
      SPSS software to assign the subject to either intervention or controlled arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment process A clinical research coordinator (CRC) will be trained by the&#xD;
      investigators on the functions and use of the STEADES-2 system. The CRC will recruit smokers&#xD;
      who are referred by the clinical teams at the study sites. They will provide information to&#xD;
      the potential subjects using the institution review board's approved study documents which&#xD;
      describe the study intent and protocol and address their queries before the subjects endorse&#xD;
      the written consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Subjects in the intervention arm will be inducted to the use of STEADES-2 device&#xD;
      by the CRC. The CRC will assist to download the STEADES app into the subject's smartphone;&#xD;
      demonstrate the use of the app and the procedure for the serious games; and linkage to the&#xD;
      virtual coach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control arm, the subjects will be enrolled into the existing smoking cessation program&#xD;
      in the respective polyclinic, which covers smoking cessation advice, together with an exhaled&#xD;
      breath analysed using a commercially available eCO measurement device and the STEADES device&#xD;
      by a trained nurse counsellor. They will complete a questionnaire and their smoking status&#xD;
      will be re-assessed at 12 weeks after their enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will collect these data from both groups of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics (Year of birth, gender, ethnic group, marital status, highest&#xD;
      educational level attained, employment status, estimated annual personal incomes) Smoking&#xD;
      Characteristics (Readiness to quit smoking [pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation,&#xD;
      action, maintenance], modified Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine dependence; CAGE questionnaire&#xD;
      modified for smoking behaviour; 4 &quot;Cs&quot; Test to assess nicotine addiction [compulsion,&#xD;
      control, cutting down, withdrawal symptoms, and consequences]; smoker's profile [stress&#xD;
      relief, conditional responses, relief of withdrawal symptoms, elevation of depression mood];&#xD;
      number of cigarettes smoked per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm only: views and experience with the gamification and the STEADES-2 system;&#xD;
      Games Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) and System Usability Scale (SUS) Completion visit The&#xD;
      subjects of both arms will make a final study visit at the 12th week post-enrolment. Their&#xD;
      smoking status of the subjects will be determined by on-site measurement of the eCO using&#xD;
      their STEADES-2 device as well as to detect the presence of nicotine related product using&#xD;
      the cotinine test kit. Photo of the STEADES-2 measurement and the cotinine test kit result,&#xD;
      together with the study identification number of the subject (excluding identifiable personal&#xD;
      data such as facial photo) will be recorded by the CRC to define the outcomes and stored in a&#xD;
      secured hard disk for references.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan Descriptive statistics will be presented in frequency and&#xD;
      percentages. Smoking cessation is defined as both measurements using the STEADES-2 device&#xD;
      with results of 0 or 1 ppm and negative cotinine test. Smoking cessation will be assessed&#xD;
      with demographics using Chi-square test to identify the profiles of those who quit smoking.&#xD;
      Smoking cessation between the intervention and control groups will also be compared using&#xD;
      Chi-square test. Cells with less than 5 count will be compared using Fisher's Exact test.&#xD;
      Independent t test and Mann Whitney U test will also be used for normally distributed data&#xD;
      and non-normally distributed data respectively to compare the difference in scores between&#xD;
      the two groups for selected variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be done using IBM SPSS version 25.0. A p-value of less than 0.05 is&#xD;
      considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An e-library will be embedded in the app for reference to the smokers, including curated&#xD;
      video, smoking cessation motivational messages. The resource material includes information on&#xD;
      the pharmacies where nicotine replacement products can be purchased, dosing which is&#xD;
      compatible with the nicotine dependency of the smokers, tips on cutting down on the number of&#xD;
      cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Repository All activities, device measurement and gameplay on the STEADES App will be&#xD;
      uploaded to a centralized server, where it will be displayed for the virtual coaches to&#xD;
      monitor. Through their dashboard in the app, the virtual coaches will also be able to&#xD;
      communicate and prescribe further activities and advice to the smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual Coaches The clinical team of investigators are multidisciplinary primary care&#xD;
      professionals including family physicians, nurses and a pharmacist. They have the training&#xD;
      and experience in smoking cessation and will serve as e-coaches to provide advice and support&#xD;
      to the smokers. They will be anonymized with the use of a generic term like &quot;coach&quot;, who will&#xD;
      support the smokers via asynchronous counselling via the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation time frame The proposed project will be implemented in phases. Phase 1 (week&#xD;
      1-28) Concurrent development of the STEADES device, app, serious games The development of the&#xD;
      STEADES-2 device, app and serious games will be carried out by the technical team members.&#xD;
      The clinical team will assemble an e-library of motivational messages and develop an&#xD;
      associated algorithm to forward these messages to subjects based on their smoking profiles&#xD;
      and trend of eCO data. Scripts will be developed for use by the virtual coaches to interact&#xD;
      with the smokers. A training manual for the virtual coaches will be concurrently drafted by&#xD;
      the STEADES clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (week 29-36) The STEADES-2 study protocol will be finalized and submitted to CIRB for&#xD;
      ethics approval. Meanwhile, the User Acceptability Testing (UAT) of the STEADES-2 and its&#xD;
      integration with the mobile app, serious games, virtual coaching system and the&#xD;
      algorithm-based motivational messages will be carried out by both the clinical and technical&#xD;
      teams, together with the clinical research coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: (week 37-60) This phase will focus on the implementation of the pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with recruitment to be completed over 12 weeks and follow them up for&#xD;
      another 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: (week 61-64) The clinical team will audit and analyse the data, interpret the&#xD;
      results, share the results via presentations, draft and submit publications to journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sites at the polyclinics will be test-beds for the STEADES-2 system and programme.&#xD;
      If the intervention is proven effective, the integrated system will transform the institution&#xD;
      smoking cessation programme and potentially leverage on the research partner in this project&#xD;
      to incorporate into local national smoking cessation programme.&#xD;
