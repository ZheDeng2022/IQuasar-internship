      The purpose of this study is to develop and test the feasibility of a behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      intervention that uses personalized recommendations for diet and physical activity behaviors&#xD;
      in a behavioral weight loss program and to explore factors associated with treatment&#xD;
      adherence and response. The 12-week intervention will utilize digital tools for&#xD;
      self-monitoring and counseling by weight management professionals. Exploratory analyses will&#xD;
      be conducted to determine if there are genetic, metabolomic, microbiome, or psychosocial&#xD;
      factors associated with treatment response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to test a personalized approach for prescribing weight&#xD;
      loss strategies in overweight adults participating in a weight loss intervention and to&#xD;
      determine if a personalized approach can optimize weight loss compared to a standard&#xD;
      behavioral weight loss intervention. Thus, all participants will receive a behavioral weight&#xD;
      loss intervention delivered via remote counseling and digital tools including a smart phone&#xD;
      app, Wi-Fi- enabled smart scale, physical activity tracker. Participants in the personalized&#xD;
      group will also use a continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences between the two groups will be the approach used to recommend diet and&#xD;
      physical activity changes. The study will compare a Standard Behavioral Weight Loss (BWL)&#xD;
      approach tested in numerous previous studies and consistent with current clinical practice,&#xD;
      to a Personalized Behavioral Weight Loss (PBWL) approach that tests a combination of diet and&#xD;
      physical activity prescriptions to determine the best &quot;fit&quot; for the participant. The PWBL&#xD;
      group will actively use CGM information during the intervention period to inform diet and&#xD;
      activity behaviors. Participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to PBWL or BWL (i.e., 30&#xD;
      to PBWL and 10 to BWL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Behavioral Weight Loss: The BWL group will receive a standard weight loss intervention&#xD;
           based on the evidence-based interventions currently being recommended for clinical&#xD;
           practice, with general recommendations for caloric reductions based on starting weight&#xD;
           and aimed at achieving a 1-2 lb. average weekly weight loss, and progressive weekly&#xD;
           increases of physical activity. Supporting behavioral lessons adapted from materials&#xD;
           used in the Diabetes Prevention Program, a landmark behavioral weight loss intervention,&#xD;
           will also be delivered. The weight loss 'prescription' will remain consistent throughout&#xD;
           the 3 month trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Personalized Behavioral Weight Loss: The PBWL group will receive a weight loss&#xD;
           intervention that is personalized for diet and physical activity recommendations based&#xD;
           on a testing period where various approaches to eating and physical activity that may&#xD;
           result in differential adherence and response are tested. Calorie recommendations will&#xD;
           be based on measured resting energy expenditure and expected activity levels and aimed&#xD;
           at achieving a 1-2 lb. average weekly weight loss. In the initial weeks, participants&#xD;
           will test various diet and physical activity prescriptions. Following this period, the&#xD;
           optimal combination will be identified by the participant, in consultation with their&#xD;
           interventionist, based on measured blood glucose, weight loss, hunger and ability to&#xD;
           adhere to the prescription. Diet composition (percentage of calories from fat,&#xD;
           carbohydrates, and protein) will be personalized along with meal frequency and physical&#xD;
           activity goals. This group will receive the same supporting behavioral lessons as the&#xD;
           BWL group along with additional resources specific to their personalized prescription.&#xD;
           The weight loss 'prescription' will vary across the 3-month trial based on response to&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in weight (kg)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Weight will be measured in kg on a calibrated digital scale. Greater negative changes in weight from baseline to 3 months indicate greater weight loss and better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>BMI will be calculated using measured weight (kg) and height (m) using the formula BMI=weight (kg)/[height (m)]^2. Greater negative changes in BMI from baseline to 3 months indicate greater weight loss and better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Score (VAS) for hunger and fullness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective sensations of hunger will be measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which measures sensations that range across a continuum of values. The VAS is a horizontal line measuring exactly 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors (i.e., 0=Not at all hungry, 100=Extremely hungry) at each end. At baseline and Month 3, participants will be asked to complete a three item VAS by placing a mark on the line at the point they feel represents their response to the question. The 3 items and anchors are 1) How hungry did you feel over the past week (0 mm anchor = not hungry at all; 100 mm anchor = extremely hungry); 2) How full did you feel after consuming meals over the past week (0 mm anchor = not full at all; 100 mm anchor = extremely full); 3) How full in general did you feel over the past week (0 mm anchor = not full at all; 100 mm anchor = extremely full). Larger positive change numbers would indicate a greater change in perceived hunger or fullness.</description>

    <description>The Automated Self-Administered 24 hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA-24) is a self-administered computer-automated 24-hour recall that will be administered on one weekend day and one week day per assessment period to estimate total calorie intake. Greater negative changes indicate reduced intake.</description>

    <description>The Automated Self-Administered 24 hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA-24) is a self-administered computer-automated 24-hour recall that will be administered on one weekend day and one week day per assessment period to estimate macronutrient (% calories from carbohydrate, fat and protein) composition.</description>

    <measure>Change in weekly energy expenditure in kcals</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Paffenbarger questionnaire (PPAQ) assesses amount of planned and lifestyle associated physical activity performed during a typical week. The PPAQ consists of three components: (1) stair climbing, (2) walking, and (3) sports and recreation. Participants report the frequency and duration of physical activity in the past week. Scoring yields energy expenditure from physical activity per week (kcal/kg/week). Higher scores translate into greater energy expenditure per week (i.e.,better outcome). Range is 0 - no theoretical maximum.</description>

    <description>The PBWL group will receive a calorie goal based on measured resting energy expenditure and baseline PA. In Weeks 1-4, participants will be randomly assigned to test patterns that manipulate diet composition (low-fat or low-carbohydrate), meal frequency (3 or 5-6 meals/day), and PA goals (weekly minutes or daily minutes goals). Following this period, the optimal combination will be identified by the participant and interventionist, based on weight loss, blood glucose, hunger and ability to adhere to the prescription. This group will receive the same supporting behavioral lessons as the BWL group along with additional resources specific to their personalized prescription. The weight loss 'prescription' will vary across the 3-month trial based on response to treatment. Participants will receive the same digital tools as the BWL group with resources specific to following the prescription they are following during any given program week.</description>
