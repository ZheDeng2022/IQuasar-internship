  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical or subclinical eating disorders (EDs) impact 10% of individuals in their lifetime&#xD;
      and are marked by significant functional impairment, early mortality, chronicity, and&#xD;
      emotional distress. ED symptoms often emerge in adolescence, with peak onset age in the&#xD;
      teenage years. Early recognition and treatment of these devastating illnesses are needed to&#xD;
      prevent long-term consequences and a chronic course. Most (80%) individuals with EDs,&#xD;
      including teens with EDs (TwEDs), do not receive treatment. Due to major barriers to access&#xD;
      and to the delivery of treatment for TwEDs, there is a need for a new model of service&#xD;
      delivery that can identify and help TwEDs. We demonstrated our ability to harness social&#xD;
      media to identify and efficiently recruit large numbers of TwEDs. Our team has successfully&#xD;
      developed a guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app for previous&#xD;
      studies and have adapted this app to address the specific needs of TwEDs. In proposed study,&#xD;
      we will test this updated mHealth intervention, which includes simplified language and&#xD;
      tailored content relevant to adolescent issues and a social networking feature designed to&#xD;
      facilitate group exchanges and coach-led weekly group sessions. This mHealth intervention&#xD;
      will be investigated among 150 TwEDs recruited from Instagram/Facebook to test preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy and feasibility of this mHealth intervention to improved eating disorder symptoms&#xD;
      among TwEDs not currently engaged in treatment. We will also garnering feedback via a mixed&#xD;
      methods approach on the efficiency, technical effectiveness, and satisfaction with mHealth&#xD;
      intervention content and features. Participants will be randomized to one of 3 study arms,&#xD;
      including a control group (standard referral to care), a group with access to the mobile app&#xD;
      only, and a group with access to the mobile app plus social networking feature. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that those with access to the mobile app intervention will have improved ED&#xD;
      outcomes in comparison to the control group, and that those with access to the additional&#xD;
      social networking feature will have the most improvement in ED symptoms out of all three&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
