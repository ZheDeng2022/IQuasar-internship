  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to compare the difference in muscle strength, muscle elasticity and muscle&#xD;
      coordination of quadriceps and hamstring muscle and their association with knee biomechanics&#xD;
      during single leg hop landing in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Hong Kong, over 3000 cases of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR) are&#xD;
      operated annually to restore knee stability. Despite recovery of knee passive laxity and&#xD;
      muscle strength, dynamic knee stability is often not restored. In additional to muscle&#xD;
      strength, muscle elasticity and muscle coordination may also play an important role in knee&#xD;
      stability. However, there is no evidence regarding the changes in muscle elasticity after&#xD;
      ACLR and its contribution to dynamic knee stability. This study is a cross-sectional study&#xD;
      designed to compare the the difference in muscle strength, muscle elasticity and muscle&#xD;
      coordination of quadriceps and hamstring muscle in 30 ACLR patients and investigate its&#xD;
      relationship with knee biomechanics during single leg hop landing. Patient selection was base&#xD;
      on medical records and subjective knee functional scores. Patient enrollment and informed&#xD;
      consent was conducted first. Muscle strength was measured by isokinetic muscle&#xD;
      testing(Biodex) at two speeds. Muscle elasticity was assessed by ultrasound shear wave&#xD;
      elastography. Muscle coordination evaluated by electromyography(EMG) and knee biomechanics&#xD;
      including kinematics and kinetics was measured by 3D motion analysis system(VICON) and all&#xD;
      the assessments were done in CUHK-ORT Sports Injury Research Laboratory in the Prince of&#xD;
      Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. All data was collected and analyzed by qualified personnel.&#xD;
