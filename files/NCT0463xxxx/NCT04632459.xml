      1. Objective 1) Primary Objective: To estimate preliminary overall response rate (ORR) of&#xD;
           combination therapy of Ramucirumab and Pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic gastric&#xD;
           or GEJ adenocarcinoma 2)Secondary Objectives: To assess secondary measures of clinical&#xD;
           efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Best Overall Response Rate: BORR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Disease Control Rate: DCR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Progression-Free Survival:PFS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall Survival: OS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of Overall Response: DOR &amp; maximal tumor shrinkage&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects : Patients with metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design(Dosage &amp; Treatment) Patients will continue to receive study treatment,&#xD;
           until they demonstrate objective disease progression (determined by modified RECIST 1.1)&#xD;
           or until they meet any other discontinuation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ramucirumab 8mg/kg on q2W&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pembrolizumab 200mg on q3W (pembrolizumab first followed by ramucirumab when&#xD;
                concurrently administered on the same day)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If ramucirumab had to be stopped due to intolerable toxicity, pembrolizumab will be&#xD;
                continued until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or upto 35 cycles.&#xD;

      Goal : To estimate efficacy and safety of combination therapy of Ramucirumab and&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Sample Size : A maximum of 35 patients will be recruited to this single-arm phase II&#xD;
      trial. In this single-arm phase II trial, 33 people were calculated using Simon's two-stage&#xD;
      design and a total of 35 patients will be recruited to account for a 5% dropout rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is calculated by use of a two-stage minimax Simon's design to control the&#xD;
      type I error at 2.5 % for null hypothesis that, for arm, the true response was 15 % or below&#xD;
      and to have 90 % of power if the true response was 40 % or higher. 19 evaluable patients are&#xD;
      to be treated in the first stage. If 3 or fewer response are observed in the first stage, the&#xD;
      arm will be stopped. If at least 4 responses are observed in the first stage, 14 additional&#xD;
      evaluable patients are to be entered onto the second stage. At the final analysis, the null&#xD;
      hypothesis will be rejected if at least 9 responses are observed in 33 evaluable patients. RR&#xD;
      is reported with its exact 95% CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durationof Study: About 2 years from approval from the regulatory authority&#xD;
