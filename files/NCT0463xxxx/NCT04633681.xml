    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the acute (1-day) and repeated (2-week) effects of combinations&#xD;
      of Sweeteners &amp; Sweetness Enhancer blends on metabolic, sensory, neuro-behavioural and&#xD;
      microbiota-mediated processes involved in satiety, consumer preferences and health.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol has the overall objective to evaluate the acute (short-term, 1 day) and&#xD;
      repeated (medium-term, 2 week) effects of combinations of sweeteners and sweetness enhancers&#xD;
      (S&amp;SEs) on metabolic, sensory, neuro-behavioural and microbiota-mediated processes involved&#xD;
      in satiety, consumer preference and health, and to explore mechanistic processes, genetic&#xD;
      background, safety issues and consumer perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 5 products being tested in 3 different formulations (sucrose-sweetened control vs 2&#xD;
      reformulated with S&amp;SE). Each product will be tested at 2 intervention sites in double-blind&#xD;
      cross-over trials with 48 subjects (24 per site) tested per product. Therefore a total of 240&#xD;
      subjects will take part across the 5 intervention sites (Navarra, Leeds, Liverpool,&#xD;
      Copenhagen, Lyon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using identical procedures each trial will consist of 2 Clinical Investigation Days (CIDs)&#xD;
      scheduled 12 days apart for each of the 3 product formulations. A 2-week wash-out period will&#xD;
      be given between formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of WP2 Phase 2 is 12 months, including a 5-month duration for each&#xD;
      cross-over trial.&#xD;

The following sensations of appetite will be used in the composite measure:&#xD;
hunger&#xD;
fullness&#xD;
desire to eat&#xD;
