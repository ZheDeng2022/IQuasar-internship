      Type of study: prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different modalities of urethroplasty for correction of CPCC without hypospadias&#xD;
           (Nesbit, modified Nesbit, dorsal dartos flap, combined plication-incision CPI, suture&#xD;
           fixation to pubic bone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Merits of modified Nesbit technique accompanied by dorsal dartos flap for one-stage&#xD;
           correction of CPCC without hypospadias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study conducted at pediatric surgery department, New Damietta &amp;&#xD;
      Alhoussain Al-Azhar University Hospitals, from January 2015 to May 2020, on 56 male patients&#xD;
      with isolated CPCC. All of them will undergo one-stage correction corporoplasty using&#xD;
      modified Nesbit technique accompanied by dorsal dartos flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutes of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter study at Pediatric Surgery Departments, Al-Azhar University hospitals at New&#xD;
      Damietta &amp; Cairo. Number of cases: Fifty-six male patients. Time frame: period of 5.6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be discussed and approved for clinical study by the Ethical Research&#xD;
      Committee at the principal investigator's hospital. The study protocol was approved by local&#xD;
      research and ethics committee of Al-Azhar Faculty of Medicine; the study protocol was&#xD;
      explained to all guardians and their informed consents were obtained for involvement in the&#xD;
      study. Confidentiality and the right to withdraw from the study at any time were guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with CPCC those fulfill inclusion criteria will undergo a nursing evaluation of&#xD;
      functional health status and a preoperative evaluation by an anesthesiologist &amp; pediatrician.&#xD;
      The angle of penile rotation will be measured on the photograph, using Millen Med DICOM&#xD;
      viewer program for image analysis, based on the orientation of the urethral meatus relative&#xD;
      to the vertical position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed-up at OPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be summarized into continuous variables expressed as mean ± standard deviation and&#xD;
      categorical variables expressed as frequency count and percentage (%), using appropriate&#xD;
      software computer package. Fisher's exact test is used for comparison of frequency&#xD;
      counts/percentage. A two-sided p-value &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will focus on one-stage correction of congenital penile curvature complex (CPCC) using&#xD;
      modified Nesbit's procedure (to correct curvature) and dorsal dartos flap (to correct&#xD;
      torsion). The results obtained from this study will be compared between both group and with&#xD;
      those reported in the literature. Also, it will focus on results, complications, their&#xD;
      management, and clinical evaluation by noticing urine stream direction. At the end, the&#xD;
      investigators will conclude that this technique ensures correction of the complex penile&#xD;
      anomaly with satisfactory results and nice cosmetic outcome.&#xD;
