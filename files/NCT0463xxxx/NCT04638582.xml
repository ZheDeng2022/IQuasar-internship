    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-site, open-label Phase II trial of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (3 cycles) followed by surgery, versus concomitant neoadjuvant pembrolizumab&#xD;
      with platinum doublet chemotherapy (3 cycles) followed by surgery for participants with Stage&#xD;
      IA3, IB and IIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Participants will be offered&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (6 cycles), and standard of care adjuvant chemotherapy (4 cycles) if&#xD;
      applicable.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The use of ctDNA levels and resolution in relation to treatment response has been studied in&#xD;
      various types of cancer, notably melanoma, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. In pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer, it was particularly noted to be useful for the prediction of recurrence and survival&#xD;
      patterns. In NSCLC, there is a growing need to identify patients who are more likely to&#xD;
      respond to immunotherapies given the rates of recurrence, and ctDNA was described to be a&#xD;
      useful tool in the prediction of pathological response in this population. In fact, ctDNA was&#xD;
      shown to correlate with disease resolution in NSCLC and higher levels of ctDNA in&#xD;
      non-responding patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central research question of this trial is focused on the ability to predict the&#xD;
      occurrence of a pCR based on resolution of ctDNA detectability in early stage NSCLC. The&#xD;
      biomarker collection plan will provide tumor and plasma samples from which whole exome&#xD;
      sequencing will be performed to monitor disease response. The endpoint is focused on the&#xD;
      elimination of ctDNA (both replicates = 0%) at the completion of systemic therapy, prior to&#xD;
      surgical resection. All patients will be re-tested for ctDNA levels 30 days post-surgery to&#xD;
      determine if those patients who did not experience ctDNA resolution after systemic therapy&#xD;
      will experience resolution with the addition of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the ctDNA treatment response arc, the investigators will be able to address the primary&#xD;
      objective of the study: to establish ctDNA levels in early stage NSCLC as a reliable measure&#xD;
      of local disease burden in the context of systemic therapy, with the lower end of the&#xD;
      detection limit correlating to the extent of pathological response. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that in a cohort of patients with stage IA3, IB and IIA NSCLC, pre-operative&#xD;
      pembrolizumab with or without histology-specific chemotherapy will cause resolution of ctDNA&#xD;
      detectability that correlates with a pathological complete response (pCR) to therapy.&#xD;
