  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness and exercise are both widely used to improve mental health and well-being. Some&#xD;
      people find that these activities also improve their ability to focus. This study aims to&#xD;
      find out whether mindfulness and light exercise could be similarly effective in improving&#xD;
      mental wellbeing and engagement at work. The study further investigates the cognitive&#xD;
      processes (e.g., memory and attention skills) that might improve as a result of mindfulness&#xD;
      and exercise.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mental illness is a major cause of disability worldwide[1]. Much of the adult population is&#xD;
      employed and spends 28% of their waking hours doing paid work[2,3]. The occupational&#xD;
      environment is therefore an opportune location for preventative mental health interventions.&#xD;
      A growing number of employers provide programmes to improve well-being and work performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness is typically defined as &quot;the awareness that emerges through paying attention on&#xD;
      purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment by&#xD;
      moment&quot;. Practising such awareness has been linked to reduction in symptoms of anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and stress in community populations. There is also evidence that mindfulness&#xD;
      could improve life satisfaction, overall well-being, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been argued that mindfulness may yield workplace benefits beyond well-being.&#xD;
      Mindfulness has been suggested to improve work performance, reduce the negative effects of&#xD;
      multitasking, and enhance self-regulation of thoughts, emotions and behaviours. Empirical&#xD;
      evidence to support these suggestions, however, is scarce. Furthermore, the mechanisms&#xD;
      through which mindfulness impacts work performance are not clear. Understanding mechanisms of&#xD;
      change (a) would help to design better, more targeted interventions, (b) would improve our&#xD;
      attempts to assess MBPs via selection of more stringent control interventions and (c) may&#xD;
      promote a personalised medicine approach by informing understanding of what works for whom&#xD;
      and in which context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current literature suggests that MBPs could improve work performance through increased mental&#xD;
      well-being and/or cognitive control over emotional material. A definitive randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial is needed to evaluate these potential mechanisms. However, methodological&#xD;
      uncertainties need clarification to inform the design of such a trial. We aim to conduct a&#xD;
      feasibility trial to clarify these uncertainties and complete a preliminary investigation of&#xD;
      the relationships between mindfulness training, workplace performance and the proposed&#xD;
      mechanisms of action: mental well-being and cognitive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility trial will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimate the between-groups effect size for the effect of mindfulness, relative to a&#xD;
           light exercise control condition, on our primary outcome of work performance, in order&#xD;
           to inform power calculation for a larger trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore whether improved cognitive control and/or enhanced mental health could be&#xD;
           potential mechanisms underlying the effect of mindfulness on work performance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine procedural feasibility of a later stage trial by evaluating the willingness of&#xD;
           the participants to be randomised and other practical implications of running a&#xD;
           randomised controlled trial;&#xD;

    <measure>Work Role Functioning Questionnaire (WRFQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention); 1 week post-intervention (primary outcome measure); 12-week post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>All participants will complete the Work Role Functioning Questionnaire's updated version. It is a 25-item measure to capture the perceived difficulties in meeting work demands. Items are rated on a 5-point scale where 0 is difficult all the time and 5 is difficult none of the time. A 6th option allows participants to denote &quot;does not apply for my job&quot;. The subscale and total score are summed, with a minimum score 0 and maximum score 100, with higher scores indicating better work functioning. The questionnaire has not been validated in English but is available in English and validations done in Spain, The Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil have shown good Cronbach alphas (0.7-0.9).&#xD;
The primary hypothesis will be evaluated with a time (pre, post) x intervention (mindfulness, light exercise) interaction predicting score on the WRFQ.</description>

    <time_frame>Days which participant works during the 4 weeks of intervention. For example, if working full-time and if Monday is Day 1 of intervention then measurements will take place on Day 1...5, Day 8...12, Day 16...20, Day 23...27.</time_frame>
    <description>To get a better understanding of daily fluctuations of work engagement that may occur and whether there are any between-group differences, participants will be asked to complete a short questionnaire about their daily work engagement. The link will be sent to participants' e-mail addresses. We will use a short 5-item version of the Work Role Functioning Questionnaire, which features the following items:&#xD;
Start [work] as soon as you arrived (work scheduling demands)&#xD;
Work without mistakes (Output demands)&#xD;
Repeat the same motions (Physical demands)&#xD;
Concentrate on your work (Mental and social demands)&#xD;
Perform multiple tasks (Flexibility demands) Items are rated on a 5-point scale where 0 is difficult all the time and 5 is difficult none of the time. A 6th option allows participants to denote &quot;does not apply for my job&quot;.</description>

    <description>Delivery: Computer-based. Stimuli: Abstract shapes with which participants will have no prior experiences.&#xD;
Typical trial: At the beginning of each trial, a negative/neural image from the International Affective Picture System appears. Then, the participants are presented with pairs of stimuli (A-B or C-D). One of the stimuli in the pair is more likely to be rewarded than the other (e.g. selecting A or C is reinforced on 80% of trials). Participants must select one of the stimuli (using key-board presses). Through trial-and-error, participants learn which of the two is correct. Feedback is presented after each response. After a certain number of trials, the contingency of reinforcement changes and another stimulus is reinforced (e.g. B is now reinforced on 80% of trials). This task measure participant's ability to track dynamic changes in their environment and alter their response strategies.</description>

    <description>Be mindful is an online course run by the Mental Health Foundation and Wellmind Media. It was developed together with British mindfulness instructors and offers access to its course materials and instructional videos through a website (http://www.bemindfulonline.com).&#xD;
The course consists of 11 sessions led by two mindfulness teachers, one female, one male. Using a variety of media (videos, assignments, audio tracks and e-mails), participants are taught to use formal as well as informal mindfulness techniques. The course lasts 4 weeks. For each week, participants are asked to do a daily formal mediation practice (up to 30 minutes but it varies from week to week) and one or two informal exercises.</description>

    <description>The control condition involves light physical exercises aimed at increasing mobility, reducing stiffness, improving circulation, and avoiding pain or repetitive strain injuries that may result from sedentary or repetitive tasks common in office environments. The exercises will include simple whole-body slightly aerobic exercises such as rotation of limbs and stretching. The course was developed by Dr Julieta Galante, a public health doctor, together with an expert in body posture re-education and body techniques.&#xD;
The course is designed to match with the mindfulness intervention condition in duration and media (length of videos, amount of written instructions). It also replicates the encouraged use of short breaks (of seconds or minutes) throughout the workday to focus on wellbeing, as occurs in mindfulness.</description>
