  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The widespread use of smartphones today has led to the emergence of new ways of teaching,&#xD;
      such as mobile learning. This research was conducted to determine the effectiveness of mobile&#xD;
      learning on students' success and anxiety in teaching the anatomy of the genital system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is a randomized controlled experimental study conducted with students who took&#xD;
      anatomy classes at a private university between November-December 2018.The sampling consisted&#xD;
      of 63 students who met the sampling criteria of the study and who were given permission to&#xD;
      participate in the research after the information was explained. Control (n=31) and&#xD;
      experimental group (n = 32) were determined by randomization using simple numbers table. The&#xD;
      mobile application developed for the experimental group was installed on the students'&#xD;
      android devices with the extension &quot;genitalsystem.apk&quot;.The anatomy of the genital system was&#xD;
      taught to the control group with a standard curriculum and to the experimental group via the&#xD;
      mobile learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the study hypothesizes that mobile learning is effective in teaching the&#xD;
      anatomy of the genital system, and that the success levels of students who receive an&#xD;
      education through mobile learning are higher and their anxiety levels are lower than those&#xD;
      who receive education through traditional methods.&#xD;

      This research was conducted to determine the effectiveness of mobile learning on students'&#xD;
      success and anxiety in teaching the anatomy of the genital system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The research is a randomized controlled experimental study. This study was&#xD;
      conducted with students who took anatomy lessons at a private university between November and&#xD;
      December 2018. Power analysis to determine the number of students to form the research sample&#xD;
      was performed using NCSS-PASS statistical package (NCSS, LLC., Kaysville, UT). In order to&#xD;
      make a study with this analysis P ≤ 0.1 levels, the number of samples was decided to be 60.&#xD;
      As a result, the sample of the research; By explaining the purpose of the study, a total of&#xD;
      63 students who was allowed to participate in the post-informative research and meet the&#xD;
      sample criteria of the research was formed. Sampling criteria; the student is not (1) not a&#xD;
      graduate of a health vocational high school, (2) has not previously been trained in mobile&#xD;
      learning, (3) has taken the anatomy course for the first time, (4) received written and&#xD;
      verbal permission for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Designed of Study and Randomization The research was designed in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      experimental type. In the randomization of the study, using the Random.org website, students&#xD;
      were assigned to the experiment (mobile application group, n = 31) and control (traditional&#xD;
      method group, n=32) groups according to their numbers in the class list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools The research data were collected with &quot;Structured Student Information&#xD;
      Form&quot;, &quot;State and Trait Anxiety Inventory&quot;, &quot;Knowledge Examination on the anatomical&#xD;
      structure of the genital system&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured Student Introduction Form The socio-demographic characteristics of the student&#xD;
      identification form, such as the students' age, gender as well as data on educational status&#xD;
      are included. It consists of five questions in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      State and Trait Anxiety Inventory In the research, two different scales were applied to the&#xD;
      students. These are the State Anxiety Scale (STAI FORM TX - I) and the Trait Anxiety Scale&#xD;
      (STAI FORM TX - 2). The scale was developed in 1970 by Speilberger et al. The adaptation and&#xD;
      adjustment of the scales into Turkish was done by Necla Öner and Ayhan LeCompte in 1983. It&#xD;
      consists of 20 items in both scales and is graded in a four-point Likert style. Scoring is&#xD;
      done between 1-4. The answer options collected in four classes in the state anxiety scale&#xD;
      (WHO), (1) None, (2) A little, (3) A lot, and (4) Completely. In the Trait Anxiety Scale&#xD;
      (SAD) options (1) Almost never, (2) Sometimes, it is (3) Much time and (4) Almost always. The&#xD;
      scores obtained from both scales theoretically range from 20 to 80. Larger scores mean high&#xD;
      anxiety levels while, smaller score means low anxiety level. In this study, Cronbach's alpha&#xD;
      value of the scale was found to be 0.95.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge examination on the anatomical structure of the genital system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genital system examination prepared according to the literature consists of 22 questions&#xD;
      including the anatomical structure. The knowledge examination contains the names of the&#xD;
      anatomical structures of the genital system on the figure. It was created by taking color&#xD;
      copies of the images on paper. The lowest score that can be obtained from the knowledge&#xD;
      examination is determined as &quot;0&quot; and the highest score as &quot;100&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different learning methods were used in both groups, but the examination was conducted in the&#xD;
      same format. The pre-test and post-test examinations contain the same questions. An equal&#xD;
      number of questions were asked about male and female genital system issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Data The necessary interviews and correspondences were carried out in order to&#xD;
      conduct the research. Permission was obtained from Health Sciences University Istanbul&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital Clinical Research Ethics Committee. The purpose of the study&#xD;
      was explained to the students as per the sample criteria and their consents were obtained.&#xD;
      All of the students participating in the study attended four hours of theoretical lessons in&#xD;
      the classroom related to anatomy of the genital system. Following the theoretical training,&#xD;
      students were divided into experiment (mobile application) and control (genital organ model)&#xD;
      groups. Both groups where then given the &quot;Structured Student Presentation Form&quot;, &quot;Status and&#xD;
      trait anxiety inventory&quot; and &quot;Knowledge Examination (pre-test)&quot; on paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The didactic content prepared for the institution's standard curriculum (control group) or&#xD;
      mobile learning is similar for both training methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application in the Control Group: After the theoretical lesson, the control group was taken&#xD;
      to the Anatomy Laboratory. The laboratory consists of three application rooms, one control&#xD;
      room and one analysis room. The &quot;Anatomy of the Organs Forming the Genital System&quot; was&#xD;
      explained using an anatomical model of the genital system organs by a researcher responsible&#xD;
      for the human anatomy course. Students were given time until the end of the lesson to work on&#xD;
      the models. During this time, their questions were answered. At the end, all of the students&#xD;
      were given a &quot;State Inventory&quot; by the researcher and asked to fill it in. Students were then&#xD;
      asked to use textbooks and atlases to study for the &quot;Knowledge Test (post-test)&quot; which took&#xD;
      place three days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application in Experimental Group: After the theoretical lesson, students in the experimental&#xD;
      group were taken to an empty classroom. The mobile application was installed on the&#xD;
      smartphones of the students in the experimental group by the researchers and they were told&#xD;
      not to share it with anyone until the end of the study. At the end of the study, the mobile&#xD;
      application was also installed on the phones of the students in the control group due to&#xD;
      ethical sensitivity. &quot;Anatomy of Organs Forming the Genital System&quot; was explained on the&#xD;
      mobile application containing the genital system organs. The students were allowed to ask&#xD;
      questions and the questions were answered. Afterwards, all students in the experimental group&#xD;
      were given a &quot;State Inventory&quot; by the researcher and asked to fill it in. Students were then&#xD;
      asked to study using the &quot;genitalsystem.apk&quot; mobile application until the &quot;Knowledge Test&#xD;
      (post-test)&quot; which took place three days later&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile Application Development Stage The use of technology in education helps students with&#xD;
      their individual learning development. However, for a successful integration of technology&#xD;
      into education, multiple design principles should be considered. In this context, the &quot;Mayer&#xD;
      Multimedia Design Principles&quot; were considered in designing the mobile application developed&#xD;
      within the scope of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mobile application was developed with Adobe Flash CS6 for Android devices with the&#xD;
      extension &quot;genitalsystem.apk&quot;. The application was uploaded to the smartphones of the&#xD;
      experimental group by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The homepage of the mobile application consists of five sections: the male genital system,&#xD;
      the female genital system, the path followed by the sperm, the path followed by the ovum and&#xD;
      the purpose of the mobile application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The male genital system is divided into two sections, presented on the application as two&#xD;
      separate pages: internal genital organs and external genital organs. Both pages on the mobile&#xD;
      application are operated in the same way: the user presses on the red dots that are&#xD;
      programmed on the page, which makes the anatomical names of the organs appear on a&#xD;
      rectangular area at the top of the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The female genital system is divided into two sections, presented on the application as two&#xD;
      separate pages: internal genital organs and external genital organs. Both pages on the mobile&#xD;
      application are operated in the same way: the user presses on the red dots that are&#xD;
      programmed on the page, which makes the anatomical names of the organs appear on a&#xD;
      rectangular area at the top of the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The page on the mobile application detailing the path followed by the sperm features an&#xD;
      animation that shows the section from the production of sperm to the woman's external genital&#xD;
      area. The users can start, stop or watch the animation whenever they want. During the&#xD;
      animation of the path followed by the sperm, the name of the anatomical region the sperm has&#xD;
      reached appears at the top of the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The page on the mobile application detailing the path followed by the ovum features an&#xD;
      animation that shows the section from the production of ovum to zygote formation. The users&#xD;
      can start, stop or watch the animation whenever they want. During the animation of the path&#xD;
      followed by the ovum, the name of the anatomical region the ovum has reached appears at the&#xD;
      top of the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the purpose of the mobile application page, users can access the sources of the&#xD;
      information provided by researches for the purposes of mobile use and the information used&#xD;
      for the mobile application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods A licensed SPSS statistical package, version 25.0 for Windows (IBM Corp)&#xD;
      was used for data analysis. The distribution of the demographic information of the&#xD;
      participants by groups was analyzed by chi-square analysis. Whether the average age varies&#xD;
      significantly between the groups was investigated with the t-test in independent groups.&#xD;
      Normal distribution among the groups in the state anxiety and trait anxiety inventory was&#xD;
      analyzed with the Kolmogrov Smirnov and Shapiro Wilks test and it was observed that they were&#xD;
      compatible with the normal distribution. Pretest-posttest comparisons were examined with&#xD;
      t-test in dependent groups and comparison of measurements by study groups with t-test in&#xD;
      independent groups. Regardless of whether the state and trait anxiety levels had a&#xD;
      significant effect on the knowledge score, regression analysis was examined. Results were&#xD;
      evaluated at 95% confidence interval and significance level at P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical and Legal Aspects of the Research The necessary interviews and correspondences were&#xD;
      carried out in order to conduct the research. Approvals were obtained from the institution&#xD;
      and ethics committee (S.U.U Istanbul Training and Research Hospital Clinical Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee- No: 1558 /07.12.2018). The students who formed the research sample have been&#xD;
      informed about the purpose, plan, duration and procedures to be done. Therefore, informed&#xD;
      consent has been obtained for their participation in the research through their own&#xD;
      willingness and on the principle of volunteering.&#xD;
