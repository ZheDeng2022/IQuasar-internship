      The investigators would like to assess if the intake of high bicarbonate mineral water would&#xD;
      not only increase total fluid intake but will also be able to give patients the additional&#xD;
      benefit of correcting the urinary abnormalities which may predispose them to stone formation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The life time risk of developing nephrolithiasis is about 10-15% in the western world, but&#xD;
      can be as high as 20-25% in the middle east. Evidence suggests that the incidence and&#xD;
      prevalence of kidney stones is increasing globally which represent a significant economic&#xD;
      burden. Besides the lack of hydration, the most common metabolic abnormalities associated&#xD;
      with calcium stones are hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia and hyperoxaluria. In addition, low&#xD;
      urinary pH from consumption of non-dairy animal protein has been associated with reduced&#xD;
      urinary citrate and increased uric acid stones which form a nidus for subsequent calcium&#xD;
      oxalate precipitates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary modification is the first line approach in the treatment of idiopathic calcium&#xD;
      oxalate (CaOx) nephrolithiasis. General advice includes adequate hydration, avoiding&#xD;
      oxalate-rich foods, and consumption of an adequate amount of calcium. Adequate hydration is&#xD;
      an easy and effective way of preventing stones. Siener et al found in healthy men,&#xD;
      consumption of mineral water rich in magnesium and bicarbonate resulted in favourable changes&#xD;
      in urinary pH, magnesium and citrate excretion (inhibitors of CaOx stone formation). Our&#xD;
      pilot study in 10 young and healthy surgical residents also revealed similar results after&#xD;
      drinking bicarbonate rich mineral water for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators compared the effect of drinking bicarbonate rich mineral&#xD;
      water with plain water on urine biochemistry in a prospective randomized study in patients&#xD;
      with known CaOx stones. The investigators hypothesize that the intake of bicarbonate rich&#xD;
      mineral water, particularly at meal times, reduces stone risk via reduction in urinary&#xD;
      oxalate through increased intestinal oxalate binding with dietary calcium. Other potential&#xD;
      benefits of mineral water include increased urinary stone inhibitors like magnesium, citrate&#xD;
      and alkalinisation of urine.&#xD;
