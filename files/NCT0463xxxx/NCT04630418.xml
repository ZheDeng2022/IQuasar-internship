    <textblock>
      Silk is a naturally occurring protein polymer that is approved for medical use by the U.S&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Silk fibroin fiber biomaterial has shown promising&#xD;
      results for tissue regeneration demonstrated through in vivo and in vitro animal models. The&#xD;
      investigators of this study have previously shown that patients' report improvement in common&#xD;
      skin aging findings including wrinkles, sagginess, and dry skin. The investigators will&#xD;
      continue this assessment of patients' skin perception as well as add on objective measures of&#xD;
      skin resilience, elasticity, and hydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will provide participants with a demographic survey, and the FACE-Q survey,&#xD;
      a validated survey, prior to administration of NanoSilk Cosmo, to assess perception of aging,&#xD;
      satisfaction with facial appearance, satisfaction with skin. The participant will undergo&#xD;
      baseline evaluation of several objective measures of skin hydration, elasticity and overall&#xD;
      healthy using non-invasive devices (Courage+Khazaka Corneometer Probe, Courage+Khazaka&#xD;
      Electronic GmbH Cutometer Dual MPA 580, and VISIA-CA GEN 7). The participants will be&#xD;
      provided with 30ml of the NanoSilk Cosmo and with extensive instruction on administration of&#xD;
      the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to clinic after 4 weeks of using the product to perform the FACE-Q&#xD;
      and re-evaluation of several objective measures of the skin using non-invasive devices&#xD;
      (Courage+Khazaka Corneometer Probe, Courage+Khazaka Electronic GmbH Cutometer Dual MPA 580,&#xD;
      and VISIA-CA GEN 7).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin aging is characterized by atrophy, decreased elasticity, wrinkling, impaired strength,&#xD;
      and altered metabolic and reparative responses. The etiology of these changes is&#xD;
      multifactorial and includes intrinsic factors such as age, genetics, metabolism, and&#xD;
      nutrition, as well as extrinsic or environmental effects like Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and&#xD;
      air pollution. It has been noted that there is increased fragility of the skin with age due&#xD;
      to flattening of the dermo-epidermal junction and decreased biosynthetic capacity of&#xD;
      fibroblasts, all leading to decreased skin resilience and an undesirable cosmetic appearance&#xD;
      of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the use of silk to reverse or repair some of these aging processes has gained&#xD;
      significant interest. Silk is a natural protein polymer that is approved for medical use by&#xD;
      the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Bombyx mori (B. mori) silk is considered a&#xD;
      non-animal product (EU Council Directive 93/42/EEC, rule 17). Importantly it is&#xD;
      biocompatible, non-inflammatory, and non-cytotoxic. There are two important components of&#xD;
      silk that are derived from the B. mori worm, both of which are proteins - fibroin and&#xD;
      sericin. In simple terms, sericin, which represents about 30% of the entire cocoon, functions&#xD;
      as a glue to hold the fibroin fibers together while blocking UV rays and providing moisture.&#xD;
      The fibroin, approximately 70% of the cocoon, is composed of two proteins which interestingly&#xD;
      have similar amino acid compositions to Natural Moisturizing Factor which is found in the&#xD;
      stratum corneum of human skin and helps retain moisture in the skin. The stratum corneum is&#xD;
      of key importance to the skin's ability to hold water and maintain skin integrity which is&#xD;
      critical for maintaining a youthful appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the moisture retention effects noted above, one of the theories behind the&#xD;
      effectiveness of silk on the skin is that the silk fibroin nanofibers are able to promote&#xD;
      cell adhesion and allows type I collagen to spread within epidermal keratinocytes and&#xD;
      fibroblasts. New data suggest that if a patient has a higher ratio of collagen type I to&#xD;
      collagen type III that these patients will have better outcomes after aesthetic facial&#xD;
      surgery, which highlights the key role of collagen in the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will provide participants with the FACE-Q survey, a validated survey, prior&#xD;
      to administration of NanoSilk Cosmo, to assess perception of aging, satisfaction with facial&#xD;
      appearance, and satisfaction with skin. The participant will undergo baseline evaluation of&#xD;
      several objective measures of skin hydration, elasticity and overall healthy using&#xD;
      non-invasive devices (Courage+Khazaka Corneometer Probe, Courage+Khazaka Electronic GmbH&#xD;
      Cutometer Dual MPA 580, and VISIA-CA GEN 7). The participants will be provided with 30ml of&#xD;
      the NanoSilk Cosmo and with extensive instruction on administration of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to clinic after 4 weeks of using the product to perform the FACE-Q&#xD;
      and re-evaluation of several objective measures of the skin using non-invasive devices&#xD;
      (Courage+Khazaka Corneometer Probe, Courage+Khazaka Electronic GmbH Cutometer Dual MPA 580,&#xD;
      and VISIA-CA GEN 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Courage+Khazaka Corneometer Probe: By evaluating the capacitance through the skin this will&#xD;
      serve as a reflection of moisture content in the skin. The corneometer is not significantly&#xD;
      affected by stales or residues of topicals applied to the skin. Additionally, it provides&#xD;
      very quick measurements (1 sec), continuous measurements, and the measurement depth is very&#xD;
      small to capture the stratum corneum and avoid deeper skin structures (blood vessels). The&#xD;
      Visioscan measures an integral characteristic of skin, and included metric in the clinical&#xD;
      experiment. It is medical grade (degree of calibration) and will provide the most accurate&#xD;
      data for researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probe will be placed on the skin before and after use of NanoSilk Cosmo and measure the&#xD;
      data points noted above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Courage+Khazaka Electronic GmbH Cutometer dual MPA 580: This device will measure&#xD;
      viscoelasticity of the skin using negative pressure to mechanically deform the skin. The&#xD;
      penetration depth is determined by a non-contact optical measuring system within the probe.&#xD;
      The resistance of the skin to the negative pressure (firmness) and its ability to return to&#xD;
      its original position (elasticity) are displayed as curves (penetration depth in mm/time) in&#xD;
      real time. The measurement allows for information about the elastic and mechanical properties&#xD;
      of skin surface and to objectively quantify a property of skin aging. The Cutometer measures&#xD;
      an integral characteristic of skin and included metric in the clinical experiment. It is&#xD;
      medical grade (degree of calibration) and will provide the most accurate data for&#xD;
      researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probe will be placed on the skin before and after use of NanoSilk Cosmo and measure the&#xD;
      data points noted above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIA-CA GEN 7(Consultation System): VISIA multi-point positioning system and live image&#xD;
      overlay provides complete data surface and subsurface skin conditions. Skin conditions&#xD;
      included in analysis are hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, inflammation, wrinkles,&#xD;
      topography, UV damage, vascularity (spider veins), and porphyrins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will place their face in the instrument and have their photo taken both&#xD;
      before and after use of NanoSilk Cosmo.&#xD;
