  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous clinical studies showed there is a potential value of EGFR-TKI in local advanced&#xD;
      EGFR-mutant NSCLC, while the risk of radiation pneumonia in combination of EGFR-TKI with&#xD;
      thoracic radiotherapy is unknown. This study aims to explore the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      concurrent almonertinib, a new third-generation EGFR-TKI drug, with radiotherapy in local&#xD;
      advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Doublet platinum-based therapy combined with radiotherapy remains the standard treatment for&#xD;
      first-line management of unresectable stage III NSCLC patients, regardless of the EGFR&#xD;
      mutation status. But the 5-year survival rate is not satisfying. Previous clinical studies&#xD;
      showed there is a potential value but also a high risk of radiation pneumonia in treatment&#xD;
      regimens of combination TKI with radiotherapy. This study intends to explore the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of concurrent almonertinib, a new third-generation EGFR-TKI drug, with radiotherapy&#xD;
      in EGFR-sensitive mutated locally advanced NSCLC patients.&#xD;

Patients with lung V20 ≥ 28% were enrolled in group A: Almonertinib induction therapy was given for 2 months firstly, followed by Almonertinib combined with radiotherapy; patients with lung V20&lt;28% were enrolled in group B: Almonertinib was synchronized with radiotherapy initially.</description>
