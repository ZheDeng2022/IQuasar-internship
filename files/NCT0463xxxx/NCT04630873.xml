    <textblock>
      There is debate regarding the efficiency of different dilutions of Botulin toxin type A&#xD;
      (BTX-A) injections. Some authors believe that highly diluted BTX-A injections achieve greater&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade resulting in higher spasticity reduction. On the other hand, other&#xD;
      researchers suggest that there is no difference in spasticity decrease if either high or low&#xD;
      volume toxin is being injected. Studies on this subject lack either the design or the power&#xD;
      of study was low. Therefore, there is no clear guideline for an optimal botulinum toxin&#xD;
      dilution protocol. In an attempt to have a better understanding, a cross over study was&#xD;
      designed. The material will be patients with spastic hemiparesis which will be treated with&#xD;
      Botulin toxin at different dilutions. Gait analysis will be used for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      Botulin toxin injection on gait improvement. To the best of our knowledge such a trial hasn't&#xD;
      been performed yet.&#xD;

      There is an ongoing controversy regarding the effect of different dilutions in the efficacy&#xD;
      of Botulin toxin type A (BTX-A) injections. Some authors believe that highly diluted BTX-A&#xD;
      injections achieve greater neuromuscular blockade resulting in higher spasticity reduction.&#xD;
      They are arguing that BTX-A in high dilution is the optimal choice especially when bigger&#xD;
      muscles are injected, for the large volume of fluid administered into the muscle will carry&#xD;
      the BTX-A molecules to endplates remote from the injection site. Two animal studies suggest&#xD;
      that increasing the volume of diluents is a potential strategy in order to achieve a more&#xD;
      efficient and cost-effective manner of BTX-A treatment. An attempt to quantify how the&#xD;
      location of BTX-A injection affects the drug effect was made, which revealed that injecting&#xD;
      only 0.5 cm away from the motor endplates yielded a 50% decrease in paralysis2. A newer&#xD;
      double-blinded study by JM Gracies et al performed on humans comes to the same conclusion,&#xD;
      that high volume dilution provides greater neuromuscular block and spasticity reduction than&#xD;
      a low volume dilution. On the other hand, other researchers suggest that there is no&#xD;
      difference in spasticity decrease if either high or low volume toxin is being injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies lack either the design or the power of study was low. Therefore, there is no&#xD;
      clear guideline for an optimal botulinum toxin dilution protocol.&#xD;
