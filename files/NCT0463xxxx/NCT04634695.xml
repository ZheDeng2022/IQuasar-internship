  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) continues to be a significant public health issue, particularly in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa. The coverage of pregnant women with three or more doses of intermittent&#xD;
      preventive treatment using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is recommended to prevent&#xD;
      risks associated with MiP in moderate-to-high transmission settings. Evidence has recently&#xD;
      become available supporting the emergence of a novel Pfdhps-431V mutation in Nigeria. This&#xD;
      new mutation may further confound the existing SP-resistance; thus, the intended follow-on&#xD;
      project aims to assess the influence of Pfdhps-431V mutation on the protective efficacy of SP&#xD;
      during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to detect P. falciparum positivity at delivery and pregnancy outcome in&#xD;
      participants who must have received three or more doses of IPTp_SP. We will attempt to check&#xD;
      the presence of existing and new Pfdhps/Pfdhfr mutations in the samples positive for P.&#xD;
      falciparum using a quantitative PCR (qPCR). The prevalence of novel Pfdhps-431V mutant and&#xD;
      other Pfdhps/Pfdhfr resistance alleles among the study population will be estimated. The&#xD;
      significance of the resistance genes on the efficacy of SP will be described by looking at&#xD;
      its associations with the reported IPTp use, P. falciparum infection, maternal anaemia, low&#xD;
      birth weight, and preterm delivery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) is considered a major public health issue with substantial risks&#xD;
      for mothers and their babies. Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy using&#xD;
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is adopted as a part of antenatal care (ANC) to prevent&#xD;
      malaria and reduce the risk associated with MiP. However, SP-resistance is increasing with&#xD;
      the emergence of Plasmodium falciparum dihydropteroate synthase (Pfdhps) and P. falciparum&#xD;
      dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) resistant genes challenging the benefits and effectiveness&#xD;
      of IPTp-SP. Still, evidence has become available supporting the emergence of a novel&#xD;
      Pfdhps-I431V mutation. The I431V mutation is found only in West and Central African&#xD;
      countries, however, its impact on SP resistance has not been evaluated. We are hypothesizing&#xD;
      that the new mutation may confound the existing SP-resistance resulting in an apparent&#xD;
      reduction in the protective effect of SP during pregnancy within the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit adult pregnant women and will assess the presence of malaria infection&#xD;
      at delivery. The study will seek new mutations in vivo using full sequencing. This molecular&#xD;
      tool will also be used to look at the prevalence of novel Pfdhps-431V mutation among pregnant&#xD;
      women undergoing monthly IPTp-SP. Attempts will be made to re-evaluate the prevalence of&#xD;
      other Pfdhps and Pfdhfr resistance alleles among the study population. The significance of&#xD;
      the resistance genes on the protective efficacy of SP will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is an observational study to be conducted among all booked pregnant women.&#xD;
      The pregnant women must have received at least three therapeutic doses of&#xD;
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine as part of routine antenatal care (ANC) before delivery. sion and&#xD;
      Pregnant women who consented to participate will be tested for the presence of malaria&#xD;
      parasite during the third trimester and at delivery. 80-100 µL blood samples will be saved as&#xD;
      dried blood spot on Whatman® filter paper from the individual with P. falciparum malaria&#xD;
      positivity Antenatal care (ANC) contact schedule with proposed timelines for implementation&#xD;
      of malaria in pregnancy interventions designed by WHO will be followed in enrolling subjects&#xD;
      from 26 weeks of pregnancy. The study will be conducted at the antenatal&#xD;
