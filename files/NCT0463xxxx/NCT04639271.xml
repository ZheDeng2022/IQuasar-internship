      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib combined with&#xD;
      trastuzumab and abraxane in HER2-positive MBC with brain metastasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overexpression of HER2 is associated with increased incidence of brain metastases in breast&#xD;
      cancer, accounting for about 20-50% of HER2 positive breast cancer. Treatment strategy ranged&#xD;
      from local therapies to systemic anti-HER2 therapies, prognosis of patients with brain&#xD;
      metastases remains poor. Previous clinical trials had demonstrated the efficacy of&#xD;
      trastuzumab and TKIs for brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors. We&#xD;
      designed the study to explore the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib combined with trastuzumab&#xD;
      and abraxane in HER2-positive MBC with brain metastasis.&#xD;
