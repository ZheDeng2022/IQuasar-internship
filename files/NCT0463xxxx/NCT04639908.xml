  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to prepare for the ageing population and its impact on the health care system, the&#xD;
      National Institute for Sickness and Disability Insurance in Belgium (RIZIV) launched in 2010&#xD;
      a subsidy programme (called Protocol 3) for innovative projects aimed at care and support for&#xD;
      vulnerable older people with complex care needs. The objective of these projects is to reduce&#xD;
      the risk and need for admission to a care institution/residential care centre. These are&#xD;
      alternative and supportive forms of care for the elderly for which there is currently no&#xD;
      allowance, which enable vulnerable older people to be cared for at home, which have a&#xD;
      positive influence on the evolution of the older person's state of health and which improve&#xD;
      the quality of life, which do not entail higher costs than those of a classic admission and&#xD;
      which are scientifically evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These Protocol 3 projects focus on vulnerable elderly people who are not admitted to a&#xD;
      residential care centre, but who are at risk of a complex and/or long-term care situation. As&#xD;
      a result of the complex care situation, there is also a great need for coordinated care&#xD;
      between different care providers and/or there will also be supportive forms of care that&#xD;
      ensure continuity of care. The expected added value of the care innovation projects should&#xD;
      focus on: the importance of consultation and cooperation between the various stakeholders,&#xD;
      the means to improve the competences of all relevant stakeholders, the means to organise&#xD;
      customised care and the means to achieve continuity of care for the patient. The objective of&#xD;
      the current study is to evaluate the phase 2 interventions, in particular: the adapted&#xD;
      interventions case management and occupational therapy; and the newly introduced&#xD;
      interventions in phase 3: health education, educational sessions for informal care providers&#xD;
      and control visits at night.&#xD;

&#xD;
      These Protocol 3 projects focus on vulnerable elderly people who are not admitted to a&#xD;

      interventions in phase 3: health education, educational sessions for informal care providers&#xD;
      and control visits at night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all, an evaluation at the end of these projects is important in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      added value of these care innovation projects and how they can possibly be structurally&#xD;
      anchored. The starting point of this study is to learn in a qualitative way about the&#xD;
      perceptions and experiences of patients and their informal carers about the benefits of the&#xD;
      interventions, the barriers and facilitating factors of their implementation and the&#xD;
      potential for improvement of these initiatives. The objective is to assess the extent to&#xD;
      which patient needs are met by the interventions and what can be improved to consolidate the&#xD;
      intervention or add more value to it.&#xD;
