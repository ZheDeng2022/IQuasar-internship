  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is multidisciplinary and&#xD;
      consists of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgical removal of the rectal&#xD;
      tumor and potentially tumor positive lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After surgery, in 15 to 27% of patients that received nCRT no tumor cells can be&#xD;
           detected during histopathological examination. In today's clinical practice, all of&#xD;
           these patients with a pathological complete response (pCR) are operated upon, with&#xD;
           substantial morbidity and mortality. The 5-year survival is 83.3% for patients with a&#xD;
           pCR, and 65.6% for those without pCR. Response after nCRT is currently evaluated using&#xD;
           magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, as MRI cannot differentiate between molecular&#xD;
           characteristics of tissue, prediction of treatment response can be inaccurate. In&#xD;
           patients with a potential cCR on MRI, additionally a high-definition white-light (HD-WL)&#xD;
           endoscopy is performed with biopsies of the previous tumor location. If both MRI and&#xD;
           HD-WL endoscopy confirm a potential cCR, patients can also be treated with a&#xD;
           watch-and-wait approach, including frequent follow-up with HD-WL endoscopy and MRI. This&#xD;
           potentially prevents extensive surgical procedures for patients in which this is not&#xD;
           required. However, MRI and HD-WL endoscopy often remain insufficient for identification&#xD;
           of cCR. Therefore, novel imaging methods are needed for accurate prediction of treatment&#xD;
           response in order to select patients. The investigators believe fluorescence molecular&#xD;
           endoscopy (FME) could be a promising technique for evaluation of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During surgery, tumor-negative resection margins are of great prognostic value.&#xD;
           Currently, surgeons rely on visual and tactile inspection for differentiation between&#xD;
           malignant and healthy tissue. When in doubt, a frozen section can be obtained, which is&#xD;
           time consuming and poses a high risk of sampling error. However, 14.7% of patients still&#xD;
           have tumor-positive resection margins, increasing the risk of local recurrence and&#xD;
           worsening outcome. Therefore, there is a need for novel imaging techniques that can be&#xD;
           used intraoperatively to improve margin assessment. The investigators believe molecular&#xD;
           fluorescence-guided surgery (MFGS) could be a promising technique for evaluation of&#xD;
           resection margins.&#xD;
