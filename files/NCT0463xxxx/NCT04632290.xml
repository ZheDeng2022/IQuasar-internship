  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a current first-in-human study, called Stimulation Movement Overground (STIMO,&#xD;
      NCT02936453), Epidural Electrical Stimulation (EES) of the spinal cord is applied to enable&#xD;
      individuals with chronic severe spinal cord injury (SCI) to complete intensive locomotor&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation training. In this clinical feasibility study, it was demonstrated that&#xD;
      EES results in an immediate enhancement of walking function, and that when applied repeatedly&#xD;
      as part of a neurorehabilitation program, EES can improve leg motor control and trigger&#xD;
      neurological recovery in individuals with severe SCI to a certain extent (Wagner et al.&#xD;
      2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies showed that linking brain activity to the onset and modulation of spinal&#xD;
      cord stimulation protocols not only improves the usability of the stimulation, but also&#xD;
      augments neurological recovery. Indeed, rats rapidly learned to modulate their cortical&#xD;
      activity in order to adjust the amplitude of spinal cord stimulation protocols. This&#xD;
      brain-spine interface allowed them to increase the amplitude of the movement of their&#xD;
      otherwise paralyzed legs to climb up a staircase (Bonizzato et al. 2018). Moreover, gait&#xD;
      rehabilitation enabled by this brain-spine interface (BSI) augmented plasticity and&#xD;
      neurological recovery. When EES was correlated with cortical neuron activity during training,&#xD;
      rats showed better recovery than when training was only supported by continuous stimulation&#xD;
      (Bonizzato et al. 2018). This concept of brain spine-interface was validated in non-human&#xD;
      primates (Capogrosso et al. 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinatec (Grenoble, France) has developed a fully implantable electrocorticogram (ECoG)&#xD;
      recording device with a 64-channel epidural electrode array capable of recording electrical&#xD;
      signals from the motor cortex for an extended period of time and with a high signal to noise&#xD;
      ratio the electrical signals from the motor cortex. This ECoG-based system allowed&#xD;
      tetraplegic patients to control an exoskeleton (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02550522) with up to 8&#xD;
      degrees of freedom for the upper limb control (Benabid et al. 2019). This device was&#xD;
      implanted in 2 individuals so far; one of them has been using this system both at the&#xD;
      hospital and at home for more than 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that ECoG-controlled EES in individuals with SCI will establish a direct&#xD;
      bridge between the patient's motor intention and the spinal cord below the lesion, which will&#xD;
      not only improve or restore voluntary control of leg movements, but will also boost&#xD;
      neuroplasticity and neurological recovery when combined with neurorehabilitation.&#xD;
