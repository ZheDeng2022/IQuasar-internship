  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reported social benefits of knitting combined with the urgent need for social and&#xD;
      activity-based programs in the disability community suggest that a knitting intervention may&#xD;
      fill a substantial gap in available programs. Knitting may also be well suited to autistic&#xD;
      strengths, combining sensory aspects (colourful sights, soft touch, rhythmic sounds), visual&#xD;
      patterning, and repetitive actions. Surprisingly, no knitting programs for ASD or other&#xD;
      conditions are reported in the literature. It is proposed that a knitting group can provide&#xD;
      social and skill-building opportunities, improving real-world social outcomes for youth with&#xD;
      ASD, and resulting in KneuroKnits, a program designed specifically to serve this need. The&#xD;
      program will be designed and run by a collaborative team of clinicians, researchers, knitting&#xD;
      experts, and a self-advocate with ASD. This program will enhance evidence supporting programs&#xD;
      providing contexts for the dual goals of meaningful social interaction for young people with&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders, physical disabilities, and acquired brain injuries and building&#xD;
      a real world creative skill that can facilitate social interaction within and beyond the&#xD;
      program. This study will evaluate participants' experiences of the program as well as their&#xD;
      levels of anxiety at various points during the program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has two sets of aims. The first are related to social and environmental&#xD;
      experiences, and the second are related to anxiety experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Social and environmental experiences&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To qualitatively observe and understand the social and skill-building experiences of a&#xD;
           knitting group for people with neurodevelopmental disorders, physical disabilities, and&#xD;
           acquired brain injuries from the perspectives of participants, their parents, and&#xD;
           program facilitators;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore whether a professionally facilitated knitting group is perceived to be a&#xD;
           beneficial and/or enjoyable environment for people with neurodevelopmental disorders,&#xD;
           physical disabilities, and acquired brain injuries to socialize with peers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore whether a professionally facilitated knitting group is perceived as an&#xD;
           appropriate and/or desired learning or skill building environment for people with&#xD;
           neurodevelopmental disorders, physical disabilities, and acquired brain injuries; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To collect data that will drive the creation of a manualized KneuroKnits program and&#xD;
           funding for future quantitative outcome measurements of program success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. To evaluate the impact of a knitting instructional program on self report of anxiety in&#xD;
      individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, physical disabilities, and/or acquired brain&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The KneuroKnits program will be based upon current knitting education practices and leading&#xD;
      practices in facilitation of social participation for youth with neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disorders, physical disabilities, and acquired brain injuries. The program will consist of 4&#xD;
      weekly sessions in which participants will learn knitting fundamentals and have opportunities&#xD;
      to socialize over a shared occupation. The 4 weekly sessions of the KneuroKnits curriculum&#xD;
      will include related knitting and social skills themes of the week. Each session will begin&#xD;
      with a structured lesson on the knitting topic of the day, and will then continue into&#xD;
      knitting practice and social interaction. Participants will be encouraged to practice their&#xD;
      new skills (knitting and social) between sessions, and will be allowed to keep all materials&#xD;
      that they use or create. The project involves two pilot runs of the program in a pre-post&#xD;
      study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research includes both qualitative and quantitative components, all of which align with&#xD;
      the structure of the KneuroKnits program described above. The project has two complementary&#xD;
      foci that will be evaluated separately: (1) social and skill based experiences of program&#xD;
      participation, and (2) the impact of program participation on anxiety related responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Social and skill based experiences of program participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primarily using qualitative design driven by an interpretive phenomenological&#xD;
           methodology, this study will explore program experiences using observation and&#xD;
           interviews with participants and stakeholders. The research team will also evaluate the&#xD;
           program environment (activity setting) using a validated measure (SEAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The impact of program participation on anxiety related responses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ a pre-post design. Anxiety will be measured at 2 time points for all&#xD;
      participants (baseline, week 4) using self report (the anxiety subscale of the Symptom&#xD;
      Checklist 90 [SCL-90] and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI] will be collected when the&#xD;
      participant attends the relevant KneuroKnits session. If the participant misses that&#xD;
      particular session, they will be asked to come in to Holland Bloorview at their earliest&#xD;
      convenient time to complete the measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program will be administered at two different sites to increase access to a broad&#xD;
      population. In October-November 2018, the 4-week program will be conducted at the Ontario&#xD;
      Science Centre site, and in November-December 2018, the program will be conducted at the&#xD;
      Holland Bloorview site.&#xD;
