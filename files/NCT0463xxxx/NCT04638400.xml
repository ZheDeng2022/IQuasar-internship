      The purpose of this research study is to determine which of the two ingredients of Vytorin&#xD;
      (Simvastatin or Ezetimibe) is responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of Vytorin&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is currently the leading cause of death in the developed countries.&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis is the most important cause of cardiovascular disease. Statins are known to&#xD;
      exert a powerful anti-atherogenic action which is reflected in a marked beneficial effect on&#xD;
      the prevention of cardiovascular effects and cardiovascular mortality. They induce a&#xD;
      reduction in the progression and an increase in the regression of atherosclerotic lesions.&#xD;
      Statins exert powerful effect on lowering LDLc and are also anti-inflammatory due to their&#xD;
      ability to lower CRP concentrations. But little is known about their anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects at a cellular and molecular levels in humans, in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vytorin, a preparation containing simvastatin and ezetimibe, has a powerful effect on&#xD;
      lowering LDLc concentration through a combination of effects on the absorption of cholesterol&#xD;
      from the gut and hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. In our previous study we have shown that&#xD;
      Vytorin exerts a potent anti-inflammatory effect in the obese in the fasting state and&#xD;
      following acute inflammatory changes induced by the intake of cream. The IMPROVE-IT trial,&#xD;
      which examined the benefits of adding ezetimibe to simvastatin, showed a small additional&#xD;
      benefit of ezetimibe (a 6% reduction in cardiovascular events) compared to simvastatin alone.&#xD;
      This is marginal when compared to the established cardiovascular benefits of statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We, therefore, explore further into the anti-inflammatory actions of the two components of&#xD;
      Vytorin by comparing the effects of simvastatin versus ezetimibe on intracellular lipid and&#xD;
      inflammation in obese patients to determine which of the two ingredients of Vytorin is&#xD;
      responsible for the specific combination of these effects.&#xD;
