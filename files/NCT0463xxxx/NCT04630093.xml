    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic clinical trial of 100 patients who self-identify as black or Latino.&#xD;
      Patients with active prescriptions for at least 3 medications and a medication change within&#xD;
      the past 6-months will be recruited from the University of Florida (UF) Health primary care&#xD;
      clinics for panel-based pharmacogenetic testing. Participants will be followed for 6 months&#xD;
      and will undergo assessments with the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication&#xD;
      (TSQM) three times (baseline visit, 3-month visit, and 6-month visit post pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      testing). In addition, data on effectiveness outcomes and socioeconomic measures will be&#xD;
      collected via the electronic health record (EHR) and patient report. Participation is&#xD;
      expected to last approximately 6 months and the study will be open for approximately 12-14&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little information exists regarding clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics in medically&#xD;
      underserved patient populations. Preliminary data indicate that underserved patients are&#xD;
      prescribed a higher rate of drugs associated with pharmacogenetic guidelines (pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      drugs). Thus, an important knowledge gap exists regarding the use of pharmacogenetic in a&#xD;
      patient population that may be the most likely to clinically benefit. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to develop key feasibility data to equitably advance preemptive pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      testing within UF Health, and to generate important preliminary data to support future larger&#xD;
      studies. This objective will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: (1) assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of preemptive pharmacogenetic clinical implementation in primary care clinics&#xD;
      predominantly serving medically underserved patients; (2) understand perspectives about&#xD;
      preemptive pharmacogenetic among key stakeholders in the primary care clinics predominantly&#xD;
      serving medically underserved patients; and (3) identify specific socioeconomic&#xD;
      characteristics most strongly associated pharmacogenetic drug prescription rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients who self-identify as black or Latino with active prescriptions for at&#xD;
      least 3 medications, one of which can be informed by panel-based pharmacogenetic testing, and&#xD;
      a medication change within the past 6-months will be recruited from UF Health primary care&#xD;
      clinics for panel-based pharmacogenetic testing. Participants will be followed for 6 months&#xD;
      and will undergo assessments with the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication&#xD;
      (TSQM) three times (at baseline and then again during the 3and 6-month follow-up post&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic testing). In addition, data on effectiveness outcomes and socioeconomic&#xD;
      measures will be collected via the EHR and patient report. Records for patients receiving&#xD;
      care at UF Health primary care clinics will be screened based on inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      for participation in the study. Those that meet criteria will be offered participation.&#xD;
      Participation is expected to last approximately 6 months and the study will be open for&#xD;
      approximately 12-14 months.&#xD;

    <description>The primary feasibility outcome will be change in patient treatment satisfaction between baseline and 6 months after pharmacogenetic testing. This patient reported outcome will be measured via the TSQM. The TSQM is a validated tool that assesses three medication-related domains (effectiveness, side effects, and convenience) to synthesize a global satisfaction score. Both global satisfaction and scores from individual domains will be analyzed.</description>
