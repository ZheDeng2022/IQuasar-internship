    <textblock>
      Current treatment of localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer is still associated with high&#xD;
      relapse and death rate as well as the need for complete bladder resection or irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to increase the rate of pathologic complete remission&#xD;
      (pCR) at the time of radical cystectomy by the combination of local bladder instillation with&#xD;
      Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) in combination with systemic immunotherapy with atezolizumab&#xD;
      and standard chemotherapy with cisplatin/gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial tests the hypothesis whether BCG can enhance systemic and local immune response and&#xD;
      thereby increase pCR rate and consequently also event-free survival. Improving pCR rate would&#xD;
      be a next step to the ultimate goal of omitting radical surgery or extensive local&#xD;
      radiotherapy to the bladder for these patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current treatment of localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer is still associated with high&#xD;
      relapse and death rate as well as the need for complete bladder resection or irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, immunotherapy using PD-1 or PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) proved&#xD;
      successful for patients with metastatic bladder cancer. The checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
      atezolizumab (anti PD-L1), pembrolizumab (anti PD-1) and nivolumab (anti PD-1) now represent&#xD;
      the standard of care in the second line setting of metastatic bladder cancer and are all&#xD;
      approved by Swissmedic for this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First results, in 2018, have been presented and published using immune checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
      as neoadjuvant treatment for localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer. SAKK has also&#xD;
      performed a single arm phase II trial using neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy with&#xD;
      cisplatin/gemcitabine in combination with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab (SAKK 06/17). A&#xD;
      preplanned interim analysis of the first 30 operated patients revealed a pCR rate of 30%. In&#xD;
      this study, residual non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) was found in approximately&#xD;
      15% of cases. While these results are encouraging, the improvement of pCR rate compared to&#xD;
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy alone is small and further improvement is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCG induces an intense local inflammatory response that mediates tumor immunity. Several&#xD;
      steps are involved in mounting the inflammatory response including attachment to the&#xD;
      urothelium with uptake by antigen presenting cells (APC) and putative internalization into&#xD;
      urothelial cells followed by a boost of the innate immune response and induction of adaptive&#xD;
      responses. Based on these findings, intravesical BCG appears to be a very interesting agent&#xD;
      to enhance the immune response and act as an adjuvant agent to increase anti-tumor response&#xD;
      with immune checkpoint inhibition using monoclonal antibodies such as atezolizumab. The&#xD;
      combination of intravesical BCG and systemic immune checkpoint inhibition is being studied&#xD;
      for patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in several ongoing phase III trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators therefore propose to add an induction cycle of intravesical recombinant BCG&#xD;
      (VPM1002BC) (total of 3 weeks) to the backbone of neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy with&#xD;
      cisplatin/gemcitabine and atezolizumab. The trial tests the hypothesis if recombinant BCG can&#xD;
      enhance systemic and local immune response and thereby increase pCR rate and consequently&#xD;
      also event-free survival. Improving pCR rate would be a next step to the ultimate goal of&#xD;
      omitting radical surgery or extensive local radiotherapy to the bladder for these patients.&#xD;
