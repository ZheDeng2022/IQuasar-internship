      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-cell lymphomas (TCLs) are rare cancers. Many types of TCLs do not develop in the lymph&#xD;
      nodes but in places like the skin, spleen, and bone marrow. Researchers want to see if a mix&#xD;
      of 4 drugs can help people with TCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if the combination of romidepsin, CC-486 (5-azacitidine), duvelisib, and doxorubicin&#xD;
      can be used safely in people with TCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older with TCL that is newly diagnosed or that returned after or did not&#xD;
      respond to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened on a separate protocol. They may have a tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have medical histories, medicine reviews, and physical exams. Their ability&#xD;
      to do daily activities will be assessed. They will have blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take duvelisib and CC-486 (5-azacitidine) by mouth. They will get&#xD;
      romidepsin and doxorubicin by intravenous infusion. They will take the drugs for up to eight&#xD;
      21-day cycles. They will keep a medicine diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy. Bone marrow will be taken&#xD;
      through a needle inserted in the hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have tumor imaging scans. Some may have a brain MRI and lumbar puncture.&#xD;
      Some may have skin assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood, saliva, and tumor samples for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a safety visit 30 days after treatment ends. Then they will have&#xD;
      follow-up visits every 60 days for 6 months, then every 90 days for 2 years, and then every 6&#xD;
      months for 2 years. Then they will have yearly visits until their disease gets worse or they&#xD;
      start a new treatment....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-cell lymphomas (TCLs) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoid malignancies defined by clonal&#xD;
      proliferation of post-thymic T lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with newly diagnosed TCLs are most commonly treated with a CHOP (cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone)-like regimen, with less than 30% having durable&#xD;
      complete responses (CRs). Of the chemotherapy agents used, doxorubicin is the one which was&#xD;
      consistently associated with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) in retrospective studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options for the 70% of patients with TCL who relapse are limited and of minimal&#xD;
      efficacy; novel treatment strategies are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many TCL have mutations in epigenetic modifier genes, and histone deacetylase inhibitors such&#xD;
      as romidepsin are approved for treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL); however, the&#xD;
      overall response rate (ORR) with single-agent treatment is only 20-30%, and improvement in OS&#xD;
      was not shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Romidepsin and the hypomethylating agent CC-486 (5-azacitidine) acted synergistically in&#xD;
      vitro, and showed high clinical activity, with an ORR of up to 79% in some types of TCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many TCLs rely on the PI3K pathway, whether through activation of CD28 through fusions or&#xD;
      gain-of-function mutations or by interruptions of the CD28-inhibiting PD-1/PD-L1 immune&#xD;
      checkpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duvelisib is an inhibitor of the PI3K gamma and delta isoforms; in phase I trials it has&#xD;
      shown both single-agent activity and synergy with romidepsin for patients with TCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As combinations of both CC-486 (5-azacitidine)/romidepsin and duvelisib/romidepsin have&#xD;
      demonstrated both adequate safety and clinical efficacy, safety and efficacy of the triplet&#xD;
      combination should be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and toxicity profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the four-drug combination of CC-486 (5-azacitidine),&#xD;
      romidepsin and duvelisib, and doxorubicin, in patients with TCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed newly diagnosed or&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory T-cell lymphoma (TCL) defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Untreated patients with any peripheral TCL, not including anaplastic large cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (ALCL), but including acute and lymphoma subtypes of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma&#xD;
      (ATLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts 1 and 3: Any relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma including ATLL and ALCL&#xD;
      who have disease after receiving at least one line of systemic therapy, which must include&#xD;
      brentuximab vedotin if the disease is ALCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status of &lt;= 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, single-center, non-randomized Phase 1 study&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;3 + 3&quot; design will be used to determine the RP2D of dose-escalated duvelisib with fixed dose&#xD;
      romidepsin CC-486 (5-azacitidine) and doxorubicin with two expansion cohorts at the RP2D&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum 8 cycles (21-day cycles) of combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore all dose levels, including further evaluation in two dose expansion cohorts, the&#xD;
      accrual ceiling will be set at 60 patients&#xD;

                  treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on&#xD;
                  treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects on antimicrobial, antifungal, or antiviral prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. History of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis),&#xD;
             celiac disease (i.e., sprue), prior gastrectomy or upper bowel removal, or any other&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would interfere with the absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drugs and/or predispose the subject&#xD;
             to an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular&#xD;
             accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (&gt;= New York Heart&#xD;
             Association Classification Class II), congenital long QT syndrome, or other serious&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia including 2nd degree atrio-ventricular (AV) block type II, 3rd&#xD;
             degree AV block, or bradycardia (ventricular rate less than 50 beats/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Hypertrophic cardiomegaly or restrictive cardiomyopathy from prior treatment or other&#xD;
             causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Uncontrolled hypertension, i.e., blood pressure (BP) of &gt;=160/95 at screening;&#xD;
             patients who have a history of hypertension controlled by medication must be on a&#xD;
             stable dose (for at least one month) and meet all other inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Triplicate average baseline QTcF interval &gt;= 480 ms during screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Patients taking drugs leading to significant QT prolongation Note: A 5 half-life&#xD;
             washout period must have elapsed following the use of these drugs prior to&#xD;
             administration of romidepsin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Concomitant use of rifampin and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers within 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Inability to receive prophylactic treatment for pneumocystis, herpes simplex virus&#xD;
             (HSV), or herpes zoster (VZV).&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including psychiatric conditions such&#xD;
             as recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Pregnant or lactating women. NOTE: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because&#xD;
             based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, duvelisib can cause fetal&#xD;
             harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies,&#xD;
             administration of duvelisib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused&#xD;
             adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal mortality. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with duvelisib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with duvelisib. These potential risks may also apply to other agents&#xD;
             used in this study.&#xD;
