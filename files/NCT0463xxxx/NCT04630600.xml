    <textblock>
      The participants in this study will be subjected to a specific clinic waiting area ambience&#xD;
      (1- no aquarium, 2- presence of aquarium with no fish, and 3- aquarium with fish) for their&#xD;
      period of waiting before their intended dental visit and their stress and anxiety levels will&#xD;
      be measured. Heart rate, blood pressure will be measured and other upon their arrival into&#xD;
      the dental clinic waiting area and then again after 20 minutes of waiting in the waiting&#xD;
      area. Anxiety will be measured using a six-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6)&#xD;
      questionnaire and the mood of the participants were assessed for valence and arousal, using&#xD;
      the feeling scale, and the felt arousal scale. The data from the three different waiting room&#xD;
      settings will be compared and statistically analysed to investigate if an aquarium has an&#xD;
      impact, and in that case how.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental anxiety is a well-known, common dilemma affecting many adults, observed more&#xD;
      frequently in children and women. It is an emotional apprehensive state which is&#xD;
      multifactorial and the origin is most commonly attributed to the anticipation of the painful&#xD;
      stimulus that may arise during treatment. It has been suggested that environmental factors&#xD;
      contribute to dental stress. Although quite trivial, the environment of a waiting room as&#xD;
      well as the time spent waiting are parameters that can cause pre- treatment stress.&#xD;
      Therefore, the waiting room must be considered an important first port for dealing with the&#xD;
      individual's pre-treatment dental anxiety. Evidence in literature suggest that waiting room&#xD;
      ambience plays a significant role in reducing the patient anxiety, for example images,&#xD;
      audio-visual effects like the lighting, music and/or videos, presence of natural light,&#xD;
      suitable reading material, aquariums have shown positive results. Beneficial effects of the&#xD;
      presence of animals on the reduction of stress have also been reported in literature, and&#xD;
      especially fish have shown a positive effect on the psychological well-being and stress&#xD;
      levels; higher relaxation, less anxiety and better mood was reported by participants after a&#xD;
      period of observing live fish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary null hypothesis is that there will be no effect of an aquarium present in&#xD;
           the waiting area on the pre-treatment anxiety and stress levels of participants&#xD;
           receiving dental care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary hypothesis is that there will be no effect of an aquarium present in the&#xD;
           waiting area on the stress and anxiety levels of the reception staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tertiary hypothesis for this study is that the treating dentist will not perceive&#xD;
           any difference in the stress and anxiety levels of the participants after observing the&#xD;
           aquarium in the waiting area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients ≥18 years, who are able to sign a consent form are included. The participants&#xD;
           are subjected to a specific clinic waiting area ambience (1- no aquarium, 2- presence of&#xD;
           aquarium with no fish, and 3- aquarium with fish) for their period of waiting before&#xD;
           their intended dental visit and their stress and anxiety levels are measured. Heart&#xD;
           rate, blood pressure will be measured and other upon their arrival into the dental&#xD;
           clinic waiting area. Three measurements will be taken and then after 20 minutes of&#xD;
           waiting another three measurements of the same will be made in order to see if the&#xD;
           presence of an aquarium gave a decrease. Anxiety will be measured using a six-item&#xD;
           State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) questionnaire and the mood of the participants&#xD;
           were assessed for valence and arousal, using the feeling scale, and the felt arousal&#xD;
           scale. The data from the three different settings will be compared and statistically&#xD;
           analysed to investigate if an aquarium has an impact, and in that case how.&#xD;
