  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel-group study in&#xD;
      participants with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, and in participants with normal&#xD;
      hepatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degrees of hepatic impairment will be determined during screening by the participant's score&#xD;
      according to Pugh's Modification of Child's Classification of Severity of Liver Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in Groups 1 through 3 as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (mild hepatic impairment): A total of approximately 8 participants with a&#xD;
           Child-Pugh score of 5 to 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (moderate hepatic impairment): A total of approximately 8 participants with a&#xD;
           Child-Pugh score of 7 to 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 (normal hepatic function): Approximately 8 to 16 participants will be matched to&#xD;
           Participants in Groups 1 and 2. Normal hepatic function participants are allowed to&#xD;
           match multiple hepatic impairment participants. Participants will be matched by sex, age&#xD;
           (± 10 years), weight (± 20%), and smoking status.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Acceptable methods of birth control in this study are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Combined hormonal (oestrogen and progestogen containing) contraception, which may be&#xD;
             oral, intravaginal, or transdermal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, which&#xD;
             may be oral, injectable, or implantable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral tubal occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vasectomized partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete sexual abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus&#xD;
        interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable&#xD;
        methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Participants with Mild or Moderate Hepatic Impairment (Groups 1 and&#xD;
        2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each participant with mild or moderate hepatic impairment must satisfy the following&#xD;
        criteria to be enrolled in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has mild (5 to 6 points) or moderate (7 to 9 points) hepatic impairment&#xD;
             per the Child-Pugh system (Appendix B).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant should be enrolled into the group corresponding to the Child-Pugh&#xD;
             classification score that most accurately reflects the most severe hepatic disease&#xD;
             classification within the past 6 months of signing the ICF (based on past medical&#xD;
             history or PE observation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a Child-Pugh score was previously calculated and documented in the last 6 months,&#xD;
             and it is more severe than the one calculated at Screening, then that previous value&#xD;
             will be used for study entry purposes. If the Screening Child-Pugh score is more&#xD;
             severe, then it will be used. If no score was calculated in the 6 months prior to&#xD;
             Screening, then the score obtained at Screening will be used. Adequate documentation&#xD;
             should be provided to substantiate the Child-Pugh score assigned to each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be medically stable for at least 4 weeks before Screening with&#xD;
             clinically acceptable medical history (eg, no worsening of clinical signs of hepatic&#xD;
             impairment, or no worsening of total bilirubin or prothrombin time by more than 50%),&#xD;
             PE, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and 12-lead ECGs consistent with the&#xD;
             underlying stable hepatic impairment condition, as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant with laboratory parameters that are considered clinically significant&#xD;
             beyond those consistent with their degree of hepatic impairment may be included if, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator and Medical Monitor, these findings will not interfere&#xD;
             with the study or introduce additional safety risk to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be stable on a concomitant medication and/or treatment regimen&#xD;
             (defined as not starting a new treatment/medication[s] or a change in the dosage or&#xD;
             frequency of the concomitant medication[s] within 2 weeks before dosing with&#xD;
             ozanimod).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min at Screening as&#xD;
             calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Matched Normal Hepatic Function Participants (Group 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each matched participant must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is in good health as determined by past medical history, PE, vital signs,&#xD;
             ECG, and clinical laboratory safety tests. Clinical laboratory safety tests (ie,&#xD;
             hematology, coagulation, chemistry, and urinalysis) must be within normal limits or&#xD;
             clinically acceptable as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must match a participant in Groups 1 and/or 2, with respect to sex, age (±&#xD;
             10 years), weight (± 20%) and smoking status. One normal hepatic function participant&#xD;
             can be matched to 2 hepatic impairment participants (one in Group 1 and one in Group&#xD;
             2), but no more than one hepatic impairment participant in the same group.&#xD;
&#xD;
