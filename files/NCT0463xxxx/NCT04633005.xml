  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) represents a significant public health&#xD;
      burden in the United States, with a growing prevalence particularly among African Americans&#xD;
      and Hispanic Americans and individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES). Although effective&#xD;
      therapies exist, gaps in their uptake contribute substantially to the excess burden of heart&#xD;
      failure. The &quot;polypill&quot; is an inexpensive once daily pill containing three agents proven to&#xD;
      improve morbidity and mortality in heart failure and represents potential strategy for&#xD;
      increasing the utilization of proven HF therapies. The proposed study is a pragmatic,&#xD;
      single-center, randomized trial to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a polypill-based&#xD;
      strategy for the treatment of HFrEF in a low-income, racially diverse population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure poses a major public health challenge in the United States. It affects more&#xD;
      than 6.2 million people and is the leading cause of hospitalization among older adults, with&#xD;
      a growing prevalence among Black, Hispanic, and low-income populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advances in the treatment of heart failure, the associated morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      remain high. From the time of heart failure diagnosis, survival is approximately 50% at&#xD;
      5-years and 10% at 10-years.8 Improved mortality and hospitalization rates have been observed&#xD;
      due to the advent of mortality-reducing HFrEF therapies and earlier diagnosis. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      substantial gaps in the uptake of guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) exist. GDMT,&#xD;
      which include beta-blockers (BB), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI),&#xD;
      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), have&#xD;
      been demonstrated to reduce all-cause mortality by &gt; 50% when used in combination.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, fewer than 25% of eligible patients currently receive these medications at any&#xD;
      dose, with socially disadvantaged groups having the lowest rates of utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polypill is an alternative management strategy. The polypill combines multiple&#xD;
      evidence-based medications in a single pill, which reduces pill burden and improves&#xD;
      adherence. Therapy with multiple medications can be conveniently initiated at an early stage&#xD;
      of disease, increasing the overall therapeutic benefit accrued over time. This is&#xD;
      particularly relevant in settings where patients experience barriers to care due to high cost&#xD;
      burden with copays associated with medication initiation, frequent lab tests, and need for&#xD;
      multiple follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polypills have been shown to be feasible and effective in multiple settings, including in the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD). They have been well tolerated and&#xD;
      additionally demonstrate significant improvements in adherence when compared to usual&#xD;
      therapies in randomized control trials. However, no randomized trial to date has evaluated a&#xD;
      polypill strategy for the treatment of heart failure, a condition in which pill burden and&#xD;
      adherence pose substantial challenges to management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a single-center, randomized trial to test the feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of a polypill-based strategy for the treatment of HFrEF (EF ≤40%) in a&#xD;
      low-income population. The setting for our proposed study is Parkland Hospital in Dallas,&#xD;
      Texas, a large county hospital that serves a racially diverse, uninsured population. We will&#xD;
      utilize 4 distinct polypill formulations to allow for up-titration of the beta-blocker&#xD;
      component of the polypill. The pill will contain spironolactone 12.5 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg,&#xD;
      and 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg of metoprolol succinate. The once-daily polypill will be&#xD;
      added to baseline therapy with a renin-angiotensin system antagonist (ACEI, ARB, or ARNI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that use of a polypill-based strategy in HFrEF will be feasible and lead to&#xD;
      improved left ventricular systolic function and lower circulating NT-pro BNP levels compared&#xD;
      with usual care. These hypotheses will be tested in the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To determine whether the use of a polypill for HFrEF leads to higher left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) compared with usual care in a low-income population. We&#xD;
      will randomize 175 HFrEF patients who are not on optimal guideline-directed medical therapy&#xD;
      to a polypill-based strategy versus usual care for 12 months. The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      the change in LVEF, obtained by cardiac MRI (CMR). CMR provides the greatest accuracy and&#xD;
      reproducibility of the non-invasive cardiac imaging modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To determine whether the use of a polypill for HFrEF leads to lower&#xD;
      circulating NT-proBNP levels compared with usual care in a low-income population. Changes in&#xD;
      circulating NT-proBNP concentrations from baseline to 12-months will be compared in&#xD;
      participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the change in LVEF over 12 months, based on prior studies&#xD;
      demonstrating measurable changes in systolic function and cardiac biomarkers within 6 to 12&#xD;
      months of treatment with GDMT. LVEF will be assessed using cardiac MRI at baseline and the&#xD;
      end of the study period. We hypothesize that polypill use will be associated with greater&#xD;
      improvement in LVEF compared with usual care.Key secondary endpoints will include NT-proBNP,&#xD;
      a serum marker of neurohormonal stress, and a well-validated surrogate endpoint for HF&#xD;
      trials. NT-proBNP levels have been associated with short- and long-term clinical outcomes for&#xD;
      all stages of HFrEF and receive a class I, Level of Evidence A recommendation for diagnosis&#xD;
      and assessment of prognosis in clinical HF guidelines.Prior trials have demonstrated more&#xD;
      than a 2-fold increased risk of in-hospital mortality associated with NT-proBNP levels in the&#xD;
      highest vs. lowest quartile, and associations of NT-proBNP levels with 1-year mortality and&#xD;
      illness course when measured serially. NT-proBNP levels respond to GDMT, with significant&#xD;
      reductions in levels accompanying the use of beta-blockers, ACEI/ARB, MRA, and SGLT2i in 6 to&#xD;
      12 months post-initiation of therapy. Other secondary endpoints of interest include adherence&#xD;
      to GDMT, as assessed by MMAS-8 score and pill count, quality of life assessed using the&#xD;
      Kansas City Cardiomyopathy (KCCQ) Questionnaire, and 6-minute walk distance (6-MWD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be led by study investigators from the University of Texas Southwestern with&#xD;
      joint appointments within the Parkland Health and Hospital System. The proposal builds on the&#xD;
      team's prior experience conducting clinical trials of cardiovascular therapies in low-income,&#xD;
      diverse populations. The trial can be performed efficiently and cost-effectively within the&#xD;
      Parkland Health and Hospital System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After securing permission from the clinical director and providers within the Parkland Health&#xD;
      and Hospital System and Parkland Cardiology Clinic, the study team will begin active&#xD;
      screening for patients with new diagnosis of heart failure within the Parkland Cardiology&#xD;
      Clinic and inpatient Parkland Cardiology service. We will enroll adults age ≥18 years with de&#xD;
      novo or chronic HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%) with recent hospitalization or outpatient visit at&#xD;
      Parkland who are not on optimal GDMT. De novo HFrEF will be defined as new-onset HFrEF with&#xD;
      hospitalization for HF or outpatient diagnosis with 90 days of screening. Chronic HFrEF will&#xD;
      include patients with a known diagnosis of HFrEF for more than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the target enrollment, the study team will enroll participants during inpatient&#xD;
      hospitalization and from outpatient clinics. Patients will be started on the polypill prior&#xD;
      to discharge or at the first outpatient visit after heart failure hospitalization. In both&#xD;
      settings, the polypill will be substituted for the individual component medications, with&#xD;
      other medications continued as prescribed. The team will include a study coordinator with&#xD;
      extensive experience performing clinical trials at Parkland Health &amp; Hospital Systems. The&#xD;
      team will perform pre-screening using EHR data after obtaining permission from the Parkland&#xD;
      inpatient and clinic heart failure attendings. Patients deemed eligible for participation&#xD;
      will be contacted prior to discharge from their HF hospitalization or at the time of their&#xD;
      initial visit to cardiology clinic following discharge. Patients will be informed about the&#xD;
      study, its goals, and the risks and benefits of participating, and will be invited to&#xD;
      participate. Potential participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire seeking&#xD;
      information on medication use, health status, and on the characteristics to assess potential&#xD;
      eligibility. Eligible participants may also be identified based on review of the EHR&#xD;
      post-discharge and will be contacted through an introductory letter and pre-screening&#xD;
      questionnaire. . Based on our initial experience, we estimate that we will need to contact&#xD;
      700 patients over the 4-year enrollment period to enroll 175 patients in the study. In our&#xD;
      prior polypill trial, conducted in an outpatient setting, we observed a 45% response rate to&#xD;
      the initial invitation, of which ~50% met eligibility criteria and consented to&#xD;
      randomization. We will record all contact attempts and responses to determine recruitment&#xD;
      rates and reasons for entry or non-entry into the trial. The study team has substantial&#xD;
      experience with recruitment of participants for clinical trials and observational studies at&#xD;
      Parkland Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet eligibility criteria will be invited to enroll in the trial.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio using a computerized algorithm. Block&#xD;
      randomization will be performed according to baseline use of a polypill component and&#xD;
      race/ethnicity group. The randomization key will be maintained by a faculty member with no&#xD;
      involvement in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators will prescribe the polypill to those in the active arm. In response&#xD;
      to the initial polypill prescription, participants will receive an initial pill vial&#xD;
      containing a 30-day supply of medication via overnight shipping. Subsequent refills of 30-day&#xD;
      supply will be made available by overnight shipping. Patients will be contacted by the study&#xD;
      team every month, 1 week before the end of their 30-day supply, to follow up on their&#xD;
      clinical status and adherence to the therapy. Participants will be instructed to take one&#xD;
      pill per day for the duration of the study. All polypill medication, including unopened or&#xD;
      partially used containers, will be maintained at the study site for eventual return to the&#xD;
      vendor. As this is an open-label trial, there will be no placebo provided in the usual care&#xD;
      arm. Participants in the usual care arm will also receive their medications free of cost in&#xD;
      30-day supplies with overnight shipping and receive monthly follow up calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with local regulatory requirements, the investigator or designated research&#xD;
      staff will document the quantity of polypill dispensed and/or administered to study&#xD;
      participants, the amount returned by study participants, and the amount received from and&#xD;
      returned to the vendor when applicable. Product accountability records will be maintained&#xD;
      throughout the course of the study. Concomitant medications and non-drug therapies not&#xD;
      specifically prohibited by the study are allowed. All concomitant medications taken during&#xD;
      the study will be recorded by study staff. Prohibited medications include all medications&#xD;
      that interact with the components of the polypill or are contraindicated in patients with&#xD;
      HFrEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit informed consent will be obtained. Responses to the baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire will be reviewed by a study coordinator as a final check on inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria and current medication use. A medical and social history will be obtained.&#xD;
      Vital signs will be measured in seated participants, according to standardized protocols. A&#xD;
      15 mL blood sample will be obtained for eligibility laboratories. Pre-menopausal women will&#xD;
      undergo a rapid urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-randomization, participants will be sent follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires and scheduled for a follow-up visit at the outpatient clinic. At these&#xD;
      follow-up visits, the study coordinators will review questionnaires for completeness, assess&#xD;
      vital signs, collect a blood sample, assess medication adherence by pill count and the MMAS-8&#xD;
      questionnaire, assess for medication safety, tolerance, and side effects. The up-titration in&#xD;
      GDMT or polypill beta-blocker dose will be performed, as tolerated on each visit. A 6-minute&#xD;
      walk test and quality of life assessment using the KCCQ will be performed at baseline, 6&#xD;
      months, and 12 months as detailed below using protocols identical to those of the baseline&#xD;
      visit. A metabolic panel test will be performed at each follow-up to assess for hyperkalemia&#xD;
      or kidney dysfunction. Additional clinic visits will be allowed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      patients' physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive $25 per study visit. In addition, subjects will also receive $25 for&#xD;
      their CMR visits at baseline and follow up. Participants will also receive travel vouchers&#xD;
      and/or transportation reimbursements for their follow-up visits.&#xD;
