      For the present study, Investigators will examine the efficacy of active prefrontal anodal&#xD;
      tDCS versus placebo (sham) interventions to treat WM dysfunction in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators selected the prefrontal stimulation modality that proved most effective in&#xD;
      enhancing high-load WM performance in single dose stimulation in healthy participants . The&#xD;
      study employs a multi-stimulation approach, with 2 sessions per day for 5 consecutive days in&#xD;
      the active treatment group (n=15) compared to a group that receives only sham stimulation&#xD;
      (n=15). This preliminary approach is based upon findings of a recent study applying cathodal&#xD;
      tDCS stimulation over left temporoparietal cortex (with left prefrontal anodal stimulation)&#xD;
      for the treatment of persistent auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. In a a recent study&#xD;
      clinical benefits were maintained for at least 3 months following stimulation. In the present&#xD;
      study, in addition to clinical outcome, researchers will evaluate whether similar improvement&#xD;
      can be obtained with WM, EEG activity, and functional outcome (e.g., discharged from&#xD;
      hospitalization following significant improvement or remission).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a recent tDCS study investigators conducted with 41 healthy participants, researchers&#xD;
      administered a single blind tDCS protocol that included an active unilateral DLPFC condition&#xD;
      (2 mA for 15 minutes, anode over the left DLPFC (midpoint between F3-AF3) and cathode over&#xD;
      the dorsal area of the superior parietal cortex (at Cz) versus a sham condition to&#xD;
      investigate changes in online working memory function. Our preliminary tDCS results indicated&#xD;
      gender-dependent (left enhancement in males versus females) high-load WM enhancement during&#xD;
      active prefrontal stimulation versus sham stimulation. The observed prefrontal tDCS enhancing&#xD;
      effect on high-load WM function indicated that left DLPFC tDCS could be implemented with SZP&#xD;
      who suffer from inefficient left DLPFC engagement during medium to high-load WM maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the lack of effective treatments for attenuating WM impairments and the importance of&#xD;
      these impairments to functional outcome in schizophrenia, tDCS based cognitive-enhancing&#xD;
      approaches may become an important new treatment method, which will consequently improve&#xD;
      treatment and functional outcome in schizophrenia patients.The innovative nature of the&#xD;
      study's proposed research project is that it promotes non-invasive focal (left prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex) neuromodulation to improve cognitive functioning as well as illness severity in SZP.&#xD;
      Most importantly, unlike antipsychotic medication that affects the entire brain circuitry and&#xD;
      produces undesired side effects (e.g., extrapyramidal effects, weight gain, hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
      and sexual dysfunction), the current non-invasive focal intervention is aimed at reducing&#xD;
      specific prefrontal dysfunctions in schizophrenia by specific targeting of prefrontal&#xD;
      electrophysiological disturbances (e.g., frontal theta synchrony) within regions known to&#xD;
      regulate behavior and the consolidation of goal-directed information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Essentially, currently proposed tDCS treatment is hypothesized to improve working&#xD;
      memory functioning and reduce symptom severity in people diagnosed with schizophrenia versus&#xD;
      sham prefrontal tDCS (placebo).The theoretical premise for our prediction implies that&#xD;
      effective inhibition of excessive dopaminergic mesolimbic activity (impaired in&#xD;
      schizophrenia), could result from excitatory left-prefrontal tDCS, which has been shown to&#xD;
      increase executive regulation of behavior in healthy individuals and people diagnosed with&#xD;
      schizophrenia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan outline For the present study, investigators will examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      active prefrontal anodal tDCS versus placebo (sham) interventions to treat WM dysfunction in&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Investigatros selected the prefrontal stimulation modality that proved most&#xD;
      effective in enhancing high-load WM performance in single dose stimulation in healthy&#xD;
      participants. A multi-stimulation approach is implemnted, with 2 sessions per day for 5&#xD;
      consecutive days in the active treatment group (n=15) compared to a group that receives only&#xD;
      sham stimulation (n=15). This preliminary approach is based upon findings of a recent study&#xD;
      applying cathodal tDCS stimulation over left temporoparietal cortex (with left prefrontal&#xD;
      anodal stimulation) for the treatment of persistent auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia&#xD;
      . In a recent study clinical benefits were maintained for at least 3 months following&#xD;
      stimulation. In the present study, in addition to clinical outcome, we will evaluate whether&#xD;
      similar improvement can be obtained with WM, EEG activity, and functional outcome (e.g.,&#xD;
      discharged from hospitalization following significant improvement or remission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In regards to efficacy, since WM is considered a core cognitive deficit in schizophrenia,&#xD;
      investigators will monitor working memory, psychosis severity and global outcome, at&#xD;
      baseline, immediately following tDCS intervention, and at 1, 4, and 8, 12, and 16 week&#xD;
      intervals, following the termination the five-day treatment. Importantly, in order to show&#xD;
      external validity of our efficacy analysis we will examine functional outcome (level of&#xD;
      independence), six months after the termination of the tDCS intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, since DLPFC stimulation may contribute to long-term electroencephalography (EEG)&#xD;
      theta- rhythm functional connectivity, associated with increased large-scale theta&#xD;
      synchronization, WM function, and episodic memory formation, investigatros will examine&#xD;
      effects of tDCS on prefrontal versus whole-brain EEG theta activity obtained during a WM task&#xD;
      (see verbal n-Back task), using event-related potential (ERP) and event-related spectral&#xD;
      power (ERSP) techniques similar to those in used in recent EEG studies in schizphrenia&#xD;
      patients. Demonstrating significant functional-connectivity EEG differences in responders&#xD;
      versus non-responders from baseline to post-intervention measurements will significantly&#xD;
      increase the validity of our proposed prefrontal pathophysiological mechanism as&#xD;
      significantly impacting psychosis severity and clinical outcome in schizophrenia.&#xD;
